# TMU May Be Expanded
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
To alleviate Tresidcier Union's dual
problems of overcrowding of facili
ties and impersonality Union Director-
Chester A. Berry has proposed a 50
per cent expansion of the Union.
Receiving highest priorities, in a
report released last week were addi
tional food service and meeting room
space, witli a 200-seat Rathskeller and
an accompanying restaurant ranked
first.
Expansion of the travel service.
ASSU and Union offices, conference
rooms, browsing and music rooms,
and the installation of an arts and
crafts center were also recommended.
Impetus for the report was the gen
eral success of Union facilities and
programs, "far exceeding our expec
tations." Dr. Berry reported.
The report was originally drafted
last February and circulated to the
Union Committee, the Union Board
and divisions, the staff of the Union,
and the offices of the Provost, Vice
President of Finance, the Conference
and Planning Offices.
Reactions from those receiving lite
report and surveys by the Union di
visions were used to determine the
priorities listed in the current report.
The report now goes to Vice Presi
dents Kenneth Cuthbertson and Alf
Brandin and to the Committee on Uni
versity Policy.
Rathskeller
The main addition recommended
would be "a single, free-standing
structure between Bowman Alumni
House and Tresidder" which would
house a Rathskeller, a 100-seat res
taurant, and conference and meeting
rooms.
The Rathskeller would help "release
some of the short-order load and do
a .job socially for the campus not now
being done, by providing a rendezvous
for dates," he reported.
Projected plans for its use include
catering to "the coffee break press",
providing a limited luncheon and sup
per menu, and meeting "the evening
demands of pizza, short order and
soda fountain items, dancing, and per
haps, expresso coffee and beer."
Beer and Coke
Dr. Berry views beer as "a social
vehicle, like Coke." Experience at
other colleges, according to Dr. Berry,
show that few discipline problems re
sult from the introduction of beer.
"At Michigan, beer ranks fifth among
the beverages sold at their union."
The closing of the old Union dining
room has nearly eliminated private
dining rooms available to non-facutly
members of the community. This fac
tor, combined with the desire to ex
pand the Tresidder menu and to pro
vide a place on campus for table
service dining, were the reasons for
recommending the addition of the din
ing room. A
It is also planned that some of the
new conference and meeting rooms lie
used for catering and banquet pur

poses. "Such use [of the existing meet
ing rooms] would change the char
acter of the present second floor of
the building into something like the
banquet wing of a large motel," the
report noted. "Properly planned facili
ties in the addition, separated from
the existing plant, will not present
such an impression, yet they will be
available for the late afternoon and
evening meetings for which there is
not now sufficient space."
A second recommended addition
would be a two-story wing constructed
over the deck to house ASSU offices.
Besides expanding the space allotted
to the Associated Students, such a
building would "also free the prime
space now occupied by ASSU for more
extensive browsing and music facili
ties. Such a move also will provide
badly needed Union Board and admin
istrative spaces in the existing read
ing-browsing area," the report stated.
The report explained the desireabil
ity of an arts and crafts center. "The
general acceptance of the student Cul

turul Aits Division .... the popularity
of the circulating library of ait prints;
the demands on music listening and
playing facilities - suggest that the
arts have an important place in the
Union program."
"Unfortunately, current facilities
provide little possibility for creative
work and the inclusion of an arts and
crafts center in the Union is urged."
The report also recommended dou
bling the size of the Union store,
tripling the size of the travel service,
doubling the lounges ("to add im
measurably to the utility and versa
tility of the entire union"), and adding
a large and a small rehearsal room.
Both building and operating costs
for the addition should be less than
those of the present structure, the
report stated. "The costly service core
of the present Union should be able to
service the additions with little aug
mentation, thus reducing the square
foot cost of building and equipping
the addition below that of Tresidder.
Similarly, operating costs should lie
somewhat lower for the addition."
