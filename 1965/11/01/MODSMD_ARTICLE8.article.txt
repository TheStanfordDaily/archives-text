# Committee To Study Closing Of Old Union
## 
### MIKE COUZENS 
Embattled Union residents may
have new hope of saving their home.
Dean Robert J. Wert announced Fri
day that the closing of Union for re
modeling is under study.
His statement followed a unani
mous resolution by Legislature that
the administration not transfer the
78 women of Union elsewhere "until
it has considered all the relevant
issues."
Administrative Space
A decision to change Union into
administrative space dates back to
1951. But the plan called for transfer
only when new dormitories enabled
Union to move as a unit.
Last May the residence was advised
of plans to move them out. this win
ter and to begin renovation. Transfer
of the deans into Union would then
free needed quad space for academics.
Protest began in the spring, and a
petition signed by most of the Union
women was submitted to Dean H.
Donald Winbigler. The women claim,
however, that approaching finals and
confusion in the Dean's Offices made
it difficult to voice objection when
the plan was announced.
This fall, the women have visited
dean s , circulated petitions, and
planned a university-wide committee
of students concerned about housing.
A statement adopted Thursday by
the entire living group said: "Stan

ford's concept of the residence uni
versity is based on the idea that a
student's residence profoundly affects
his educational experience . .
"We as students of u residential
university demand that we be con
sulted on residential policy concern
ing us."
The administration has maintained
that moving the women out could not
be delayed to the end of spring quar
ter. at which time they could move
in larger groups, to fill spaces result
ing from year-end attrition.
Construction was scheduled to be
gin in January, however. Dean Wert
told The Daily last night thai con
struction would probably be some
what behind schedule.
Union's arguments, as presented by
Jackie Boggs, Muriel Dance and
Sheila McCarthy, rest primarily on
three points. Their location can, they
believe, be better used for a dormitory
than for student services.
Secondly, it is asserted that their
identity as a group is valuable, and
should not be fragmented by moving
their into high-rise and other housing.
Finally, they submit that the ad
ministration did not consult with
them before the change was decided
upon.
The Committee of Fifteen, on in
struction by Legislature to its five
members, will begin discussing Union
as its "first priority." The committee
meets for the first time today.

should not be fragmented by moving
their into high-rise and other housing.
Finally, they submit that the ad
ministration did not consult with
them before the change was decided
upon.
The Committee of Fifteen, on in
struction by Legislature to its five
members, will begin discussing Union
as its "first priority." The committee
meets for the first time today.
Embattled Union residents may
have new hope of saving their home.
Dean Robert J. Wert announced Fri
day that the closing of Union for re
modeling is under study.
His statement followed a unani
mous resolution by Legislature that
the administration not transfer the
78 women of Union elsewhere "until
it has considered all the relevant
issues."
Administrative Space
A decision to change Union into
administrative space dates back to
1951. But the plan called for transfer
only when new dormitories enabled
Union to move as a unit.
Last May the residence was advised
of plans to move them out. this win
ter and to begin renovation. Transfer
of the deans into Union would then
free needed quad space for academics.
Protest began in the spring, and a
petition signed by most of the Union
women was submitted to Dean H.
Donald Winbigler. The women claim,
however, that approaching finals and
confusion in the Dean's Offices made
it difficult to voice objection when
the plan was announced.
This fall, the women have visited
dean s , circulated petitions, and
planned a university-wide committee
of students concerned about housing.
A statement adopted Thursday by
the entire living group said: "Stan

ford's concept of the residence uni
versity is based on the idea that a
student's residence profoundly affects
his educational experience . .
"We as students of u residential
university demand that we be con
sulted on residential policy concern
ing us."
The administration has maintained
that moving the women out could not
be delayed to the end of spring quar
ter. at which time they could move
in larger groups, to fill spaces result
ing from year-end attrition.
Construction was scheduled to be
gin in January, however. Dean Wert
told The Daily last night thai con
struction would probably be some
what behind schedule.
Union's arguments, as presented by
Jackie Boggs, Muriel Dance and
Sheila McCarthy, rest primarily on
three points. Their location can, they
believe, be better used for a dormitory
than for student services.
Secondly, it is asserted that their
identity as a group is valuable, and
should not be fragmented by moving
their into high-rise and other housing.
