(Confess or Repress?
All of us have faced unpleasant experiences we'd |ust as soon forget, and
tiaumatic episodes we hope have been erased. But the science of modern
psychology has shown modern men that the past is not lost but etched into
the living fabric of our lives. We grow to be the kind of people we are over
many years, and, unfortunately, unless corrected, the past very much con
| tributes to present day behavior. Anxious to be freed from problems of childhood
and the scars of life some have advocated a life of easy morals and unrestricted
I self-expression, unaware that the unconscious mind controls us, and not the
other way around. As Jesus Christ put it,"He who commits sin is a servant of
: sin".
It is also true that to repress and hide the past only increases the influence
of buried problems, faults become more active when hidden and dangerous
| when concealed. Sooner or later the past catches up with us and a life is lost.
The cure for the ills of life is never to repress, but to learn 1o confess.

The Greek New Testament word "confess' reveals a meaning deeper than
the common usage "to admit, or acknowledge , for this compound word car
ries the meaning of bringing out of the heart non-verbal thoughts, formulating
and expressing them freely before God, coming into agreement with Him, and
finding cleansing, purging and release of tension. The very woid pure in
Greek gives us our English word "catharsis' so the words of Jesus become
clear, ' Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God , The pure in heart
can "see" God now, because they've learned to confess!
Regardless of Ihe depth of an inner need of cleansing, the Bible assures men
everywhere, ' If we confess our sins God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (I John 1:9). Since Jesus Christ said
that all human ills spring from an unclean heart (Matthew 15:19), the import
ance of cleansing and confession of sin can riot be underestimated.
While confessing sins to olheis may sometimes bo effective (James 16)
most people prefer to go directly to God. Jesus Christ is only concerned about
your honesty and openness; His healing love and complete forgiveness are
already available to you today. Why not discover today the truth of His words,
"If the Son shall set you free ycu shall be free indeed".
