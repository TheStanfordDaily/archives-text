# Open Letter To Humphrey
## 
### 
Dear Mr. Vice President:
As we are interested in hearing
you speak, we are unhappy to
learn that you have cancelled your
proposed visit to Stanford.
As you well know, there toil
tinues in this area an extensive
and intense debate on our Far
Eastern policy. We had hoped
that your address would concern
that policy.
In view of the gravity of the
situation in Vietnam, the increas
ing seriousness of our relations
(or lack of them) with China, and
our sincere concern and debate
about these matters, we hope that
you or some other prominent
member of the Administration
will consent to visit us in the near
future to speak on Far Eastern
policy and to discuss it with a
panel of professors of varied
|MÂ»iuts of view.
WILLIAM MACKENZIE.
