## Lindsay 
### 
If the best interests of the city of New York
were apparent to the voters, there would be no
question but that John Lindsay would win the
mayoralty in a landslide. The choice is entirely
between him and Abraham Beame. William
Buckley is not really a candidate for mayor.
Beame's support comes from the very Demo
cratic politicians with whom the enlightened and
progressive Democrats of New York City have
been at war for a generation. By habit, experi
ence and point of view, he is the perfect repre
sentative of the city machine which, in New
York and in other cities, has been failing to
make our big cities fit for our urbanized society.
Lindsay No Miracle Worker
This is no claim that Lindsay is a miracle
worker and a superman. It is quite enough to
say that he comes from a new generation of
educated and public-spirited men which is alert
to and aware of what will have to be done if a
big city like New York is to be made livable and
decent.
It is by no means improbable that in the end
the voters of New York will act upon their first
and most important interest—the welfare of the
city. But the voters are being distracted by poli
ticians, each of whom has his ax to grind.
There is to begin with the Kennedy interest in
New York which, while exploiting the shining
legend of John F. Kennedy, has in fact sunk its
political base in the old New York Democratic
machine. Then there are the administration Dem
ocrats who dare not fail to prove their party
regularity because their minds are fixed not on
New York City, but on Presidential politics in
the years to come.
Most important of all, and critical in this par
ticular election, are the progressive Democrats
in New York. They are in the tradition of Frank
lin and Eleanor Roosevelt, A 1 Smith and Herbert
Lehman. The candidate of these progressive
Democrats was defeated for the nomination by
the machines which nominated Abraham Beame.
The progressive Democrats, the Roosevelt and
Lehman Democrats, are now passing through the
ordeal of choosing between their principles and
their record of party regularity. If they remain
true to their tradition, true to what they have
long professed and have long fought for, they
will—at least in the secrecy of the polling booth
- vote against Beame and for Lindsay.
If the progressive Democrats do this, the
Buckley campaign will be no more than an ugly
sideshow. If, on the other hand, tlie progressive
Democrats desert their principles, the election
returns may show that Buckley, who represents
the Goldwatcr faction, contrived the defeat of
a Republican.
Ruling The Wreckage
He represents the faction which captured the
Republican Party in 1964, and he has now shown
that he is determined to wreck the party in order
to rule the wreckage.
There is in his performance not a scintilla of
interest in the good government of the city of
New York. Buckley's paramount and sole object
is to prove that no Republican, even the most
attractive and highly qualified Republican, can
be elcctcd unless he has surrendered to the
Goldwatcr faction. This is a most, serious assault
<>n the integrity and on the independence of the
Republican Party, and dealing with it will pre
occupy Republicans for a long time to conic.
The key to the election, both from the point of
view of the interests of New York City and of
the interests of the Republican Party, is in the
hands of the progressive Democrats. If they do
not stand up straight, if they bow their heads,
hold their noses and meekly refuse to be as inde
pendent as they have always asked others to be.
they will have a stain on their consciences which
they will not soon be able to wipe off.

The key to the election, both from the point of
view of the interests of New York City and of
the interests of the Republican Party, is in the

If the best interests of the city of New York
were apparent to the voters, there would be no
question but that John Lindsay would win the
mayoralty in a landslide. The choice is entirely
between him and Abraham Beame. William
Buckley is not really a candidate for mayor.
Beame's support comes from the very Demo
cratic politicians with whom the enlightened and
progressive Democrats of New York City have
been at war for a generation. By habit, experi
ence and point of view, he is the perfect repre
sentative of the city machine which, in New
York and in other cities, has been failing to
make our big cities fit for our urbanized society.
Lindsay No Miracle Worker
This is no claim that Lindsay is a miracle
worker and a superman. It is quite enough to
say that he comes from a new generation of
educated and public-spirited men which is alert
to and aware of what will have to be done if a
big city like New York is to be made livable and
decent.
It is by no means improbable that in the end
the voters of New York will act upon their first
and most important interest—the welfare of the
city. But the voters are being distracted by poli
ticians, each of whom has his ax to grind.
There is to begin with the Kennedy interest in
New York which, while exploiting the shining
legend of John F. Kennedy, has in fact sunk its
political base in the old New York Democratic
machine. Then there are the administration Dem
ocrats who dare not fail to prove their party
regularity because their minds are fixed not on
New York City, but on Presidential politics in
the years to come.
Most important of all, and critical in this par
ticular election, are the progressive Democrats
in New York. They are in the tradition of Frank
lin and Eleanor Roosevelt, A 1 Smith and Herbert
Lehman. The candidate of these progressive
Democrats was defeated for the nomination by
the machines which nominated Abraham Beame.
The progressive Democrats, the Roosevelt and
Lehman Democrats, are now passing through the
ordeal of choosing between their principles and
their record of party regularity. If they remain
true to their tradition, true to what they have
long professed and have long fought for, they
will—at least in the secrecy of the polling booth
- vote against Beame and for Lindsay.
If the progressive Democrats do this, the
Buckley campaign will be no more than an ugly
sideshow. If, on the other hand, tlie progressive
Democrats desert their principles, the election
returns may show that Buckley, who represents
the Goldwatcr faction, contrived the defeat of
a Republican.
Ruling The Wreckage
He represents the faction which captured the
Republican Party in 1964, and he has now shown
that he is determined to wreck the party in order
to rule the wreckage.
There is in his performance not a scintilla of
interest in the good government of the city of
New York. Buckley's paramount and sole object
is to prove that no Republican, even the most
attractive and highly qualified Republican, can
be elcctcd unless he has surrendered to the
Goldwatcr faction. This is a most, serious assault
<>n the integrity and on the independence of the
Republican Party, and dealing with it will pre
occupy Republicans for a long time to conic.
