Today is Election Day in New York City unit
lor someone who doesn't live there it's been a
very hard campaign to follow. It was one of
the cleanest campaigns ever seen in New York
and the only things that the candidates have
charged each other with have been bigotry, rac
ism, incompetence, stupidity, and moral turpi
tude.
As far as we can tell from the advertisements,
a vote for William Buckley is really a vote for
Abraham Beame. A vote for Beame is really a
vote for John Lindsay. And a vote for Lindsay
is either a vote for Beame or Buckley, depending
on how you feel about David Dubinsky, the head
of the Ladies Garment Workers Union.
Lindsay Best. Looking
Mr. Lindsay is the best looking of the three
and has been attacked for this by his opponents
who feel a city as large as New York would be
handicapped by a good-looking Mayor.
The Congressman from the Silk Stocking Dis
trict insists he is running as a Fusion candidate
and not as a Republican. Therefore, a win by
Lindsay, according to Republican leaders, would
be a big boost for the Republican party all over
the United States.
Mr. Buckley does not really want to be Mayor
of New York City and has already announced
that if he won he would demand a recount. His
objective seems to be to prevent Mr. Lindsay
from winning. Since he is not a serious candidate
for the office, he has had the advantage of not
having to discuss the issues. Because he's steered
clear of the issues and only dealt in personalities,
Mr. Buckley has been getting the most attention
of any of the three candidates.
Mr. Beame is the Democratic candidate for
Mayor and has been attacked for his height, his
lack of glamour, and his handling of the city's
books as Controller. At the beginning the only
one in the Democratic party who hedged on his
endorsement was President Johnson who had
only sent him warm greetings through Vice Pres
ident Humphrey. You can't do much witli warm
greetings during an election campaign, and many
of Mr. Beame's supporters indicated that the
warm greetings would have as much effect on
the race as an autographed photo of Mr. John
son's gall bladder operation.
Who Doesn't Support Whom
Mayor Wagner has not campaigned actively
for Controller Beame, presumably because Sen.
Robert Kennedy is supporting him. No national
Republicans have campaigned for Lindsay be
cause Lindsay was afraid that, if they did. he
would lose the Democratic vote.
Mr. Lindsay has been attacked for being a
white Protestant, Mr. Buckley has been attacked
for being a Catholic, and Mr. Beame's only hope
is that New York has never had a Jewish Mayor.
Mr. Bucklcy has accused Mr. Lindsay of being
soft on communism and Mr. Lindsay has accused
Mr. Beame of being soft on Mr. Buckley.
Lindsay insists that if Mr. Beame really had
the best interests of the city at heart he should
answer Buckley's charges against Lindsay.
Beame does not want to attack Buckley, because,
if he did, President Johnson might ask for his
warm greetings back.
So today the citizens of New York City will
have an opportunity to go to the polls and decide
who their Mayor will be. it isn't an easy election
to predict, at least, not since Yale announced that
Columbus didn't discover America and fouled up
the Italian vote.
All I can say is: "New York is a nice place to
visit, but I wouldn't want to vote there."

The Congressman from the Silk Stocking Dis
trict insists he is running as a Fusion candidate
and not as a Republican. Therefore, a win by
Lindsay, according to Republican leaders, would
be a big boost for the Republican party all over
the United States.
Mr. Buckley does not really want to be Mayor
of New York City and has already announced
that if he won he would demand a recount. His
objective seems to be to prevent Mr. Lindsay
from winning. Since he is not a serious candidate
for the office, he has had the advantage of not
having to discuss the issues. Because he's steered
clear of the issues and only dealt in personalities,
Mr. Buckley has been getting the most attention
of any of the three candidates.
Mr. Beame is the Democratic candidate for
Mayor and has been attacked for his height, his
lack of glamour, and his handling of the city's
books as Controller. At the beginning the only
one in the Democratic party who hedged on his
endorsement was President Johnson who had
only sent him warm greetings through Vice Pres
ident Humphrey. You can't do much witli warm
greetings during an election campaign, and many
of Mr. Beame's supporters indicated that the
warm greetings would have as much effect on
the race as an autographed photo of Mr. John
son's gall bladder operation.
Who Doesn't Support Whom
Mayor Wagner has not campaigned actively
for Controller Beame, presumably because Sen.
Robert Kennedy is supporting him. No national
Republicans have campaigned for Lindsay be
cause Lindsay was afraid that, if they did. he
would lose the Democratic vote.
Mr. Lindsay has been attacked for being a
white Protestant, Mr. Buckley has been attacked
for being a Catholic, and Mr. Beame's only hope
is that New York has never had a Jewish Mayor.
Mr. Bucklcy has accused Mr. Lindsay of being
soft on communism and Mr. Lindsay has accused
Mr. Beame of being soft on Mr. Buckley.
Lindsay insists that if Mr. Beame really had
the best interests of the city at heart he should
answer Buckley's charges against Lindsay.
Beame does not want to attack Buckley, because,
if he did, President Johnson might ask for his
warm greetings back.
So today the citizens of New York City will
have an opportunity to go to the polls and decide
who their Mayor will be. it isn't an easy election
to predict, at least, not since Yale announced that
Columbus didn't discover America and fouled up
the Italian vote.
All I can say is: "New York is a nice place to
visit, but I wouldn't want to vote there."

lor someone who doesn't live there it's been a
very hard campaign to follow. It was one of
the cleanest campaigns ever seen in New York
and the only things that the candidates have
charged each other with have been bigotry, rac
ism, incompetence, stupidity, and moral turpi
tude.
As far as we can tell from the advertisements,
a vote for William Buckley is really a vote for
Abraham Beame. A vote for Beame is really a
vote for John Lindsay. And a vote for Lindsay
is either a vote for Beame or Buckley, depending
on how you feel about David Dubinsky, the head
of the Ladies Garment Workers Union.
Lindsay Best. Looking
Mr. Lindsay is the best looking of the three
and has been attacked for this by his opponents
who feel a city as large as New York would be
handicapped by a good-looking Mayor.
