## Miracles Do Happen-Daily Accuracy Lauded 
### 
Editor, The Dully:
Last Thursday's issues i)f the
Stanford Daily and the Palo Alto
Times presented a striking con
trast between our two local
newspapers in the relative ac
curacy of their reporting of a
news item. The item in question
—featured in both papers—was
the fact (a) that 29 Stanford pro
fessors were beginning to collect
signatures for a petition, in the
form of a letter to President
Johnson, which will appear ill an
advertisement in the Washing
ton Post next month, and (b)
that the ad is to l>e published
only when 1000 signatures have
been obtained.
The Daily reported the above
with complete accuracy under
the headline "Profs to Petition
L.8.J," The Times, on the other
hand, used the headline, "29
Stanford Professors Petition
L.8.J.", which is clearly mis
leading. Moreover, the Times
states incorrectly that the 29 pro
fessors are members of Califor
nians for Peace in Vietnam.
While some of them are, others
are not. In any case, the 29 pro
fessors sponsoring the petition
are doing so in an individual
capacity and not as members of
any organization.

• Pave Vietnam
Editor, The Daily:
Recently alternatives to the
administration's Vietnam policy
have been as numerous as B-52's
north of the border. The follow
ing is a slightly revised version
of one such recent proposal (Art
Hoppe, S.F. Chronicle) which is
being sent to Mr. Minus Gall
bladder who is in close contact
with internal processes in Wash
ington.
The proposal is quite simple:
pave over Vietnam, asphalt the
whole bloody country, paint
parking strips on the asphalt,
and install parking meters. This
would set off a chain reaction
which would please everybody.
First, police would be needed
to check the parking meters.
American police could be sent to
do the job. In a country the size
of Vietnam this would entail a
large share of our present law
enforcement officers. This would
mean a smaller police force at
home and thus less resistance to
those demonstrating against our
Vietnam policy. It might result

in utter chaos but at least we
would be relatively unimpeded
in our march to the Oakland
Army Terminal.
Second, automobiles would be
needed to occupy the parking
places. American cars could be
floated over or dropped from
bombers. This would add a
whole new dynamic dimension
to the war. Opponents of the
war could cry "economic exploi
tation" and thus have to rely
less on appeals to conscience,
morality and all that pre-Maehi
avellian dribble. Anti-anti dem
onstrators could carry banners
saying "What's good for General
Motors, etc."
Third, we would need Ameri
can service stations to main
tenance the cars. Vietnamese
would be convinced that the
American way is best. They
would fall heirs to America's
one great contribution to man
kind—gas station rest rooms.
Fourth, American currency—
at least pennies, nickels and
dimes to put in the parking me
ters —would have to be intro
duced. This would round out
American economic take-over.
Skeptical Communists would be
convinced that capitalism is at
the heart of American Imperi
alism. Commies would rush to
the aid of the oppressed Viet
namese by attempting to de
stroy the Capitalist Warmon
gers. This woidd lead to the
eventual unleashing of the
Doomsday Machine. Two advan
tages would result: the Com
mies would be blamed for the
ultimate escalation of the war,
and our initial escalation would
be overlooked; more important
ly. this would end all problems
associated with Vietnam for pol
icy makers, anti-demonstrators,
parking meter attendants, serv
ice station operators, etc. In fact,
it would end the whole bloody
mess for all of us. No more dem
onstrations, no more teach-ins,
no more anything.

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Prof. Possony's
concern over Communist activi
ties on this nation's campuses I
would like to say that there are
a number of things which bother
me, too.
