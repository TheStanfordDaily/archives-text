### DICK LIVINGSTON 
Members of the Walter Army

their support for the United
States war effort in Vietnam,
are seeking blood dona'ions to
day at noon in White Memorial
Plaza.
The blood will be given to
United States and South Viet
namese military casualties and
to civilian victims of "Commun
ist terrorism."
One Pint From Each
The Society is seeking one pint
of blood from each donor to
"support the struggle of the Re
public of Vietnam against the
aggression from the north. We
feel that by donating blood, we
will give some real and personal
aid to those suffering in this
conflict."
The pledge which prospective
donors will be asked to sign says,
"We may not all agree on all
aspects of the United States' in
volvement in South Vietnam, but
we do all emphatically agree as
to the urgent necessity of the
basic United States action in this
area."
MeNamara Praise
The drive was announced
hours after Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara expressed his
"deepest appreciation to the
thousands of students and other
groups across the country who
have volunteered to donate blood
as a gesture of support for our
servicemen fighting in Viet
nam."
The Army Society hopes to
appeal to personal pride and
patriotism in the drive. Reports
that most students support the
government's policy in Vietnam
make the Society optimistic
about the success of the drive.
Freshman Robert Clark, vice
president of the Society, said
that the blood drive is being
supported by at least six other
campus organizations, including
the Arnold Air Society, the Viet
nam Defense Committee, the
Young Republicans and a newly
formed national group. CON
SCIENCE.
Aid From CON SCIEN CE

clined to endorse the drive. "If
the Young Democrats take a

stand either way it would split
the organization down the mid
dle." he explained.
Bob Naylor, another co-chair
man of CONSCIENCE in Cali
fornia and president of the
Young Republicans, announced
that the executive board of this
group had endorsed the blood
drive for US and South Vietna
mese troops. "There was com
plete unanimity on the need to
support our commitment. 1 am
surprised that there is some
doubt in Young Democrat circles
about supporting their President
on this issue."
Aid To Viet Cong

Committee For Vietnam, a
group opposing the Army Soci
ety program, announced plans to
seek money and blood pledges
