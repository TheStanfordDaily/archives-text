# Energy Transfer In Stanford's Backyard
## 
### VIKRAM RAO 
"We're not trying to create an
ocean in our backyard; nor arc we
attempting to simulate it.*' says Prof.
En Yun llsu. "We're merely trying,
among other things, to obtain energy
transfer between wind and waves;
and thereby understand the underly
ing mechanism."
The wind-wave tunnel, one of the
largest of its kind in the U.S., was
designed, fabricated a n d commis
sioned in just under twelve months
ik) mean feat by any standards. Prof.
Hsu's associates in this National Sci
ence Foundation sponsored venture
are Profs. Byrne Perry and Robert L.
St reel, also ol Stanford's Civil Engi
neering Department.
This massive piece of equipment
generates waves of all sizes and de
scription. Their observation gives in
formation with regard to energy
transfer, wave growth, and other
characteristics which cannot easily be
studi< d at sea. "ft is generally known,"
said Prof. Hsu, "that wind blowing
over a free water surface generates
waves. Yet the physical processes in
volved cannot be regarded as known."
The 115-foot glass walled tunnel,
strongly reminiscent of a fish tank,
is (i ft. high and 3 ft. wide. At one
end smooth waves are generated by
an electronically controlled hydraulic
piston, instead of by the more conven
tional mechanical device. This offers
greater flexibility of operation in pro
during different wave forms, and is
dN'i cheaper in operation than it inc

ehanical counterpart. "The least I can
say," commented Prof. llsu lightly,
"is that you don't get your hands
messy."
Wind generated by a 30 h.p. cen
trifugal fan plays upon the surface
at speeds lip to 30 ra.p.h. and creates
surf, white-caps and the like.
At the other end of the tunnel is a
shelving beach consisting of steel bas
kets containing stainless steel lathe
shavings. The action of a real beach
is simulated in that the waves are nol
permitted to rebound off the end and
interfere with the oncoming wave pat
to ins under observation. Wave shapes
and other characteristics are record
ed by a complexity of electronic dc
\ ices and cameras.
11 is w hen science degenerates into
technology that the man in the street
sits up and takes notice. To him the
photoelectric theory is Hot tangible
until it operates a burglar alarm of
the more sophisticated variety.
Prof. llsu's apparatus should hence
he of interest since it is going to have
a very decided impetus on technology
in diverse fields. The energy distribu
tion in waves is a major factor in the
design ol Hiips and missiles, as well
as harbor piers and the like, it ma\
now be possible to forecast more ac
curately the effect of stormy condi
tions at sea. and consequently develop
new measures to combat them a
piece of work that might well put the
phrase "pouring oil on troubled wa
ters" out of business.
