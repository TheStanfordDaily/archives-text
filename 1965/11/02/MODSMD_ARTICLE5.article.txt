Today's competing blood drives in W lute Mem
orial Plaza are rife with symbolism but there is at
present no guarantee that either side will end up
aiding those who need help the most—the civilian
casualties of the ever-escalating conflict in Vietnam.
The Committee for Medical Aid to Vietnam—and
the 200-tnan Stanford Committee lor Peace in Viet
nam which voted to support their drive last night
deserve the most severe censure, as well as complete
ostracism in their corner of the Plaza this afternoon.
Although forewarned by the International Red Cross
that its help only "takes the form of medical supplies
handed over to the North Vietnamese Red Cross in
in Hanoi" and that the National Liberation Front
(Viet Cong) is supplied with medical and surgical
supplies "through its representative in Moscow, this
group has decided to make its contribution anyway
in hopes that the harried civilian populace may re
ceive care.
Though not treasonous, this decision is a moral and
political blunder of the first order and can only fur
ther polarization of an issue desparateh in need of
a reasoned and widespread dialogue.
However, we find the reaction of the \\ alter Army
Society and other red, white and blue organizations
somewhat off the point as well. We do not doubt that
American and South Vietnamese troops need blood
but we have yet to read of an American Red Cross
warning that the supply for our military men is low.
Hut what about the civilians everyone claims to be
concerned about?
According to the International Red Cross, "our
delegates are co-operating with the South Vietnamese
Red Cross in a relief program (food, medicine and
clothing) for about 600,000 displaced persons.' We
suggest that these are the people who need aid—the
one who are victims of a vicious war they did not
start and cannot control..
