# SCPV Backs Move For Medical Help
## 
### BILL WERTZ Managing Editor 
The Medical Aid Committee
for Vietnam will hold a rally at
noon today to raise money for
medical supplies to be sent to
Viet Cong controlled areas of
Viet nam.
Members of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
passed a resolution last night
commending the Medical Aid
Committee's action, with ihe
stipulation that the aid would go
to civilians only.
"We believe that as a major
combatant and as the major
supplier of arms to the conflict,
the United States owes a partic
ular and probably unpayable
debt to the civilians whom the
war has harmed," the resolution
said.
A Lesser Tragedy
Stuart McRae, co-chairman of
the Medical Aid Committee, said
that supplies sent, (o Vietnam
would possibly end up in the
hands of the Viet Cong, but said
he felt this was less of a tragedy
than the bombings that have
harmed civilians.
The Medical Aid Committee
plans to administer aid through
the International Committee of
the Red Cross.
The Committee was told in a
letter dated October 13 from the
American Red Cross: "It is the
traditional role of the Interna
tional Committee of the Red
Cross to administer aid impar
tially in strife-torn areas. You
may be sure that any contribu
tions you 7iiake to the Commit
tee would be used in the manner
which you obviously intend."
Hanoi Control
However, the Medical Aid
Committee was told by the In
ternational Red Cross on Oct. 1.1
that medical air! in North Viet
nam was handed over to the
government in Hanoi and that it
had no control of the supplies
past this point. It said that aid
for Viet Cong controlled areas
of South Vietnam was handled
by a representative of the Na
tional Liberation Front in Mos
cow.
SCPV member Client Sedky
said "It is very unrealistic to
believe that the aid will not go
to the Viet Cong."
The SCPV resolution empha
sized that the Medical Aid
Committee was a completely
"separate and independent or
ganization" and had no official
connection with the SCVP.

"We understand that neither
the American Red Cross, CARE,
nor any other American agency
is attempting to redress the
misery which the war is inflict
ing 011 the civilian population of
these areas," the resolution
stated.
Paying A Debt
"That the American Red Cross
is attempting to pay this debt to
the people of the area in South
Vietnam which we control, we
find commendable. That the
Medical Aid Committee is at
tempting to pay a part of this
debt which no other American
agency has seen fit to, we find
equally comendable."
SCPV Chairman David Ran
som said he thought the Com
mittee's objectives "honorable
and humanitarian."
"I believe that the Medical Aid
Committee's program will de
crease civilian suffering for
which this nation is responsi
ble." ho said. "We owe these
people our help."
"Odd Form"
Professor Bruce Franklin of
the English Department and
Professor Christian Bay of the
political science department will
speak in support of the Medical
Aid Committee's actions in the
rally this morning.
Criticized by the U.S. State
Department as "An odd form of
humanitarianism," the Medical
Aid Committee's plan has
sparked countering offers by
students at other campuses to
donate blood for U.S. forces in
Vietnam.
