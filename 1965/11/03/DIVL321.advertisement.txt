LATE FOR CLASS?
When you're late for class, what can you do?
Do you drive your car . . . park it in a hurry . . . only to get a ticket?
OR do you ride your nifty, thrifty, Honda 50 up to the door (with your
girl on the back, of course) and make it on time to every class.
See us for details on low cost new or used Hondas ...
