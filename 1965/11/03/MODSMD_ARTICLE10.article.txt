# NOISELESS COUP
## Cycle Revolution Hits Campus 
### JOHN HODGES 
Keeping up with the quickening
pace of modern Farm life, 300 local
students have registered their approv
al of a relatively new and exciting
means of transportation: the Motor
cycle.
Invariably spelled with a capital
"M" by its enthusiasts, the Motorcycle
has undergone astonishing growth
over the last five years, Once a SO
vehicle-pcr-year noise problem, the
improved, well-muffled Motorcycle
has swelled to a police registration ol
300, a 500 per cent increase.
Motorcyclists arc si ill in the minor
ity of Stanford's 8500 motor vehicle
operators, but the trend indicates thai
the minority will continue to grow in
number with improvements in the
two-wheeled machines.
Great Brcakt hrougli
Stanford cyclists have been at
tracted by great breakthroughs in the
Motorcycle industry, according to
Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis.
The two-wheeled motor-monster of
five years ago was a hulking, imprac
tical gas-burner, useful only, as an
after-class joymobile or a plaything
for young mechanics.
Today, the Motorcycle has been re
duced to a point where it is light
weight, quiet, economical, less bulky,
more maneuverable. and less expen
sive initially. Although the cycle can
still double as an after-class joymobile
or weekend "tinkertoy." a motorcycle
is now used for here to foe r unheard
of purposes transportation, for in
stance. Ease in handling and improved
parkin;; futilities have made it a prut

tical way of commuting between
classes.
Years ago the noise problem caused
by motorcycles was so acute that the
administration considered placing a
ban on all motor-driven cycles on cam
pus. Today no such problems exist,
say Stanford Police. Mufflers have
become so effective Ihat it is now
rarely necessary to issue ;i citation
for excessive noise.
Girls Too
Evidence of the new practicality of
the Motorcycle was offered by Chief
Gordon, who noted that today it is
not strange to see a girl driving a
Honda or a Yamaha. Just a few years
back, one had to be a male and a
brawny one at that to handle the
machines.
By far the greatest problem police
have with Motorcycles today is the
parking situation, Gordon added, but
on ;i percentage basis, Motorcycles
are no worse offenders than automo
biles. And apparently those cyclists
who are cited for parking violations
are usually those who, late to class,
decide to "chance it"and pray for
non-vigilance on the police force.
Parking Areas
Parking facilities for cycles are
improving also, the police added.
Motorcycle-reserved areas are now be
ing enlarged in most campus lots to
accommodate the influx of motorcy
cling students and staff members. A
few years ago, Motorcycles were
parked in automobile spaces. Occa
sionally a car backing out would clip
a cycle, knocking it over, and if the
the motorcycle was first in a line of
eight or ten, the resulting domino
type rcatiion could cause seiiuus dam

age. Today there is virtually no cyelo
damage in parking areas.
No longer a problem size-wise, and
although nut quite as silent as a Rolls-
Royee, and considerably less expen
sive. the Motorcycle can be expected
to continue to increase in importance
among the other Farm machinery.
Within financial reach of most Stan
ford students finally is a practical
joymobile.

The two-wheeled motor-monster of
five years ago was a hulking, imprac
tical gas-burner, useful only, as an
after-class joymobile or a plaything
for young mechanics.
Today, the Motorcycle has been re
duced to a point where it is light
weight, quiet, economical, less bulky,
more maneuverable. and less expen
sive initially. Although the cycle can
still double as an after-class joymobile
or weekend "tinkertoy." a motorcycle
is now used for here to foe r unheard
of purposes transportation, for in
stance. Ease in handling and improved
parkin;; futilities have made it a prut

tical way of commuting between
classes.
Years ago the noise problem caused
by motorcycles was so acute that the
administration considered placing a
ban on all motor-driven cycles on cam
pus. Today no such problems exist,
say Stanford Police. Mufflers have
become so effective Ihat it is now
rarely necessary to issue ;i citation
for excessive noise.
Girls Too
Evidence of the new practicality of
the Motorcycle was offered by Chief
Gordon, who noted that today it is
not strange to see a girl driving a
Honda or a Yamaha. Just a few years
back, one had to be a male and a
brawny one at that to handle the
machines.
By far the greatest problem police
have with Motorcycles today is the
parking situation, Gordon added, but
on ;i percentage basis, Motorcycles
are no worse offenders than automo
biles. And apparently those cyclists
who are cited for parking violations
are usually those who, late to class,
decide to "chance it"and pray for
non-vigilance on the police force.
Parking Areas
Parking facilities for cycles are
improving also, the police added.
Motorcycle-reserved areas are now be
ing enlarged in most campus lots to
accommodate the influx of motorcy
cling students and staff members. A
few years ago, Motorcycles were
parked in automobile spaces. Occa
sionally a car backing out would clip
a cycle, knocking it over, and if the
the motorcycle was first in a line of
eight or ten, the resulting domino
type rcatiion could cause seiiuus dam

age. Today there is virtually no cyelo
damage in parking areas.
No longer a problem size-wise, and
although nut quite as silent as a Rolls-
Royee, and considerably less expen
sive. the Motorcycle can be expected
to continue to increase in importance
among the other Farm machinery.
Within financial reach of most Stan
ford students finally is a practical
joymobile.
Keeping up with the quickening
pace of modern Farm life, 300 local
students have registered their approv
al of a relatively new and exciting
means of transportation: the Motor
cycle.
Invariably spelled with a capital
"M" by its enthusiasts, the Motorcycle
has undergone astonishing growth
over the last five years, Once a SO
vehicle-pcr-year noise problem, the
improved, well-muffled Motorcycle
has swelled to a police registration ol
300, a 500 per cent increase.
Motorcyclists arc si ill in the minor

operators, but the trend indicates thai
