# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OVERSEAS CAMPUS SUPPLEMENT EDITION
## Austrian Dedication Tomorrow 
### 
Formal dedication of Stanford-in-
Austria will take place tomorrow at
the new campus in Semmering, Aus
tria.
President Wallace Sterling, U.S.
Ambassador James W. Riddleberger,
and Austrian Chancellor Josef Klaus
will speak at the ceremonies officially
opening Stanford's fourth overseas
campus.
The dedication will start with an
open house at the new campus, lo
cated in half of a five-story resort
hotel in the Austrian Alps 57 miles
south of Vienna. The talks are sched
uled for a total of 60 to 90 minutes,
beginning at 5 p.m. A buffet for 200
to 250 guests will follow.
Stan ford-in-Austria and the fifth
overseas Stanford campus at Harlax
ton Manor in England were both ap
proved in November, 1964, by the
Stanford Board of Trustees. Stanford
in-Britain will open for its first ses
sion next January.
The Austrian campus is located in
Semmering, a well-known skiing and
resort area, mountainous and forested.
Graz, Austria's second-largest city,
lies about 60 miles south of the cam
pus. Venice and Yugoslavia, as well
as Vienna and Graz, are accessible by
direct rail.
Before the Iron Curtain, the area
was frequented by the upper-middle
class of the Slavic and Balkan coun
tries as well as by the Viennesse and
West Germans who still vacation
there. The Panhans Hotel, half of
which is used by the Stanford campus,
has elegant facilities known through
out Europe.
All facilities, including a tennis
court (which becomes an ice rink in
winter), two swimming pools, a lounge
and a bar, are available to Stanford
students.
An orchestra plays daily at tea and
for dancing every evening. In addi
tion. they will have their own dining
room and Rathskeller, as well as a
modern lecture hall, small classrooms
and library. Some student rooms will
even have a private bath, a luxury in
Europe.
The Stanford students will learn
about Europeans not only through the
people at the hotel, but also in their
contact with Austrian families. Each
student will have an adopted family,
as at other Overseas Campuses, in
which he will have opportunities to
acquaint himself with Austrians and
also to improve his language ability.
Other experiences available to the
students are traveling extensively
through Europe and in the Semmering
area.
