# IT'S EASIER THERE
## Language Through Culture 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
If yon arc thinking of going over
seas, you know that the University
has a minimum language require
ment. In my ease it was two quarters
of French.
A strong background in a language
is always helpful when going to an
overseas campus, but it is by no
means necessary. Often the "new
comers" to a language get the most
out of their time abroad because of
the spirit of adventure and novelty
they find in tackling the language.
1 was one of these newcomers when
1 began my six month stay iu Tours,
France last September. As a member
of the bottom language section, I
thought that progress was a word
stricken from the French vocabulary.
To Dislraetlon
Although each student was sur
prised at the progress he had made
at the end of six months, daily results
were hard to see. We often drove our
teachers to distraction with our ques
tions on grammar. The explanation

"C'est comme ea" never quite satis
fied us, but a quick glance at English
proves that language can never be
reduced to mere rules.
Today I can look back on some of
my battles with the French language
with pride and also a bit of amaze
ment. Classroom French will always
be the same regardless of location and
so my most memorable encounters
were with the French people.
"False friends," words which exist
in two languages but have entirely
different meanings, are sure to plague
the beginners in a new language. Mis
pronunciation and the similarity in
the sounds of foreign words can also
provide some humorous pitfalls.
Dirty Wash
I remember the first time I took a
bus ride in Paris. I told the conductor
that I wanted to go to the end of the
line (fin de ligne). Unfortunately 1
mispronounced the word for line
(ligne), and the conductor understood
me to say that. 1 wanted to see his
dirty wash (lingo)!

Luckily these experiences imprint
themselves indelibly on the mind of
the student and he is not apt to make
the same mistake twice.
A foreign language is more than
simply another means of comunica
tion. Language also involves the cus
toms and way of life of a country, and
at times a different way of thinking.
Every contact with people in a for
eign land give the students a new
perspective.
Social Setting
Most cajnpuses provide students
with a chanoe to meet the people in
social situations. Parties with the
local students and invitations to dine
with families are always opportuni
ties to increase one's language ability,
but perhaps more importantly social
settings allow the student to become
part of the environment in which he
is living.
The key which opens the student's
horizons to the culture and spirit of
the people during his overseas stay
is language and an adventurous out
look on his new surroundings.

"False friends," words which exist
in two languages but have entirely
different meanings, are sure to plague
the beginners in a new language. Mis
pronunciation and the similarity in
the sounds of foreign words can also
provide some humorous pitfalls.
Dirty Wash
I remember the first time I took a
bus ride in Paris. I told the conductor
that I wanted to go to the end of the
line (fin de ligne). Unfortunately 1
mispronounced the word for line
(ligne), and the conductor understood
me to say that. 1 wanted to see his
dirty wash (lingo)!

Luckily these experiences imprint
themselves indelibly on the mind of
the student and he is not apt to make
the same mistake twice.
A foreign language is more than
simply another means of comunica
tion. Language also involves the cus
toms and way of life of a country, and
at times a different way of thinking.
Every contact with people in a for
eign land give the students a new
perspective.
Social Setting
Most cajnpuses provide students
with a chanoe to meet the people in
social situations. Parties with the
local students and invitations to dine
with families are always opportuni
ties to increase one's language ability,
but perhaps more importantly social
settings allow the student to become
part of the environment in which he
is living.
The key which opens the student's
horizons to the culture and spirit of
the people during his overseas stay
is language and an adventurous out
look on his new surroundings.
If yon arc thinking of going over
seas, you know that the University
has a minimum language require
ment. In my ease it was two quarters
of French.
A strong background in a language
is always helpful when going to an
overseas campus, but it is by no
means necessary. Often the "new
comers" to a language get the most
out of their time abroad because of
the spirit of adventure and novelty
they find in tackling the language.
1 was one of these newcomers when
1 began my six month stay iu Tours,
France last September. As a member
of the bottom language section, I
thought that progress was a word
stricken from the French vocabulary.
To Dislraetlon
Although each student was sur
prised at the progress he had made
at the end of six months, daily results
were hard to see. We often drove our
teachers to distraction with our ques
tions on grammar. The explanation

"C'est comme ea" never quite satis
fied us, but a quick glance at English
proves that language can never be
reduced to mere rules.
Today I can look back on some of
my battles with the French language
with pride and also a bit of amaze
ment. Classroom French will always
be the same regardless of location and
so my most memorable encounters
were with the French people.
