# Overseas Board Begins Evaluation Of Campuses
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL ITALY IX Assistant Editor 
A mechanism for channeling stu
dent evaluations of the Overseas Cam
pus program to the administration
has been initiated this fall by the
Overseas Campus Board.
According to an agreement with
Director of the Overseas Campus Pro
gram Dr. Robert Walker, the Over
seas Campus Board will begin this
year to serve as the mouthpiece for
"criticisms, questions, and ideas on
the Program coming from returning
students and from those currently in
Europe," reports Carl Simpson, Presi
dent of the Board.
Dr. Walker views this as a "useful
function for the Board." He "wel
comes the assistance of groups such
as this for bringing together and put
ting in a usable form suggestions of
this kind. We will give Ihem serious
consideration."
Channel Suggestions
Simpson views the Board as "the
central organ for channeling sugges
tions to the Overseas Campus admin
istration." He would see the Board as
"eompiling the requests and evalua
tions of returning students." He plans
to combine the written form of the
reports with their oral presentation
to Dr. Walker and the other adminis
trators of the program at Board meet,
ings.
The Board plans to hold open meet
ings two or three times a quarter,

beginning with one Nov. 9 at 7:15 p.m.
in Tresidder.
Simpson views Walker as "re
sponsive to public desires and open
to the Board's suggestions."
Alumni
The Board will be working in co
operation with the Associated Alumni
of Overseas Campuses. The alumni
group, which holds a reception for
newly returned students, plans to dis
tribute a questionaire at their function
beginning next quarter.
The institution of this mechanism
for evaluation and change is one of
several changes in the Board's activi
ties resulting from a re-evaluation of
the Board's role in the program. The
Board now plans to have a more fre
quent turnover of membership, limit
ing terms to three quarters. Plans also
call for enlarging the Board with ad
hoc members to make it more repre
sentative. The Board is also concerned
with balancing its membership to in
clude both those "fresh back from
Overseas" and those who have had the
opportunity to mature their impres
sions.
In addition, the Board plans to send
a letter or two each quarter to the
Presidents of the groups currently in
Europe to establish "a dialogue while
students are in Europe to solve some
problems while they are still there,"
relates Board member John Bell. A
more general questionnaire will be
distributed to all students shortly be
fore they leave Europe.
Motivation
Motivation for these changes came
position of the Board and with the

limiting of institutionalized feedback
to administration and sometimes fac
ully members. "There has been very
little from the people for whom the
program is designed," Bell said.
One instance of institutionalized
evaluation of the program was a study
by a sub-committee of the General
Studies committee completed in the
spring of 1964. The group, under the
chairmanship of Prof. John Loftis,
evaluated the program as part, of the
General Studies projectons for the
next decade at Stanford.
The tenor of the Loftis committee's
report was "very affirmative," and the
success of the program was attributed
to its being "the first experience of a
large group of young Americans ex
periencing Europe together, while
maintaining continuity with their
American studies," Prof. Loftis re
ported.
The sub-committee recommended
the expansion of the program which
was realized with the establishment
of the new campuses in Austria and
England.

A mechanism for channeling stu
dent evaluations of the Overseas Cam
pus program to the administration
has been initiated this fall by the
Overseas Campus Board.
According to an agreement with
Director of the Overseas Campus Pro
gram Dr. Robert Walker, the Over
seas Campus Board will begin this
year to serve as the mouthpiece for
"criticisms, questions, and ideas on
the Program coming from returning
students and from those currently in
Europe," reports Carl Simpson, Presi
dent of the Board.
Dr. Walker views this as a "useful
function for the Board." He "wel
comes the assistance of groups such
as this for bringing together and put
ting in a usable form suggestions of
this kind. We will give Ihem serious
consideration."
Channel Suggestions
Simpson views the Board as "the
central organ for channeling sugges
tions to the Overseas Campus admin
istration." He would see the Board as
"eompiling the requests and evalua
tions of returning students." He plans
to combine the written form of the
reports with their oral presentation
to Dr. Walker and the other adminis
trators of the program at Board meet,
ings.
The Board plans to hold open meet
ings two or three times a quarter,

beginning with one Nov. 9 at 7:15 p.m.
in Tresidder.
Simpson views Walker as "re
sponsive to public desires and open
to the Board's suggestions."
Alumni
The Board will be working in co
operation with the Associated Alumni
of Overseas Campuses. The alumni
group, which holds a reception for
newly returned students, plans to dis
tribute a questionaire at their function
beginning next quarter.
The institution of this mechanism
for evaluation and change is one of
several changes in the Board's activi
ties resulting from a re-evaluation of
the Board's role in the program. The
Board now plans to have a more fre
quent turnover of membership, limit
ing terms to three quarters. Plans also
call for enlarging the Board with ad
hoc members to make it more repre
sentative. The Board is also concerned
with balancing its membership to in
clude both those "fresh back from
Overseas" and those who have had the
opportunity to mature their impres
sions.
In addition, the Board plans to send
a letter or two each quarter to the
Presidents of the groups currently in
Europe to establish "a dialogue while
students are in Europe to solve some
problems while they are still there,"
relates Board member John Bell. A
more general questionnaire will be
distributed to all students shortly be
fore they leave Europe.
Motivation
Motivation for these changes came
position of the Board and with the

limiting of institutionalized feedback
to administration and sometimes fac
ully members. "There has been very
little from the people for whom the
program is designed," Bell said.
One instance of institutionalized
evaluation of the program was a study
by a sub-committee of the General
Studies committee completed in the
spring of 1964. The group, under the
chairmanship of Prof. John Loftis,
evaluated the program as part, of the
General Studies projectons for the
next decade at Stanford.
The tenor of the Loftis committee's
report was "very affirmative," and the
success of the program was attributed
to its being "the first experience of a
large group of young Americans ex
periencing Europe together, while
maintaining continuity with their
American studies," Prof. Loftis re
ported.
The sub-committee recommended
the expansion of the program which
was realized with the establishment
of the new campuses in Austria and
England.
