# Readers Will 'Get the Point' In Weak Workshop Edition
## 
### BARB SAVERY 
Henry Alley, Workshop editor,
opens the third edition of his under
graduate journal, with a particularly
appropriate editorial on the plotless
-11 ess of most Workshop sh«u t stories.
"The prose." he notes, "often seems
aimless, the dramatic construction
weak."
Alley then proceeds to devote the
entire edition to examples of such

prose, and the only response left read
ers is a satiated "We get the point!"
Which is to say, the new edition of
Workshop is an excellent treatise on.
and testament to, the deficiencies of
Stanford prose. Period.

Patt MeDermid's "The Rooms on
Salisbury Road" is a fine descriptive
piece, and proves the writer quite
facile with words, but il unfortunately
amounts to little more than a harshly
nostalgic description of Hong Kong
life.
Although "Road" is, to echo Alley,
"formless and lacking in ideas," it is
still, basically, good writing a re
deeming virtue which the later Work
shop pieces lack. Tom Zaniello's "Si
lence of Song" lacks not only form
and ideas, bul coherence; and Jeff
Smith's "Marion, Arkansas" feebly
fails to convey its apparent theme:
that Ihp failures in race relations are
the fault of "Everyman's" inertia.
Fortunately, however, the failure of
Workshop's prose is compensated for
by Ihe surprising quality of some ol
its poetry.
