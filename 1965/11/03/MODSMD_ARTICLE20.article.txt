## Diversity Needed 
### 
With tlir formal dedication of the Austrian campus tomorrow and
the opening of the British campus in January, the overseas campus
program will have expanded to such an extent that fully one-twelfth
of the student body will be abroad at any given moment.
Since so many students will be affected we hope this supplement
may help the potential applicant to discern some of the realities be
hind the myths of Stanford abroad. The vaunted "Europena Experi
ence—Stanford Style" is not for everyone, for although Time Maga
zines statement some year's ago that "... the brains behind their
(the student's) tanned and healthy faces" find the classwork at over
seas campuses "inane and untaxing" is somewhat unjust, it is true that
the program does not allow for intensive study of the local language,
culture or literature.
Stanford abroad is a mass program and thus suffers as much from
its practicality as it gains. Yet presently it is the only viable alterna
tive open to undergraduates who cannot afford to drop out of school
for a year to study abroad—either because of finances or the draft. The
University is extremely reluctant to accept transfer credits from foreign
colleges except in the area of language proficiency, and so far the
idea of establishing a selective Junior Year Abroad Program has been
stoutly resisted. Moreover, there is no formal consultation with stu
dents about the contents and administration of the present program.
Perhaps Dr. Robert Walker, director of Stanford abroad and chair
man of the committee of the Academic Council on General Studies,
might move to appoint students as ex-officio members of this com
mittee (such action was recommended by the parent Executive Com
mittee two weeks ago). Also, the student advisory committee on over
seas campuses might be used more as counselors on regulations, ad
ministration and faculty and course assignments abroad.
It is time for the Administration to put aside its overly defensive
reaction to student and faculty criticism and begin a comprehensive
study of the feasibility of a diversified overseas study program.
