# 'A Great Place For Teaching'
## Faculty Praises Environment; Professor Urges Improvements 
### CHRIS HARTE 
"My first suggestion is that the
University establish a Stanford in
Stanford. To create as satisfactory an
atmosphere here on the Farm as there
is at the overseas campuses would be
of great benefit."
Such comment is typical from the
professors who have taught at the
overseas campuses. But although they
all join in praise for the program,
each sees possibilities for improve
ment.
Family Opportunity
Perhaps the major advantage for
the professor is that the University
allows him to take his wife and two
children with him.
"It was a tremendous opportunity
for my two sons to attend school in
Beutelsbach," said Professor Edwin
M. Good, who spent one quarter each
with Germany XIII and XIV. "And
you get a chance for a kind of close
living with students which is very dif
ferent from here."
"We had a good number of evening
bnll sessions, some lasting until two
or three in the morning," said sociol
ogy professor Morris Zelditch, "which
is much closer contact with the under
graduates than we get here."
Original Works Used
Art Professor Matthew S. Kahn,
who spanned two Italy groups, com
mented on the benefits of being able
to use original works of art as exam
ples, instead of the second and third
hand examples he has to use here.
Speaking of benefits to the studenls
at the foreign campuses, Dornbusch
said that "being in the country, in
contact with its culture, makes much
more meaningful what the student
has learned and is learning about it."
He also cited the decline in grade

consciousness as an advantage to the
student.
"The students come back with a far
greater appreciation of art and music
because of the contact with opera,
concerts, and the world famous gal
leries," according to Professor Wayne
Vucinch, who has been with three
groups each at both the German and
Italian campuses.
Potential Not Realized
Good, a professor of religion, said
that there is a "potentiality for over
coming the students' parochialism,"
but added that this is "not always
realized as it could and should bo."
Zelditch, who taught in Florence,
considers the overseas campuses to
have a "far more intellectual and
intimate atmosphere, one which is
valuable for any major."
English professor John Loft is felt;
that language study on the French
campus, where he taught in groups
11, 111, and X, is more effective than
on the home campus.
Students Isolated
Loftis and sociology professor Dorn
busch agree that at the French cam
pus students are as "little isolated
from the community as possible," and
that "considering the size of the stu
dent body, it probably couldn't be
done better."
Kahn felt that whatever isolation
there was on the Italian campus was
necessary, mentioning that students
would not get as much out of the
course if it were taught in Italian,
even by a native, because of the detail
and subtleties involved.
Professor Zelditch agreed, noting
that "in Florence, as in Boston, one
doesn't walk down a street and get
invited into a stranger's home."
"Primarily because of the place
ment of the campus, way up on the
hill, getting down is quite a produc
tion and requires a deliberate effort
on the part of the student," said Pro
fessor Good of the German campus.
Adaptability Important
Vucinch feels that in both Italy and
Germany it is "not so much the loca
tion of the campus as the adaptability
of the individual" which determines
the student's contact or isolation.
Many improvements were suggested
by the professors. Zelditch commented
on the need to improve the libraries,
but noted the financial difficulty to
maintaining five good libraries over
seas.
He also said that there is no place
to "get away and study at the Flor
ence campus.
Professor Dornbusch suggested that
the week long and weekend trips be
more heavily subsidized, and that
more money be allocated to bring dis
tinguished scholars to the campuses.
Academic Transfer
"The program is not fulfilling its
potential," said Good, because the aca
demic program overseas is often sim
ply the program here transferred to
a spot in Europe, "a remarkably un
imaginative solution."
"Since half the Stanford undergrad
uates will not attend the foreign cam
puses, roughly one-twelfth of all un
dergraduate education will be taking
place overseas."
Because of this. God believes, the
faculty has the responsibility to main
tain constant supervision of the cam
puses.
He recommends that a new faculty
committee of the academic council be
established to oversee the campuses,
feeling that this is the best way for
the faculty to exercise control over
them.
