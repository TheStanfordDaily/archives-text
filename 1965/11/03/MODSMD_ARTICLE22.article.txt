# Campus In France Is Protective
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM FRANCE X Associate Editor 
The statue of Rabelais stands with
its back to the building, and in order
to got a good look at it you have to
walk around to the front, maybe even
as far as across the street to the quay
which holds back the Loire.
The prestigious sign over the door
reads "Stanford in France" which has
a romantic ring, but the boast that
inside the door there is France in
Stanford has a hollow one.
Yet it is not Rabelais or the French
culture which has turned its back on
Stanford but the other way around.
Outside there is France, which, like
the Loire, gushes out and flows past
in all its glory. There are the con
gested streets, full of whining velo
solexes and deux chevaux. There is
the smell of strong tobacco and fresh
bread. There are the stores with dis
arranged stalls on the sidewalk. And
there are the students at noon, talking
between sips of coffee after lunch.
But inside things are different.
Inside there is a French television
that no one watches. Inside there arc
French teachers for two hours a day,
who speak only rarely in the official
language which is English. Inside,
there are French newspapers and
magazines, but most everyone reads
the New York Times and Tin»>s. In
side, there arc books in French, but,
unless they are assigned, no one reads
them.
The center contains a ping pong
table, a volleyball court, a dining
room, a library and a bar that serves
Heineken beer for 20 cents a bottle.
As Chuck Kuntz, a student in Group
X, remarks, "It is not hard to get
along here."
The campus is in many ways the
extension of Stanford in California
(there are Stanford professors, courses
and students) by other means, and
perhaps better means. It features coed
living, beer and wine, and a more
natural relation between student and
faculty.
These improvement to Farm living
partially explain the popularity of the
overseas program, but they also keep
the students couped up,
Alex Bryner, a French major who
went from Group X to the Stanford
program at Nantes, puts it this way:
"It is for most people just an Amer
ican place in a French surrounding,
sort of like having your own little
island in a hostile world, and you may
go out to talk a little French but you
always come back to your nest."
But: it is not merely a case of lead
ing a horse to water that refuses to
drink, as many contend. Rather, you
can't even get the horse out of his
sweet-smelling barn.

But inside things are different.
Inside there is a French television
that no one watches. Inside there arc
French teachers for two hours a day,
who speak only rarely in the official
language which is English. Inside,
there are French newspapers and
magazines, but most everyone reads
the New York Times and Tin»>s. In
side, there arc books in French, but,
unless they are assigned, no one reads
them.
The center contains a ping pong
table, a volleyball court, a dining
room, a library and a bar that serves
Heineken beer for 20 cents a bottle.
As Chuck Kuntz, a student in Group
X, remarks, "It is not hard to get
along here."
The campus is in many ways the
extension of Stanford in California
(there are Stanford professors, courses
and students) by other means, and
perhaps better means. It features coed
living, beer and wine, and a more
natural relation between student and
faculty.
These improvement to Farm living
partially explain the popularity of the
overseas program, but they also keep
the students couped up,
Alex Bryner, a French major who
went from Group X to the Stanford
program at Nantes, puts it this way:
"It is for most people just an Amer
ican place in a French surrounding,
sort of like having your own little
island in a hostile world, and you may
go out to talk a little French but you
always come back to your nest."
But: it is not merely a case of lead
ing a horse to water that refuses to
drink, as many contend. Rather, you
can't even get the horse out of his
sweet-smelling barn.
The statue of Rabelais stands with
its back to the building, and in order
to got a good look at it you have to
walk around to the front, maybe even
as far as across the street to the quay
which holds back the Loire.
The prestigious sign over the door
reads "Stanford in France" which has
a romantic ring, but the boast that
inside the door there is France in
Stanford has a hollow one.
Yet it is not Rabelais or the French
culture which has turned its back on
Stanford but the other way around.
Outside there is France, which, like
the Loire, gushes out and flows past
in all its glory. There are the con
gested streets, full of whining velo
solexes and deux chevaux. There is
the smell of strong tobacco and fresh
bread. There are the stores with dis
arranged stalls on the sidewalk. And
there are the students at noon, talking
between sips of coffee after lunch.
