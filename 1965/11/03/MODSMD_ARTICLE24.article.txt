# BRITISH CAMPUS OPENS
## Manor Houses Group 
### 
Stanford-in-Britain, the fifth center
in the overseas education program,
will welcome its first group of 80
students during winter quarter this
year.
Housed in Harlaxton Manor, the 50
men and 30 women will enjoy educa
tional exchanges and sports events
with the neighboring colleges of Nott
ingham and Leicester. Visiting faculty
will be exchanged between these
schools and Harlaxton.
The Campus is a mile from the
small village of Harlaxton, an agri
cultural center, and is an hour and
40 minutes from London by train.
Harlaxton is only a short distance
from the site of Robin Hood and
the Sheriff of Nottingham's famed

Sherwood forest. Nearby Nottingham
boasts four theaters, one of which
is a permanent Shakespearian reper
tory.
Harlaxton Manor was originally
built by the De Ligne and Gregory
families in 1837. It has since been
completely modernized with central
heating, plumbing, lighting, a dining
hall and kitchen and an elevator.
A paratroop regiment occupied the
manor during World War 11. It was
then used by the Society of Jesus, a
Roman Catholic Jesuit order, as a
novitiate until 1964. It was in 1964
that the Stanford Board of Trustees
approved the location as an overseas
center.
The building will house two facul
ty instructors, and the assistant di

rector of studies as well as students:
Professor George Knowles of the
History Department, and Professor
Martin Evans, of the English Depart
ment. Arthur Tollefson will aid the
Director of Studies.
Field trips to the Continent, as
well as throughout England, will be
possible.
Existing rules and regulations for
Overseas Campuses will remain in
effect for the new British and Aus
trian centers.
Stanford pioneered its first under
graduate overseas campus near Stutt
gart, Germany, in 1958. It followed
with similar campuses at Tours,
France, and Florence, Italy, in 1960.
Semmering, Austria was opened this
fall.
