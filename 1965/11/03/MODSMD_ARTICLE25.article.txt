# French Campus Enjoys Ties With Community
## 
### JIM SELNA FRANCE IX Assistant Editor 
The Stanford-in-France campus is
located in Tours, about 200 kilometers
southwest of Paris. Tours is Iho cen
ter of the Loire Valley, famous for
its chateaux and its fine wines.
In some respects Tours is not a
typical French town. Much of the
town was destroyed during the Sec
ond World War. The town is more
modern, both in appearance and spir
it, than other parts of the nation.
The Stanford Center is situated on
Place Anatole France facing the Loire
River. The heart of town is just a
five minute walk along the Rue Na
tional, the main street of Tours.
Consideration
All activities are conducted under
one roof in a building leased to Stan
ford by the French Ministry of Edu
cation. The Center has its own libraiy
which also serves as a lecture room.
Quarters and classroom space are
smaller than sutdents are used to,
and a good degree of consideration is
required of all students for life to
function smoothly at the Center.
Stanford-in-France is affiliated wilh
the University of Poitier and Stanford

students have all the privileges of
their French counterparts.
Language and the study of French
culture are the principle goals of the
academic program. Two professors
from Stanford in California accom
pany each group. Their courses are
usually chosen to take advantage of
the French environment, and tend to
focus on French contribution in the
particular field of study.
Sustained Contact
The faculty members take their
meals with the students and students
have a unique opportunity in their
Stanford career for sustained person
al contact with their teachers.
French is taught by local teachers.
Most of the French instructors teach
on the lycec level, though it is not
unusual to have a professor from the
University of Poitier.
According to his language ability,
each student is placed in one of the
five French groups. Recent changes
in the format of the courses have
been made to provide a greater con
tinuity with the curriculum of the
French Department on Quad.
More Progress
Generally students in the lower
group make the most progress over
the six month period, although stu
dents in the upper groups are able
to take greater advantage of many
cultural offerings due to their prior
skill in the language.
A two unit course in French Civil
ization is taught by guest lecturers.
At times the course lacks continuity.
Lectures in French arc the rule dur
ing the second quarter, however even
the students in the lowest French
groups are generally able to adapt
to this.
Although the academic load varies
from session to session, there is al
ways adequate time for travel and
making friends in the town.
A "French Family"
Through the French Administra
tion, Stanford has built up excellent
ties with the community. Parties with
French students are held regularly.
Each student has a French conversa
tion partner and a "French family."
Most French students study En
glish in the lycec and enjoy an inter
change with American students.
French friendships and acquaintances
with families depend on the individ
ual student's desire to meet the people
and speak the language.

Some students are completely as
similated into the French student
community, while others remain aloof.
Stanford students quickly learn that
the best way to learn the language
is to speak it. The French people in
Tours are sympathique toward those
who are learning their language, but
the student has to put aside his fears
of destroying the language by open
ing his mouth.
Getting to l'aris
There is much to see in the sur
rounding area. Tours' location makes
weekend trips quite easy.
Getting to Paris is an adventure in
itself. The trip takes about three
hours by car or train. Many students
prefer to hitch-hike in good weather.
It is an excellent opportunity for spir
ited discussions on topics which range
from last year's wine crop to General
DeGaulle to Vietnam.
Frenchmen rarely pick up French
hitch hikers, but American students
they find intriguing. While not for
bidding students to hitch-hike, the
University does not encourage it.
Wine Fairs
The Loire Valley is chateau coun
try. The chateaux were summer
palaces of French nobility. Wine
fairs, which take place in the winter
and spring are also attractions not to
be missed.
It is possible to travel to London
or Spain over a weekend, although
it is desirable to save longer trips
for the three week break between
quarters.
Field trips are planned well in ad
vance and are designed bo show a
student more than he could possibly
see on his own. Local guides are gen
erally not professionals; in most in
stances they are friends of Stanford
and show students more than the
"tourist spots." Ample free time is
allowed for personal interests.
French Bread!
French cuisine is not what most
students expect. Stanford students
cat the same food as the average
French student, since the menu is
the same as that of the Resaurant
Universitaire.
Most students cannot get over the
fact that the French always use
French dressing on their salads and
eat French bread at all three meals.
Frenchmen cat more bread to make
up for a smaller proportion of meat
in their diet.

usually chosen to take advantage of
the French environment, and tend to
focus on French contribution in the
particular field of study.
Sustained Contact
The faculty members take their
meals with the students and students
have a unique opportunity in their
Stanford career for sustained person
al contact with their teachers.
French is taught by local teachers.
Most of the French instructors teach
on the lycec level, though it is not
unusual to have a professor from the
University of Poitier.
According to his language ability,
each student is placed in one of the
five French groups. Recent changes
in the format of the courses have
been made to provide a greater con
tinuity with the curriculum of the
French Department on Quad.
More Progress
Generally students in the lower
group make the most progress over
the six month period, although stu
dents in the upper groups are able
to take greater advantage of many
cultural offerings due to their prior
skill in the language.
A two unit course in French Civil
ization is taught by guest lecturers.
At times the course lacks continuity.
Lectures in French arc the rule dur
ing the second quarter, however even
the students in the lowest French
groups are generally able to adapt
to this.
Although the academic load varies
from session to session, there is al
ways adequate time for travel and
making friends in the town.
A "French Family"
Through the French Administra
tion, Stanford has built up excellent
ties with the community. Parties with
French students are held regularly.
Each student has a French conversa
tion partner and a "French family."
Most French students study En
glish in the lycec and enjoy an inter
change with American students.
French friendships and acquaintances
with families depend on the individ
ual student's desire to meet the people
and speak the language.

Some students are completely as
similated into the French student
community, while others remain aloof.
Stanford students quickly learn that
the best way to learn the language
is to speak it. The French people in
Tours are sympathique toward those
who are learning their language, but
the student has to put aside his fears
of destroying the language by open
ing his mouth.
Getting to l'aris
There is much to see in the sur
rounding area. Tours' location makes
weekend trips quite easy.
Getting to Paris is an adventure in
itself. The trip takes about three
hours by car or train. Many students
prefer to hitch-hike in good weather.
It is an excellent opportunity for spir
ited discussions on topics which range
from last year's wine crop to General
DeGaulle to Vietnam.
Frenchmen rarely pick up French
hitch hikers, but American students
they find intriguing. While not for
bidding students to hitch-hike, the
University does not encourage it.
Wine Fairs
The Loire Valley is chateau coun
try. The chateaux were summer
palaces of French nobility. Wine
fairs, which take place in the winter
and spring are also attractions not to
be missed.
It is possible to travel to London
or Spain over a weekend, although
it is desirable to save longer trips
for the three week break between
quarters.
Field trips are planned well in ad
vance and are designed bo show a
student more than he could possibly
see on his own. Local guides are gen
erally not professionals; in most in
stances they are friends of Stanford
and show students more than the
"tourist spots." Ample free time is
allowed for personal interests.
French Bread!
French cuisine is not what most
students expect. Stanford students
cat the same food as the average
French student, since the menu is
the same as that of the Resaurant
Universitaire.
Most students cannot get over the
fact that the French always use
French dressing on their salads and
eat French bread at all three meals.
Frenchmen cat more bread to make
up for a smaller proportion of meat
in their diet.
The Stanford-in-France campus is
located in Tours, about 200 kilometers
southwest of Paris. Tours is Iho cen
ter of the Loire Valley, famous for
its chateaux and its fine wines.
In some respects Tours is not a
typical French town. Much of the
town was destroyed during the Sec
ond World War. The town is more
modern, both in appearance and spir
it, than other parts of the nation.
The Stanford Center is situated on
Place Anatole France facing the Loire
River. The heart of town is just a
five minute walk along the Rue Na
tional, the main street of Tours.
Consideration
All activities are conducted under
one roof in a building leased to Stan
ford by the French Ministry of Edu
cation. The Center has its own libraiy
which also serves as a lecture room.
Quarters and classroom space are
smaller than sutdents are used to,
and a good degree of consideration is
required of all students for life to
function smoothly at the Center.
Stanford-in-France is affiliated wilh
the University of Poitier and Stanford

students have all the privileges of
their French counterparts.
Language and the study of French
culture are the principle goals of the
academic program. Two professors
from Stanford in California accom
pany each group. Their courses are
usually chosen to take advantage of
the French environment, and tend to
focus on French contribution in the

making friends in the town.
A "French Family"
Through the French Administra
tion, Stanford has built up excellent
ties with the community. Parties with
French students are held regularly.
Each student has a French conversa
tion partner and a "French family."
Most French students study En
glish in the lycec and enjoy an inter
change with American students.
French friendships and acquaintances
with families depend on the individ
ual student's desire to meet the people
and speak the language.

Some students are completely as
similated into the French student
community, while others remain aloof.
Stanford students quickly learn that
the best way to learn the language
is to speak it. The French people in
Tours are sympathique toward those
who are learning their language, but
the student has to put aside his fears
of destroying the language by open
ing his mouth.
Getting to l'aris
There is much to see in the sur
rounding area. Tours' location makes
weekend trips quite easy.
Getting to Paris is an adventure in
itself. The trip takes about three
hours by car or train. Many students
prefer to hitch-hike in good weather.
It is an excellent opportunity for spir
ited discussions on topics which range
from last year's wine crop to General
DeGaulle to Vietnam.
Frenchmen rarely pick up French
hitch hikers, but American students
they find intriguing. While not for
bidding students to hitch-hike, the
University does not encourage it.
Wine Fairs
The Loire Valley is chateau coun
try. The chateaux were summer
palaces of French nobility. Wine
fairs, which take place in the winter
and spring are also attractions not to
be missed.
It is possible to travel to London
or Spain over a weekend, although
it is desirable to save longer trips
for the three week break between
quarters.
Field trips are planned well in ad
vance and are designed bo show a
student more than he could possibly
see on his own. Local guides are gen
erally not professionals; in most in
stances they are friends of Stanford
and show students more than the
"tourist spots." Ample free time is
allowed for personal interests.
French Bread!
French cuisine is not what most
students expect. Stanford students
cat the same food as the average
French student, since the menu is
the same as that of the Resaurant
Universitaire.
Most students cannot get over the
fact that the French always use
French dressing on their salads and
eat French bread at all three meals.
Frenchmen cat more bread to make
up for a smaller proportion of meat
in their diet.
The Stanford-in-France campus is
located in Tours, about 200 kilometers
southwest of Paris. Tours is Iho cen
ter of the Loire Valley, famous for
its chateaux and its fine wines.
In some respects Tours is not a
typical French town. Much of the
town was destroyed during the Sec
ond World War. The town is more
modern, both in appearance and spir
it, than other parts of the nation.
The Stanford Center is situated on
Place Anatole France facing the Loire
River. The heart of town is just a
five minute walk along the Rue Na
tional, the main street of Tours.
Consideration
All activities are conducted under
one roof in a building leased to Stan
ford by the French Ministry of Edu
cation. The Center has its own libraiy
which also serves as a lecture room.
Quarters and classroom space are
smaller than sutdents are used to,
and a good degree of consideration is
required of all students for life to
function smoothly at the Center.
Stanford-in-France is affiliated wilh
the University of Poitier and Stanford

students have all the privileges of
their French counterparts.
Language and the study of French
culture are the principle goals of the
academic program. Two professors
from Stanford in California accom
pany each group. Their courses are
usually chosen to take advantage of
the French environment, and tend to
focus on French contribution in the
particular field of study.
Sustained Contact
The faculty members take their
meals with the students and students
have a unique opportunity in their
Stanford career for sustained person
al contact with their teachers.
French is taught by local teachers.
Most of the French instructors teach
on the lycec level, though it is not
unusual to have a professor from the
University of Poitier.
According to his language ability,
each student is placed in one of the
five French groups. Recent changes
in the format of the courses have
been made to provide a greater con
tinuity with the curriculum of the
French Department on Quad.
More Progress
Generally students in the lower
group make the most progress over
the six month period, although stu
dents in the upper groups are able
to take greater advantage of many
cultural offerings due to their prior
skill in the language.
A two unit course in French Civil
ization is taught by guest lecturers.
At times the course lacks continuity.
Lectures in French arc the rule dur
ing the second quarter, however even
the students in the lowest French
groups are generally able to adapt
to this.
Although the academic load varies
from session to session, there is al
ways adequate time for travel and
making friends in the town.
