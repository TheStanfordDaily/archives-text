# Florence Reflects Shortcomings, Successes Of Overseas Program
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL ITALY IX Associate Editor 
Stanford's campus in Florence is
perhaps the ideal installation of the
five in its implementation of the pro
gram's philosophy, showing best its
strengths and superficialities, its in
tricate planning and annoying pro*
tectiveness.
The physical location is certainly
the best. Villa San Paolo is twenty
minutus walk from some of the
world's great art and Florence itself
is assuredly one of the most exciting
and richest cities of the world.
And the campus in the Renaissance
City certainly exemplifies the balance
in emphasis sought by the program's
directors. For Florence is situated

such that, with a little initiative, the
student may feel he knows Florence
as well or better than his home town,
has a feeling for Italy as a second
homeland, and a nodding acquaint
ance with Europe as a whole.
Balance
presses this striving for a balance be
tween being in Europe and maintain
ing educational continuity with the
United States. As a result, two and
a half of the four courses are taught
in English and have only partial rel
evance to the location in which they
are being taught (although the recent
initiation of a regular art history
course one quarter for each group is
a large step forward).
And most of a student's time is
spent with other Americans. The Villa

itself is slightly isolated from the city
itself, being located closer to olive
orchards than Fra Angeliee frescoes.
Thus a conscious effort must be made
just to "get out of the Villa" to the
"centro."
The three-day weekends seem
unique in overseas study programs.
Besides being another element of bal
ance, weekend trips are cleverly de
signed to reinforce and be reinforced
by the short-week's study. The Pope's
captivity seems to come alive when
one sees for himself Ca.stel San An
gelo; reading of a rather long and
detailed history of renaissance Italy
becomes easier when one has stood at
tiie place of the Paz/.i conspiracy.
Discipline
Discipline is necessarily introduced
into the system; one must study 'if
at all) during (tie week, but also the
weekend must be used to the fullest
before returning to captivity for four
days.
The program is definitely geared to
the mass, to the average student not
able or courageous enough to go it on
his own as with the traditional junior
year abroad. And who is to say that
with only one exposure to Europe, a
person shouldn't get an overall, but
necessarily superficial, understanding
of a large area rather than a compre
hensive knowledge of a more limited
field?
In its strengths also lie the pro
gram's greatest deficiencies. The na
ture of a mass program necessitates
its appeal on a lowest common de
nominator basis. Many more people
can go because the language require
ment is small; and many more apply
than would fur the normal program
because they know they will be living
with other Americans. But as a result,
students are isolated and most have
little contact with Italians.
Initiative Dulled
Perhaps the most unfortunate as
pect of the program is its affects on
the student who wants to define for
himself "the European experience."
For all other aspects of the program
seem to be conspiring against this:
tiie combination of rules, paternalis
tically designed to restrict and pro
tect the immature American abroad
and the name of the University at
home; the "rigorous" academic load,
designed to protect tiie reputation of
tlie program as not "Mickey Mouse";
tiie Villa, variously described as a
ghetto and as a congenial coed living
environment.
Most students admit they come
home changed, although they can't
verbalize why they went. They seem
to need the direction and definition of

tiie "European experience" conveni
ently provided by the directors of the
program. But how much better would
the program be as a junior-year
abrout program rather than sopho
more?
The administration seems to see the
greatest value in applying to two
years of Stanford education the super
abroad program rather than sopho
ficial and rather fragmented insights
gathered during six months study
overseas in the sophomore year.
Here or There?
But many students regret the em
phasis on the effects back home of
the experience in Europe as being
more important than the value of the
experience in Europe itself. It would
seem that the additional year of ma
turity were the program a junior
year-abroad program would enable a
greater number of students to define
for themselves "the European expe
rience."

for themselves "the European expe
rience."
"Program" is perhaps the best word
to describe the current situation; tiie
students' experience is just that:
programmed.
Stanford's campus in Florence is
perhaps the ideal installation of the
five in its implementation of the pro
gram's philosophy, showing best its
strengths and superficialities, its in
tricate planning and annoying pro*
tectiveness.
The physical location is certainly
the best. Villa San Paolo is twenty
minutus walk from some of the
world's great art and Florence itself
is assuredly one of the most exciting
and richest cities of the world.
And the campus in the Renaissance
City certainly exemplifies the balance
in emphasis sought by the program's
directors. For Florence is situated

such that, with a little initiative, the
student may feel he knows Florence
as well or better than his home town,
has a feeling for Italy as a second
homeland, and a nodding acquaint
ance with Europe as a whole.
Balance
presses this striving for a balance be
tween being in Europe and maintain
ing educational continuity with the
United States. As a result, two and
a half of the four courses are taught
in English and have only partial rel
evance to the location in which they
are being taught (although the recent
initiation of a regular art history
course one quarter for each group is
a large step forward).
And most of a student's time is
spent with other Americans. The Villa

itself is slightly isolated from the city
itself, being located closer to olive
orchards than Fra Angeliee frescoes.
Thus a conscious effort must be made
just to "get out of the Villa" to the
"centro."
The three-day weekends seem
unique in overseas study programs.
Besides being another element of bal
ance, weekend trips are cleverly de
signed to reinforce and be reinforced
by the short-week's study. The Pope's
captivity seems to come alive when
one sees for himself Ca.stel San An
gelo; reading of a rather long and
detailed history of renaissance Italy
becomes easier when one has stood at
tiie place of the Paz/.i conspiracy.
Discipline
Discipline is necessarily introduced
into the system; one must study 'if
at all) during (tie week, but also the
weekend must be used to the fullest
before returning to captivity for four
days.
The program is definitely geared to
the mass, to the average student not
able or courageous enough to go it on
his own as with the traditional junior
year abroad. And who is to say that
with only one exposure to Europe, a
person shouldn't get an overall, but
necessarily superficial, understanding
of a large area rather than a compre
hensive knowledge of a more limited
field?
In its strengths also lie the pro
gram's greatest deficiencies. The na
ture of a mass program necessitates
its appeal on a lowest common de
nominator basis. Many more people
can go because the language require
ment is small; and many more apply
than would fur the normal program
because they know they will be living
with other Americans. But as a result,
students are isolated and most have
little contact with Italians.
Initiative Dulled
Perhaps the most unfortunate as
pect of the program is its affects on
the student who wants to define for
himself "the European experience."
For all other aspects of the program
seem to be conspiring against this:
tiie combination of rules, paternalis
tically designed to restrict and pro
tect the immature American abroad
and the name of the University at
home; the "rigorous" academic load,
designed to protect tiie reputation of
tlie program as not "Mickey Mouse";
tiie Villa, variously described as a
ghetto and as a congenial coed living
environment.
Most students admit they come
home changed, although they can't
verbalize why they went. They seem
to need the direction and definition of

tiie "European experience" conveni
ently provided by the directors of the
program. But how much better would
the program be as a junior-year
abrout program rather than sopho
more?
The administration seems to see the
greatest value in applying to two
years of Stanford education the super
abroad program rather than sopho
ficial and rather fragmented insights
gathered during six months study
overseas in the sophomore year.
Here or There?
But many students regret the em
phasis on the effects back home of
the experience in Europe as being
more important than the value of the
experience in Europe itself. It would
seem that the additional year of ma
turity were the program a junior
year-abroad program would enable a

seem that the additional year of ma
turity were the program a junior
year-abroad program would enable a
greater number of students to define
for themselves "the European expe
rience."
"Program" is perhaps the best word
to describe the current situation; tiie
students' experience is just that:
programmed.
Stanford's campus in Florence is
perhaps the ideal installation of the
five in its implementation of the pro
gram's philosophy, showing best its
strengths and superficialities, its in
tricate planning and annoying pro*
tectiveness.
The physical location is certainly
the best. Villa San Paolo is twenty
minutus walk from some of the
world's great art and Florence itself
is assuredly one of the most exciting
and richest cities of the world.
And the campus in the Renaissance
City certainly exemplifies the balance
in emphasis sought by the program's
directors. For Florence is situated

such that, with a little initiative, the
student may feel he knows Florence
as well or better than his home town,
has a feeling for Italy as a second
homeland, and a nodding acquaint
ance with Europe as a whole.
Balance
presses this striving for a balance be
tween being in Europe and maintain
ing educational continuity with the
United States. As a result, two and
a half of the four courses are taught
in English and have only partial rel
evance to the location in which they
are being taught (although the recent
initiation of a regular art history
course one quarter for each group is
a large step forward).
And most of a student's time is
spent with other Americans. The Villa

itself is slightly isolated from the city
itself, being located closer to olive
orchards than Fra Angeliee frescoes.
Thus a conscious effort must be made
just to "get out of the Villa" to the
"centro."
The three-day weekends seem
unique in overseas study programs.
Besides being another element of bal
ance, weekend trips are cleverly de
signed to reinforce and be reinforced
by the short-week's study. The Pope's
captivity seems to come alive when
one sees for himself Ca.stel San An
gelo; reading of a rather long and
detailed history of renaissance Italy
becomes easier when one has stood at
tiie place of the Paz/.i conspiracy.
Discipline
Discipline is necessarily introduced
into the system; one must study 'if
at all) during (tie week, but also the
weekend must be used to the fullest
before returning to captivity for four
days.
The program is definitely geared to
the mass, to the average student not
able or courageous enough to go it on
his own as with the traditional junior
year abroad. And who is to say that
with only one exposure to Europe, a
person shouldn't get an overall, but
necessarily superficial, understanding
of a large area rather than a compre
hensive knowledge of a more limited
field?
In its strengths also lie the pro
gram's greatest deficiencies. The na
ture of a mass program necessitates
its appeal on a lowest common de
nominator basis. Many more people
can go because the language require
ment is small; and many more apply
than would fur the normal program
because they know they will be living
with other Americans. But as a result,
students are isolated and most have
little contact with Italians.
Initiative Dulled
Perhaps the most unfortunate as
pect of the program is its affects on
the student who wants to define for
himself "the European experience."
For all other aspects of the program
seem to be conspiring against this:
tiie combination of rules, paternalis
tically designed to restrict and pro
tect the immature American abroad
and the name of the University at
home; the "rigorous" academic load,
designed to protect tiie reputation of
tlie program as not "Mickey Mouse";
tiie Villa, variously described as a
ghetto and as a congenial coed living
environment.
Most students admit they come
home changed, although they can't
verbalize why they went. They seem
to need the direction and definition of

tiie "European experience" conveni
ently provided by the directors of the
program. But how much better would
the program be as a junior-year
abrout program rather than sopho
more?
The administration seems to see the
greatest value in applying to two
years of Stanford education the super
abroad program rather than sopho
ficial and rather fragmented insights
gathered during six months study
overseas in the sophomore year.
Here or There?
But many students regret the em
phasis on the effects back home of
the experience in Europe as being
more important than the value of the
experience in Europe itself. It would
seem that the additional year of ma
turity were the program a junior
year-abroad program would enable a
greater number of students to define
for themselves "the European expe
rience."
"Program" is perhaps the best word
to describe the current situation; tiie
students' experience is just that:
