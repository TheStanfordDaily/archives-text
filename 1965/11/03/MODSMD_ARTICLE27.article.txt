# Stanford Italian Style: Viva 'La Dolce Vita'
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Italy VIII Editor 
Villa San Paolo in Florence, Italy, is
somewhat different than the other
two established overseas campi in
Tours and Beutelsbaeh.
It is large enough to comfortably
house the entire campus with a bar
and a garden terrace overlooking the
city thrown in. The food is excellent
and plentiful, and if for some reason
one isn't satisfied with a serving of
pasta big enough to satiate Chef Boy
ar-dee himself, the maids have been
known to sneak seconds; indeed, din
ing at tlie Villa becomes a hedonistic
art form in itself. One learns to eat
two meals a day of pasta, meat and
vegetables and desert without lament
ing the loss of two full hours time.
Perhaps it's the wine one can order;
perhaps it is the company of 79 di
versely-oriented Stanford students; or
perhaps it is tlie languid approach to
life that typifies much that is Italian.
Moreover, the Villa is located within
walking distance of Michelangelo's
Tomb of the Medici, Masaccio's
"Adam and P've Expelled From the
Garden of Eden" and the square
where Savonarola was hung and
burned. It is so physically integrated
with the life of this major Italian
metropolis that the sounds of omni
present motorscooters and other city
noises often penetrate the high wall
that separates the Villa from its
environs.
And here Is where the paradox lies.
For the Villa, though physically closer

to more "natives" than either the
French of German campi, is in reality
further removed. The Florentines
have seen and dealt with so many
foreigners that a certain reserve has
naturally come to fore. If one speaks
Italian fluently, the problem is of
course ameliorated. But Italian is not
a language common to high schools
and the meager two-quarter prepara
tion at the home campus though an
improvement over the old system with
its one-quarter minimum requirement
— makes a really meaningful discus
sion almost impossible.
Euphemistic Contention
Moreover, the euphemistic conten
tion that Stanford-in-Italy has an at
mosphere "similar in many ways to
tiie small English college" has little
to do with the academic wasteland
that nearly always typifies overseas
campi, especially t be Villa where only
the most naive professor would ex
pect his charges to book in the library
instead of drink and think in the gar
den.
Thus the vaunted "European ex
perience" in Italy has relatively little
to do with immersion —socially or
academically in an alien culture.
Yet if one wishes to learn toleration
and even respect for 79 fellow Stan
forctttes of varying interests and per
suasions, tt) spend weekends hitchhik
ing about the country (although this
worthwhile endeavor, like motor
cycling, is frowned upon by the ad
ministration) or just to sit in the gar
den and think, then Villa San Paolo is
an ideal place to live for six months.
