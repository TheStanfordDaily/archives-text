# GERMAN TIES ENCOURAGED
## The 						Pastoral Burg Life 
### MARY KAY BECKER GERMANY XI 
Stanford-in-Germany, ihe Burg: the
oldest and most "vorhanglich" of the
foreign campuses.
Physical plant: adequate. The size
of the rooms inspire one to be else
where as much as possible. An out
standing feature is the basement
"Ratskeller," containing beer, wine,
professors and sometimes German
boys.
Geographical location: very central.
Two hours by train from Munich; 48
hours from Athens.
Faculty, staff, programs: all vari
able. The long field trips (there is
always one to Berlin) should leave a
lasting impression, and the short ones
art 1 not unforgettable.
Cultural opportunities: Europe is
known to have these.
Food: "Kuchen" and tea at -1 in the
afternoon supports further existence.
Academics tend to fade into the
background on the Burg. Despite the
careful emphasis on maintaining Stan
ford's curriculum requirements—tak
ing the full 15 units, not being able
to travel except on weekends, taking
courses which have little relation to

Europe—it's only a few people that
come over to fulfill their General
Studies requirements.
Germany is not perfect (none of t he
campuses could be). Being 19 km
from Stuttgart, which is not Ger
many's most cosmopolitan city, can
not be described as having abundant
cultural opportunity.
On the other hand, Beutelsbach is
small. The villagers know you are
there. And usually, they are glad you
are there.
Local Adoption
"Adoption of a Stanford student
by a German family is a longstand
ing practice in Beutelsbach, Enders
liach, and other surrounding towns.
The possibilities for meeting families
come at many times. The Beutelsbach
Fest soon after arrival, hitchhiking,
talking to other students or simply
wandering around in the village may
help to establish contact.
In addition, the Burg office keeps
a list of interested families. Anyone
who tries to get to meet some of the
local people usually has no trouble
doing so.
One wonders sometimes if, after
XVI or XVII groups, the Stanford stu

dents will ever begin to wear out
their welcome.
Some of the families have been tak
ing in students since Group I, often
four or live per group. They are used
to informal American manners, used
to dealing with two-quarter German,
and used to letting the invaders from
the Burg melt into their daily routine.
Worthwhile Troubles
For other families, who may be
trying this for Hie first time, having
students in can be somewhat of a
strain although in most cases, it
usually turns out to be mutually
worth whatever halting conversations
and misunderstandings develop at
first.
The atmosphere of a foreign cam
pus is attested to by the fact that
everyone is now striving, with all the
residential changes forthcoming, to
recreate this atmosphere in Stanford
ill-California.
Being part of a cohesive Stanford
student group can be the most mem
orable part of ihe overseas exper
ience. Or, for those with a real desire
to live European, it can be most in
hibiting.

Local Adoption
"Adoption of a Stanford student
by a German family is a longstand
ing practice in Beutelsbach, Enders
liach, and other surrounding towns.
The possibilities for meeting families
come at many times. The Beutelsbach
Fest soon after arrival, hitchhiking,
talking to other students or simply
wandering around in the village may
help to establish contact.
In addition, the Burg office keeps
a list of interested families. Anyone
who tries to get to meet some of the
local people usually has no trouble
doing so.
One wonders sometimes if, after
XVI or XVII groups, the Stanford stu

dents will ever begin to wear out
their welcome.
Some of the families have been tak
ing in students since Group I, often
four or live per group. They are used
to informal American manners, used
to dealing with two-quarter German,
and used to letting the invaders from
the Burg melt into their daily routine.
Worthwhile Troubles
For other families, who may be
trying this for Hie first time, having
students in can be somewhat of a
strain although in most cases, it
usually turns out to be mutually
worth whatever halting conversations
and misunderstandings develop at
first.
The atmosphere of a foreign cam
pus is attested to by the fact that
everyone is now striving, with all the
residential changes forthcoming, to
recreate this atmosphere in Stanford
ill-California.
Being part of a cohesive Stanford
student group can be the most mem
orable part of ihe overseas exper
ience. Or, for those with a real desire
to live European, it can be most in
hibiting.
Stanford-in-Germany, ihe Burg: the
oldest and most "vorhanglich" of the
foreign campuses.
Physical plant: adequate. The size
of the rooms inspire one to be else
where as much as possible. An out
standing feature is the basement
"Ratskeller," containing beer, wine,
professors and sometimes German
boys.
Geographical location: very central.
Two hours by train from Munich; 48
hours from Athens.
Faculty, staff, programs: all vari
able. The long field trips (there is
always one to Berlin) should leave a
lasting impression, and the short ones
art 1 not unforgettable.
Cultural opportunities: Europe is
known to have these.
Food: "Kuchen" and tea at -1 in the
afternoon supports further existence.
Academics tend to fade into the
background on the Burg. Despite the
careful emphasis on maintaining Stan
ford's curriculum requirements—tak
ing the full 15 units, not being able
to travel except on weekends, taking
courses which have little relation to

Europe—it's only a few people that
come over to fulfill their General
Studies requirements.
Germany is not perfect (none of t he
campuses could be). Being 19 km
