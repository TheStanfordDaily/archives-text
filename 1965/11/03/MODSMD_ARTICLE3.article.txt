# Blood Drives Vie For Donors
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER DICK LIVINGSTON 
Blood drives representing two op
posing views on the Vietnam war
opened yesterday in White Plaza and
will continue through the end of this
week.
Sporadic heckling and intermittent
applause marked a noon rally spon
sored yesterday by the Medical Aid
Committee for Vietnam. The commit
tee is a group of 20 Stanford students
who plan to send blood pledges and
money to aid civilian victims of U.S.
bombings.
Anot h"r View
Opposing the Medical Aid Commit
tee is the Walter Army Society, an

ROTC organization, which is solicit
ing blood donors for U.S. and South
Vietnamese troops. The Society is
supported by at least, six other cam
pus groups, including CONSCIENCE,
a bi-partisan national association be
gun at Stanford and supporting U.S.
action in Vietnam.
At yesterday's rally neither group
actually collected blood, but more
than lf>o pledges were given to the
Army Society. The Medical Aid Com
mittee received slightly under 1<»
pledges of blood as well as some fi
nancial support.
The Medical Aid rally attracted
more than 500 by-standers and fea
tured speeches by Bruce Franklin, as

sistant professor of English, and
Christian Bay, lecturer in political
science. The speakers were interrupt
ed frequently by catcalls from a gen
erally critical audience.
Too Much Noise
Several attempts were made by un
friendly students to turn down blar
ring amplifiers during the speeches.
One graduate student in mechanical
engineering said the noise was inter
fering with his studies, and he said
lie planned to take his complaint to
the University.
Other students hurled balls of
paper at the speakers who opposed
U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
"What makes you think these sup

plies are going to civilians?" one stu
dent screamed. Other bystanders
yelled out charges of Communism
and draft-dodging.
ItiU'lit Of Discussion
The speakers emphasized the right
of open discussion in a free society
and continued their talks.
Stuart Mcßae, co-chairman of the
Medical Aid Committee, portrayed the
United States as the aggressor in
Vietnam. "Our policy is against the
Vietnamese people themselves," Mc-
Rae said. He noted that officials admit
"we will have to kill at least two Viet*
namese for each Viet Cong to win the
war."
Prof. Franklin, said it is insane to

believe that a person who is a Com
munist is no longer a human being.
The worst tragedy if the administra
tion position, he said, is that "they de
mand that the American people com
pletely support their policy."
Not Interested in Negotiating
Prof. Bay accused the mass media
ol" misreporting the war. He added
that the U.S. is not interested in nego
tiations on Vietnam. "If elections
were held," Bay said, "our govern
ment knows that the Viet Cong would
win." He called for complete with
drawal of U.S. troops.
The Medical Aid Committee, in leal
lets passed out at th«> rally, said medi
cal supplies were needed for "the or
dinary people of Vietnam who suffer
most" from the war.
A committee spokesman said the
group plans to work through the In
ternational Red Cross. (IRCi, al
though he said details for processing
and shipping the blood were not yet
known.
To Kt'd Cross
The IRC has written the committer
saying that supplies for North Viet
nam are turned over to the Viet
namese Red Cross in Hanoi. No guar
antees that supplies would go to civil
ians only were offered by the IRC.
Walter Army Society was joined l>\
six other student organizations in its
blood drive supporting the American
commitment- in Vietnam.
The drive was announced shortly
after U.S. Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara expressed his "deepest ap
preciation to the thousands of stu
dents and other groups across the
country who have volunteered to do
natc blood as a gesture of support
for our servicemen fighting in Viet
nam."
Other Groups
Groups participating in the drive
include the navy Quarterdeck Society,
Arnold Air Society. Vietnam Defense
Committee, Association of the U.S.
Army, Vietnam Defense Council, and
CONSCIENCE.
In a mimeographed paper soliciting
blood for American and South Viet
namese military casualties, the Waltei
Army Society said:
"We may not all agree on all
aspects of the United States involve
ment in South Vietnam, but we do all
emphatically agree as to the urgent
necessity of the basic United States
action in this area."
