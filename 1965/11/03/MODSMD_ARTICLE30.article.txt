# Official Overseas Often Encourage

### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Daily Editor Volume 146 
With the spectacular success and
rapid expansion of the Stanford over
seas campuses program, a formidable
body of myth has grown up in the
past few years about what actually
happens (educationally speaking) at
these Old World outposts.
Most of the myths derive directly
from the substantial volume of ex
pensive booklets and bulletins (read:
propaganda) which pours forth year
ly from the modest Stanford-abroad
office on Inner Quad. This peculiar
literature (as is the rule with Stan
ford PR material) tends naturally to
create an image of the program cal
culated ti) please the folks back home,
including the aspiring cosmopolites
populating the freshmen dorms. It
does so by presenting as reality what
are actually the goals and dreams of
the originators of the program. Not
surprisingly these images are often
misleading if not outright false.
Lights Still Burn
Take, for example, the myth of the
"rigorous academic program." The
latest edition of the general informa
tion bulletin on the overseas cam
puses one again trots out the con
venient absurdity that "the entire
program overseas is kept at an aca
demic standard fully equal to that at
the home campus . . . Study lights
burn .just as steadily overseas as they
do at home."
As if to balance one myth with
another, the booklet creates a second
image, one of unlimited weekend trav -
el including trips which astound na
tive professors both by the distances
covered and by the points of interest
included. By some miracle of sched
uling, students also find time for un
limited "mingling" with nearby resi
dents: they help bring in the grape
harvest, participate in folk-dancing
groups, attend innumerable operas

and symphonies, and generally drink
deeply at the springs of local culture.
As might be expected, the truth is
lost somewhere between the two myth
ical ideals. Time for travel, for getting
to know local families, and for taking
advantage of the education offered
without credit- by the cultural differ
ences of an overseas setting cannot be
provided without considerable curtail
ment of the academic load. (Some pro
fessors, reluctant to yield, have been
reprimanded by the home office.) On
the other hand, to carry on some kind
of course of studies requires that at
least a few of those idyllic weekends
be spent in the library.
Conflicting' Goals
This example of competing myths
demonstrates a fundamental fact of
the Stanford overseas program: that
it is a shakey ( but successful i compro
mise between a multitude of contra
dictory antl conflicting goals. It seeks
lo educate the student in the ways of
a particular country while requiring
him nevertheless to spend most of his
time with fellow Americans and to
continue a "normal" course load; ii
seeks to provide him with enough lan
guage to accomplish ''immersion" in
a foreign culture, while at the same
lime keeping the language require
ment low enough so that it does not
bar from the program those with only
secondary or minimal language inter
est; it seeks to give the student "in
timate knowledge" of a country while
keeping the time spent abroad short
enough to fit all academic schedules.
In short, the Stanford program
seeks at the same time both brevity
and completeness. It seeks to extend
to the masses (now over half the en
tire undergraduate student body) the
kind of deep educational experience
previously available only to the more
demanding (and often more able) few.
To do so requires some sacrifice in
excellence.

tion bulletin on the overseas cam
puses one again trots out the con
venient absurdity that "the entire
program overseas is kept at an aca
demic standard fully equal to that at
the home campus . . . Study lights
burn .just as steadily overseas as they
do at home."
As if to balance one myth with
another, the booklet creates a second
image, one of unlimited weekend trav -
el including trips which astound na
tive professors both by the distances
covered and by the points of interest
included. By some miracle of sched
uling, students also find time for un
limited "mingling" with nearby resi
dents: they help bring in the grape
harvest, participate in folk-dancing
groups, attend innumerable operas

and symphonies, and generally drink
deeply at the springs of local culture.
As might be expected, the truth is
lost somewhere between the two myth
ical ideals. Time for travel, for getting
to know local families, and for taking
advantage of the education offered
without credit- by the cultural differ
ences of an overseas setting cannot be
provided without considerable curtail
ment of the academic load. (Some pro
fessors, reluctant to yield, have been
reprimanded by the home office.) On
the other hand, to carry on some kind
of course of studies requires that at
least a few of those idyllic weekends
be spent in the library.
Conflicting' Goals
This example of competing myths
demonstrates a fundamental fact of
the Stanford overseas program: that
it is a shakey ( but successful i compro
mise between a multitude of contra
dictory antl conflicting goals. It seeks
lo educate the student in the ways of
a particular country while requiring
him nevertheless to spend most of his
time with fellow Americans and to
continue a "normal" course load; ii
seeks to provide him with enough lan
guage to accomplish ''immersion" in
a foreign culture, while at the same
lime keeping the language require
ment low enough so that it does not
bar from the program those with only
secondary or minimal language inter
est; it seeks to give the student "in
timate knowledge" of a country while
keeping the time spent abroad short
enough to fit all academic schedules.
In short, the Stanford program
seeks at the same time both brevity
and completeness. It seeks to extend
to the masses (now over half the en
tire undergraduate student body) the
kind of deep educational experience
previously available only to the more
demanding (and often more able) few.
To do so requires some sacrifice in
excellence.
With the spectacular success and
rapid expansion of the Stanford over
seas campuses program, a formidable
body of myth has grown up in the
past few years about what actually
happens (educationally speaking) at
these Old World outposts.
Most of the myths derive directly
from the substantial volume of ex
pensive booklets and bulletins (read:
propaganda) which pours forth year
ly from the modest Stanford-abroad
office on Inner Quad. This peculiar
literature (as is the rule with Stan
ford PR material) tends naturally to
create an image of the program cal
culated ti) please the folks back home,
including the aspiring cosmopolites
populating the freshmen dorms. It
does so by presenting as reality what
are actually the goals and dreams of
the originators of the program. Not
surprisingly these images are often
misleading if not outright false.
Lights Still Burn
Take, for example, the myth of the
"rigorous academic program." The
