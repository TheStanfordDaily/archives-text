It is remarkable and commendable
thai the program largely has suc
ceeded in finding a happy median be
tween quantity and quality, but it has
noi done so without disappointing
many students who were led, by one
myth or another to expect more than
they received from their "overseas
experience." Most of the criticism of
the program has come from just such
discontents.
Some, expecting to gain the lan
guage proficiency of a Junior Year

Abroad, have been disappointed when
they returned to the United States
without complete fluency. Others have
felt tied down by their groups and
partially isolated from the culture to
tlie point that the six months hardly
seemed worthwhile. In the future still
others may be misled by the vacation
land appearances of the Austrian and
British campusos only to receive the
dull shock of being forced to spend
part of their skiing time over the
books.
Majority Satisfied
Despite these inevitable disappoint
ments, the phenomenal success of the
program has been confirmed by the
overwhelming majority of students,
who return manifestly satisfied with
their experience. Few have good cause
to complain except that they them
selves failed to take fullest advantage
of the opportunities they were given
and thus to excel to the limits of their
ability.
As for the myths nurtured back
home by the Stanford office, one can
only export them to continue. They
flo, like myths about liquor regula
tions and faculty-student ratios, serve
ihe useful function of "selling" the
program to parents and students.
Once the student is abroad it is up to
him to choose which myth he will
strive to fulfill.
