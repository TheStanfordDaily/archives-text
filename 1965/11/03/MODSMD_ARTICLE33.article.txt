# JV Eleven Trains For Future Glory

### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford's Junior Varsity foot
hall team has gone through the
years under the very dark
shadow of the Varsity and
Frosh, yet from the ranks of the
J.V.'s has come many an able
varsity ball player. The Junior
Varsity level is simply a step
ping off place for some athletes
on tlu i way to the higher grid
iron echelons.

The entire J.V. squad prac
tices along with the varsity,
learning the same plays, doing
the same drills, fighting for
varsity positions. But many of
the sophomore players lack ex
perience, maturity, or finesse
Because these players would not
ordinarily see any varsity action
at all, there are three games
scheduled for these athletes to
gain experience.

Most of the J.V. players also
suit-up for the varsity home
games. They often pet an oppor
tunity to play a couple of min
utes because of an injury or be
cause the game is a runaway.
Most of the Junior Varsity play
ers do not travel to the away
games with the regular varsity
squad. It is often on these week
ends of inactivity that they get
a chance to get much game ex
perience.
In the three game schedule
this year the Stanford J.V.'s did
show that they were capable
players. They were able to run
over their three opponents, San
Jose, San Francisco State, and
Moffett without much problem.
The San Jose game was the
most contested, but Stanford
overcame the Spartans in the
final quarter, 24-17.
In the 48-0 rout of the San
Francisco State J.V.'s fullback
Tom Elliott crossed the end /one
line numerous times. Quarter
back Don Cook mixed up
Elliott's runing prowess with
his own passing ability to ruin
SFS.
