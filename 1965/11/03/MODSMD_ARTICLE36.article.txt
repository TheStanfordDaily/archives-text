# Rush Committee For Policy Study
## 
### 
I liis year s de\ elopinent of a unified rush policy shows w hat
student cooperation can accomplish in settling a potentially com
plex issue. Most important, Stanford fraternities, eating clubs,
and independent houses have resolved tlieir areas of dispute
before deadline pressures again would force acceptance ol a
poork planned poliex satisfactorv to no one.
However, much still needs to be done both in implementing
this \ car's policy and in continuing the review of rush the
ad hoc committee began last spring. One provision of the
accepted polic\ is that a rush guide describing living choices
be prepared by a student-faculty editorial committee.
There undoubtedly will be mam problems for this editorial
committee in writing the rush guide. It will be extremely diffi
cult for a group of five or ten persons to agree on advantages
and disadvantages ol diverse living groups, and it will be even
more difficult to phrase the* findings in a way acceptable to all
concerned. That the editorial committee is selected by the living
group presidents as soon as possible is thus imperative, for less
than six weeks remain before the booklet is to be mailed to the
students' homes.
Living group presidents should also consider the ad hoe
committee s recommendation that a standing committee be estab
lished to consider more fundamental changes in rush than were
made this year. The committee pointed out that the "concept of
a final rushing policy is unrealistic,' and proposed a thorough
evaluation of rush. Comparison of Stanford's rush system with
methods of other universities would be beneficial, and it is lioped
that such an evaluational committee of students, faculty, and
university representatives begin its work immediately.
Perhaps the committee would decide that the present rush
system is the best one possible: perhaps it would discover a
vastly improved method. In any case, such a stucK would be
most worthwhile and is long overdue.
