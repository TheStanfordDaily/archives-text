## Controversy Over Medicare To Vietnam Factions Rages 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Everyday in Vietnam people
are killed, wounded, their homes
devastated by the weapons of
modern war. Intensive bombing
with steel fragmentation bombs,
napalm, and toxic chemicals
sprayed from the air have been
used on villages and the country
side, and have inevitably devas
tated the civilian population.
While this cruel war continues,
it is the ordinary people of Viet
nam who suffer most. Since 1957
over 300.000 have been killed and
100.000 injured or tortured. It is
these people living in the vil
lages who need your material
help.
There is a desperate need to
send medical supplies which will
help to save lives. Medical equip
ment and drugs of all kinds are
needed, especially antibiotics and
antiseptics. Even the simplest
equipment for first aid posts
such as forceps, scissors, nee
dles, and sutures are desperately
needed in addition to amputa
tion saws and blood plasma.
Money will buy these supplies
also.
In a relentless war help must
he administered by an effective
authority. Medical Aid Commit
tee will send all contributions to
the International Rod Cross,
which has already agreed to de
liver the aid to victims of the
war in North Vietnam and areas
of South Vietnam under NLF
control. This guarantees the
greatest possible efficiency.
There exist several American
programs which exclusively pro
vide airl for the population in
areas controlled by the Saigon
and American governments. The
Medical Aid Committee there
fore believes that the medical

needs of many of the civilian
victims of American bombing
have boon and are being ignored.
Thus, the Medical Aid Commit
tee is attempting to fill a moral
void in the American conscience.
By contributing to the Com
mittee the American people will
be able to render immediate re
lief to those who are innocently
suffering as a consequence of
American military action.

•Competitive Repulsion
Editor, The Daily:
We are repelled by the com
petition of the two groups seek
ing blood donations in White
Memorial Pla/.a today. To us
these groups seem to be subor
dinating humanitarian purposes
to their political viewpoints.
Their disagreement over which
Vietnamese to give blood to hits
a new low in the increasingly
hysterical debate on our Viet
nam policy in this country.
It is apparent that neither
Stanford group has thought
through the implications of its
efforts today. And, as The Daily
editorial correctly points out,
neither group is really concerned
with aiding all ihe civilian casu
alties of tho war. The CON
SCIENCE-supported effort pro
poses to send blood to "South
Vietnamese victims of Commu
nist terror." while the Medical
A if I Committee anticipates that
their aid will bo received by the
Viet Cong.
The unrealistic and essentially
political motives of both groups
approach the farcial and absurd,,

Editor, The Daily:
Thinking that many students
may presently be considering
the whether and which of for
eign campi, wo would like both
to defend and recommend the
choice we made. Your letter to
last fall's editor astonished stu
dents then at Stanford-in-Italy
with its idea that jagged glass
on parts of the wall around Villa
San Paolo symbolizes hostile
separation between Stanfordites
and Florentines.
We suggest for two reasons
that this is absurd. It is true
that Florence is a sophisticated
city whose citizens are more in
terested in individual worth than
in mere American citizenship.
They see Americans and other
foreigners all the time. Yet they
are generally friendly and even
eager for friendships if there is
a measure of common interest
that would be a prerequisite for
friendship between any two peo
ple.
While these people might be

met by the student studying on
Im own in Florence, many of
them arc brought to the villa
either through collections with
the administration or merely by
the idea that Americans there
are interested in tho Italian and
his culture.
We would further suggest
that the city itself, its size, prox
imity, and abundance of art of
all kinds provides an immense
varietj of possibilities for stim
ulation and activity. Neverthe
less, it is Ihe villa which serves
as a von comfortable home base
of learning.
Housed all in one historical
building with a large garden of
its own, Stanford-in-Italy has an
atmosphtro similar in many
ways to the small English col
lege. Living together with one's
professors, their families, and
the charming Italian administra
tion and staff is a luxurious way
to learn.

over 300.000 have been killed and
100.000 injured or tortured. It is

needed in addition to amputa

Money will buy these supplies
also.

While these people might be

the idea that Americans there

We would further suggest

Everyday in Vietnam people
are killed, wounded, their homes
devastated by the weapons of
modern war. Intensive bombing
with steel fragmentation bombs,
napalm, and toxic chemicals
sprayed from the air have been
used on villages and the country
side, and have inevitably devas
tated the civilian population.
While this cruel war continues,
it is the ordinary people of Viet
nam who suffer most. Since 1957
over 300.000 have been killed and
100.000 injured or tortured. It is
these people living in the vil
lages who need your material
help.
There is a desperate need to
send medical supplies which will
help to save lives. Medical equip
ment and drugs of all kinds are
needed, especially antibiotics and
antiseptics. Even the simplest
equipment for first aid posts
such as forceps, scissors, nee
dles, and sutures are desperately
needed in addition to amputa
tion saws and blood plasma.
Money will buy these supplies
also.
In a relentless war help must
he administered by an effective
authority. Medical Aid Commit
tee will send all contributions to
the International Rod Cross,
which has already agreed to de
liver the aid to victims of the
war in North Vietnam and areas
of South Vietnam under NLF
control. This guarantees the
greatest possible efficiency.
There exist several American
programs which exclusively pro
vide airl for the population in
areas controlled by the Saigon
and American governments. The
Medical Aid Committee there
fore believes that the medical

needs of many of the civilian
victims of American bombing
have boon and are being ignored.
Thus, the Medical Aid Commit
tee is attempting to fill a moral
void in the American conscience.
By contributing to the Com
mittee the American people will
be able to render immediate re
lief to those who are innocently
suffering as a consequence of
American military action.
