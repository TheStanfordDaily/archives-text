# Post-Christian Sex
## 
### 
In times like these moral standards seem "post-Christian' and sex codes rela
tive. Many are advocating pre-marital sex and relaxed attitudes toward the
deviant and perverse. However it is as foolish to ignore the moral laws of life
as it is to defy the law of gravity. Sex outside of marriage simply doesn't work
because it cuts across the grain of life. Though unseen, moral laws are abso
lutes of our being and sin in any form brings only "pleasure for a season,"
as the Bible puts it. The Old Testament reminds us that God never changes and
can not in fact relax the standards of holiness which love demands. "There is
a way which seems right 10 a man, but its end is the way to death" the writer
of Proverbs (14:12) expresses it, and God Himself says, Behold, all souls are
mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son; the soul that sins
shall die" (Ezekiel 18:4). The God of the ages still says to man, "the wages
of sin is death", why destroy yourself?
Sex is fun, and sin is what we love to do. But perhaps you are among the
many finding out the hard way that pain, guilt, emptiness and increased desire
accompany the misuse of sex. Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for
whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his own
flesh will from the flesh reap corruption;; but he who sows to the Spirit will
from the Spirit reap eternal life (Galatciins 6:7, 8).
Contrary to popular misconceptions, the God who built us is a God of sex,
neither Victorian nor legalist. He says no to sex outside of marriage to pro
tect the bonds of holy love between man and wife and the sanctity of mar
riage. In a very real way the moral decadence of careless parents becomes
the inheritance of unborn innocent children (See Numbers 14:18).
In a world of counterfeit sex why take second best? Human drives are very
strong and temptation can be almost overwhelming in a sin-soaked world. The
Bible says, "There is no temptation which has overtaken you that is not common
to man". Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible, has been through life on Earth,
too, and successfully weathered it all on our behalf. He alone is fully qualified
to lead you into a life of fulfillment, peace rand sexual satisfaction. While the
world seems to be going to hell, why should you?

flesh will from the flesh reap corruption;; but he who sows to the Spirit will
from the Spirit reap eternal life (Galatciins 6:7, 8).
Contrary to popular misconceptions, the God who built us is a God of sex,
neither Victorian nor legalist. He says no to sex outside of marriage to pro
tect the bonds of holy love between man and wife and the sanctity of mar
riage. In a very real way the moral decadence of careless parents becomes
the inheritance of unborn innocent children (See Numbers 14:18).
In a world of counterfeit sex why take second best? Human drives are very
strong and temptation can be almost overwhelming in a sin-soaked world. The
Bible says, "There is no temptation which has overtaken you that is not common
to man". Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible, has been through life on Earth,
too, and successfully weathered it all on our behalf. He alone is fully qualified
to lead you into a life of fulfillment, peace rand sexual satisfaction. While the
world seems to be going to hell, why should you?

In times like these moral standards seem "post-Christian' and sex codes rela
tive. Many are advocating pre-marital sex and relaxed attitudes toward the
deviant and perverse. However it is as foolish to ignore the moral laws of life
as it is to defy the law of gravity. Sex outside of marriage simply doesn't work
because it cuts across the grain of life. Though unseen, moral laws are abso
lutes of our being and sin in any form brings only "pleasure for a season,"
as the Bible puts it. The Old Testament reminds us that God never changes and
can not in fact relax the standards of holiness which love demands. "There is
a way which seems right 10 a man, but its end is the way to death" the writer
of Proverbs (14:12) expresses it, and God Himself says, Behold, all souls are
mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son; the soul that sins
shall die" (Ezekiel 18:4). The God of the ages still says to man, "the wages
of sin is death", why destroy yourself?
Sex is fun, and sin is what we love to do. But perhaps you are among the
many finding out the hard way that pain, guilt, emptiness and increased desire
accompany the misuse of sex. Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for
whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his own
flesh will from the flesh reap corruption;; but he who sows to the Spirit will
from the Spirit reap eternal life (Galatciins 6:7, 8).
