# Dante Proposed One Ruler
## 
### 
l)r. Uguccione Hanieri di Sorbello,
Italian author and lecturer, empha
sized in a speech last night at Dinkel
spiel. that Dante was the first to be
lieve that the world should he gov
erned by one ruler.
Di Surbello continued the series of
lectures and discussions eommemor
aring the 700 th anniversary of the
birth of Dahte in a speech entitled
"Dante's Thoughts on World Govern
ment."
Di Sorbello stated that Dante's
main purpose was to publicize man's
need for peace in order to reach full
potentiality in thought.
Di Sorbello sees the si\ centuries
after Dante as the "Age of Nations"
which produced the modern world.
According to Di Sorbello the close of
the division of the world by nationali
ties began at the end of the First
World War when the League of Na
tions was created.
Although this first effort at world
unification failed, the United Nations
evolved to take its place. Di Sorbello
stated that this "Age of Nations"
would come to end perhaps not in his
lifetime but perhaps in ours.
The Divine Comedy presents man's
freedom to choose between realiza
tion of unity or self-destruction in
striving for this goal. I,a Monarohia
and the Divine Comedy are Dante's
prophesies on world government as
seen by Di Sorbello.
He stated that others have seen
the possibility of universal govern
ment.. Anatomy of Peace by Emery
Reeves and the pamphlet "Draft for
World Constitution." by a group of
professors at the University of Chica
go, were contemporary thesises paral
lei to Dante's belief in the inevitability
of universal government for the
achievement of truth by mankind.
The Roman Empire, to Dante, was
the greatest success of unification.
During its height, thought and creativ
ity flourished, but its decline and the
failure of Henry VII to re-unify Italy
brought on the fact that the man of
his era was incapable of creating a
human entitv.
