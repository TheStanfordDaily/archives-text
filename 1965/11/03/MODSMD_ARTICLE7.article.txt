# Profs React Against Rally
## 
### 
A group of Stanford professors
have criticized I lie actions of students
involved in Vietnam ralJys in White
Pla/.a yesterday.
They disapproved both the principle
of Vietnam rallys and the behavior
of students who heckled speakers.
Professor Otis A. Pease of the De
partment oT History told the Daily in
an interview last night that he
thought the students were not as
much interested in donating blood as
making a political point.
"The donation of blood was used
purely as ;i symbol of rallying," he
said.
Two Factions
Pease commented that Vietnam ral
lys tended only to harden the public
into two factions either supporting or
disapproving of the administration
policy in Vietnam.
"I am concerned," he said, "that the
nation is getting into a mood where
people who are genuinely interested
in questioning 'aspects of administra
tion policy not necessarily all of it
will not be accorded a fair hearing.
"If you are not totally for the pres
ent policy," he commented, "somehow
you are completely against it."
Pease stated that open debate
should be encouraged in the United
States and that diplomatic negotiators
should he required to take the results
of the debate into account.
Professor Gabriel Almond, faculty
advisor to the Stanford Executive
Board of Conscience, also criticized
the rallys.
"The whole business of taking very
complicated issues to the street and
dramatizing them is an unfortunate
thing." he said. "These unusual forms
of protest only distract attention from
serious complex issues.
"I am opposed to all forms of sen
sat ionalizat ion," he stated.
Political Science professor Charles
Drekimeir commented that onlookers
were better behaved during Berkeley
demonstrations two weeks ago than
during the speeches in White Plaza.
"I was tremendously impressed with
the orderliness of the march there,"
ho said.
"I think those who were heckling
the rally speakers did so because they
were not able to present an effective
argument," he said. "They are frus
trated because of it.and have to get

back some way."
Professor Christian Bay, one of the
main rally speakers, said he did not
mind the behavior of bystanders. "I
think we were surprised they listened
as much as they did," he added.
Bay concluded that Vietnam raliys
were valuable if they received what

he called "proper puoiicny.
All the men agreed that the various
groups involved, both those for and
against administration policy and
those who opposed only part of the
present action in live far east should
be encouraged to express opinions
aloud.

of protest only distract attention from
serious complex issues.
"I am opposed to all forms of sen

Political Science professor Charles
Drekimeir commented that onlookers
were better behaved during Berkeley
demonstrations two weeks ago than
during the speeches in White Plaza.
"I was tremendously impressed with
the orderliness of the march there,"
ho said.
"I think those who were heckling
the rally speakers did so because they
were not able to present an effective
argument," he said. "They are frus
trated because of it.and have to get

back some way."
Professor Christian Bay, one of the
main rally speakers, said he did not
mind the behavior of bystanders. "I
think we were surprised they listened
as much as they did," he added.
Bay concluded that Vietnam raliys
were valuable if they received what

he called "proper puoiicny.
All the men agreed that the various
groups involved, both those for and
against administration policy and
those who opposed only part of the
present action in live far east should
be encouraged to express opinions
aloud.
A group of Stanford professors
have criticized I lie actions of students
involved in Vietnam ralJys in White
Pla/.a yesterday.
They disapproved both the principle
of Vietnam rallys and the behavior
of students who heckled speakers.
Professor Otis A. Pease of the De
partment oT History told the Daily in
an interview last night that he
thought the students were not as
much interested in donating blood as
making a political point.
"The donation of blood was used
purely as ;i symbol of rallying," he
said.
Two Factions
Pease commented that Vietnam ral
lys tended only to harden the public
into two factions either supporting or
disapproving of the administration
policy in Vietnam.
"I am concerned," he said, "that the
nation is getting into a mood where
people who are genuinely interested
in questioning 'aspects of administra
tion policy not necessarily all of it
will not be accorded a fair hearing.
"If you are not totally for the pres
ent policy," he commented, "somehow
you are completely against it."
Pease stated that open debate
should be encouraged in the United
States and that diplomatic negotiators
should he required to take the results
of the debate into account.
Professor Gabriel Almond, faculty
advisor to the Stanford Executive
Board of Conscience, also criticized
the rallys.
"The whole business of taking very
complicated issues to the street and
dramatizing them is an unfortunate
thing." he said. "These unusual forms
of protest only distract attention from
serious complex issues.

sat ionalizat ion," he stated.
