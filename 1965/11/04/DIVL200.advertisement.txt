The War That Lies Ahead
There's not a man among us who'd like to see another war. Who enjoys
the horror of man's inhumanity to man? But in a world where some claim
"all is well'' and others say "we must have peace", we've seen no end to war.
In fact the Koreas and Viet Nams seem only to be bleeding excess steam from
a pressure-cooker world.
Two thousand years ago Jesus Christ was asked what the future had in
store. He replied, "... you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that
you are not alarmed; for this must take place but the end is not yet. For nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be
famines and earthquakes in various places; all this is but the beginning of
sufferings".
A little time spent in the Bible, whose predictions have never failed to come
true in minute detail, shows clearly that the world wil not have peace until
the return of Jesus Christ. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, (which in
Greek means "unveiling") describes in vivid symbolism and realistic detail
the days that lie ahead in this dying world:
"Behold I saw a pale horse, and it's rider's name was Death, and Hades
followed him; and they were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill
with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the
earth . . . Then the kings of the earth and the great men and generals and
the rich and the strong, and everyone, slave and free, hid in the caves and
among the rocks of the mountains, calling to the rocks and mountains, Fall
on us and hide us from the wrath of him who is seated on the throne, and
from the wrath of the lamb(Jesus Christ); for the great day of their wrath has
come, and who can stand before it'? . . . And in those days men will seek
death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death will fly from them . . .
The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of
the works of their hands nor give up worshipping demons and idols of gold
and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot either see or hear or
walk; nor did they repent of their murders or of their sorceries or of their
immorality of their thefts".
In view of the dark days that lie ahead the most important decision you I!
ever make is to receive Jesus Christ into your heart as lord. Lord He is,
whether people believe it or not, and He alone, the Bible says, "delivers from
the wrath to come". The just God of love who saves men from themselves will
help you, "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will be
saved".

ever make is to receive Jesus Christ into your heart as lord. Lord He is,
whether people believe it or not, and He alone, the Bible says, "delivers from
the wrath to come". The just God of love who saves men from themselves will
help you, "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will be
saved".

The War That Lies Ahead
There's not a man among us who'd like to see another war. Who enjoys
the horror of man's inhumanity to man? But in a world where some claim
"all is well'' and others say "we must have peace", we've seen no end to war.
In fact the Koreas and Viet Nams seem only to be bleeding excess steam from
a pressure-cooker world.
Two thousand years ago Jesus Christ was asked what the future had in
store. He replied, "... you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that
you are not alarmed; for this must take place but the end is not yet. For nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be
famines and earthquakes in various places; all this is but the beginning of
sufferings".
A little time spent in the Bible, whose predictions have never failed to come
true in minute detail, shows clearly that the world wil not have peace until
the return of Jesus Christ. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, (which in
Greek means "unveiling") describes in vivid symbolism and realistic detail
the days that lie ahead in this dying world:
"Behold I saw a pale horse, and it's rider's name was Death, and Hades
followed him; and they were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill
with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the
earth . . . Then the kings of the earth and the great men and generals and
the rich and the strong, and everyone, slave and free, hid in the caves and
among the rocks of the mountains, calling to the rocks and mountains, Fall
on us and hide us from the wrath of him who is seated on the throne, and
from the wrath of the lamb(Jesus Christ); for the great day of their wrath has
come, and who can stand before it'? . . . And in those days men will seek
death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death will fly from them . . .
The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of
the works of their hands nor give up worshipping demons and idols of gold
and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot either see or hear or
walk; nor did they repent of their murders or of their sorceries or of their
immorality of their thefts".
In view of the dark days that lie ahead the most important decision you I!
ever make is to receive Jesus Christ into your heart as lord. Lord He is,
whether people believe it or not, and He alone, the Bible says, "delivers from
the wrath to come". The just God of love who saves men from themselves will
help you, "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will be
saved".
