Aftor a month of intramural
action, the perennially powerful
Sigma Chis remain the team to
beat. But the Kappa Alphas,
who are in the same league,
may be just the team to beat
them. The KA's squashed the
Delts 13-0 for their fourth win
in a row.
The KA's got their first score
when Ken Smith ran back a
pass interception. The second
score came on a 25-yard pass
from Dick Knudtsen to Jerry
Varanini. The tough defense, led
by Bill McElroy, Will Hagenah,
Rick Brekelbaum, and Glen Nol
te, turned in its fourth straight
shutout, having previously si
lenced the Alpha Sigs 18-0, the
Fijis 44-0, and Theta Chi 9-0.
The undefeated Phi Kaps rode
the passing arm of Don Leydig
to their fourth victory, nipping
the Phi Delts 20-19. John Ashton
caught two of Leydig's passes
for touchdowns, while Glen
Schofield carried in one. Larry
Lomax and Pat Concannon man
ufactured the Phi Delt's strong
comeback effort. The Phi Delts
are now 3-1.

Whipping the Theta Xis 26-0,
the Theta Delts 1 on their fourth
game in as many tries. Fred
Mosely was the big noise, rum
bling across the goal on two
runs, and passing touchdowns to
Bill Steinhart and Mike Walsh.
Upset-minded El Toro handed
Los Arcos its first defeat, 12-0,
to highlight club action. After
a 40-yard pass play, El Toro's
Bub Turner ran it in from the
three. He hit Mark Wells on a
pass for the final six.
Muir dumped Donner 20-7 to
remain atop the Stern League.
Passes from Joe Muelleur to
Tom Petersmyers and Steve Bal
frey comprised the main Muir
offensive. The passing attack of
Serra bombed Lassen 24-2. Steve
Taylor found easy targets in
Tom Rohlf and Guy Eustice.
After an initial loss tn Muir

7-6, Fremont is beginning to roll.
After leveling Holliday 27-0, Fre
mont knocked off Burbank 13-0.
The Fremont attack was led by
Stan Smith, who, against Bur
bank, threw for one score and
ran back a pass interception for
the other.

nipero put a hurt on Otero 25-0.
