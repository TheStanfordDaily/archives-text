# Inventor Says Cyberlite No Flash-In-The-Pan
## 
### ERIC OLSEN 
Dr. John Voevodsky, a Stanford
graduate student, has recently devel
oped a device which will completely
revolutionize highway safety by al
most eliminating rear-end accidents.
The device, called a Cyberiite, is
designed to provide instantaneous
communication between drivers on
busy roads by modifying present
b i ake-I igh t systerns.
Statistics released by the National
Safety Council show how important
this device will be once it comes into
general use. Traffic accidents caused
47,700 deaths, 1.700,000 injuries, and
over $8 billion in damage in 1964. In
the 15- to 24-year age group, 11,123
people died in traffic accidents while
cancer and suicide, the next leading
causes of death, together killed only
3,997.
Frightening' Statistics
Dr. Voevodsky said, "These high
way statistics arc frightening, not
only because so many people are be
ing killed, but also because many of

these deaths were easily px-eventable."
Safety Council figures show that 60
per cent of urban and 30 per cent of
rural traffic accidents are rear-end
ers. The Cyberiite should be able to
eliminate rear-end collisions.
The Cyberiite itself is a small cir
cuit which may be easily and inex
pensively installer! in any car. Mass
production will lower the cost to
about five dollars and installation
time to under ten minutes.
The basic principle of the device is
that the human eye and brain can
react more readily lo a flashing light
than to the change in brightness now
used in brake lights. Voevodsky ob
served that with the present system,
when a driver steps on his brake, the
lights come on, but other drivers can
not tell whether he is just tapping
his brake or making an emergency
stop.
Variable Signal
On the other hand the Cyberiite
gives a variable signal which depends
on the car's decclleration. When the
driver rides his brake gently, the
lights flash once each second; but
when he slams on the brake in an
emergency, the flash rate increases
up to 15 flashes eeach second. The
drivers behind immediately know
what is happening and have enough
time to avoid danger. The idea is
very simple but apparently no one
ever thought of it before.
Dr. Voevodsky decided to design
the Cyberiite after being involved in
an accident on the Bayshore Freeway
caused by a car parked in the fast
lane. When a car is parked by the
side of a road at night, the Cyberiite
provides a slow, steady blink of one
a second. But if the car should be
stopped in the road obstructing traf
fic, the rear light can be set to flash
at 15 per second, protecting everyone
on tlie road from an accident.
First Cybernetics PhD
The first PhD in the U.S. in the new
field of Cybernetics was awarded to
Dr. Voevodsky at Stanford on October
1. Cybernetics is a new and growing
field described as the comparative
study of the automatic control sys
tem formed by the nervous system
and brain and by mechanical-electrical
communication systems.
In January Dr. Voevodsky will as
sume the title of Research Associate
in the Psychology Department under
Dr. Ernest R. Hilgard. He has at
tended Cornell University, the Uni
versity of Arizona, Illinois Institute
of Technology, and the University of
Southern California, as well as Stan
ford.
