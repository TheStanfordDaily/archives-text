Editor, The Daily:
Those well - meaning people
who have so far gone along with
the U. S. government's war in
Vietnam need to stop and con
sider the kind of disgusting
moral pathology and mindless
yahooism that our policy is let
ling loose here at home. Stan
ford had a shocking example
Tuesday noon of how war-fever
and phony patriotism can de
grade and sabotage the ideals
for which the nation stands. I
Went to White Plaza to hear my
eolieague Professor Franklin
speak in support of medical aid
to the Vietnamese and against
aggressive U. S. action in Asia.
It seemed, however, that the
part of the crowd that I first
wandered into couldnt stand the
idea of free speech. In any com
munity— even in an academic
community I suppose — there
will always be those fearful, ig
norant. sadistic people who feel
their smelly little existences to
be somehow threatened by ideas
different from their own. Usu
ally, though, the university tra
dition of free inquiry and dis
cussion manages to keep their
neurotic tendencies towards anti
intellectual, sheep-like orthodoxy
and violence in check, at least
until they get out of college.
But now I watched a mob of
these mental pygmies whose
.sick and unpatriotic intolerance
had found a seemingly "legiti
mate" out let in ugly, xenophobic
chauvinism. They threw various
objects and debris at Dr. Frank
lin and then ducked behind each
other (that's the old American
way for you!); they called him —
an cx-SAC officer—a "slacker"
and a "coward" (brave boys,
cozy and safe with 2S and ID
deferrments, not exactly rush
ing down to enlist, afraid to con
front anyone alone without the
mobi; they called him—l'm not.
making this up—a "yellow V.
C."; they called him—but not
very loud, just for each other
to hear—a "dirty jew bastard."
I saw and heard these inde
cencies at this school where the
winds of freedom are supposed
to blow. And the main point is
that if this sort of thing is hap
pening here, it is happening all
over. The fact that the infamous
Hell's Angels won gobs of public
good-will for brutally assaulting
Berkeley peace demonstrators
and that the Ku Klux Klan
stands four-square behind our
military venture in Asia ought

to make anybody pause and
think: this war is making' rotten
and obscene behavior respecta
ble in America.
I'm told that some people
think those who oppose the war
in Vietnam are traitors, but if a
traitor is one who betrays our
country, its marvelous ideals,
and its great republican values,
then I suggest that the treason

• Medical Aid 'Illegal'
Editor, The Daily:
We support the right to pro
test America's foreign policy in
Southeast Asia but we denounce
the actions of the Medical Aid
Committee for Vietnam (North).
Actions which arc immoral and
illegal should never be con
doned, and not long tolerated.
The Medical Aid Committee
for Vietnam has repeatedly said
I hat it will raise money for med
ical supplies to be given to the
North Vietnamese and the areas
of South Vietnam under control
of the Viet Cong. It seems clear
that these activities constitute
a serious danger to the estab
lishment of world peace. In the
Twentieth Century, war involves
the entire economic resources of
a nation. Therefore even a cas
ual observer would see that,
even were aid only to reach
civilians, it would simply result
in other material being released
to belligerents. The surest way
to engineer a war of attrition in
Vietnam is to aid the other side.
Aid and comfort to enemies of
the United States constitutes
treason. The legal advisors of
fice to the Department of State
has stated publicly that any aid
given by an American citizen to
either the "National Liberation
Front" or North Vietnam would
in the opinion of the Depart
ment be a violation of law.
By permitting this drive to
continue, Stanford University is
acquiescing in what seems clear
ly a violation of Federal law.
We call upon the authorities of
this University — Student, Fac
ulty, and Administrative -— to
end any silent partnership in a
criminal conspiracy.
The right of free expression
does not obligate the University
to stand by while its property
is being used to perpetrate
crime; nor should the students
stand by while the reputation of
their University is corrupted by

the immoral and illegal actions
of a few.

• Drama Dept. Kipped
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Sharp's incredible
letter in Monday's Daily under
lines the insensltlvity with
which the Department of Drama
and kindred interests have dealt
with supporters of extracurricu
lar drama over a number of
years, to an increasing extent.
How far away from reason the
Professor has gone can best be
shown by his own remark, in
which he allows that "one hor
ror in drama departments in a
university is their insistence on
letting untrained undergraduates
present their theatrical image to
an adoring or unadoring public.
The reaction is seldom honest.
Always underneath any adula
tion is the stated or understood
'for a college production.' As a
consequence, students get a false
sense of their own talent and
audiences gradually lose their
taste. Most of them, very sensi
bly, go to the movies." A state
ment like this, considering the
delicacy of the present situation,
is intemperate and fatuous.
The point, simply, is that there
are areas of student drama that
fall outside the professional con
cern of the Department of Dra
ma, that these areas keenly rep
resent the interests of a large
portion of students, that student
interests of this sort are a pre
eminent part of the entire Uni
versity program and that the
Department of Drama has no
right—and it might realize, no
need—to supplant these inter
ests. The students have deter
mined for themselves that in
formal dramatic activity of the
type provided by Ram's Head
allows the most effective outlet
for their talents, and any ac
tions, intentional or otherwise,
that tend to reduce the effective
ness of this outlet represents a
grim sort of professional censor
ship.
Ram's Head lias been victim
ized by an extensive shuffling of

schedules and facilities. It is dif
ficult to imagine some of the
lavish Spring Show musicals of
the past being staged in the Lit
tle Theatre, where one misstep
would send an actor plunging
into the orchestra pit, were
there an orchestra pit to speak
of. The Nitery, despite the de
lightful opportunities it provides
for professional experimentation,
is by any reasonable standard
an outhouse among theatrical
facilities, and any attempt to
relegate unwilling stud en t
groups to these premises is akin
to telling them to go wave then
arms and shout their lines into
a dark corner whene they can't
embarrass themselves or their
elders.
Nobody can deny the advan
tages to the University and to
drama that will follow from the
important advances which have
been made recently at Stanford.
But these new activities are sim
ply not competitive with tradi
tional forms of student drama,
and with a little good will and a
bit of circumspection most seri
out conflicts could bo avoided.
But the good will seems long in
coming; any observer who cares
enough to knock the dust off the
Associated Students records will
find that the recent history of
Ram's Head largely has been
one, long fight, repeated every
year, to obtain even minimal re
hearsal time in an auditorium
built with student tuition funds
voted, ostensibly, by the stu
dents themselves, and hand
somely equipped and supported
by Ram's Head revenue. Even
the scheduling of public per
formances themselves has de
pended on the preemptory claims
of other drama interests and of
other interests not even vaguely
related to student desires.
Even the most ardent support
ers of Ram's Head will admit
that the various products of the
group's efforts are inconsistent,
but this is, and is supposed to
be, a profitable part of the self
teaching process, and those who
have sat through some of Ram's
Head's lesser moments have
stayed on to sec the organiza
tion provide some of the finest
and certainly, from a student
standpoint, most fulfilling expe
riences in Stanford drama.
And the audiences, contrary
to the Professor's assumptions,
are not losing their taste; stu
dent. dramatic activities are
profitable and consistently well
received, and he might rest with
the knowledge that a loyal
"adoring or unadoring" public
has long preceded him at this
University, and will survive him.

• Drama Dept. Kipped
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Sharp's incredible
letter in Monday's Daily under
lines the insensltlvity with
which the Department of Drama
and kindred interests have dealt
with supporters of extracurricu
lar drama over a number of
years, to an increasing extent.
How far away from reason the
Professor has gone can best be
shown by his own remark, in
which he allows that "one hor
ror in drama departments in a
university is their insistence on
letting untrained undergraduates
present their theatrical image to
an adoring or unadoring public.
The reaction is seldom honest.
Always underneath any adula
tion is the stated or understood
'for a college production.' As a
consequence, students get a false
sense of their own talent and
audiences gradually lose their
taste. Most of them, very sensi
bly, go to the movies." A state
ment like this, considering the
delicacy of the present situation,
is intemperate and fatuous.
The point, simply, is that there
are areas of student drama that
fall outside the professional con
cern of the Department of Dra
ma, that these areas keenly rep
resent the interests of a large
portion of students, that student
interests of this sort are a pre
eminent part of the entire Uni
versity program and that the
Department of Drama has no
right—and it might realize, no
need—to supplant these inter
ests. The students have deter
mined for themselves that in
formal dramatic activity of the
type provided by Ram's Head
allows the most effective outlet
for their talents, and any ac
tions, intentional or otherwise,
that tend to reduce the effective
ness of this outlet represents a
grim sort of professional censor
ship.
Ram's Head lias been victim
ized by an extensive shuffling of

schedules and facilities. It is dif
ficult to imagine some of the
lavish Spring Show musicals of
the past being staged in the Lit
tle Theatre, where one misstep
would send an actor plunging
into the orchestra pit, were
there an orchestra pit to speak
of. The Nitery, despite the de
lightful opportunities it provides
for professional experimentation,
is by any reasonable standard
an outhouse among theatrical
facilities, and any attempt to
relegate unwilling stud en t
groups to these premises is akin
to telling them to go wave then
arms and shout their lines into
a dark corner whene they can't
embarrass themselves or their
elders.
Nobody can deny the advan
tages to the University and to
drama that will follow from the
important advances which have
been made recently at Stanford.
But these new activities are sim
ply not competitive with tradi
tional forms of student drama,
and with a little good will and a
bit of circumspection most seri
out conflicts could bo avoided.
But the good will seems long in
coming; any observer who cares
enough to knock the dust off the
Associated Students records will
find that the recent history of
Ram's Head largely has been
one, long fight, repeated every
year, to obtain even minimal re
hearsal time in an auditorium
built with student tuition funds
voted, ostensibly, by the stu
dents themselves, and hand
somely equipped and supported
by Ram's Head revenue. Even
the scheduling of public per
formances themselves has de
pended on the preemptory claims
of other drama interests and of
other interests not even vaguely
related to student desires.
Even the most ardent support
ers of Ram's Head will admit
that the various products of the
group's efforts are inconsistent,
but this is, and is supposed to
be, a profitable part of the self
teaching process, and those who
have sat through some of Ram's
Head's lesser moments have
stayed on to sec the organiza
tion provide some of the finest
and certainly, from a student
standpoint, most fulfilling expe
riences in Stanford drama.
And the audiences, contrary
to the Professor's assumptions,
are not losing their taste; stu
dent. dramatic activities are
profitable and consistently well
received, and he might rest with
the knowledge that a loyal
"adoring or unadoring" public
has long preceded him at this
University, and will survive him.

Those well - meaning people
who have so far gone along with
the U. S. government's war in
Vietnam need to stop and con

moral pathology and mindless

Went to White Plaza to hear my
eolieague Professor Franklin
speak in support of medical aid
to the Vietnamese and against
aggressive U. S. action in Asia.
It seemed, however, that the
part of the crowd that I first
wandered into couldnt stand the
idea of free speech. In any com
munity— even in an academic
community I suppose — there
will always be those fearful, ig
norant. sadistic people who feel
their smelly little existences to
be somehow threatened by ideas
different from their own. Usu
ally, though, the university tra
dition of free inquiry and dis
cussion manages to keep their
neurotic tendencies towards anti
intellectual, sheep-like orthodoxy
and violence in check, at least
until they get out of college.
But now I watched a mob of
these mental pygmies whose
.sick and unpatriotic intolerance
had found a seemingly "legiti
mate" out let in ugly, xenophobic
chauvinism. They threw various
objects and debris at Dr. Frank

an cx-SAC officer—a "slacker"

very loud, just for each other

I saw and heard these inde
cencies at this school where the
winds of freedom are supposed
to blow. And the main point is
that if this sort of thing is hap
pening here, it is happening all
over. The fact that the infamous
Hell's Angels won gobs of public
good-will for brutally assaulting
Berkeley peace demonstrators
and that the Ku Klux Klan
stands four-square behind our
military venture in Asia ought

to make anybody pause and
think: this war is making' rotten
and obscene behavior respecta
ble in America.
I'm told that some people
think those who oppose the war
in Vietnam are traitors, but if a
traitor is one who betrays our
country, its marvelous ideals,
and its great republican values,
then I suggest that the treason

• Medical Aid 'Illegal'
Editor, The Daily:
We support the right to pro
test America's foreign policy in
Southeast Asia but we denounce
the actions of the Medical Aid
Committee for Vietnam (North).
Actions which arc immoral and
illegal should never be con
doned, and not long tolerated.
The Medical Aid Committee
for Vietnam has repeatedly said
I hat it will raise money for med
ical supplies to be given to the
North Vietnamese and the areas
of South Vietnam under control
of the Viet Cong. It seems clear
that these activities constitute
a serious danger to the estab
lishment of world peace. In the
Twentieth Century, war involves
the entire economic resources of
a nation. Therefore even a cas
ual observer would see that,
even were aid only to reach
civilians, it would simply result
in other material being released
to belligerents. The surest way
to engineer a war of attrition in
Vietnam is to aid the other side.
Aid and comfort to enemies of
the United States constitutes
treason. The legal advisors of
fice to the Department of State
has stated publicly that any aid
given by an American citizen to
either the "National Liberation
Front" or North Vietnam would
in the opinion of the Depart
ment be a violation of law.
By permitting this drive to
continue, Stanford University is
acquiescing in what seems clear
ly a violation of Federal law.
We call upon the authorities of

• Medical Aid 'Illegal'
Editor, The Daily:
We support the right to pro
test America's foreign policy in
Southeast Asia but we denounce
the actions of the Medical Aid
Committee for Vietnam (North).
Actions which arc immoral and
illegal should never be con
doned, and not long tolerated.
The Medical Aid Committee
for Vietnam has repeatedly said
I hat it will raise money for med
ical supplies to be given to the
North Vietnamese and the areas
of South Vietnam under control
of the Viet Cong. It seems clear
that these activities constitute
a serious danger to the estab
lishment of world peace. In the
Twentieth Century, war involves
the entire economic resources of
a nation. Therefore even a cas
ual observer would see that,
even were aid only to reach
civilians, it would simply result
in other material being released
to belligerents. The surest way
to engineer a war of attrition in
Vietnam is to aid the other side.
Aid and comfort to enemies of
the United States constitutes
treason. The legal advisors of
fice to the Department of State
has stated publicly that any aid
given by an American citizen to
either the "National Liberation
Front" or North Vietnam would
in the opinion of the Depart
ment be a violation of law.
By permitting this drive to
continue, Stanford University is
acquiescing in what seems clear
ly a violation of Federal law.
We call upon the authorities of
this University — Student, Fac
ulty, and Administrative -— to
end any silent partnership in a
criminal conspiracy.
The right of free expression
does not obligate the University
to stand by while its property
is being used to perpetrate
crime; nor should the students
stand by while the reputation of
their University is corrupted by

the immoral and illegal actions
of a few.

• Drama Dept. Kipped
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Sharp's incredible
letter in Monday's Daily under
lines the insensltlvity with
which the Department of Drama
and kindred interests have dealt
with supporters of extracurricu
lar drama over a number of
years, to an increasing extent.
How far away from reason the
Professor has gone can best be
shown by his own remark, in
which he allows that "one hor
ror in drama departments in a
university is their insistence on
letting untrained undergraduates
present their theatrical image to
an adoring or unadoring public.
The reaction is seldom honest.
Always underneath any adula
tion is the stated or understood
'for a college production.' As a
consequence, students get a false
sense of their own talent and
audiences gradually lose their
taste. Most of them, very sensi
bly, go to the movies." A state
ment like this, considering the
delicacy of the present situation,
is intemperate and fatuous.
The point, simply, is that there
are areas of student drama that
fall outside the professional con
cern of the Department of Dra
ma, that these areas keenly rep
resent the interests of a large
portion of students, that student
interests of this sort are a pre
eminent part of the entire Uni
versity program and that the
Department of Drama has no
right—and it might realize, no
need—to supplant these inter
ests. The students have deter
mined for themselves that in
formal dramatic activity of the
type provided by Ram's Head
allows the most effective outlet
for their talents, and any ac
tions, intentional or otherwise,
that tend to reduce the effective
ness of this outlet represents a
grim sort of professional censor
ship.
Ram's Head lias been victim
ized by an extensive shuffling of

schedules and facilities. It is dif
ficult to imagine some of the
lavish Spring Show musicals of
the past being staged in the Lit
tle Theatre, where one misstep
would send an actor plunging
into the orchestra pit, were
there an orchestra pit to speak
of. The Nitery, despite the de
lightful opportunities it provides
for professional experimentation,
is by any reasonable standard
an outhouse among theatrical
facilities, and any attempt to
relegate unwilling stud en t
groups to these premises is akin
to telling them to go wave then
arms and shout their lines into
a dark corner whene they can't
embarrass themselves or their
elders.
Nobody can deny the advan
tages to the University and to
drama that will follow from the
important advances which have
been made recently at Stanford.
But these new activities are sim
ply not competitive with tradi
tional forms of student drama,
and with a little good will and a
bit of circumspection most seri
out conflicts could bo avoided.
But the good will seems long in
coming; any observer who cares
enough to knock the dust off the
Associated Students records will
find that the recent history of
Ram's Head largely has been
one, long fight, repeated every
year, to obtain even minimal re
hearsal time in an auditorium
built with student tuition funds
voted, ostensibly, by the stu
dents themselves, and hand
somely equipped and supported
by Ram's Head revenue. Even
the scheduling of public per
formances themselves has de
pended on the preemptory claims
of other drama interests and of
other interests not even vaguely
related to student desires.
Even the most ardent support
ers of Ram's Head will admit
that the various products of the

that these activities constitute
a serious danger to the estab

Twentieth Century, war involves
the entire economic resources of

even were aid only to reach
civilians, it would simply result
in other material being released
to belligerents. The surest way
to engineer a war of attrition in
Vietnam is to aid the other side.
Aid and comfort to enemies of
the United States constitutes
treason. The legal advisors of

has stated publicly that any aid
given by an American citizen to
either the "National Liberation

in the opinion of the Depart

By permitting this drive to
continue, Stanford University is
acquiescing in what seems clear

• Drama Dept. Kipped
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Sharp's incredible
letter in Monday's Daily under
lines the insensltlvity with
which the Department of Drama
and kindred interests have dealt
with supporters of extracurricu
lar drama over a number of
years, to an increasing extent.
How far away from reason the
Professor has gone can best be
shown by his own remark, in
which he allows that "one hor
ror in drama departments in a
university is their insistence on
letting untrained undergraduates
present their theatrical image to
an adoring or unadoring public.
The reaction is seldom honest.
Always underneath any adula
tion is the stated or understood
'for a college production.' As a
consequence, students get a false
sense of their own talent and
audiences gradually lose their
taste. Most of them, very sensi
bly, go to the movies." A state
ment like this, considering the
delicacy of the present situation,
is intemperate and fatuous.
The point, simply, is that there
are areas of student drama that
fall outside the professional con
cern of the Department of Dra
ma, that these areas keenly rep
resent the interests of a large
portion of students, that student
interests of this sort are a pre
eminent part of the entire Uni
versity program and that the
Department of Drama has no
right—and it might realize, no
need—to supplant these inter
ests. The students have deter
mined for themselves that in
formal dramatic activity of the
type provided by Ram's Head
allows the most effective outlet
for their talents, and any ac
tions, intentional or otherwise,
that tend to reduce the effective
ness of this outlet represents a
grim sort of professional censor
ship.
Ram's Head lias been victim
ized by an extensive shuffling of

schedules and facilities. It is dif
ficult to imagine some of the
lavish Spring Show musicals of
the past being staged in the Lit
tle Theatre, where one misstep
would send an actor plunging
into the orchestra pit, were
there an orchestra pit to speak
of. The Nitery, despite the de
lightful opportunities it provides
for professional experimentation,
is by any reasonable standard
an outhouse among theatrical
facilities, and any attempt to
relegate unwilling stud en t
groups to these premises is akin
to telling them to go wave then
arms and shout their lines into
a dark corner whene they can't
embarrass themselves or their
elders.
Nobody can deny the advan
tages to the University and to
drama that will follow from the
important advances which have
been made recently at Stanford.
But these new activities are sim
ply not competitive with tradi
tional forms of student drama,
and with a little good will and a
bit of circumspection most seri
out conflicts could bo avoided.
But the good will seems long in
coming; any observer who cares
enough to knock the dust off the
Associated Students records will
find that the recent history of
Ram's Head largely has been
one, long fight, repeated every
year, to obtain even minimal re
hearsal time in an auditorium
built with student tuition funds
voted, ostensibly, by the stu
dents themselves, and hand
somely equipped and supported
by Ram's Head revenue. Even
the scheduling of public per
formances themselves has de
pended on the preemptory claims
of other drama interests and of
other interests not even vaguely
related to student desires.
Even the most ardent support
ers of Ram's Head will admit
that the various products of the
group's efforts are inconsistent,
but this is, and is supposed to
be, a profitable part of the self
teaching process, and those who
have sat through some of Ram's
Head's lesser moments have
stayed on to sec the organiza
tion provide some of the finest
and certainly, from a student
standpoint, most fulfilling expe
riences in Stanford drama.
And the audiences, contrary
to the Professor's assumptions,
are not losing their taste; stu
dent. dramatic activities are
profitable and consistently well
received, and he might rest with
the knowledge that a loyal
"adoring or unadoring" public
has long preceded him at this
University, and will survive him.

Went to White Plaza to hear my
eolieague Professor Franklin
speak in support of medical aid
to the Vietnamese and against
aggressive U. S. action in Asia.
It seemed, however, that the

wandered into couldnt stand the
idea of free speech. In any com

will always be those fearful, ig
norant. sadistic people who feel
their smelly little existences to
be somehow threatened by ideas
different from their own. Usu
ally, though, the university tra
dition of free inquiry and dis
cussion manages to keep their
neurotic tendencies towards anti
intellectual, sheep-like orthodoxy
and violence in check, at least
until they get out of college.
But now I watched a mob of
these mental pygmies whose

had found a seemingly "legiti

I saw and heard these inde

that if this sort of thing is hap

Hell's Angels won gobs of public

Berkeley peace demonstrators
and that the Ku Klux Klan

military venture in Asia ought

to make anybody pause and
think: this war is making' rotten

I'm told that some people
think those who oppose the war

traitor is one who betrays our

been made recently at Stanford.
But these new activities are sim
ply not competitive with tradi
tional forms of student drama,
and with a little good will and a
bit of circumspection most seri
out conflicts could bo avoided.
But the good will seems long in
coming; any observer who cares
enough to knock the dust off the
Associated Students records will
find that the recent history of
Ram's Head largely has been
one, long fight, repeated every
year, to obtain even minimal re
hearsal time in an auditorium
built with student tuition funds
voted, ostensibly, by the stu
dents themselves, and hand
somely equipped and supported
by Ram's Head revenue. Even
the scheduling of public per
formances themselves has de
pended on the preemptory claims
of other drama interests and of
other interests not even vaguely
related to student desires.
Even the most ardent support
ers of Ram's Head will admit
that the various products of the
group's efforts are inconsistent,
but this is, and is supposed to
be, a profitable part of the self
teaching process, and those who
have sat through some of Ram's
Head's lesser moments have
stayed on to sec the organiza
tion provide some of the finest
and certainly, from a student
standpoint, most fulfilling expe
riences in Stanford drama.
And the audiences, contrary
to the Professor's assumptions,
are not losing their taste; stu
dent. dramatic activities are
profitable and consistently well
received, and he might rest with
the knowledge that a loyal
"adoring or unadoring" public
has long preceded him at this
University, and will survive him.

Editor, The Daily:
Those well - meaning people
who have so far gone along with
the U. S. government's war in
Vietnam need to stop and con
sider the kind of disgusting
moral pathology and mindless
yahooism that our policy is let
ling loose here at home. Stan
ford had a shocking example
Tuesday noon of how war-fever
and phony patriotism can de
grade and sabotage the ideals
for which the nation stands. I
Went to White Plaza to hear my
eolieague Professor Franklin
speak in support of medical aid
to the Vietnamese and against
aggressive U. S. action in Asia.
It seemed, however, that the
part of the crowd that I first
wandered into couldnt stand the
idea of free speech. In any com
munity— even in an academic
community I suppose — there
will always be those fearful, ig
norant. sadistic people who feel
their smelly little existences to
be somehow threatened by ideas
different from their own. Usu
ally, though, the university tra
dition of free inquiry and dis
cussion manages to keep their
neurotic tendencies towards anti
intellectual, sheep-like orthodoxy
and violence in check, at least
until they get out of college.
But now I watched a mob of
these mental pygmies whose
.sick and unpatriotic intolerance
had found a seemingly "legiti
mate" out let in ugly, xenophobic
chauvinism. They threw various
objects and debris at Dr. Frank
lin and then ducked behind each
other (that's the old American
way for you!); they called him —
an cx-SAC officer—a "slacker"
and a "coward" (brave boys,
cozy and safe with 2S and ID
deferrments, not exactly rush
ing down to enlist, afraid to con
front anyone alone without the
mobi; they called him—l'm not.
making this up—a "yellow V.
C."; they called him—but not
very loud, just for each other
to hear—a "dirty jew bastard."
I saw and heard these inde
cencies at this school where the
winds of freedom are supposed
to blow. And the main point is
that if this sort of thing is hap
pening here, it is happening all
over. The fact that the infamous
Hell's Angels won gobs of public
good-will for brutally assaulting
Berkeley peace demonstrators
and that the Ku Klux Klan
stands four-square behind our
military venture in Asia ought

to make anybody pause and
think: this war is making' rotten
and obscene behavior respecta
ble in America.
I'm told that some people
think those who oppose the war
in Vietnam are traitors, but if a
traitor is one who betrays our
country, its marvelous ideals,
and its great republican values,
then I suggest that the treason
lies elsewhere*.

• Medical Aid 'Illegal'
Editor, The Daily:
We support the right to pro
test America's foreign policy in
Southeast Asia but we denounce
the actions of the Medical Aid
Committee for Vietnam (North).
Actions which arc immoral and
illegal should never be con
doned, and not long tolerated.
The Medical Aid Committee
for Vietnam has repeatedly said
I hat it will raise money for med
ical supplies to be given to the
North Vietnamese and the areas
of South Vietnam under control
of the Viet Cong. It seems clear
that these activities constitute
a serious danger to the estab
lishment of world peace. In the
Twentieth Century, war involves
the entire economic resources of
a nation. Therefore even a cas
ual observer would see that,
even were aid only to reach
civilians, it would simply result
in other material being released
to belligerents. The surest way
to engineer a war of attrition in
Vietnam is to aid the other side.
Aid and comfort to enemies of
the United States constitutes
treason. The legal advisors of
fice to the Department of State
has stated publicly that any aid
given by an American citizen to
either the "National Liberation
Front" or North Vietnam would
in the opinion of the Depart
ment be a violation of law.
By permitting this drive to
continue, Stanford University is
acquiescing in what seems clear
ly a violation of Federal law.
We call upon the authorities of
this University — Student, Fac
ulty, and Administrative -— to
end any silent partnership in a
criminal conspiracy.
The right of free expression
does not obligate the University
to stand by while its property
is being used to perpetrate
crime; nor should the students
stand by while the reputation of
their University is corrupted by

the immoral and illegal actions
of a few.

• Drama Dept. Kipped
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Sharp's incredible
letter in Monday's Daily under
lines the insensltlvity with
which the Department of Drama
and kindred interests have dealt
with supporters of extracurricu
lar drama over a number of
years, to an increasing extent.
How far away from reason the
Professor has gone can best be
shown by his own remark, in
which he allows that "one hor
ror in drama departments in a
university is their insistence on
letting untrained undergraduates
present their theatrical image to
an adoring or unadoring public.
The reaction is seldom honest.
Always underneath any adula
tion is the stated or understood
'for a college production.' As a
consequence, students get a false
sense of their own talent and
audiences gradually lose their
taste. Most of them, very sensi
bly, go to the movies." A state
ment like this, considering the
delicacy of the present situation,
is intemperate and fatuous.
The point, simply, is that there
are areas of student drama that
fall outside the professional con
cern of the Department of Dra
ma, that these areas keenly rep
resent the interests of a large
portion of students, that student
interests of this sort are a pre
eminent part of the entire Uni
versity program and that the
Department of Drama has no
right—and it might realize, no
need—to supplant these inter
ests. The students have deter
mined for themselves that in
formal dramatic activity of the
type provided by Ram's Head
allows the most effective outlet
for their talents, and any ac
tions, intentional or otherwise,
that tend to reduce the effective
ness of this outlet represents a
grim sort of professional censor
ship.
Ram's Head lias been victim
ized by an extensive shuffling of

schedules and facilities. It is dif
ficult to imagine some of the
lavish Spring Show musicals of
the past being staged in the Lit
tle Theatre, where one misstep
would send an actor plunging
into the orchestra pit, were
there an orchestra pit to speak
of. The Nitery, despite the de
lightful opportunities it provides
for professional experimentation,
is by any reasonable standard
an outhouse among theatrical
facilities, and any attempt to
relegate unwilling stud en t
groups to these premises is akin
to telling them to go wave then
arms and shout their lines into
a dark corner whene they can't
embarrass themselves or their
elders.
Nobody can deny the advan
tages to the University and to
drama that will follow from the
important advances which have
been made recently at Stanford.
But these new activities are sim
ply not competitive with tradi
tional forms of student drama,
and with a little good will and a
bit of circumspection most seri
out conflicts could bo avoided.
But the good will seems long in
coming; any observer who cares
enough to knock the dust off the
Associated Students records will
find that the recent history of
Ram's Head largely has been
one, long fight, repeated every
year, to obtain even minimal re
hearsal time in an auditorium
built with student tuition funds
voted, ostensibly, by the stu
dents themselves, and hand
somely equipped and supported
by Ram's Head revenue. Even
the scheduling of public per
formances themselves has de
pended on the preemptory claims
of other drama interests and of
other interests not even vaguely
related to student desires.
Even the most ardent support
ers of Ram's Head will admit

but this is, and is supposed to
