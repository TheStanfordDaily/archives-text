## Education At Stanford- An 'Orifical' Experience 
### 
The transcontinental piano
trip, once a relatively infrequent
and novel event for the average
individual, is in this jet age a
common and mundane occur
rence which must, at best, bo
coped with.
To succor the disinteicsted
passenger through five hours of
anxiety, various devices and con
coctions stimulate all the sense
organs and fill nearly all the
orifices. A piping-hot, pre-fab
meal, a complete bar, multi
channel Muzak, and a first-run
(and last-run) movie dot the
menu. Seemingly the only miss

ing comforter is Soma. Looking
out the window disturbs the oth
er passengers who want to see
the movie.
Like the ride from San Fran
cisco to New York is the trip
through Stanford (at slightly in
creased fee and time duration).
The "Guide to a More Pleasant
Journey" must contain these
items of information: "Quite a
variety of channels are open to
the passenger, but choose no
more than five a quarter; do not
tune in for longer than a quar
ter because the programs repeat
themselves. Deadline for drop
ping channels is Nov. 2.
"Once the trip has started the
passenger is advised not to at
tempt departure severe intel
lectual depressurization will oc
cur. with accompanying bubbles
of academic snobbery in the
bloodstream. To supplant the
lack of oxygen on the trip, ster
ile air will bo provided. Most
passengers find it more comfort
able to keep their seat bolt fas
toned during the whole trip and
to remain in one place. Passen
gers may smoke only tobacco,
and no one under 21 will bo al
lowed to consume alcoholic bev
erages, at least while the stew
ardess is looking."
"This is your captain speak
ing (this is a recording). We
will be departing soon — our
speed will be fast, the altitude,
high (airsickness bags arc with
in easy reach). Stanford Airlines
would like to remind you that
riding on this plane is a privi
lege, not an opportunity. I'm
driving the plane, so you are ad
vised not to bitch. Passengers
are not allowed in the cockpit
since we will bo on automatic
pilot. The stewardess will be
around to offer you coffee, tea,
or panacea. Hope you have a
privileged trip."
"Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen,
this Is your stewardess, Miss
Jane Stanford. Before we depart,
I'd like to add a few words to
what the captain said: since
there are more men than woman
today, men and women will sit
on opposite sides, even at the
risk of an unbalanced flight.
The one toilet on board is
equipped with a non-sectarian
Bible. Stanford Airlines flies on
the premise that you are mature
men and women; any passen
gers engaging in conduct un
worthy of such will go the 'Odd
job' route."
And so the trip goes: you
must not. look out the window
since the other passengers are
watching the movie and require
total darkness to sec. Keep ear
phones in auditory orifices at
all times—failure to do so has
resulted in a peculiar syndrome,
characterized by fixation on the
earth below, known as the
"think" syndrome. More than
one discontented passenger suf
fers from this malady.
When the plane arrives at its
destination, you may unfasten
your seatbelt, detach earphones,
stretch, smile at your friendly
stewardess and thank her for
the stimulating journey (she will
make sure you have left nothing
behind). You have reached your
destination, the adult world
(only you may bo surprised that
others, not on the plane, have
arrived too, some by train, some
hitchhiking) and Stanford Air
lines got you there (on time);
this is a result of Stanford Air
line's careful handling.
Walk away from the airplane
(don't look back—the plane is on
the edge of greatness and may
have fallen over) and go home
and watch TV for the rest of
your life.
