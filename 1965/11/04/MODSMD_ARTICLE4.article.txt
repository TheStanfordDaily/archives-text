# Stanford-Based CONSCIENCE Planning 2000-Campus 'Lecture-In'
## 
### RON PEDROZA 
National co-chairmen of the new
CONSCIENCE group supporting
American policy in Vietnam yesterday
expressed hope that 1500 to 2000 col
lege campuses will participate in a
nationwide "lecture-in" November 22,
organized by the Stanford-based com
mittee.
Hal S. Scott and Michael S. Cum
mings, speaking in a seven-man panel
at Tresidder Union, described the en
thusiastic response students through
out the nation have given CON
SCIENCE and said that over 2100
signatures have been collected at
Stanford on a petition expressing "ba
sic agreement with U.S. policy in
Vietnam."
"The lecture-in program's purpose,"
said Scott, "is to unite the supporters
of the Administration's basic policy
in Vietnam and close the issue of
where the vast majority of American
students stand."
In response to letter mailed Friday,

October 29, CONSCIENCE the Com
mittee On National Student Citizen
ship In Every National Case of Emer
gency has obtained the support of
colleges i'n 47 states; the other states
have yet to reply. In California, the
University of California at Berkeley
and Los Angeles, the University of
Southern California, and San Diego
State College were among the first to
join Stanford in the program.
Jim Rummonds, co-chairman of
CONSCIENCE at Stanford, said that
many students are supporting CON
SCIENCE because they "resent being
classified with the small minority of
students who give spiritual aid to the
Viet Cong." Mark Schiambor, Berke
ley chairman, cited another reason;
"Cal has declined in state and na
tional opinion because of the irrepre
sentative Viet n a m demonstrations
here."
Panel moderator Kurt Pidduck and
members Jeff Chinn. Robert Naylor,
Frank Verlot, and Jim Rummonds

aided the co-chairmen in giving the
reporters the purpose of CON
SCIENCE and its activities on the
Stanford campus.
The founders of CONSCIENCE felt
that the student opinion demonstrated
on college campuses was not repre
sentative of the majority of students.
They wish to prove the majority's
support through the expected turnout
for the national lecture-in on Novem
ber 22.
Naylor emphasized that CON
SCIENCE wishes to demonstrate
"positive support of our Vietnam pol
icy; it is not a protest against the
protests."
The campus chairmen of CON
SCIENCE will seek prominent speak
ers for the lectures, in many cases
national figures. The Stanford chair
men have asked the U.S. government
for assistance in securing speakers
for several schools. The speakers will
be men who, although they may differ
on tactics in the Vietnam war. agree

with basic U.S. policy and advocated
moderate, informed, intellectual criti
cism.
CONSCIENCE agrees with Ihe
right to dissent, but does not agree
with the aims of the demonstrations
against U.S. Vietnam policy.
"Moreover," said Scott, citing a re
cent James Reston column in the New
York Times, "the peace marchers are
actually reducing the chances of peace
because Hanoi interprets the dissent
as U.S. weakness."
CONSCIENCE is circulating a peti
tion to all the campus living groups
asking students to record their basic
agreements with the above stated pol
icies and t lie basic U.S. commitment
to remain in Vietnam until a satis
factory agreement securing the free
dom of the South Vietnamese people
is reached.
Scott said CONSCIENCE is being
supported by private contributions
and only those organizations who sub
mit a policy statement agreeing with
CONSCIENCE' aims. CONSCIENCE
has received about $400 so far.
