# ARMY SOCIETY LEADS, 253-52
## Blood Drives Reach Midpoint 
### HAL HUGHES 
The week-long blood drive of two
groups representing opposite posi
tions on America's involvement in
Vietnam moved past the half-way
point today.
Walter Army Society, an ROTC
honor organization, is soliciting blood
donations for casualties in South Viet
nam. Medical Aid Committee for Viet
nam. which opposes U.S. participation
in the war, seeks blood and financial
aid for civilians injured by U.S. bomb
ings in North Vietnam.
The Army Society, which is being

helped in its drive by six other cam
pus organizat ions, r e e e iv e d 103
pledges yesterday ot bring its total to
253 pints.
CONSCIENCE, a recently formed
national organization supporting U.S.
policy in Vietnam, is helping in the
drive.
The Medical Aid Committee, with
about 20 members helping in the
drive, received 14 more pledges yes
terday, bringing its total pledge to 52
pints of blood and $180.
The Committee is trying to contact
the International Red Cross in Geneva

to see what methods can be used to
assure that its aid would be distrib
uted only to civilians.
Robert Clark, vice-president of the
Walter Army Society and chairman
of their blood drive, said his group
was "content to act instead of talk
ing." He said he was pleased with
coverage the drive was getting in the
national press and television.
"We're glad to discuss the issues,
and don't feel that civil disobedience
is necessary," Clark added.
Stuart Mc√üae, co-chairman of the
Medical Aid Committee, stated that
he was most happy with the dona
lions, but that he was disappointed
with student apathy. He said his
group experienced no unpleasant
scenes except for three groups of
"young-looking" men who would come
to the table, mumble "traitors," and
sulk off.
Tomorrow is the final day of both
drives.
