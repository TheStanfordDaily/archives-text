# Right Of Silence Asked In Upcoming LASSU Bill
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A resolution restricting the audible
range of loudspeakers used in student
rallies will he introduced tonight in
the Legislature's regular meeting.
Stating that "the rights to not listen
and not participate" in demonstra
tions are "equally important" as the
right of public assembly, the resolu
tion would ban the use on campus of
loudspeakers with a range exceeding
100 yards. Frank Verlot will sponsor
the proposition.
The loudspeaker resolution comes
in response to Tuesday's noisy rally
in White Memorial plaza of the Med
ical Aid Committee for Vietnam. Stu
dents made several attempts to turn
down the volume of amplifiers used
by speakers. One engineering student,
a member of Verlot's constituency,
complained that the noise was inter
fering with his studies and said he
planned to complain to the University.
Appointment Ban
Upcoming LASSU business includes
a By-law amendment to abolish the
appointing of LASSU representatives
when vacancies arise. Sponsored by
Carl Anderson, the amended bill may
be reported out of the By-laws com
mittee tonight and possibly voted on
next week.
The bill provides for a special elec
tion to fill any vacant seat and gives
living groups the "standing power"
to hold such elections. Certain organ
izations will also have the 1 authority

to hold special elections for vacancies
in related constituencies. By this plan,
for instance, Law Association would
fill a vacancy in the Graduate School
of Law.
The bill was introduced last month
after speaker Jay Kadane made sev
eral interim appointments to vacant
graduate student seats, as provided
by the existing By-laws. This move
encountered some opposition and in
one case Kadane's appointee was sub
sequently defeated in the formal elec
tion to fill his seat.
Fifteen Report
Other business will include a report
by the student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, including a descrip
tion of the discussions on the Union
residence dispute.
Old business left over from the
tumultuous meeting October 28 in
cludes a resolution condemning the
National Selective Service policy of
considering the academic year as
three consecutive quarters, Fall
through Spring. Another resolution
urges an investigation of the possi
bility of improvement of Teaching
Assistants' salaries.
Important legislation concerning
Union residence and women's social
regulations may be reported out of
committee at tonight's meeting, al
though this had not been decided at
press time yesterday.
The meeting will begin at 7:30 p.m.
in room 320.

Old business left over from the
tumultuous meeting October 28 in
cludes a resolution condemning the
National Selective Service policy of
considering the academic year as
three consecutive quarters, Fall
through Spring. Another resolution
urges an investigation of the possi
bility of improvement of Teaching
Assistants' salaries.
Important legislation concerning
Union residence and women's social
regulations may be reported out of
committee at tonight's meeting, al
though this had not been decided at
press time yesterday.
The meeting will begin at 7:30 p.m.
in room 320.
A resolution restricting the audible
range of loudspeakers used in student
rallies will he introduced tonight in
the Legislature's regular meeting.
Stating that "the rights to not listen
and not participate" in demonstra
tions are "equally important" as the
right of public assembly, the resolu
tion would ban the use on campus of
loudspeakers with a range exceeding
100 yards. Frank Verlot will sponsor
the proposition.
The loudspeaker resolution comes
in response to Tuesday's noisy rally
in White Memorial plaza of the Med
ical Aid Committee for Vietnam. Stu
dents made several attempts to turn
down the volume of amplifiers used
by speakers. One engineering student,
a member of Verlot's constituency,
complained that the noise was inter
fering with his studies and said he
planned to complain to the University.
Appointment Ban
Upcoming LASSU business includes
a By-law amendment to abolish the
appointing of LASSU representatives
when vacancies arise. Sponsored by
Carl Anderson, the amended bill may
be reported out of the By-laws com
mittee tonight and possibly voted on
next week.
The bill provides for a special elec
tion to fill any vacant seat and gives
living groups the "standing power"
to hold such elections. Certain organ
izations will also have the 1 authority

to hold special elections for vacancies
in related constituencies. By this plan,
for instance, Law Association would
fill a vacancy in the Graduate School
of Law.
The bill was introduced last month
after speaker Jay Kadane made sev
eral interim appointments to vacant
graduate student seats, as provided
by the existing By-laws. This move
encountered some opposition and in
one case Kadane's appointee was sub
sequently defeated in the formal elec
tion to fill his seat.
Fifteen Report
Other business will include a report
by the student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, including a descrip
tion of the discussions on the Union
residence dispute.
