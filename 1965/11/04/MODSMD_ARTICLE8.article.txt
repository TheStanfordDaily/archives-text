# RELIGION ON CAMPUS
## Good: 'Worship Key To Freedom' 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor (Fifth in a series 
"There is widespread and strong
opinion for freedom of worship. If it
is nol soon resolved in the only way
il can possibly be resolved, all sorts
of crimps will be thrown at the Presi
dent's Advisory Committee on Reli
gious Affairs," Prof. Edwin M. Goori
told The Daily yesterday.
"Worship is the basic issue in the
current evaluation of religion; with
out resolution of this issue," hp con
tinued. "it is impossible to establish
the limits of student religious life on
campus.
"Worship is obviously a major part
of religion. If it is curtailed, all other
religious activity is limited. But if il
is free, all else is allowed. Because
many other things go automatically
with worship, constraints arc placed
around the Committee's consideration
of other religious activities until the
question of worship is decided."
On how it is to be decklcd, Uoull

has felt for years that "freedom of
worship is the only live option for
recognition of the facts of contempo
rary life and of Stanford history.
"To implement the non-denomina
tional religion specified bv Mrs. .Stan
ford, the University has two alter
natives. First, it can acknowledge the
increasing importance of Catholics,
Jews, and other non Protestants and
recognize the integrity of all demoni
nations. Or it could press the 'general
religion' idea of Mrs. Stanford by re
fusing to recognize any ecclesiastical
group and denying rights to each one.
In effect, this would be the creation
of a new religion, which was not
her intent."
'Minority Rights'
Good, senior member of the Reli
gious Studies staff, agrees with Chap
lain Minto that the Founding Grant is
enabling, within the context that Hie
University cannot and will not be tied
to any eeeclosiastieal organization.
The intent was to avoid denomina
tional identification. This has been
successfully aceomoli- hed hut the in

tout might better Ik- served by recog
nition of all faiths.
"Memorial Church is Protestant
not denominational and will remain
basically Protestant. But Protestants
as members of the largest party have
the obligation to provide minorities
with their rights, which certainly in
cludes freedom of worship. Such a
solution in no way contravenes the
charter documents," he said.
Good hopes that "there will be stu
dents sitting on the President's Com
mittee on Religious Activities." "The
only iliing people think of is having
student participation on the Commit
tee." he stated, i ASSU vice president
Clark Brown submitted two weeks
ago a petition to committee chairman
Richard Lyman requesting three stu
dents be granted seats on the Com
mittee. an arrangement similar to
those for other Presidential Advisory
Committees. The Committee acted on
the petition but "the answer must
come from the President." according
to Lyman. Sterling returns to campus
in a week and a half.)

"Whether or nut there are students
on the Committee, student opinion
must be grist for the mill. The Berry
money is being spent on the stu
dents." he said. (The Berry money is
$30,000 a year income from a $1.3 mil
lion gilt from alumnus Lowell Berry.)
'Initiative Vital'
"For student religious life to be
vital, students must be interested.
This will be accomplished if some of
the initiative comes from them. The
identification of the things to be done
should come from the students.
"The best service the students can
do now is to think."
It is also obvious that the involved
people should be consulted, too.
In contrasting the current situation
to that in the past. Good thinks it
"immeasurably better. The quality of
both the denominational ministers
and the students is higher. The inter
ests pursued and the questions asked
are deeper. They are in the vanguard
of experiment instead of being pari
of a salvage operation."
