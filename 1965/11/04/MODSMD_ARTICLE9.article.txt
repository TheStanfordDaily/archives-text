LARKSPUR (APi The Northern
California president of the Hell's An
gels motorcycle club told a Redwood
High School audience here Wednes
day that the Hell's Angels will
counter-demonstrate at all future anti
war demonstrations in the area,
Ralph Hubert Barger, 27, of Oak
land, had been invited to speak by an
American government class teacher.
The Berkeley based Vietnam Day
Committee, which plans a march pro
testing U. S. involvement in Vietnam
Nov. 20, had also been invited, but
declined.
"We'll counter-demonstrate when
ever there's a demonstration," said
Barger, "But there's no need to fear
us. We just like to get on our motor
cycles and have a good time."
Members of the Oakland Hell's A'n
gels tried to tear a Vietnam Day
Committee banner when a previous
protest parade was stopped by police
at the Oakland city limits Oct. 16. A
Berkeley policeman suffered a broken
leg in the scuffle that followed. One
Hell's Angel was charged with as
sault.
During a question and answer pe
riod. one student accused Barger of
holding fascist views.
"112 don't claim to be a good example
to the American public," Barger told
one student later.
Another asked him what his view
of a good American was.
"I really can't say -everybody has
a different meaning. I'm not a politi
cal scientist, I just went through the
ninth grade," the Hell's Angels leader
replied.
