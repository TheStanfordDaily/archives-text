The Only Cause to Die For •
Youth is a time for commitment to a cause, for service to humanity, for revo
lution against the injustices of the day. The trouble with most peace move
ments, worthy causes, and protest groups is their unrealistic foundations and
missing spiritual resources. It is one thing to stir up a storm and quite another
to accomplish any lasting results; it is easy to raise questions, but harder to
effect a cure.
The missing power »n many groups, and churches, and movements of reform,
is Jesus Christ. The missing "something" in many human hearts, the answer
to that human need to "be somebody is Jesus Christ. It was Jesus Christ who
said, "He would find his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake
and the gospel's will find it." In a universe where a sovereign God still holds
the strings of history it just doesn't pay to serve counterfeit causes or to be
content with second best.
Perhaps you've wondered about the zeal of early Christian martyrs or th
fire of Wesley, Calvin, Luther and Knox. Do you know that the fire and power
of a living Christ are just as available today? If you mean business with God
why not rise to the claims of Jesus Christ as Paul did when he found out,
it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20). The
cause of Christ still is the most dangerous and revolutionary cause the world
has ever seen, but it is a cause which is guaranteed not to foil. What every man
finds in Jesus Christ he can never lose; a Christian knows, not believes, he pos
sesses eternal life. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribu
lation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written, 'For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are re
garded as sheep to be slaughtered'. No in all these things we are more than
conquerors through him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to sep
arate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8 35-39).
Experience is the best test of truth, and there is nothing like joining the
club to get the inside story. Why not check out the cause of Christ' and find
out for yourself He really is worth dying for.

sesses eternal life. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribu
lation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written, 'For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are re
garded as sheep to be slaughtered'. No in all these things we are more than
conquerors through him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to sep
arate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8 35-39).
Experience is the best test of truth, and there is nothing like joining the
club to get the inside story. Why not check out the cause of Christ' and find
out for yourself He really is worth dying for.

The Only Cause to Die For •
Youth is a time for commitment to a cause, for service to humanity, for revo
lution against the injustices of the day. The trouble with most peace move
ments, worthy causes, and protest groups is their unrealistic foundations and
missing spiritual resources. It is one thing to stir up a storm and quite another
to accomplish any lasting results; it is easy to raise questions, but harder to
effect a cure.
The missing power »n many groups, and churches, and movements of reform,
is Jesus Christ. The missing "something" in many human hearts, the answer
to that human need to "be somebody is Jesus Christ. It was Jesus Christ who
said, "He would find his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake
and the gospel's will find it." In a universe where a sovereign God still holds
the strings of history it just doesn't pay to serve counterfeit causes or to be
content with second best.
Perhaps you've wondered about the zeal of early Christian martyrs or th
fire of Wesley, Calvin, Luther and Knox. Do you know that the fire and power
of a living Christ are just as available today? If you mean business with God
why not rise to the claims of Jesus Christ as Paul did when he found out,
it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20). The
cause of Christ still is the most dangerous and revolutionary cause the world
has ever seen, but it is a cause which is guaranteed not to foil. What every man
finds in Jesus Christ he can never lose; a Christian knows, not believes, he pos
sesses eternal life. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribu
lation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written, 'For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are re
garded as sheep to be slaughtered'. No in all these things we are more than
