In his just-published Russia
and History's Turning Point
(New York: Duell, Sloan and
Pearce. Pp. XVI, 558. $8.95),
Alexander Kerensky, teacher of
two senior colloquia at Stanford
this quarter, has written a first
rate political autobiography,
which is not, I am happy to re
port, a personal iconography.
Large, authoritative and defin
itive, this is Krensky's first auto
biography but not, I hope, his
last book.
The thorough, exciting, ex
alted and touching success story
oI a young man "blest because
he was given a chance to plumb

the very depths of human his
tory, to witness the destruction
of an old world and the creation
of a new one", this is a warm
human account of perhaps the
greatest drama of modern his
tory. Concentrating on his few
political years (five) culminat
ing with his seven months in
the Cabinet of the Provisional
Government, Kerensky vividly
describes his early youth, the
preparation for his law career,
his first political involvements,
his election in 1912 (he was then
3] years old) to the Duma, and
finally the brief zenith of his
political life.
Time Was Short
An imaginative and exciting
natural leader eminently capable
of channeling the mass hysteria,

hatred and passion of the times
into an incipient political sys
tem, Kerensky was also a force
ful, impatient and impassionate
doer. Time was short, the tasks
gigantic. Committed to fighting
both obstinate extremes, the
crumbling but cunning auto
cracy and the treacherous but
determined Bolsheviks, Keren
sky also stepped on the wrong
toes. Nervous at signs of coun
terrevolution—justifiably so, as
events soon proved — he con
fused and divided his own sup
porters. But it was his ultimate
inability to reconcile the staunch
and unyielding opposites which
cost him his political life.
Tolstoyan Beliefs
To Kerensky, the events of
March, 1917, stood for the be
ginning of a new era of human
liberty in Russia. Tolstoyan in
his beliefs, Kerensky hoped that
the Revolution would be the
catalyst which would make it
possible to transform men and
endow them with the human
dignity and human rights com
mensurate with their autonomy
as human beings, in a universe
where morality, love and mercy
would rule. The successful Bol
shevik Revolution put a stop to
this hope: Alexander Kerensky,
faithful to his beliefs, has had
to live with this defeat. His per
sonal tragedy became the trag
edy of his nation.
Almost fifty years after his
great personal triumph and de
feat, years he spent in the deep
and cold shadow of 1917, Keren
sky writes now with detach
ment, wisdom, compassion and
wistfulness: "At the end of my
long life, which has been en
tirely passed in the critical years
of our present historical turn
ing point, I can clearly see that
no one gets away with anything
and that: one has to pay for
everything. . . . Man must learn
to live not by hatred and re
venge, but by love and forgive
ness. [Otherwise], the destruc
tive forces which have accumu
lated in the depths of the soul
less mechanical civilization of
the contemporary world will
burst out."
