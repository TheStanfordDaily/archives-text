# Fatherland, Not Marx, Motivates Red Youth

"The international communist
movement in the post-World
War II era has seen a regenera
tion of national aspirations
which lias led to an end of com
munist unity."
The speaker is Alexander Ker
ensky, the 84-year old former
head of the Russian provisional
government overthrown by the
Bolsheviks on November 7, 1917.
He is presently teaching two
senior colloquiems on "The Rus
sian Provisional Government"
and "Contemporary World Poli
tics."
According to Kerensky, the
restoration of a unified com
munist bloc is impossible in the
light of the Sino-Soviet dispute.
In Russia, a "new generation"
has taken over, one which is not
"irreconcilably committed to
Marxist teaching and Leninist
fanaticism." He noted that in
the last war, Stalin was forced
to put aside communist slogans
and urge the defense of 'eternal
Russia.' Stalin admitted as much
to a visiting American, Keren
sky noted, when he said "I know
people will not fight for me, or
for communism, but only for the
fatherland." Historical Russian
heroes were also resurrected.
Nation —Not System
"Thus, the first impression of
the young people who are now
leaders was of a nation—not a
system—defending itself." Since
the war there has been a realiza
tion that "it is impossible to
create a successful economy by
maintaining Leninist or Stalin
ist totalitarian dictatorships."
However, changes "must go very

slow since the apparaticlii (bu
reaucracy) controls everything."
Yet Kerensky cautioned that no
one should expect the "restora
tion of the so-called capitalist
system as the West understands
it. It is impossible, it is stopping
Britain from pursuing Welfare
State policies."
On the international and ideo
logical scene, Kerensky opined
that a majority of Russian com
munists "are against involve
ment in any war — especially
one to be waged over establish
ing a communist government in
some distant country." To the
white-haired Russian Prime Min
ister of 48 years ago, ex-Premier
Khrushchev's speech at the
Bucharest Conference of some
years ago is vital to an under
standing of the Sino-Soviet ideo
logical dispute.
Generations Ago
Khrushchev noted that Marx
and Lenin lived and wrote gen
erations ago, but times have
changed and war is no longer
inevitable. In Kerensky's opin
ion, this means Mao Tse-tung
is "right" on communist doc
trine. "Marx, Lenin and Stalin
all believed military conflict be
tween capitalism and commun
ism is inevitable."
The Chinese policy, then, is to
foster and encourage conflict
wherever possible, such as those

in Vietnam, Malaysia and Pakis-i
tan-India.
Kerensky is unsure of tMo |
efficacy of the United Nations ;
in this field. "I was skeptical of,
its predecessor, the League of !
Nations, and it finished very '
badly. The UN is 'alive' today
because all but one of the big t
countries are there. It is an ■
arena for opinion, but there is
no power—no state power. Thus j
the U.S. contention that the j
question of Vietnam is too im
portant and too serious for the
U.N. is correct."
As an alternative, Kerensky
thinks it necessary to "devise
some continental federations,
and after this, organize a world
council between these five con
federations." He noted that Ihis
setup would be similar to that
of Europe prior to World War I.
No Moral Principle
At the present, he believes
"there are not any moral or
right principles" between states.
As an example, he noted the con
tinuing problem of disarma
ment. "There are always nego
tiations. If you'll notice, you'll
see that about every other year
after World War T there were
meetings in Switzerland on this.
The big powers are still without
trust, and with reason because
of the competition between the
two."
