# Cards Face Green Wave
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford football team
travels into the heart of the
I South Saturday night to meet
the Green Wave of Tulane at
8:00 p.m. in New Orleans. The
Indians are out to reverse last
weekend's Washington fiasco.
Tulane, on the other hand, can
almost look on Stanford as a
1 breather. An extremely arduous

schedule, which has lead Tulane
to a 2-3 record, includes Texas,
Alabama, Miami (Florida), Geor
gia Tech, Mississippi, Mississippi
St., Vanderbilt, Stanford, Flor
ida, and LSU.
All of these teams have boon
ranked in the top 20 and eighl
of thorn in the top ton at one
lime or another this season.
Tribe 2 0
This will be the third game in
a series starting in 1961. Stan
ford has won both games, 9-7 in
'61 and 6-3 in '62.
The Indians will be trying to
find the same Green Wave de
fensive weaknesses which seven
other foes have found to the
tune of 126 points. Tulane's
most lopsided losses have been
to Texas, 31-0 and to Alabama
27-0.
They have also had some up
sets, beating tenth-ranked Mis
sissippi State, 17-15, and defeat
ing a strong Miami club, 24-16.
The favorite weapon of the
Green Wave is sophomore quar
terback Bobby Duhon. lie is
supposedly one of the best sig
nalcallers over to enroll al Tu
lane.
One of Six
Duhon's advocates just may

be right, 100. The 190 pounder
beat out Dave East last year's
starter and tabbed in preseason
as a star. In 1964, East set a
Tulane passing record by com
pleing 85 passes for 816 yards.
Duhon is one of six sophs start
ing in offense.
Duhon's best and therefore
Tulane's best play is the roll-out
pass. A good left-handed throw
er and a strong runner Duhon
is always a threat to go all the
way.
As evidence of this, four of
Tulane's touchdowns this season
have come from passes of over
20 yards; the longest being 71
yards.
In order to cut down his ef
fectiveness, Stanford's front
four of A 1 Wilburn, Bill Ogle,
Mike Hibler, and Monty Molir
mon must keep him in the pock
et and put a hard rush on him.
Pass Defense
Tulane runs a five-four de
fense with two corncrbacks and
two halfbacks. Middle-guard Le
on Verriere and inside-linebacker
Bill Goss anchor the sometimes
porous defense. Both players
were selected to the all-South
eastern Conference team last
year.
If the Indians can hit their
pass receivers, t he Tribe should
have no trouble moving the ball
against Tulane. Of course, the
line will have to do a good job
of pass protection against down
five and stunting linebackers of
Tulane.
The Green Wave often has a
zone coverage with two men in
each half of the field. Thus Stan
ford can flood a zone and theo
retically have receivers open
every time.

Stanford should add win num
ber five if the defense can stop
quarterback Duhon and if Ihe
offense can regenerate their
passing attack.

This will be the third game in
a series starting in 1961. Stan
ford has won both games, 9-7 in
'61 and 6-3 in '62.
The Indians will be trying to
find the same Green Wave de
fensive weaknesses which seven
other foes have found to the
tune of 126 points. Tulane's
most lopsided losses have been
to Texas, 31-0 and to Alabama
27-0.
They have also had some up
sets, beating tenth-ranked Mis
sissippi State, 17-15, and defeat
ing a strong Miami club, 24-16.
The favorite weapon of the
Green Wave is sophomore quar
terback Bobby Duhon. lie is
supposedly one of the best sig
nalcallers over to enroll al Tu
lane.
One of Six
Duhon's advocates just may

be right, 100. The 190 pounder
beat out Dave East last year's
starter and tabbed in preseason
as a star. In 1964, East set a
Tulane passing record by com
pleing 85 passes for 816 yards.
Duhon is one of six sophs start
ing in offense.
Duhon's best and therefore
Tulane's best play is the roll-out
pass. A good left-handed throw
er and a strong runner Duhon
is always a threat to go all the
way.
As evidence of this, four of
Tulane's touchdowns this season
have come from passes of over
20 yards; the longest being 71
yards.
In order to cut down his ef
fectiveness, Stanford's front
four of A 1 Wilburn, Bill Ogle,
Mike Hibler, and Monty Molir
mon must keep him in the pock
et and put a hard rush on him.
Pass Defense
Tulane runs a five-four de
fense with two corncrbacks and
two halfbacks. Middle-guard Le
on Verriere and inside-linebacker
Bill Goss anchor the sometimes
porous defense. Both players
were selected to the all-South
eastern Conference team last
year.
If the Indians can hit their
pass receivers, t he Tribe should
have no trouble moving the ball
against Tulane. Of course, the
line will have to do a good job
of pass protection against down
five and stunting linebackers of
Tulane.
The Green Wave often has a
zone coverage with two men in
each half of the field. Thus Stan
ford can flood a zone and theo
retically have receivers open
every time.

Stanford should add win num
ber five if the defense can stop
quarterback Duhon and if Ihe
offense can regenerate their
passing attack.
The Stanford football team
travels into the heart of the
I South Saturday night to meet
the Green Wave of Tulane at
8:00 p.m. in New Orleans. The
Indians are out to reverse last
weekend's Washington fiasco.
Tulane, on the other hand, can
almost look on Stanford as a
1 breather. An extremely arduous

schedule, which has lead Tulane
to a 2-3 record, includes Texas,
Alabama, Miami (Florida), Geor
gia Tech, Mississippi, Mississippi
St., Vanderbilt, Stanford, Flor
ida, and LSU.
All of these teams have boon
ranked in the top 20 and eighl
