# Frosh Ready For Unbeaten UCLA Squad
## 
### ARLEN HOLTER 
"This will be toughest team i
we have faced all year and we i
will have to play our best game
of ihe season in order to win."
With these words Coach Dick
Vermiel set Ihe stage for this ,
afternoons tilt between his Stan- j
ford Frosh and the Brubabes;
from UCLA. UCLA enters the ;
game undefeated, as to the Indi-!
ans, including a victory over the |
Cal Frosh 2G-7.
The Brubabes are led by Rick
Purdy, a 210 pounder, who plays i
quarterback like they do at Ohio I
State. He leads the squad in j
both passing and rushing and 1
personally rushed for 17(1 yards j
against Cal.
Favorite Receiver
When he is not running with
the ball, Purdy's favorite receiv
er is split end, Mike Dexter, a
sprinter with a great pair of
hands. To keep the middle of the
defense honest, Purdy has a
good fullback in Mike Berghal. j
The Uclan defense is spearhead-!
Ed by Mike Batuista, a hard
nosed linebacker.
The Papooses will enter the
game in fine shape, with all of
the key personnel healthy. Coach
Vermiel has drilled his squad
less on fundamentals and has
avoided heavy contact while con
centrating on teamwork and
timing. He feels that the boys
will be rested and ready to hit
this afternoon.
The Frosh offensive attack is
paced by Greg Broughton, the
200 pounder from La Canada,
who has slashed his way for
325 yards and three touchdowns
in three games. Quarterback
Gene Washington leads in total
offense however, having run for
174 yards and passed for 197.
Bruce Cass heads the receivers
with five receptions for 69 yards.
This is the last game for what
many experts believe is the best
freshman team in Stanford his
tory. Hopefully, this game will
be a preview of many Indian
victories in the next three years.
