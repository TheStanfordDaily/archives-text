# Poloists Seek Second Win Over USC Today
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
USC's grudge-bearing water
poloists deliver themselves into
the Encina Pool this afternoon at
3:30. The Indians drew the last
straw and broke the horses' back
with it earlier this season. The
12-10 Stanford victory was a tribe
first in USC's pool.
Southern Cal's scoring threat
comes in a small, but not easily

contained bundle. Roy Saari and
Dean Willeford, each of whom
scored five goals against Stan
ford, handle the vast majority of
the Trojan shooting chores—and
scores.
The Stanford-USC game three
weeks ago saw eight Trojans
foul out of ihe game, Saari being
the only starter left. Six Indians
bit the foul dust in the unusually
refereed contest.
]>«'ptli Deciding Factor
Stanford's superior depth came
to the fore, as the tribe was able
to bottle up the Saari situation,
which meant corking the Trojan
offense. Meanwhile, the Indian
second string poured in the goals
needed to preserve the Stanford
win.
Stanford will have the home
pool advantage this time, but will
be playing without one advan
tage present at Ihe first TJSC
game. Gary Sheerer, the tribe's
chief scorer as a sophomore,
came home from the USC game
with an eight goal performance.
He came home from San Jose
State two weeks ago with a
broken hand.
The loss of one outstanding
player, however, does not hurt
Stanford's style of play as much
as it would, say, USC's. Stan
ford's offense emphasizes ball
control and low foul rate, always
working for the opening where
a man can break clear for the
goal.
This pattern does not depend
on a single player, but on the
efficiency of the offensive unit
as a whole. In a game, one
player will not dominate the
shooting.
Heady: Aim ... Fire!
Pete Ready, a sophomore, has
taken over as the Indian high
scorer since the loss of Sheerer.
When the fast break offense
stalls, Ready is a constant threat
from the hole with a variety of
powerful backhand and sizzling
sweep shots.
Mike Eshleman, varsity cap
tain, gets the defensive assign
ment on the opponents' most
dangerous shooter. Eshleman
will have the task this afternoon
of keeping the Trojan's big
horse, Roy Saari, from galloping
away goalward into the sunset.
Eshleman is also among the
tribe triumvirate of high scorers,
despite his defensive specializa
tion.
Mark Parmely and Bill Meyer,
two sophomores, are shooters
to be given more than slight
consideration by the opposing
goalie. Parmely and Meyer have
averaged at least a goal a game
over the last several weeks.
Parmely also handles the sprint

ing task at the start of each
quarter.
Jeff Bock, a senior, and Rill
Derrig and Doug Jensen jun
iors, form a vital segment of
tho tribe attack. Both have
marked clopto characteristics
when it comes to opponents'
passes. A stolen pass often sets
up the fast break that catches
opponents by surprise and re
sults in a Stanford goal.
Goalies Vance Simonds and
Mike Sorem have brought the
Cards out of more than a few
clutch situations. Simonds han
dles the deep end chores while
Sorem, 6'-4", defends the over
sized gofd in shallow end pools.
Doug MaeeLan, Craig Brown,
and Walt Poterbin, all sopho
mores, give the Indians their
strong bench. Losing a player to
four fouls creates no huge de
gree of distress.
Fresh Take on 112 S>l
Stanford's freshman team,
sitting on a 9-1 record, face the
College of San Mateo this after
noon after the varsity game.
CSM should provide the stiffest
competition yet for the squad

scribes as "the best swimming
team playing water polo in the
United States."

competition yet for the squad
that varsity coach Gaughran de
scribes as "the best swimming
team playing water polo in the
United States."
USC's grudge-bearing water
poloists deliver themselves into
the Encina Pool this afternoon at
3:30. The Indians drew the last
straw and broke the horses' back
with it earlier this season. The
12-10 Stanford victory was a tribe
first in USC's pool.
Southern Cal's scoring threat
comes in a small, but not easily

contained bundle. Roy Saari and
Dean Willeford, each of whom
scored five goals against Stan
ford, handle the vast majority of
the Trojan shooting chores—and
scores.
The Stanford-USC game three
weeks ago saw eight Trojans
foul out of ihe game, Saari being
the only starter left. Six Indians
bit the foul dust in the unusually
refereed contest.
]>«'ptli Deciding Factor
Stanford's superior depth came
to the fore, as the tribe was able
to bottle up the Saari situation,
which meant corking the Trojan
offense. Meanwhile, the Indian
second string poured in the goals
needed to preserve the Stanford
win.
Stanford will have the home
pool advantage this time, but will
be playing without one advan
tage present at Ihe first TJSC
game. Gary Sheerer, the tribe's
chief scorer as a sophomore,
came home from the USC game
with an eight goal performance.
He came home from San Jose
State two weeks ago with a
broken hand.
The loss of one outstanding
player, however, does not hurt
Stanford's style of play as much
as it would, say, USC's. Stan
ford's offense emphasizes ball
control and low foul rate, always
working for the opening where
a man can break clear for the
goal.
This pattern does not depend
on a single player, but on the
efficiency of the offensive unit
as a whole. In a game, one
player will not dominate the
shooting.
Heady: Aim ... Fire!
Pete Ready, a sophomore, has
taken over as the Indian high
scorer since the loss of Sheerer.
When the fast break offense
stalls, Ready is a constant threat
from the hole with a variety of
powerful backhand and sizzling
sweep shots.
Mike Eshleman, varsity cap
tain, gets the defensive assign
ment on the opponents' most
dangerous shooter. Eshleman
will have the task this afternoon
of keeping the Trojan's big
horse, Roy Saari, from galloping
away goalward into the sunset.
Eshleman is also among the
tribe triumvirate of high scorers,
despite his defensive specializa
tion.
Mark Parmely and Bill Meyer,
two sophomores, are shooters
to be given more than slight
consideration by the opposing
goalie. Parmely and Meyer have
averaged at least a goal a game
over the last several weeks.
Parmely also handles the sprint

ing task at the start of each
quarter.
Jeff Bock, a senior, and Rill
Derrig and Doug Jensen jun
iors, form a vital segment of
tho tribe attack. Both have
marked clopto characteristics
when it comes to opponents'
passes. A stolen pass often sets
up the fast break that catches
opponents by surprise and re
sults in a Stanford goal.
Goalies Vance Simonds and
Mike Sorem have brought the
Cards out of more than a few
clutch situations. Simonds han
dles the deep end chores while
Sorem, 6'-4", defends the over
sized gofd in shallow end pools.
Doug MaeeLan, Craig Brown,
and Walt Poterbin, all sopho
mores, give the Indians their
strong bench. Losing a player to
four fouls creates no huge de
gree of distress.
Fresh Take on 112 S>l
Stanford's freshman team,
sitting on a 9-1 record, face the
College of San Mateo this after
noon after the varsity game.
