# The 						Battle Of The Dramas
## 
### 
Now that the thunder and
smoke have temporarily sub
sided into sniper fire and high
morning fog near the ocean, it's
easy to see who's winning The
Battle of Student Drama.
Nobody.
The Repertory Theater is in
danger of being impaled on the
pens of outraged and articulate
undergraduates. Ram's Head is
slowly suffocating for want of
space to build its sets, rehearse
its shows, and stage its produc
tions.
Student Drama is acquiring
nocturnal vision and and learn
ing how to hang from the ceil
ing in the Nitery. (Student dra
ma audiences are advised to do
likewise.) And the Administra
tion, whoever that may be, is
being blamed for the whole
mess.
In short, everybody is losing,
and the real culprits have yet. to
be mentioned.
Doing Its .lob
First of all, none of this is
the Repertory Theater's fault.
It is only doing, and doing well,
the job it was hired to do. How
ever, lest absolute priority be
given tf» its needs, let it be said
that one production doth not a
season make, and that Rain's
Head, with amateurs, did nearly
as good a .job on "Once Upon a

Mattress" last spring as the
Repertory Theater has done on
"That Scoundrel Scapin."
Second, Ram's Head, which
paid t ho salary of a resident di
rector before there was a Drama
Department, which helped with
the fund-raising for Memorial
Auditorium, and which, since
1941. has contributed $38,000, in
equipment for Mem Aud and in
scholarship funds, to the cause
of campus drama, is definitely
not getting a fair shake consid
ering its record of service.
Third, granted that "exciting
things" can be done in the Nit
ei*y, it is still an insult to ask
anyone to pay for the privilege
of being crammed into a glori
fied classroom that looks more
like a bat's cave than a theater.
"A Bird in Hand"
And finally, the Administra
tion quite wisely took the bird
at hand instead of waiting till
a theater could be built to house
it, when the bush might have
been empty.
The real problem in fact is
not the lack of space but the
scheduling of that space, where
the complete absence of coopera
tion and coordination is appal
ling. The Music Department is
holding tooth and claw onto
Dinkelspiel Auditorium; and any
suggestion that it be used for

student drama is met with what
can only be termed complete
hysteria.
The Committee on Public Ex
ercises is apparently unwilling
to schedule anything in Cubber
ley Auditorium. As of now it
may be only serviceable, but
with a coat of paint and a few
more lights it would be eminent
ly suitable for speakers.
And the Speech and Drama
Department has virtually deeded
Memorial Auditorium (and be
cause of sound problems, Little
Theater) to the Repertory Thea
ter for the whole year.
Let's Get Together
If these factions would only
get together and schedule with
an eye to making the maximum
use of the space available, then
student drama could get out of
the Nitery, Ram's Head could do
Winter One-Acts in Little Thea
ter and Spring Show in Mem
Aud, the speakers could speak,
the visiting artists could per
form, and the Music Department
and the Repertory Theater could
still have almost as much time
and space for their concerts and
plays as they have now.
As someone once said, Come,
let us reason together and
quickly, too, before the audience
gets disgusted and goes off to
the movies.

of being crammed into a glori
fied classroom that looks more
like a bat's cave than a theater.
"A Bird in Hand"
And finally, the Administra
tion quite wisely took the bird
at hand instead of waiting till
a theater could be built to house
it, when the bush might have
been empty.
The real problem in fact is
not the lack of space but the
scheduling of that space, where
the complete absence of coopera
tion and coordination is appal
ling. The Music Department is
holding tooth and claw onto
Dinkelspiel Auditorium; and any
suggestion that it be used for

student drama is met with what
can only be termed complete
hysteria.
The Committee on Public Ex
ercises is apparently unwilling
to schedule anything in Cubber
ley Auditorium. As of now it
may be only serviceable, but
with a coat of paint and a few
more lights it would be eminent
ly suitable for speakers.
And the Speech and Drama
Department has virtually deeded
Memorial Auditorium (and be
cause of sound problems, Little
Theater) to the Repertory Thea
ter for the whole year.
Let's Get Together
If these factions would only
get together and schedule with
an eye to making the maximum
use of the space available, then
student drama could get out of
the Nitery, Ram's Head could do
Winter One-Acts in Little Thea
ter and Spring Show in Mem
Aud, the speakers could speak,
the visiting artists could per
form, and the Music Department
and the Repertory Theater could
still have almost as much time
and space for their concerts and
plays as they have now.
As someone once said, Come,
let us reason together and
quickly, too, before the audience
gets disgusted and goes off to
the movies.

Now that the thunder and
smoke have temporarily sub
sided into sniper fire and high
morning fog near the ocean, it's
easy to see who's winning The
Battle of Student Drama.
Nobody.
The Repertory Theater is in
danger of being impaled on the
pens of outraged and articulate
undergraduates. Ram's Head is
slowly suffocating for want of
space to build its sets, rehearse
its shows, and stage its produc
tions.
Student Drama is acquiring
nocturnal vision and and learn
ing how to hang from the ceil
ing in the Nitery. (Student dra
ma audiences are advised to do
likewise.) And the Administra
tion, whoever that may be, is
being blamed for the whole
mess.
In short, everybody is losing,
and the real culprits have yet. to
be mentioned.
Doing Its .lob
First of all, none of this is
the Repertory Theater's fault.
It is only doing, and doing well,
the job it was hired to do. How
ever, lest absolute priority be
given tf» its needs, let it be said
that one production doth not a
season make, and that Rain's
Head, with amateurs, did nearly
as good a .job on "Once Upon a

Mattress" last spring as the
Repertory Theater has done on
"That Scoundrel Scapin."
Second, Ram's Head, which
paid t ho salary of a resident di
rector before there was a Drama
Department, which helped with
the fund-raising for Memorial
Auditorium, and which, since
1941. has contributed $38,000, in
equipment for Mem Aud and in
scholarship funds, to the cause
of campus drama, is definitely
not getting a fair shake consid
ering its record of service.
Third, granted that "exciting
things" can be done in the Nit
ei*y, it is still an insult to ask
anyone to pay for the privilege
of being crammed into a glori
fied classroom that looks more
like a bat's cave than a theater.
