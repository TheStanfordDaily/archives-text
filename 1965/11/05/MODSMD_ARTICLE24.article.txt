## Nietzsche Vs. 'The Peninsula's Only' 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
"Sick are they always," wrote Nietzsche. "They
vomit their bile and call it a newspaper."
Variations ot this perceptive apothegm, though
usually expressed in yet coarser diction, have tumbled
from the lips of overwrought newspaper readers ever
since Plato exoriated the written discourse of his day
for having no "reticences or proprieties."
Students on the peninsula become aware early in
their academic careers of the hang-outs, lives, and
personal habits of prostitutes, junkies, homosexuals
and motorcycle gangs through the good offices of San
Francisco's "Monarch of the Dailies" and her several
competitors.
The assiduous Chronicle reader is more likely to have
an informed opinion on the considerable proportions of
Yvonne IVAngers, the social problems of Dolly Mc-
Masters, or the decorations on the lavatory wall of the
Hell's Angels Clubhouse, than on the status of the New
York mayoralty race.
We expect this sort of nerve-end stimulus and un
thinking playfulness from the big city dailies. Pander
ing to the desires of the many has always, with few
exceptions, been their unique raison d'etre. But there is
a transgression more general to papers, and conse
quently more serious as common in the small paper
as in the large: the desire for controversy.
For the same vital juices animate the Daily editor,
wishing to make his volume "distinctive" or "memor
able," as the crass City Editor, needing to maintain
a level of circulation to keep his job. And the road to
distinction is the route of controversy.
Newspapers thrive on conflict; they lust after the
shocking. Writers are happy to see a quarrel start and
sad to see it. end.
If no antagonisms exist, an ambitious paper—by
artful allegation, by selective quotation—is more than
happy to fire one. And such proclivities make one won
der whether newspapers are the 1 unmixed blessing our
social studies primers always declared them to be.
Whether, in point of fact, they are blessings at all.
Has The Daily itself ever been victim to such inclin
ations? Has it helped flame discord and fragment the
academic community? One example, of many available,
should suffice.
There is a story scarcely anyone knows, about the
Dean Allen Affair last year, or, as the San Francisco
Examiner appellated it,"The Great Stanford Sex
Scandal." For the uninitiated among us, Lucile Allen
was a Dean of Women at Stanford (until last year)
given- according to her more vociferous accusers—to
making indiscrete remarks about the sexual activities
of English TA's—among her other objectionable char
acteristics.
Her inclinations along this line were being docu

merited, as part of a more general report on student
administration relationships, by a student committee.
The report, supposedly a secret affair, was released
prematurely to The Daily when Speaker of LASSU
Ed Shaw discovered a note from a mysterious graduate
student telling him to make the report public or a
group of graduate students would.
Fearing for the context of the report, Shaw released
it to The Daily which, after adducing hundreds of
column inches—and hundreds of pounds—of linotyped
evidence against poor Dean Allen, succeeded in getting
her to resign, as they say, "under pressure."
So goes the story. And almost true.
The note, in point of fact, was not written by a grad
uate student at all. It was rather typed on a Donnor
House typewriter by the Executive Editor of The Dally,
a close confidant of the editor, presumably intending
to prevent any secret deal being made, or break up any
deal which had already been made, between adminis
tration and student government which might preclude
The Daily from getting in its licks at the administra
tion.
Shaw made his decision, the editor made her decision,
The Daily was put to bed "several hundred" dollars late,
and Stanford made the AP wire services. A consid
erable quantity of copy enlivened our campus news
paper for several weeks, and its editor (between inter
views) could feel she had made her little mark on the
Stanford scene.
But how orderly it would have been had the student
government shown the resourcefulness (and perhaps
it did) to quietly pressure the administration into
quietly releasing Miss Allen, depriving the sensational
newspapers of a sex story and working in harmony
with the administration.
But a newspaper thrives on conflict, and those vital
juices were working on an editor and an executive
editor.
I once asked a fellow Daily staffer of some repute,
who is going into professional journalism, what he'd do
if he found himself getting assigned to cover PTA's.
He said, without hesitation, "I'd find Birchers."
Such are the proclivities of the writing fraternity.
Such are, I suppose, my oWn as I write this column.
Dull writers do not survive.
I recall an editor of several volumes ago who asked
in his first editorial "Does A Good Newspaper Have to
Be Dull?" He concluded, as might be expected, that it
doesn't. But to the extent dullness represents responsi
bility, desire for unity which supersedes the desire for
distinctive destruction, and a disdain for the trivial,
perhaps it comprises both a necessary and sufficient
condition for the "good newspaper."
But then again, perhaps such an animal has never
existed.

Maybe we at the University will be constrained to
choose the drastic option advanced by Jefferson in a
letter to John Adams. "I have given up newspapers in
exchange for Tacitus and Thucydides, for Newton and
Euclid, and I find myself much the happier."
(Editor's Note: 31r. Martinson's column was re
ceived |>y The Daily October 27, at which time two
staff members were appointed to investigate the valid
ity of Mr. Magnuson's charges against the former
Daily executive editor —Justin Beck. The essence of
their findings was that the former executive editor
did, indeed, type the anonymous note, and further,
that the Daily editor at the time, Nancy Steffen, wrote
it.
The Daily contacted the former editor by phone
Wednesday evening. She stated in part: "I take full
responsibility for forcing publication of that report...
The first time I read the report, I knew that whatever
the pressures, whatever the circumstances, the report
had to !>e published, not merely because it brought to
light and exposed an appalling situation in the Dean's
Office that had to be corrected, but because the pub
lication of the report in its entirety offered one oppor
tunity for the whole Stanford community to begin
open and free discussion of Stanford's real problems
. . . Justin's part in it was minimal. It was my idea
and I executed it."
The Daily could find no evidence to show that any
other person besides the former executive editor and
the former editor was involved in the note-writing,
incident. All other students involved in the publication
of the Crow-Halversou Report did, to the best knowl
edge of The Daily, act in good faith in all their deal
ings with other students and with the administration.
We cannot support the means used by the former
editor to achieve the laudable ends which she noted
in her statement —"an open and free discussion of
Stanford's real problems''—which in turn led to the
•Indicia! Reform Bill, changes in the social regulations,
and increased student-faculty-administration discus
sion. We are interested in, and committed to, the
achievement of the type of structural reform that |
resulted from the publication of the Crow-Halverson
Report. However, we cannot condone, nor will
we emulate, the methods employed in this instance
to abrogate legtimate and responsible student-faculty
consultation.
As to Mr. Magnusou's comments on the condition of '
American journalism, we would like to conclude, as 1
he did, with a quote from Thomas Jefferson: "If it
were left up to me to choose between government
without newspapers and newspapers without govern
ment, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the
latter.")
