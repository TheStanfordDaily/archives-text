## Vietnam: Blood And Epithets 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Your Tuesday headline, "SC
PV Backs Move For Medical
Help," was misleading, as was,
by omission, the story that fol
lowed.
Since only about 35 of the
SCPV's 180 members attended
Monday's general meeting, those
present felt they could take a
stand, not for the Committee,
but simply as a meeting. Conse
quently ihe statement which
was issued began: "The sense of
the November 1, 1965 general
meeting ... is to commend the
plan of the Medical Aid Com
mittee."
Furthermore, the meeting
made it clear that it supported
that plan "insofar as the Inter
national Red Cross will dispense
the Medical Aid Committee aid
to civilian victims of the bomb
ing" (bold mine.) I understand
that the Medical Aid Committee
is going to some lengths to see
that this is so.
Detailed discussion of the
Medical Aid Committee's pro
gram will continue in the SCPV.
Arguments for and against en
dorsing its plan will be put be
fore the general membership in
an impending mailing.

Editor, The Daily:
There appear to be some mis
conceptions as to the purpose of
Ihe Walter Army Society Blood
Drive and the destination of the
blood being collected. The pur
pose of the drive is two-fold: to
give tangible evidence of our
support of our government's
policy in South Vietnam and to

give "real and personal aid to
those suffering in this conflict."
The goals are of equal impor
tance (in our estimation). We
do wish to help the people of
South Vietnam, as well as voice
a loyalty to our government's
policy.
There is a second point of mis
understanding or perhaps of
misrepresentation. O u r state
ment of policy, which is now
being signed by people wishing
to donate blood to our cause,
clearly explains that the blood
is "to be distributed through the
AMERICAN RED CROSS to
United States and South Viet
namese military casualties and
to the civilian victims of the
war and of the Vietnamese Com
munist terrorism."
We emphasize that the blood
goes to both military AND civil
ian casualties. We have been
misquoted on which civilians are
being helped by the blood we are
collecting. Our statement reads,
"to the civilian victims of the
war" in general, provided they
are in South Vietnam, AND to
civilian victims "of the Vietnam
ese Communist terrorism." We
stress the existence of substan
tial Vietnamese Communist ter
rorism and we intend to bring
aid to the victims of this ter
rorism.
As for the physical need of
the blood. Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara said this
November 1, 1965: "The Depart
ment of Defense does have a
requirement for blood which can
be processed into anti-hepatitis
globulin and albumen for treat
ing shock. These two deriva
tives, unlike whole blood, can be
stored for long periods of time
and are being used to protect

and support our military forces
in Vietnam. Reserve supplies of
anti-hepatitis globulin have been
particularly needed as a result
of the build-up there."

• On Tolerance
Editor, The Daily:
Alter attending the noon rally
at White Plaza Tuesday, I too,
like Prof. Polhemus, felt dis
gusted with the proceedings.
But my disgust, unlike his, did
not focus on the crowd's reac
tion to the speeches- nor even,
in fact, to the opinions ex
pressed by proponents or oppo
nents of present U.S. policy in
Vietnam.
Indeed, more than the simple
fact of U.S. involvement in the
Vietnamese war does Prof. Pol
hemus' vituperative and rather
illogical letter itself contribute
to the shocking behavior and
dangerous thought patterns of
so many of us today.
Intolerance is not. as Prof.
Polhemus would have us believe
the exclusive property of either
proponents or opponents of U.S.
policy. Such epithets as that
writer fan Assistant Professor
in the English Department) em
ployed to describe "the mob" at
White Plaza suggest, rather
ominously, that we have now
reached the stage where any op
position meets with blind, emo
tional. and unreasoning protest
from those opposed. Instead of
the classic two sides to the issue
(pro and con), we quickly have
four more, and even here, oppo
sition meets with counter-attack
more readily than with a rea
soned defense of the original
positions.
But perhaps Prof. Polhemus
has simply ignored, in the midst
of his denunciation, the fact that
Tuesday's gathering was hardly
conducive to the free exchange
of ideas which the professor pre
sumably desires.
How are people in an audience
to rebut a man with a loud
speaker? How register disagree
ment with particular facets of
his presentation? Add to this the
questionable "facts" cited and
the deliberate baiting of the
small, unruly segment of the au
dience by Professor Franklin
and it becomes at least doubtful
that all of the "hecklers" are
anti-intellectual "mental pyg
mies" and "fearful, ignorant,
sadistic people."
Not that I condone the behav
ior of those hecklers. Their
taunts only served to provoke
in reaction pompous sneering
from a speaker who had many
important points to make. No,
before condemning the partici
pants and here I caution my
self as well as Prof. Polhemus—
let us ponder the effects of a
setting, viz. a noon rally, which
not only places the two (or
more) sides on uneven terms,
but also which separates us as
reasonable men.

• Bloody (lootl Show
Editor, The Daily:
1 was on campus the other
day. Over by the plaza two
groups were collecting blood
one for the Viet Cong and the
other for the Hell's Angels. In
stead of the sign-your-name-lay
away type plan each group had
a large stainless steel tube
where donors would slit their
wrists and give according to the
intensities of their beliefs.
1 thought it was a pretty good
idea just like church and the
collection plate- with dollars
floating all over the place how
can you give only a quarter. 1
got in one line, slit my wrists
and held the veins closed wait
ing for my turn. I was uncom
fortable — the flies, heat and
some guy trying to slip a piece
of bread underneath my tongue.
The fellow in front of me got
up to the tube, read the small
print on the sign and found out
he was in the wrong line. He
made a break for the other side
with little drops of blood trac
ing his path. One of our guys
tripped him he slid across the
pavement, blood gushing forth
like a loose garden hose. Both
sides rushed over to get him
over to their tubes. Those who
had both hands free grasped
first the rest of u.s clawed with
our free hand. We tugged and
they tugged until he was gone.
With fights all over the place
1 reached the tube and gave two
squirts some guy slapped my
back and I gave three. I left to
go study someone is going to
have to do something about that
war.

• Academic Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I am tired of hearing tlio.se
elements in our midst who would
make of Stanford what it is not.
We have had enough of the im
potent crying and lofty idealism
that yearns lor an academic
community.
Stanford is not an academic
community; at most only a.small
portion of us here have any such
pretensions. For an academic
community would undoubtedly
apply intellectual conclusions to
its behavior. As one of us this
noon, during Professor Bay's
speech, demanded an American
accent for a change, others of
us bombed the speaker with
wads of paper. A cohort com
posed anti-Semitic epithets.
We enjoy ourselves, and until
something powerful enough
comes along to deny our enthu
siasm and zest for joy, we will
continue to live as we do. We arc
not forced to think about the
issues, so why should we behave
consistently with the norms es
tablished by a mythical academ
ic community. We have no rea
sons to do so. It is only because
1 am so upset that I have had
time to compose this letter. We
want freedom, not the fetters
imposed by an academic free
dom.
