## Searching For God's Idenity 
### 'JACK TRINKLEIN 
Man's quest for the identification
of God presented the theme for
Michael Novaek's lecture in Tresidder
Union last night. The three great his
torical attempts of the western world
the Hebrew, Greek, and Christian
medieval were broadly outlined in his
hour long discussion.
Although Mr. Novack expressed a
desire to speak more on the contempo
rary scene, he remained with the
topic assigned. He expressed this de
sire because of what he believes is
the great variance of present views
with that of the past.
Mystery of Group
God and man were combined in the
very early stages of religious devel
opment. Novack noted. The mystery
of God was the mystery of the group
itself. But individuals soon rose to
contradict this view, "Divine was dif
ferentiated from the simply marvel
ous."
From this differentiation arose the
three views which were discussed.
The Hebraic vision of God is one of
an actoi\ God is pictured in anthro
pomorphic terms through the divine
deeds attributed to Him. The Hebrew
position is to tell stories and not to
tackle philosophical questions; Though
the Old Testament contains contra
dictions. they are simply not regarded.
Cosmic Force
The Greek philosophy is on two
planes of thought, Platonic and Aris
totelian. Plato's contention is that man
seeks sometimes to do good, and this
therefore leads man to think of God
as some sort of attractive force.
Related to Plato's doctrine is Aris
totle's contention that man sometimes
understands. In this manner God is
thought of as the source of harmony
and all that is intelligible, a sort of
cosmic force.
Medieval Christianity became the
inheritor of both the Greek and Jew
ish philosophies. It merged the
straight acceptance of the biblical
stories with the dialectic of Greece.
In this merger Thomas Aquinas
played the leading role.
Synthesis of Aquinas
Aquinas thought of God as a re
sponse to human inquiry. Novack
stated, "We cannot know what God
is like, we cannot point to God. we
cannot even name Him. Regarding
God we are in a very great darkness."
Only the drive of inquiry indicates
there is a God. What He is, is impos
sible to know.
Novack continued to say, "The Me
dieval hypothesis was an attempt to
see how far the human mind can go
in attempting to speak knowing that
speech is inadequate."
A question and answer period con
cluded the program.
