# Republicans Debate Purpose-Principles, Or Why Not Victory?

One problem oi the nepuoiican
Party today is its failure to agree on
whether it is out to win elections or
merely influence the citizenry.
This point was made clear in yes
terday's Young Republican panel dis
cussion on the future of the GOP.
Featured speakers were William
Rusher, publisher of National Review,
representing the conservative view
point; and Prof. Robert Horn of Stan
ford's Political Science Department,
the liberal side.
Also participating were student

leaders Carl Anderson for the con
servative view and Carl Schmidt for
the liberal.
Communicate Principles
Rusher asserted that winning is not
the sole aim of a political party. It
is equally important, he said, to com
municate principles to the electorate.
Prof. Horn then asked for a show
of hands on the question "How many
of you are interested in winning the
1968 election?"
Virtually all hands went up. and a
member of the audience then asked
Rusher, "Doesn't the Republican Party

have to appeal to the voters even it
it means .sacrificing some principle,
since principles are useless on paper
unless we have legislators to enact
t hem?"
"No G<khl To Lose"
Rusher admitted that "It does you
no good to lose if you're right" but
quickly followed by asking "What
good does it do you to win if you're
wrong?"
Schmidt declared that he was not
satisfied wtih a second-rate GOP
which attempts only to influence.
"The Republican Party is good
enough to win," he said. "Our prob
lem is that we don't think enough of
our principles to run a candidate who
can win."
Schmidt was referring to the defeat
of Sen. Barry Goldwater, conservative
Republican candidate in 1964. He and
Prof. Horn traced the troubles of the
GOP to this election, but Anderson
proposed that the party had been in
trouble for 30 years before Goldwater.
Went Downhill
"Liberal Republicans had been get
ting the party's nomination for the
past decade," pointed out Rusher,
"and in this time the Republican party
went downhill.
"I won't say that the Liberals are
responsible for this trend, but I'm
not for handing the party back to
them now."
While Schmidt believed that the
strength of the party depends on the
dialogue between the left and right
within the party. Rusher said this was
another of the GOP's problems.
"Neither faction will accept a candi
date offered by the other faction."
Moderator Richard Noble, a San
Francisco attorney, suggested that
"this may be the reason that Richard
Nixon continues to appear popular;
no one is sure which side of the fence
he sits on."
