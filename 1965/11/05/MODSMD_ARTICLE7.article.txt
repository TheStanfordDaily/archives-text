# Self-Help, Stability, And Growth
## 'Hamlet Program' 
### 
The Army's hamlet program in
South Vietnam is slowly winning out,
reports Captain James G. Bayer, pro
fessor of military science and counter
guerilla warfare.
Before coming to Stanford, Profes

sor Bayer was stationed in South
Vietnam as the first district adviser
to the villages of Can Due and Bhin
Phuc. The military purpose in this
zone was to establish stability and
help growth.

This meant fighting hack against
Viet Cong raids, but mostly helping.
Captain Bayer explains, by working
with "USOM" (United States Over
seas Missiont in establishing schools,
dispensaries and road-building.

"We didn't try to play God," he
said. "We just supplied the necessary
materials and let the villagers take
it from there."
Captain Bayer's advisory team,
composed of a cross-section of Army
specialists, did much experimental
work in chemical fertilizing to boost
the village's rice yield.
"The Viet Cong immediately put
oui the rumor that the fertilizer was
American poison to destroy tin*
crops." he said, "but when the vil
lagers doubled their crops the first
time out. we didn't hear much more
about that."
Captain Bayer went on to tell how
Ihe Can Due villagers built a concrete
replica of the Statue of Liberty about
IS feet high in front of their village
headquarters to show their apprecia
tion of American aid.
(livatest Respect
When asked for an appraisal of his
Vietnamese counterparts, Captain
Bayer had only the greatest respect.
"Properly trained, the Vietnamese
soldier is man-for-man as good as any
of ours. They're brave, smart and
quick to learn; if we can keep the
training going they'll be able to run
their own country."
"You have to remember, though,
that these people have had 10 to 15
years of war already," he added.
"Many of them as members of the
Viet Minli fought the French, and il
they're a little skeptical about occupa
tion troops, it's understandable."
Mayor served in both World War 11
;iiid the Korean Conflict. He has been
decorated with the Air Medal, the
Urcnzc Star, and two unit citations.

materials ami let tlie villagers lake it from there."
The Army's hamlet program in
South Vietnam is slowly winning out,
reports Captain James G. Bayer, pro
fessor of military science and counter
guerilla warfare.
Before coming to Stanford, Profes

sor Bayer was stationed in South
Vietnam as the first district adviser
to the villages of Can Due and Bhin
Phuc. The military purpose in this
zone was to establish stability and
help growth.

This meant fighting hack against
Viet Cong raids, but mostly helping.
Captain Bayer explains, by working
with "USOM" (United States Over
seas Missiont in establishing schools,
dispensaries and road-building.

"We didn't try to play God," he
said. "We just supplied the necessary
materials and let the villagers take
it from there."
Captain Bayer's advisory team,
composed of a cross-section of Army
specialists, did much experimental
work in chemical fertilizing to boost
the village's rice yield.
"The Viet Cong immediately put
oui the rumor that the fertilizer was
American poison to destroy tin*
crops." he said, "but when the vil
lagers doubled their crops the first
time out. we didn't hear much more
about that."
Captain Bayer went on to tell how
Ihe Can Due villagers built a concrete
replica of the Statue of Liberty about
IS feet high in front of their village
headquarters to show their apprecia
tion of American aid.
(livatest Respect
When asked for an appraisal of his
Vietnamese counterparts, Captain
Bayer had only the greatest respect.
"Properly trained, the Vietnamese
soldier is man-for-man as good as any
of ours. They're brave, smart and
quick to learn; if we can keep the
training going they'll be able to run
their own country."
"You have to remember, though,
that these people have had 10 to 15
years of war already," he added.
"Many of them as members of the
Viet Minli fought the French, and il
they're a little skeptical about occupa
tion troops, it's understandable."
