## 
### 
By lON IiOISK and SI J] W K kIZI K
The Legislature last night unani
mously passed a resolution declaring
the Selective Service's policy on stu
dent deferments "unreasonably re
strictive."
The resolution noted that male
Stanford students who attend an over
seas campus during a Summer Quar
ter lose their deferments unless they
attend seven straight quarters.
It also noted that six Stanford stu
dents who attended school Summer
and Autumn Quarter, 19fil, and Win
ter. 1965, but not this past Spring
Quarter, have been drafted.
No Quorum
Four short of a quorum, LASSU
adjourned at 10:35, without acting on
three controversial pieces of legisla
tion:
• A resolution, arising from this
week's rallies on White Plaza, which

would limit the sound range of loud
speakers used for asemblies to 100
yards.
• A related resolution which would
order the Medical Aid Committee for
North Vietnam to "cease and desist
from all solicitations of funds or blood
on the property of Stanford Unrvers
ity" until a "Committee of Experts,"
appointed by the LASSU Speaker,
could "determine the legality of the
MACNV's actions."
• A bill which would reapportion
graduate representation within the
Legislature.
T.A.'s Salaries
Earlier the Legislature passed a
resolution instructing the ASSU
President to "investigate the possibili
ties" of raising the salaries of Teach
ing Assistants and having them ex
empted from federal income tax.
Passed unanimously was a resolu
tion asking the California Scholar
ship Federation to reconsider its pol
icy of restricting student financial aid
grants to the September-June aca
demic year.
In an effort to expedite business, the
LASSU agenda was divided into "non
controversial" and "controversial"
legislation. Acording to Speaker Jay
Kadane, legislation is "noncontrovers
ial" if no one heatedly objects to ii
in the week preceding the meeting at
which it is discussed.
N oiieontroversial
In "non controversial" business,
LASSU passed a resolution setting up
a special ASSU Committee which will
publish precedent cases from the stu
dent judicial council. The accounts
will be compiled without the names of
those involved.
The final version will be submitted
to Legislature for aproval prior to
publication.
In another resolution, LASSU re
quested the ASSU President to in
vestigate the disposition of the $10
automobile registration fee and re
port back on the feasibility of a re
duction.
