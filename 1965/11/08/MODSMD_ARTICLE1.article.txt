## Sen. Kennedy Defends Blood For N. Vietnam 
### 
Compiled from the Associated Press
The heavily criticized Medical Aid committee's collections ol blood and
money for North Vietnam were given unexpected support Friday when Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy told a news conference in Los Angeles that he favored
giving blood to "anybody who needs it."
The Associated Press quoted Kennedy as saying that furnishing blood to
North Vietnam for humanitarian purposes would be in "the oldest tradition of
this country."

The New York senator qualified
these statements by adding that giv
ing blood to the communists could
be done only through an international
agency. To do it directly might be a
violation of U.S. laws, he said.
The question first arose during a
news conference when Kennedy was
asked if he thought those favoring
sending blood to North Vietnam had
gone "too far."
Blood to Anyone
"I'd rather concentrate on the South
Vietnamese, and those who need it,"
Kennedy said, "bin I'm in favor of
giving blood to anyone." He said
"blood can be sent if it is clear that
it is under the International Red
Cross and not in violation of our
statutes."
He was asked if he favored some
student groups' plans to ship Ameri
can blood directly to North Vietnam.
"I'm talking about through an or
ganization like the Red Cross," said
Kennedy. "If it's a blanket question
of would we furnish blood to North
Vietnam, I would furnish it. I think
that's in the oldest tradition of this
country."
Supports Dissent
Kennedy, in California on a speak
ing tour, supported student dissent in
other matters. When asked if he
thought draft card burners had gone
too far, he replied, "If a person feels
that strongly, and wants to make that
kind of sacrifice, he can go and burn
his draft card, and take the conse
quences."
Later, at the University of South
ern California, Kennedy told stu
dents: "I defend the right to dissent,
* the right to criticize. But we must be
careful not to let disagreement with
national policy jeopardize the success
of the efforts in which student par
ticipation has been so important."
In another talk Friday, Kennedy
said nuclear weapons should be
banned from some sections of the
world. He cited South America and
Africa.
Anatole Anton of the Stanford
.Medical Aid conuuittee released a
statement yesterday praising Ken
nedy's "courageous stand," calling
it "strongly pro-Red Cross." The
committee sent a letter to Kennedy
on Wednesday asking for his sup
port, hut it is not known if this
influenced his remarks at the Fri
day press conference.

ganization like the Red Cross," said
Kennedy. "If it's a blanket question
of would we furnish blood to North
Vietnam, I would furnish it. I think
that's in the oldest tradition of this
country."
Supports Dissent
Kennedy, in California on a speak
ing tour, supported student dissent in
other matters. When asked if he
thought draft card burners had gone
too far, he replied, "If a person feels
that strongly, and wants to make that
kind of sacrifice, he can go and burn
his draft card, and take the conse
quences."
Later, at the University of South
ern California, Kennedy told stu
dents: "I defend the right to dissent,
* the right to criticize. But we must be
careful not to let disagreement with
national policy jeopardize the success
of the efforts in which student par
ticipation has been so important."
In another talk Friday, Kennedy
said nuclear weapons should be
banned from some sections of the
world. He cited South America and
Africa.
Anatole Anton of the Stanford
.Medical Aid conuuittee released a
statement yesterday praising Ken
nedy's "courageous stand," calling
it "strongly pro-Red Cross." The
committee sent a letter to Kennedy
on Wednesday asking for his sup
port, hut it is not known if this
influenced his remarks at the Fri
day press conference.

The heavily criticized Medical Aid committee's collections ol blood and
money for North Vietnam were given unexpected support Friday when Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy told a news conference in Los Angeles that he favored
giving blood to "anybody who needs it."
The Associated Press quoted Kennedy as saying that furnishing blood to
North Vietnam for humanitarian purposes would be in "the oldest tradition of
this country."

The New York senator qualified
these statements by adding that giv
ing blood to the communists could
be done only through an international
agency. To do it directly might be a
violation of U.S. laws, he said.
The question first arose during a
news conference when Kennedy was
asked if he thought those favoring
sending blood to North Vietnam had
gone "too far."
Blood to Anyone
"I'd rather concentrate on the South
Vietnamese, and those who need it,"
Kennedy said, "bin I'm in favor of
giving blood to anyone." He said
"blood can be sent if it is clear that
it is under the International Red
Cross and not in violation of our
statutes."
He was asked if he favored some
student groups' plans to ship Ameri
can blood directly to North Vietnam.
"I'm talking about through an or
ganization like the Red Cross," said
Kennedy. "If it's a blanket question
of would we furnish blood to North
Vietnam, I would furnish it. I think
that's in the oldest tradition of this
