llolbrook's presentation closely re
flects Samuel Langhorne Clemens's
own. Twain began lecturing in 1895
to help pay off debts resulting from
poor investments.
Today. Twain is remembered for
his hooks, but in his own day ho was
also a noted lecturer-entertainer. It
was on the platform that he first
wooed and won ihe country.
Twain ANo Toured
As "America's court jester," Twain
was hailed by kings and commoners
alike o'n his world lour in the 1890's.
In explaining bis philosophy Twain
once wrote, "The human race, in its
poverty, has unquestionably one re
ally effective weapon laughter."
Holbrook tries lo capture Ihe spirit:
• >112 the man who said. "Power, money,
persuasion, supplication perscctilion
these can lilt .it a colossal humbug
—pUi.li i' a little, weaken it a little,

century by century; but only laughter
can blow i1 to rage and atoms at a
blast. Against the assault of laughter
nothing can stand."
Researched Twain
At the end of his long and eventful

life, Twain had been honored as a
great humanitarian, author and sat
irist. Holbrook's research on Twain
led him lo base his act on these char
acteristics.
Holbrook, a native of Cleveland,
was educated at Suffield Academy.
Culver Military Academy and Deni
son University. He made his first pro
fessional appearance in his home
town in "The Man Who Came To
Dinner" in 19-12.

stage tour with his wife, featuring
