# Pakistanis Boycott Indians
## I-Center 'Evening Abroad' Disrupted By Student Strife 
### PAMELA LANG 
Stanford's six Pakistani students,
refusing to fraternize with Indian
students while the two nations are at
war, walked out Saturday from an
"Evening Abroad in India, Pakistan,
and Ceylon" program sponsored by
the International Center in Tresidder
Memorial Union.
In a printed statement distributed
at the program, the Pakistanis gave
two reasons for their action -concern
over the Kashmir war and a feeling
that such a joint function would be
"misleading and damaging" now or at
any time.
The Pakistanis reportedly acted on
the advice of the Pakistani Consul in
San Francisco, who yesterday was un
available for comment.
The program at Tresidder featured
Indian and Ceylonese music, dancing,
and fashion, with slides and a movie
illustrating Indian life. It was also to
have included a description of East
Pakistani Bengal and slides of La
hore, West Pakistan.
Shortly after the program Ijegan,
however, Iqbal Adamjce, a Pakistani
introduced by the moderator, an In
dian, as "my friend from Pakistan
Mr. Iqbal," rose to announce his dis
association from the program. He and
the other Pakistani students then left
the room.
Their position was explained in a

mimeographed statement dated No
vember 6, the text of which is us
follows:
"We, the nationals of Pakistan, de
plore the fact thai a joint India-
Pakistan night lias been planned for
this evening, by whatever organiza
tions are involved. We feel that this
is in poor taste at tihs time because
of the following:
"I. Pakistan is at war with India
over the question of self-determina
tion for the people of Kashmir. Can
we indulge in festivities when our
brothers are dying at this very mo
ment for this cause?
"2. Our culture, religion, traditions,
and aspirations are distinctly differ
ent from those of the majority of
Indians. It is lor the protection and
preservation of these values that our
country came into existence at the
expense of incalculable sacrifice. A
joint function of this nature is mis
leading and damaging because the at
titude's of the Indian government re
fuses to recognize and reconcile itself
to the vital differences which neces
sitate the existence of Pakistan as a
nation.
"We appreciate the work of the
International Center and all other
groups on the Stanford Campus in
presenting the culture of the peoples
of the world before the Stanford com
munity and extend to them our co
operation. We would be happy to pre
sent the culture of Pakistan at any
other time."
Balasundrah Krishnamoorthi, the
Indian student in charge of fhe "Eve
ning Abroad," denied that the func
tion was planned to promote a "one-
India" theory. "We had no such
motives," he said yesterday."It is
very unfortunate that the Pakistani
students should feel this way. 1 call
it unfortunate because it was only a
cultural program with no political
overtones.
Pakistani Dissents
Nasar Ahmed, a Pakistani student,
did not wholly support a walk-out at
this time, although it would have been
"iin absolutely different thing if done
earlier." "I hope I am not unpatri
otic," he said, "when I say it was un
wise to do it."
"They were on the horns of an un
pleasant dilemma," said Roger Dob
son. a former resident of Pakistan,
whose slides of the Punjab and Rajas
than were one of the highlights of
Saturday's program. He described, the
incident as "most unfortunately han
dled," but added, "Under the circum
stances, I don't think they had any
other option."
"We do not think that tensions else
where ought to be reproduced on the
campus," said Mrs. Gertrude Will
iams. faculty adviser for the I-Center.
"We do not feel that the I-Center is
involved." The problem is. she added,
"a question of the student's relation
to his own government."
