# Whither Debate?
## 
### 
In light of last week's blood drives in White
Plaza and the outpouring of irrationality and
emotionalism that accompanied them, we feay
that most of this community has joined the larger
society in moving to terminate debate over U.S.
policy in Vietnam.
One is either pro or con on the subject, and
few on either side are still willing to discuss the
whys and wherefores of this increasingly esca
lating conflict. And as more American soldiers
die in Vietnam, this number will necessarily
diminish.
It Is with this in mind that we tend to regard
CONSCIENCE (Committee On National Stu
dent Citizenship In Every National Case of
Emergency) with mixed emotions. Organized
on a bipartisan basis by a group of Stanford
students, this rapidly growing nation-wide com
mittee has announced plans to hold a "synchro
nized 'lecture-in' " November 22 to demonstrate
to "President Johnson and national leaders all
over the world that the great majority of Amer
ican college students feel that it is their respon
sibility to support tho national government at
this time of international crisis."
This 'lecture-in is admittedly a kind of answer
to the November 20 marches ou Washington
and the Oakland Army Base planned by the
Vietnam-Day Committee. Moreover, CON
SCIENCE has declared that all speakers—

though moderates arc preferred—must support
basic Administration policy in Vietnam.
Thus the monologue of the 'teach-in' is to be
rebutted by the monologue of the 'lecture-in.'
Granted, this positive action is much to be pre
ferred over the negative reaction of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce and Hell's Angels genre,
but it is not a debate and not a dialogue.
Two weeks ago, Americans for Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy (ARFEP) all but died aborn
ing—partially because of an immense tactical
blunder in putting Socialist Norman Thomas on
the nation-wide hookup, but mostly because
most Americans (and most students) still do
not want to follow Senator Fulbright's urging
and explore old myths in the light of new re
alities. Ft is the failure of such attempts that
leads the moderates among those who dissent
to join the radical faction that prefers ilratt card
burning to discussion and would rather see a
human torch than a meaningful debate.
In the"Letters" column below, Professor
Dennis Doolin challenges anyone of compe
tence to join him in a dialogue on the Vietnam
question. \Vc hope that the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam finds some one to an
swer this challenge.
And we urge the SCPV, CONSCIENCE, the
Medical Aid to Vietnam Committee, the Walter
Army Society and all the others to plan fewer
polemics and/or competing blood drives and
move toward a more relevant discussion of the
issues.
