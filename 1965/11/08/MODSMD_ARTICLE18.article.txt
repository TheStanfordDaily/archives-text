## Doolin Seeks Vietnam Debate 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I am weary of the often un
informed, innacurate, untrue,
and hysterical presentations
served up as teaeh»ins rather
than the monologues that they
actually are. I am also disturbed
by the protest marches, sit-ins,
and draft-card burn-ins that
work to obscure the oft-stated
and sincere desire of our Gov
ernment to etfect a resolution of
the Vietnam conflict through
negotiation.
Therefore, I would like to en
ter into an informed dialogue
(or debate, if you will) with
someone who advocates a uni
lateral withdrawal of our forces
from South Vietnam, providing
he has at least four of the fol
lowing credentials: 1) he has
read the key statements of Com
munist Chinese, Nationalist Chi
nese, North Vietnamese, Viet
Cong, South Vietnamese, Lao
tian (all three groups), Cambo
dian. Thai. Malaysian, Japanese,
Korean, (North and South), Fili
pino, Indonesian, Indian, Soviet,
British, French, and American
decision-makers over the past
several years; 2) he has a back
ground of some years of study
with regard to Far Eastern de
velopments; 3) he reads at least
one Asian language; 1) he has
read the reports of the Interna
tional Commission for Supervi
sion and Control in Vietnam;
5) he has studied Marshal Lin
Piao's "Long Live the Victory
of People's War" (Peking Re.
view, no. 36, 1965) and Commli

nist Chinese Foreign Minister
Ch'en Yi's remarks at his press
conference of September 29
(Ibid., no. 41, 1965); and 6) he
has read Professor Roche's arti
cle, "A Professor Votes For Mr.
Johnson," New York Times Mag
azine, October 24, 1965. (It would
also he helpful if ho has been
to Vietnam.)
Such a person might convince
me that our Government is in
error; however, those who meet
the above criteria are, to my
knowledge, in basic support of
United States policy. If I'm
wrong, let's debate. If I'm right,
Ii mplore the anti-war (who
isn't!) demonstrators to realize
that they are straightening the
resolve of those in Hanoi, Pek
ing, and South Vietnam who
don't want to negotiate, as well
as giving a dangerous opportu
nity to extremists of left and
right in our country whose "so
lutions" are nothing more than
blind reactions to a tremendous
ly complex problem.
Disagree if you will, but first
do your homework and, above
all, don't defeat your own
purposes.

The juvenile conduct of the
hecklers at the Blood for Viet
nam rally was obvious to all
present. A sane and thinking
observer could easily perceive

the level of their remarks. More
powerful arguments against the
war-hawk contingency could
hardly be found.
Mr. Polhemus' subsequent let
ter to The Daily (Nov. -1), how
ever, does him a disservice.
With alacrity he rushes forth to
wallow in the gutter of those
hecklers he condemns. By de
scending to near hysterical name
calling, he hastens the polariza
tion of the Vietnam debate at a
time when thoughtful alterna
tives need to be articulated. De
spite occasional lip-service to the
ideal of free and open dialogue,
his letter reduces the current
debate to the simplicities of
bumper stickers.

Editor, Tlje Daily:
It has been four years since
1 attended Stanford in Italy
(Group III) and ever since I
have read or listened to count
less discussions of the overseas
program. I am always surprised
and disappointed to find that
most of them are predicated on
the assumption that the writer's
or speaker's experience overseas
was the definitive one. Just com
pare the Leopold and Campbell
articles in The Daily's Overseas
Supplement. Each one is sure
he knows all about the "Euro
pean experience" and yet each
contradicts the other often.
I, from my experience in Italy.

would also contradict some of
each of their statements of
"fact". I found Florentines hos
pitable and friendly. Professors
expected us to study and the
library was used for this pur
pose. Students who wanted more
language ability look more Ital
ian before they came—they
didn't have to wait for changed
requirements to force them to
do so. At least for women there
were many fewer regulations
than there were here. And fin
ally, sophomores were quite able
to define the "European experi
ence" for themselves and were
actively doing so.
The contradictions between
my experiences in Italy and
Uiose of Mr. Campbell and Mr.
Leopold do not indicate that two
of us must be wrong. Rather
they point to what most of those
who discuss the overseas cam
puses do not. seem to realize: a
stay at a foreign campus is not
a unitary experience but is one
that is determined largely by the
individual participating in it.
The program itself is a set of
compromises but it. is also flex
ible with a multitude of poten
tialities that, the individual may
realize or squander as he
chooses.

The reccnt competition be

themselves "Conscience" arid
"Peace" has begun to create an
atmosphere of confusion and

for our times is Yeats' prophecy:
Things fall apart; the center

Mere anarchy is loosed upon
the world.
The blood-dimnled tide is

Therefore, I would like to en
ter into an informed dialogue
(or debate, if you will) with
someone who advocates a uni
lateral withdrawal of our forces
from South Vietnam, providing
he has at least four of the fol
lowing credentials: 1) he has
read the key statements of Com
munist Chinese, Nationalist Chi

tian (all three groups), Cambo
dian. Thai. Malaysian, Japanese,
Korean, (North and South), Fili

British, French, and American

several years; 2) he has a back
ground of some years of study
with regard to Far Eastern de
velopments; 3) he reads at least
one Asian language; 1) he has
read the reports of the Interna
tional Commission for Supervi
sion and Control in Vietnam;
5) he has studied Marshal Lin

Such a person might convince
me that our Government is in
error; however, those who meet
the above criteria are, to my
knowledge, in basic support of
United States policy. If I'm
wrong, let's debate. If I'm right,
