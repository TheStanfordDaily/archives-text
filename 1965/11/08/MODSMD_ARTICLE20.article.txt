## How 'VIP' Ratio Affects Vietnam Escalation Policy 
### 
The trouble when you escalate
a war is that you not only have
to escalate the troops but also
the VIPs who want to visit the
area where you're fighting.
In the beginning, when we
first started helping out in
South Vietnam, our policy was
to keep our VIPs to a minimum,
on the theory that it Was a
South Vietnamese war and our
VIPs should act in an advisory
capacity only.
But as the succeeding South
Vietnamese governments kept
knocking off their own VIPs in
military coups, we had no choice
but to replace them with Amer
ican VIPs who soon were being
escorted all over the country.
A 5-1 Katio
For a long time the Depart
ment of Defense refused to dis

cuss how many VIPs they in
tended to send to Vietnam. The
reason they gave is that it took
five American soldiers to pro
tect one American VIP, and if
they revealed how many VIPs
intended to go to Vietnam, the
enemy would know how many
soldiers we planned to send
there.
But then President Johnson
announced he was going to send
140,000 American troops to pro
tect our position in Southeast
Asia. This meant We could ex
pect 28,000 VIPs to visit "our"
boys.
Unfortunately, more VIPs re
quested to go to Saigon, and so
we had to up our commitment
to 165.000 troops.
If tlie rate of VIP visits goes
up, which it shows every inten
tion of doing, wo may soon have
between 200,000 and 300,000
American Gls in Vietnam.
This is the main trouble with
escalation. The more troops you
throw in, the more VIPs want
to visit the place, and then you
have to send in more troops to
protect them.
It's not just a question of
Congressmen and Senators go
ing to Vietnam. You also have
Defense Department officials,
leading businessmen, Broadway
shows, Hollywood movie stars,
syndicated columnists, magazine
publishers, television network
executives, baseball players,
clergy, and psychological war
fare experts.
Unknown Condition
Though it is not generally
known, one of the conditions
that the North Vietnamese have
made for negotiations is that,
although the American troops
can stay in Vietnam, the VIPs
would have to pull out. The
Americans stationed in Vietnam
are happily willing to give in on
this point, though Washington
has turned it down repeatedly.
Without VIPs, Washington
maintains no one would know
what a wonderful .job we're do
ing over there and morale on
the home front would collapse.
There was a time when VIPs
were just willing to visit a few
bars in Saigon and then return
to the United States. But now
most VlP's insist on helicopter
flight over enemy territory and
hazardous visits to Special
Forces camps. This has pro
duced a great strain on the mili
tary equipment, but it has given
the Armed Forces a chance to
check out new methods of han
dling VIPs.
Many new techniques have
been innovated which were un
heard of in World War II and
the Korean conflicts.
For one thing the new type of
VIP wants to see the war for
himself, and although he would
like to bp shot at. he certainly
doesn't want to get: him. This
has put the military on its toes.
It is rumored that some VIPs
are flown over friendly territory
and shot at by our own troops,
but this has been vehemently de
nied by the Defense Depart
ment.
There is a Pentagon order
that no GI may fire at an Amer
ican VIP no matter how much
he is provoked. But in Vietnam,
as we all know, anything can
happen and usually does.
