82 yards for their field goal and two
touchdowns.

Hot First Half
The yardage was almost evenly di
vided between the first and second
half, even though, Stanford did all its

fhat came to play football, however.
When the defense had the chance,
they held Tulane's highly-touted soph
onion: (|uarlcrback, Bobby Duhon,
completely in check.
Fa end with the likeb ui Phil Sclincj

dcr, Al Wilburn, Mike Hibler. Glenn
Myers, and Bob llath plus a whole
team of punishing taeklers, Tulane's
offense never saw daylight. The
Green Wave running game was to
tally bottled up. and the front four
put such tremendous pressure on the
Dulion that many of his tosses were
hurried and high.
Tulane had a total offense of 77
yards for the game.
