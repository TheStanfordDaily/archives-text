82 yards for their field goal and two
touchdowns.
The Tribe had the ball on 83 plays
as compared with only 46 for Tulane.
The amount of time that Stanford
had the ball was even more impres
sive as Stanford stayed on the ground

age. The Indians rang up a total of
fense of 455 yards.
Hot First Half
The yardage was almost evenly di
vided between the first and second
half, even though, Stanford did all its
scoring in the first half.
The offense wasn't the only one
fhat came to play football, however.
When the defense had the chance,
they held Tulane's highly-touted soph
onion: (|uarlcrback, Bobby Duhon,
completely in check.
Fa end with the likeb ui Phil Sclincj

dcr, Al Wilburn, Mike Hibler. Glenn
Myers, and Bob llath plus a whole
team of punishing taeklers, Tulane's
offense never saw daylight. The
Green Wave running game was to
tally bottled up. and the front four
put such tremendous pressure on the
Dulion that many of his tosses were
hurried and high.
Tulane had a total offense of 77
yards for the game.
Tulane's biggest noise eame on the
opening kick-off. Tom Ross booted
the ball to the l where Butch Coco
hobbled the ball. He picked it up .iusi
as the Indians closed in. eluded two
taeklers. and race up the sideline for
18 yards to the Stanford 48.
Tough Uel'riise
The Tribe dug in right there,
though, and three runs gained only
five yards, forcing Tulane to punt.

set Hip tone for the night; Lewis hit
flanker Phil Humphreys on a deep
hook pattern for a 27 yard gain t«
