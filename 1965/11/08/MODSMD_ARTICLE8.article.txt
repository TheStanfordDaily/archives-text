# FORD GIVES $1 MILLION:
## Grant To Aid Journalism 
### 
The University announced today a
program that will enable working
journalists and liberal arts graduates
to study here under a $975,000 Ford
Foundation grant.
Clifford F. Wiegle, executive head
of the Department of Communication,
said the program will begin next fall
and will involve up to 36 working
journalists and 12 liberal arts grad
uates. Under this grant, professional
journalists will study from one to
two quarters. They will concentrate

their study in specific fields in which
they hope to concentrate as reporters
but not as candidates for degrees.
To Improve Reporting
Professor Wiegle believes that the
program will offer an "unparalleled
opportunity for the improvement of
reporting among the mass media in
the Western United States.' '
"It should help a significant num
ber of the most promising younger
professionals in the field to achieve
a broader understanding and a deeper
insight into some of the problems fac
ing our society," he said.
In addition, the University will
award 12 national fellowships com
parable to Woodrow Wilson appoint
ments and designed to attract top
level libera] arts graduates into jour
nalism and broadcasting. The fellows,
chosen from top-ranked college and
university graduates will study under
Stanford's regular master of arts de
gree program in communication.
Guest Leeturers
Distinguished lecturers from the
mass media and public affairs will
meet with the students in the pro

gram and some will spend as much
as a month as "guests in residence."
A major part of this particular
phase of tho program will be devoted
to study of a specific field in which
each student hopes to specialize. Stu
dents will also bo thoroughly ground
ed in the history of free speech and
a free press, history of the mass me
dia. communication law, the ethics
and responsibilities of professional
communicators, and the rights and
responsibilities of the mass media in
society. There will be a minimum of
instruction in technical editorial work.
Selection of Fellows
Summer workshops are also planned
for approximately 20 follows. The
workshops will cover a single topic
such as new developments in educa
tion drama and other cultural events.
Selection of professional fellows will
be on the basis of recommendations
from their employers, from heads of
journalism programs from which the
candidates were graduates, and from
others qualified to judge their poten
tial for growth in the communications
industry.

ed in the history of free speech and
a free press, history of the mass me
dia. communication law, the ethics
and responsibilities of professional
communicators, and the rights and
responsibilities of the mass media in
society. There will be a minimum of

Selection of Fellows
Summer workshops are also planned
for approximately 20 follows. The
workshops will cover a single topic
such as new developments in educa
tion drama and other cultural events.
Selection of professional fellows will
be on the basis of recommendations
from their employers, from heads of
journalism programs from which the
candidates were graduates, and from
others qualified to judge their poten
tial for growth in the communications
industry.
The University announced today a
program that will enable working
journalists and liberal arts graduates
to study here under a $975,000 Ford
Foundation grant.
Clifford F. Wiegle, executive head
of the Department of Communication,
said the program will begin next fall
and will involve up to 36 working
journalists and 12 liberal arts grad
uates. Under this grant, professional
journalists will study from one to
two quarters. They will concentrate

their study in specific fields in which
they hope to concentrate as reporters
but not as candidates for degrees.
To Improve Reporting
Professor Wiegle believes that the
program will offer an "unparalleled
opportunity for the improvement of
reporting among the mass media in
the Western United States.' '
"It should help a significant num
ber of the most promising younger
professionals in the field to achieve
a broader understanding and a deeper
insight into some of the problems fac
ing our society," he said.
In addition, the University will
award 12 national fellowships com
parable to Woodrow Wilson appoint
ments and designed to attract top
level libera] arts graduates into jour
nalism and broadcasting. The fellows,
chosen from top-ranked college and
university graduates will study under
Stanford's regular master of arts de
gree program in communication.
Guest Leeturers
Distinguished lecturers from the
mass media and public affairs will
meet with the students in the pro

gram and some will spend as much
as a month as "guests in residence."
A major part of this particular
phase of tho program will be devoted
to study of a specific field in which
each student hopes to specialize. Stu
dents will also bo thoroughly ground
ed in the history of free speech and
a free press, history of the mass me
dia. communication law, the ethics
and responsibilities of professional
communicators, and the rights and
responsibilities of the mass media in
society. There will be a minimum of
