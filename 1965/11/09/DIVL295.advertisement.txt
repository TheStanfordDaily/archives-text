MITRE is chief technical advisor and systems engineer to the Air
Force Electronic Systems Division of the Air Force Systems
Command. In this capacity, we design and develop such global,
computer-based systems as the NORAD Combat Operations
Center and the Back-Up Interceptor Control System. Other com
mitments: development of a future air traffic control system and
supporting the Defense Communications Agency in the develop
ment of the National Military Command System.
For the young systems engineer, this is uniquely rewarding work.
You associate with the top men in your field. You work in an
atmosphere that allows you to extend your capabilities profession
ally and academically.
At MITRE, men trained in single disciplines are encouraged to
grow beyond their original fields of interest. Systems designers
learn to work from an increasingly broad base.
You may work in such diverse areas as information theory, com
puter design, display techniques and propagation. You may
analyze. You may synthesize. You may deal with systems or in
dividual components. At the highest levels, you may have to con
sider political, economic and social factors... as well as the avail
able and predictable technology.
Requirements: M.S., or Ph.D. in these disciplines — electronics,
physics, mathematics. MITRE is located in pleasant, suburban
Boston and also has facilities in Washington, D. C., Colorado
Springs and Florida. If an interview will be inconvenient, inquiries
may be directed in confidence to College Relations Coordinator,
