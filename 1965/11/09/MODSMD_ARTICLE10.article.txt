# Students Making Usual Progress Won't Be Drafted
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
"Despite increased draft calls, there
is no reason for students making nor
mal and satisfactory progress to have
any concern," Walter Findeisen Stan
ford National Service Advisor told
The Daily yesterday.
Findeiscn said that the University,
"wholeheartedly committed to pur
suing the principle of student defer
ments," would use all measures to
protect the registration of students in
good standing.
He said ii was incomprehensible
that the local boards would attempt
to undermine one of the nations great
est assets, higher education, while the
government is pouring millions of dol
lars into education.
In Difficulty
When asked about the plight of
those students who had substituted
summer school for one of the regular
quarters, Findeisen said that "these
young men are going to find them
selves in difficulty."
Last Thursday evening LASSU
passed a resolution declaring that the
Selective Service requirements that
students attend school during the nor
mal academic year was "unreasonably
restrictive."
Reportedly, six students have al
ready been drafted for their failure
to meet this requirement.
Federal Law
Findeisen noted however that under

federal law a student who is regis
tered at the time of his induction no
tice may not be drafted out of school
and has the right to finish the aca
demic year if lie appeals to his local
board.
Much confusion has been raised in
recent weeks over the criteria for de
ferments. Under present regulations
of the Selective Service which have
been in effect since May 1, 1963, the
local board has a wide degree of flexi
bility in interpreting the policy laid
down by the National Director of
Selective Service.
Students may be deferred "whose
activity is found to be necessary to
the maintenance of the national
health, safety, or interest." Although
the national director may issue direc
tives to the various boards, they are
"advisory only."
Many local boards are classifying
students I-A rather than 11-S in order
to fill their quotas, Findeisen noted.
However, a I-A classification is no
guarantee that a student will be in
ducted.
Finish The Year
Any student receiving a I-A classi
fication may appeal the judgment of
the local board. According to federal
law. a student would then be granted
a I-S deferment which would allow
him to finish the academic year in any
event. However a student may onty
apply for the I-S deferment once. At
the end of the academic year the stu
dent's status would again be reviewed.
Findeisen told The Daily that there
are as many as 20 Stanford students
presently on I S deferments ami per
haps more.
In a press conference last week,
Colonel Kenneth Lcith of the State
Selective Service said that as many
as 128.000 of the 158,000 students in
California would lose their student
deferments this year.
Two-fold Reasoning
There is two-fold reasoning behind
the change in classification Findeisen
said. Local boards are more easily able
1o judge their manpower pool when
men are classified I-A. According to
Findeisen, a man must be I-A before
the board can order him to report for
a physical. In some respects this pro
cedure is beneficial for it removes the
doubt in the mind of both the student
and the board as to whether he will be
called.
Also students requesting I-S de
ferments to avoid I-A status use up
this privilege and can thus be counted
upon by the local board in filling
future quotas.
