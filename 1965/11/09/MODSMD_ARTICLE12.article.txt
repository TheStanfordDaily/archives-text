# Aid Project For Unemployed Calls For Stanford Support
## 
### 
Directors of a now project de
signed to aid the unemployed
and underemployed of the pe
ninsula area have voiced their
need for ;iid from Stanford stu
dents.
The project, named the Oppor
tunities Industrialization Center
West (OICWt, extends beyond
basic job retraining, although
it presently offers courses in
typing and electronic assembly,
and will soon offer sheet metal
work, switchboard operating,
and similar vocational skills.
The primary emphasis of the
program is on pro-vocational
training, called the "feeder pro
gram." Every trainee must at
tain a basic level of competence
in tlie reading, communication,
and arithmetic skills necessary
for his vocational work.
Feeder Program
Accompanied by personal
counseling, the feeder program
also includes courses in employ
ment attitudes, personal hygiene,
and job finding.
Mr. Ashley Cooke, OICW di
rector and a former staff mem
ber of the Philadelphia OIC. em
phasizes that the program is
"not a free school, but rather a
demonstration of faith" â€” faith
by the trainers in the students,
by the students in themselves.
This unique aspect of the pro
gram is made possible by the
cooperation between OICW and
industry.
Financial Need
In addition to offering em
ployment:, Peninsula industries
are contributing equipment and
instructors.
The directors of the program
hope that Stanford too can aid
in this peninsula-wide project.

The primary need is financial,
and contributions can be sent to
OICW, 1 t(K) O'Brien Drive, Men
lo Park. More importantly, how
ever, students will be able to
help as tutors for individual
trainees in reading, communica
tion, and arithmetic skills as
well as in clerical work.

Volunteer applications for!
those types of work may be
filled out now at the National
Student Association desk in ihe
Tresidder loft. For further in- j
formation, call Sheldon Shaef-1
