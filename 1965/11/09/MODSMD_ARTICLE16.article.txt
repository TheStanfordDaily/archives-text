# BLUE AND GOLD FINGER
## Costuming Colors Gaities 
### ANNE BROPHY 
One of the true "behind the
scenes" figures, who contributes
greatly to the success or failure
of any stage production, is the
cost inner.
Filling this key position for
the Ram's Ilead production of
Big (lame Gaieties is Sophomore
John Pasqueletti.
His costumes for "Blue and
Gold Finger," designed to re
flect the original plot and score,
run the gamut from "beta break
ers," and surfer shirts to gold
lame gowns and Mondrian-print
shifts.
Keyed (ostnines
To achieve a musical-comedy
effect through color, Pasqueletti
attempted to key each costume
to the mood and personality of
the individual character, while
preserving the thematic mood of
each scene as a whole. Use of
different fabric textures and col
or intensities make the central
characters stand out from the
chorus members. The result is
described by the cast as "semi

unrealistic: each character has
a thematic similarity."
Color-costuming to abstract
the mood of the scene is cited by
Costume Executrix Carol Round
tree as a concept adding excite
ment and continuity to Hie show.
A t T C setting inspires fashions
for the well-dressed beatnik and
protestor; varied lengths of torn
jeans and cut-offs are topped
with turtle-necks, shirts, or ve
lours sweatshirts hi a spectrum
of shades of blue.
Stereotypes
Hack on Quad, thematic char
acter stereotypes are highlighted
in the traditional color scheme,
featuring avant-garde outfits
for the fashion-conscious Axe
Comm. member. Fluorescent
fabrics add to the impact of a
dramatic black light sequence,
vibrancy and color intensity in
creasing with tin 1 tempo of the
scene. Costumes in a dirge scene
reek of depression in muted
shades of bronze and orange.

Tickets for the show are on
sale in front of the Post Office
from 5) a.m. to 3 p.m. and are
also available at the Tresidrier
Box Office.
