While scholars raise the question of a historical Jesus and confused theolo
gians dispute the authority of the Son of God. Jesus Christ, a risen lord, is
known and loved by millions who have met H m as a peisonal F end The man
who wonders if God is dead hcisn t looked and ioesn't want to know, for
finding Christ, one is forever changed, and can nor h.-!p but ~-e Him every

arates the sheeps from the goats, and he will place the sheep at In light hand,
but the goats at the left. Then the King will say to those at i is tight hand,
'Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was
thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was
naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and
you came to me.l Then the righteous will answer him. Lord when did we see
thee hungry and feed thee, or thirsty and give thee dâ–  ink? And when did we
see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and ci. ; > the- ' And when
did we see thee in prison and visit thee 0 ' And the King v. ill answer them,
'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you
did it to me.' Then he will say to those at his left hand, Depart from me, you
cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was
hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you nave me no drint I
was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe
