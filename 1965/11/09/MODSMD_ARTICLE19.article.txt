YOU, TOO, CAN BE INFERIOR
The second gravest problem confronting college students
today is inferiority feelings. (The first gravest problem is,
of course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority
house canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of infe
riority feelings and their possible cures.
Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three princi
pal categories:
1. Physical inferiority.
2. Mental inferiority.
3. Financial inferiority.
(A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish —
but 1 believe this is common only along the coasts and in
the Great Lakes area.)
Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, per
haps the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined
to teel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beauti
ful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the
people, neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their
marks in the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates.
Look at Caesar. Look at Lassie.
\\ hat I mean is you can't always tell what's inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course,
you can. Take Personna Stainless Steel Blades, for exam
ple. Just one glance at that jolly blue and white package—
so bright and pert, so neat but not gaudy—and you knoir it
has to contain blades of absolute perfection. And you are

right! Personna gives you so many shaves per blade it takes
a math major to count them. And they are luxury shaves—
smoother, comfortabler, kinder to the kisser. Moreover,
Personna comes both in Double Edge and Injector style.
And as if this weren't enough, Personna is now offering you
a chance to grab a fistful of $100 bills from a $100,000 bowl!
The Personna Stainless Steel Sweepstakes is off and run
ning, and you're all eligible to enter. Visit your friendly
Personna dealer today to get details and an entry blank.)
But I digress. Let us turn now to the second category
mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber
than other people. This is not so. It must be remembered
that there are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for in
stance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and
Sturbridge, students at a prominent Western university
(Dartmouth). It, was always assumed that Claude was the
more intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge
about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humani
ties, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny
knots. But no matter; everyb'"' looked down on "Stupid
Sturbridge," as they called i. id looked up to "Clever
Claude," as they called him. But who do you think turned
out to be the smart one when their granny almost got loose
and ran away? You guessed it —good old Stupid Sturbridge.
We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your in
come. You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can
pose for a life class, if your college is w ell heated.
But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to ac
cept it philosophically. Look on the bright side of povorl. .
True, others may have more money than you have, but
look at all the things you have that they don't—debts, for
instance, and hunger cramps.
Always remember, dear friends, that poverty is no dis
grace. It is an error, but if is no disgrace.

But I digress. Let us turn now to the second category
mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber
than other people. This is not so. It must be remembered
that there are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for in
stance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and
Sturbridge, students at a prominent Western university
(Dartmouth). It, was always assumed that Claude was the
more intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge
about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humani
ties, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny
knots. But no matter; everyb'"' looked down on "Stupid
Sturbridge," as they called i. id looked up to "Clever
Claude," as they called him. But who do you think turned
out to be the smart one when their granny almost got loose
and ran away? You guessed it —good old Stupid Sturbridge.
We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your in
come. You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can
pose for a life class, if your college is w ell heated.
But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to ac
cept it philosophically. Look on the bright side of povorl. .
True, others may have more money than you have, but
look at all the things you have that they don't—debts, for
instance, and hunger cramps.
Always remember, dear friends, that poverty is no dis
grace. It is an error, but if is no disgrace.

The second gravest problem confronting college students
today is inferiority feelings. (The first gravest problem is,
of course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority
house canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of infe
riority feelings and their possible cures.
Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three princi
pal categories:
1. Physical inferiority.
2. Mental inferiority.
3. Financial inferiority.
(A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish —
but 1 believe this is common only along the coasts and in
the Great Lakes area.)
Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, per
haps the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined
to teel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beauti
ful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the
people, neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their
marks in the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates.
Look at Caesar. Look at Lassie.
