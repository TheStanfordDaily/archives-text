# Water Poloists Defeat S. Cal. In Return Play
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
A fired-up Stanford water polo
team simmered, ihen boiled over
last Friday, to cook (he visiting
USC Trojans, 12-9.
The Indians jumped to an
overpowering 8-2 lead in the
first half. Stanford clicked on
every pass, and forced the Tro
jans to submit 1o Stanford's
style of play. The Cards made
their shots count, and denied
the Trojan offense nearly com
pletely.
Stanford opened the game in
a hurry. After two minutes of
Mark Parmely look a per
fect cross court pass from Jeff
Beck and fired it into the goal
from eight yards out. The quick
clean execution of the play set
a precedent for the game.

BiJl Meyer, breaking toward
the goal, took another set-up
pass and converted for the score.
Hoy Saari scored once in tho
first period for I JSC's only score.
Canls Explode iii Second
Stanford burst, through the
Trojan defense in the second pe
riod with an intense, fasl-break
ing, hard-pushing effort good
for six goals. Pete Ready pow
ered in a backhand shot to open
the quarter.
Bill Derrlg scored the first of
his three goals on a hi-lo fake
to put the tribe in front, 4-1.
The Trojan goalie's woes had
just begun. Stanford weaved
through the USC zone defense
and sol up scoring shots with
amazing efficiency.
Parmely and Meyer each col
lected their second goals of the
afternoon, then Dcrrig tallied
his second goal of the quarter.
Mike Eshleman, team cantain,
ended Stanford's scoring for the
half as he chugged through two
USC defenders to take his shot.
Dean Willeford, who scored
five times in the Stanford-USC
game earlier this year, tallied
his first goal late in the second
quarter to give the Trojans their
two goals against the Indians'
eight.
Simonds Thwarts USC Shots
Vance Simonds, who made six
teen saves in front of the Stan
ford goal, made six of those
saves in the second quarter—
four against the hard-throwing
Trojan horse, Roy Saari.
The Indians cooled off from
their torrid pace, as USC moved
to within three goals of the tribe
in the third quarter. Willeford
bioke away for three goals,
while Pete Ready scored Stan
ford's sole goal in the period.
Stanford, with the game well
under control, matched the Tro
jans goal for goal, in the last
quarter. Saari, who never scored

against Stanford defensive ace
Mike Eshleman, tallied twice in
the period.
Bill Derrig and Mark Parmely
scored their third goals of the
day, and Eshleman socked in his
second to put the game on ice,
12-9.
Scoring Attack Fffecive
The even distribution of scor
ing over five Stanford players
illustrates 1 the effectiveness of
the Indian scoring attack. The
tribe offense emphasizes con
stant movement, looking to
break one man open for a shot
at the goal. The attack does not
key around a single player, but
the entire unit, putting the op
ponent's defense to considerable
strain.
Stanford sank Southern Cal
sans Sheerer. Gary Sheerer
scored eight goals in Stanford's
12-10 victory over the Trojans
earlier this season and led the
tribe scorers before his hand
was broken at San Jose State
three weeks ago.
The Cards' style of play, key
ing on ball control, relies on a
low fouling rate to maintain pos
session. The Indians lost three
players to the four-foul limit.
Southern Cal lost five, although
Saari and Willeford, the chief
Trojan offensive threats, were
never in foul danger.
Gaughran: "Best All Year."
Varsity coach Jim Gaughran
was tremendously pleased with
the Indian victory, citing the
first half effort as the best wa
ter polo he had seen all year.
Gaughran compared Friday's
game with the UCLA game last
week where Stanford fell, 5-3,
saying that "This time, our
shots scored." Stanford missed
.17 attempts against the Bruins.
Stanford, now 10-4, has seven
games remaining in the season.
The Indians host the perennially
potent Long Beach State 49'ers
this Friday. Long Beach
squeezed past Southern Cal by
one goal earlier this year, but
fell to UCLA.
Stanford can expect a rough
time with the 49'ers. but can
also look for one addition to last
Friday's red hot offense. Gary
Sheerer may return to action by
the end of this week, and if the
Red O stays hot, Long Beach
will find themselves in an un
comfortable environment indeed.
Saturday morning, San Jose
will test the Indians in the En- i

cina Pool. In an earlier encoun
ter between the two teams,
Stanford held a 5-1 lead in the
fourth period, hut the Spartans
rose to bring the final count
down to 5-4. The tribe will be
eager to settle ihe account on
more decisive terms.
Cards No. > in AAWU
Stanford's victory over USC
virtually cinches the tribe's
berth as number two in the con
ference behind UCLA. The only
obstacle left in the conference is
Cal, whom the Cards play Nov.
20.
The Indians meet four teams
in the Northern California Open
Tournament coming up two

weeks from today. Among these
learns will he Foothill and the
Olympic Club — both of which
beat the tribe earlier this season.
If the Indians can knock off
each of these teams, as well as
Long Beach State, they will rest
in the nation's number two col
legiate position. UCLA has more
or less clinched the top ranking.
