### 
LOS ANGELES Coach Tom
my Prothro, whose UCLA
Bruins play Stanford this week
in another Rose Bowl Bid for
the Uclans, observed Monday:
"I've never seen a Stanford team
that was easy lo beat at Palo
Alto."
Protbo, speaking at the week
ly football writers' luncheon,
had high praise for the Wash
ington Huskies, whom the
Bruins defeated Saturday, 28 24.
"Washington is the best team
I ever saw with a 3-5 record. The
Washington team we beat would
have beaten any other team we
played this season on the day
we played these teams," Protho
declared.
Bruin quarterback Gary Bo
ban of UCLA was named back
of the week and awarded the
Golden Helmet. The sophomore
star accounted for all four Bruin
touchdowns, throwing two
touchdown passes and running
60 and one yard for the others.
Coach John McKay of South
ern California, whose Trojons
play Pittsburgh here Saturday,
said the Panthers have a fine of
fense. But, said McKay, it hasn't
been able lo show its ability be
cause the defense—usually a
strong unit at Pitt—has been
inept.
