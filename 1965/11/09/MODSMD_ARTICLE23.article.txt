# Red Soccer Team Loses
## 
### 
Playing tho unbeaten and
league-loading University of San
Francisco, Stanford's soccer
team out-played and out-shot
their opposition but could never
muster enough together for a
victory as the Indians fell, 3-0,
Saturday at. San Francisco.
The score was 1-0 at half-time
and USF never really put on
any offensive show as Stanford
was continually pressing both
on defense and offense.
The Dons also scored once in
the third and fourth quarter.
Injuries A Factor
Several key injuries definitely
were a factor in the contest.
Not only was Kamel Kadi, one
of the better players on the
team, side-lined because of a leg
injury he sustained in a previ
ous game but two other key per
formers were hampered with leg
injuries.
USF scored once on a break
away and was given a score
when Stanford's goalie was
faked out of position.
