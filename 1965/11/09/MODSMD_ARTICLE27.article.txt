# FROSH RECORD 9-2
## Poloists Defeated 
### PERRY HACKETT 
The Stanford freshman water
polo team was sunk by the visit
ing team from the College of
San Mateo in an upset loss last
Friday evening. The frosh, who
previously boasted a 9-1 record,
wore an appropriate color in
this game, blue. The outcome
of the game was decided in the
first four minutes of the quar
ter.
The CSM six scored three
goals in quick succession to cata
pult them into the lead which
they neved lost. The latter part
of the first quarter had little
action until the last few seconds
when a foul was charged against
the Indians.
CSM scored their fourth goal
over protests from the stands
that claimed the ball had been
given to the wrong team.
In the middle of the second
quarter, and after several at
tempts, Stanford's Mike Wall
put the Indians on the score
hoard. With a revitalized spirit
the team recovered the ball sev
eral times as Morgan Manning
and Pete Siebert put on a stiff
defense.
In the last two minutes, Luis
Nicolao in rapid succession led
the Tribe to two more goals to
give CSM a shakey one point
margin. Within the closing sec
onds, however, CSM's Belli put i
his second point into the Indian j
goal to end the half with San i
Mateo leading 5-3.
Lead Down To Three
The third quarter marked the
end of the Stanford drive. Belli
scored for CSM and following
two Stanford fouls, CSM was in
a position to make another very
easy goal. In the next minute
Mike Wall hurled a powerful
long shot into the CSM goal to J
raise the Indians 1o a three pointfl
deficit. A goal by CSM ended iheß
quarter with Stanford behind*
Nicolao's easy score in the

fourth period was the last Stan
ford point. Vainly the Tribe tried
to hold their opponents and to
score. Dick Roth who usually
scores several goals per game
was unable to score.
Teammate Nicolao who had
three goals for eleven attempts
showed one of his poorer per
formances of the season. Several
times team-members, including
Pete Siebert, Paul Meyer, Mor
gan Manning, and Jeff Hammett
captured the ball and put on
strong drives; but, too many
times the goal shots were in
effective.
Goalie Saves 12
Doug Chapin, Stanford's
goalie, totaled 12 saves for the
game, including the well known
face block.
The game ended with CSM
dunking Stanford 10-5. CSM's
Belli was the high scorer with
5 goals. Only one Indian folded
out with four fouls, although
several San Mateoans left the
game due 1o fouls.

three goals for eleven attempts
showed one of his poorer per
formances of the season. Several
times team-members, including
Pete Siebert, Paul Meyer, Mor
gan Manning, and Jeff Hammett
captured the ball and put on
strong drives; but, too many
times the goal shots were in
effective.
Goalie Saves 12
Doug Chapin, Stanford's
goalie, totaled 12 saves for the
game, including the well known
face block.
The game ended with CSM
dunking Stanford 10-5. CSM's
Belli was the high scorer with
5 goals. Only one Indian folded
out with four fouls, although
several San Mateoans left the
game due 1o fouls.
The Stanford freshman water
polo team was sunk by the visit
ing team from the College of
San Mateo in an upset loss last
Friday evening. The frosh, who
previously boasted a 9-1 record,
wore an appropriate color in
this game, blue. The outcome
of the game was decided in the
first four minutes of the quar
ter.
The CSM six scored three
goals in quick succession to cata
pult them into the lead which
they neved lost. The latter part
of the first quarter had little
action until the last few seconds
when a foul was charged against
the Indians.
CSM scored their fourth goal
over protests from the stands
that claimed the ball had been
given to the wrong team.
In the middle of the second
quarter, and after several at
tempts, Stanford's Mike Wall
put the Indians on the score
hoard. With a revitalized spirit
the team recovered the ball sev
eral times as Morgan Manning
and Pete Siebert put on a stiff
defense.
In the last two minutes, Luis
Nicolao in rapid succession led
the Tribe to two more goals to
give CSM a shakey one point
margin. Within the closing sec
onds, however, CSM's Belli put i
his second point into the Indian j
goal to end the half with San i
Mateo leading 5-3.
Lead Down To Three
The third quarter marked the
end of the Stanford drive. Belli
scored for CSM and following
two Stanford fouls, CSM was in
a position to make another very
easy goal. In the next minute
Mike Wall hurled a powerful
long shot into the CSM goal to J
raise the Indians 1o a three pointfl
deficit. A goal by CSM ended iheß
quarter with Stanford behind*
Nicolao's easy score in the

fourth period was the last Stan
ford point. Vainly the Tribe tried
to hold their opponents and to
score. Dick Roth who usually
scores several goals per game
was unable to score.
Teammate Nicolao who had
three goals for eleven attempts
showed one of his poorer per
formances of the season. Several
times team-members, including
Pete Siebert, Paul Meyer, Mor
gan Manning, and Jeff Hammett
captured the ball and put on
strong drives; but, too many
times the goal shots were in
