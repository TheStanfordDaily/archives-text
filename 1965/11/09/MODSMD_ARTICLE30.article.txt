## The 						Paradox Of Vietnam Protests 
### JAMES RESTON 
New York Times
It is not easy, but let. us as
sume that all the student dem
onstrators against the war in
Vietnam are everything they say
they are:
Sincerely for an honorable
peace, troubled by the bombing
of the civil populations of both
North and South Vietnam, genu
inely afraid that we may be
trapped into a hopeless war
with China, and worried about
the power of the President and
the Pentagon and the pugna
cious, bawling patriotism of
many influential men in Con
gress.
A case can be made for it.
In a world of accidents, nu
clear weapons, and damn fools,
even a dreaming pacificism has
to be answered. And men who
want peace, defy the govern
ments, and demonstrate for the
support of Congress are not
only within their rights but
must be heard.
Postponing' Peace
The trouble is that they are
inadvertently working against
all the things they want, and
creating all the things they fear
most. They are not promoting
peace but postponing it. They
are not persuading the President
or Congress to end the war, but
deceiving Ho Chi Minh and the
Viet Cong into prolonging it.
They are not proving the supe
rior wisdom of the university
community, but unfortunately
are bringing il into serious
quest ion.
When President Johnson was
stubbornly refusing to discuss
Vietnam and rejecting all
thought of a negotiated settle
ment the student objectors had a
point, and many of us here in the
Washington press corps and the
Washington political community
supported them. But they are
now out of date. They are mak
ing news, but they are not mak
ing sense.
The problem of peace now lies
not in Washington but in Hanoi,
and probably the most reliable
source of information in the
Western world about what is
going on there is the Canadian
representative on the Vietnam
International Control Commis
sion. Blair Seaborn.
Peace
lie flies regularly to the North
Vietnamese capital with the Po
lish and Indian members of that
commission, and he is personal
ly in favor of an honorable nego
tiated peace in Vietnam. He is
a cultivated man and a profes
sional diplomat. He knows all
the mistakes we have made,
probably in more detail than all
the professors in all the teach
ins in all the universities of this
country.
What he finds in Hanoi, how
ever, is a total misconception of

American policy and, particular
ly. a powerful conviction among
Communist officials there that
the anti-war demonstrations and
editorials in the United States
will force the American govern
ment to give up the fight.
Not even the conscientious ob
jectors on the picket lines in
this country really believe that
they have the power or the sup
port to bring about any such re
sult, but Hanoi apparently be
lieves it.and for an interesting
reason.
Ho Chi Minli and the other
Communist leaders in Hanoi re
member that they defeated the
French in Vietnam between 1930
and 1953 at least partly because
of opposition to the Indochinese
war inside France. The Commu
nists won the propaganda battle
hi Paris before they won the
military battle at Dien Bien Pint.
Protest
Now they think they see the
same surge of protest working
against the American Govern
ment in Washington, no matter
what Seaborn says to the con
trary.
They have not been able to
challenge American air, naval or
even ground power effectively
since midsummer in South Viet
nam, but they apparently still
hope that the U.S. demonstra
tions against the Johnson Ad
ministration will in the end give
them the victory they cannot
achieve on the battlefield.
So the Communists reject the
negotiations lhat the demonstra
tors in the United States want.
They reject the negotiations
that the American Government
has offered, and the demonstra

tors are protesting, not against
the nation North Vietnam
that is continuing the war, but
against their own country that
is offering to make peace.
Psychology
Not surprisingly, this is cre
ating an ugly situation here in
Washington. Instead of winning
allies in Congress to change the
Johnson policy, the demonstra
tors are encouraging the very
war psychology they denounce.
Senators John Stennis (Dem.-
Ala.) chairman of the Senate
Preparedness Sub-committee, is
now demanding that the admin
istration pull up the antidraft
movement "by the roots and
grind it to bits."
Confusion
Honest conscientious objectors
are being confused with uncon
scientious objectors, hangers-on,
intellectual gradua'te-school draft
dodgers, and rent-a-crowd boobs
who will demonstrate for or
against anything. And the uni
versities and the Government's
policy are being hurt in the
process.
So there arc now all kinds of
investigations going on or being
planned to find out who and
what are behind all these dem
onstrations on the campuses. It
is a paradoxical situation, for it
is working not for intelligent
objective analysis of the prob
lem, which the university com
munity of the Nation is sup
posed to represent, not for
peace, which the demonstrators
are demanding, but in both
cases for precisely the opposite.
