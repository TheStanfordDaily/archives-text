# LASSU's 'Illegal' Resolution
## 
### MIKE COUZENS 
Before I built a wall I'd ask
to know
What I was walling in or
walling out,
And to whom I was like to
give offence.
Something there is that
doesn't love a wall,
That wants it down.
From "Mending Wall"
The draft, like the six-gun, is
a great equalizer. But when it
victimizes a student simply be
cause he studied at a foreign
campus, serious students may
be "equalized" into the same
class as blatanl dodgers.
Selective Service bases its poli
cies on the semester. Students
who have attended a foreign
campus through the summer,
and then take off a regular quar
ter, can be, and have been, con
scripted.
Seven Quarter Alternative
The alternative is going to
school for seven quarters, a
labor of love which not all are
willing to undertake.
Clark Brown, ASSIJ Vice
President, raised this objection

in Legislature last Thursday. He
presented a resolution criticizing
Selective Service as "unreason
ably restrictive." It was passed
unanimously.
Here enters the problem of
"the wall." Erected in a student
initiative last, spring, it bears
the inscription:
"The government of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University shall not take posi
tions on matters other than
those pertaining to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus."
Selective Service is a student
fear, perhaps, but not a student
affair. And having seen no pick
eters viewing with alarm, I as
sume there is no draft board
plying its trade "on the Stan
ford campus."
'Illegal' Ilseoliition
In passing the resolution, then,
Legislature took a position on
a question of real importance to
students, where there was
strong sentiment, and within its
realm of competence. But it did
so illegally.
This is not simply a techni
cality. Legislature has a pleth
era of these, to which it com

mits entirely too much time. The
point is that there are issues
outside "the wall" which com
mand its attention. Why was
such a limitation passed by the
student body?
Two other options were pre
sented: il) Anything goes, and
(2) positions on "... only those
issues which are of deep con
cern to the student body and
within the knowledge and com
petence of Legislature . .
Why was <2> unacceptable? I
believe the failing was with the
Legislature, where it remains.
A resolution on Stickney's pre
ceded the initiative. Adrian
Stickney was asked to come be
fore the body and tell whether
or not his restaurants discrimin
ated. Then discussion was to
take place on a motion of cen
sure.
Imagr of Parkinson's Law
Competence? Student concern?
The voters thought not. And Leg
islature has done little to dispel
the image of parliamentary nit
pickers whose higher authority
is not the ASStT Constitution
anil By-laws, but Parkinson's
Law.

A meeting two weeks ago was
adjourned when representatives
could not decide how lo vote on
a motion to table the reconsid
eration of a vote by which was
carried the motion to postpone
indefinitely. As meetings drag
on, it appears that whenever the
major issues ;ire the next order
of business, the quorum has dis
sipated.
Some procedural reform seems
essential if Legislature is in
argue that it is mature enough
to surmount the wall. Commit
tees can solve part of the prob
lem, if Legislators will trust
their judgment and not demand
that their meetings be recon
vened on the floor, to the bore
dom of all. More than that, a
mechanism must be found to
pass non-controversial items to
gether, without the burdensome
details explained for each.
In sum, Legislature must be
prepared to mend its own fences
before encompassing the uni
verse. Legislators trained in
peripherieal vision could then
give student policies some re
spect, and witli it, aomc cflec
-1 iveness.

Before I built a wall I'd ask
to know
What I was walling in or

And to whom I was like to

That wants it down.
From "Mending Wall"
The draft, like the six-gun, is
a great equalizer. But when it
victimizes a student simply be
cause he studied at a foreign
campus, serious students may
be "equalized" into the same
class as blatanl dodgers.
Selective Service bases its poli
cies on the semester. Students
who have attended a foreign
campus through the summer,
and then take off a regular quar
ter, can be, and have been, con
scripted.
Seven Quarter Alternative
The alternative is going to
school for seven quarters, a
labor of love which not all are
willing to undertake.
Clark Brown, ASSIJ Vice
President, raised this objection

in Legislature last Thursday. He
presented a resolution criticizing
Selective Service as "unreason
ably restrictive." It was passed
unanimously.
Here enters the problem of
"the wall." Erected in a student
initiative last, spring, it bears
the inscription:
"The government of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University shall not take posi
tions on matters other than
those pertaining to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus."
Selective Service is a student
fear, perhaps, but not a student
affair. And having seen no pick
eters viewing with alarm, I as
sume there is no draft board
plying its trade "on the Stan
ford campus."
'Illegal' Ilseoliition
In passing the resolution, then,
Legislature took a position on
a question of real importance to
students, where there was
strong sentiment, and within its
realm of competence. But it did
so illegally.
This is not simply a techni
cality. Legislature has a pleth
era of these, to which it com

mits entirely too much time. The
point is that there are issues
outside "the wall" which com
mand its attention. Why was
such a limitation passed by the
student body?
Two other options were pre
sented: il) Anything goes, and
(2) positions on "... only those
issues which are of deep con
cern to the student body and
within the knowledge and com
petence of Legislature . .
Why was <2> unacceptable? I
believe the failing was with the
Legislature, where it remains.
A resolution on Stickney's pre
ceded the initiative. Adrian
Stickney was asked to come be
fore the body and tell whether
or not his restaurants discrimin
ated. Then discussion was to
take place on a motion of cen
sure.
