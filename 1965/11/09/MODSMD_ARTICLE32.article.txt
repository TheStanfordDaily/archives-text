## Vietnam Debate—The Spectre 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
O small and fair of facc!
In this appalling place.
The conscious soul must give
Its life to live.
Yvor Winters
Professor Polhemus' letter to
The Daily (November •!) illumi
nates one of the most terrifying
spectres arising from the bitter
controversy over the war in
Vietnam but not the one he in
tended. In his righteous anger
over the abuse of his colleague
Professor Franklin an anger
which I assume all men of good
will on the campus share, even
if they choose not to express it
in Professor Polhemus' violent
diction he has played into the
hands of the Enemy.
In the confusion of his out
rage. he loosely associates (con
sciously or unconsciously) Pro
fessor Franklin's assailants with
all "those well-meaning people
who have so far gone along with
the U.S. government's war in
Vietnam," and in essence im
plies that these "well-meaning"
(but misguided) people are in
directly responsible, through
their support of the Administra
tion's policy, for scenes like the
one he witnessed in White Me
morial Plaza last week.
It is true that the war in Viet
nam has generated "war fever"
and "phony patriotism." War al
ways has. And it is true, also,
that the war and its accompany
ing hysteria have provided an
excuse for "rotten and obscene
behavior." Again, war always
lias. One need not look any fur
ther than the brutal treatment
of the Japanese-Americans in
this very state at the onset of
World War II to support both
of these points. Such things are
appalling; they are enough to
make good men weep.
But it does not follow, there
fore, that World War II should
not have been fought. Neither
does it follow that to cease "ag
gressive U.S. action in Asia" is
the only conceivable sane solu
tion to the current problem,
either there or here. Quite a
number of intelligent, informed
persons sincerely believe other
wise. Even if one granted that
the threat of mob violence at
home might be alleviated by
such action, we would still have
the war mongers (not to men
tion that curious new phenom
enon, the peace mongers) and
the super put riots among us;
they would simply find another
focus for their perverse ener
gies. And the real dilemma, in
Vietnam that of how to ensure
the self-determination of the
Vietnamese people- would still
remain.
When one closely examines
Professor Polhemus' outburst,
then, through the pious rhetoric
he discerns something very dis
turbing: Professor Polhemus
cannot accept the fact that an
other intelligent individual of
good will can sincerely differ
with his own estimation of what
is right in Vietnam; anyone who
supports the Administration's
Vietnam policy is implicated
with those sanctioning mob vio
lence at home. And where do
such judgments place Professor
Polhemus? Squarely in the camp
of those "fearful, ignorant, sa
distic people who feel their
smelly little existences to be
somehow threatened by ideas
different from their own."
When in the time of crisis
good men (among whom I num
ber Professor Polhemus), upon
whom we all depend, stray blind
ly into the Enemy's camp, what
are our chances of survival?

•Question Of Tae(lics)
Editor, The Daily:
Certainly few can condone the
particular tactics which former
Daily editor Nancy Steffcn em

ployed in publishing the Crow-
Halverson Report i.e., writing
an anonymous letter that re
portedly forced Speaker Ed
Shaw to release the document.
But I am also deeply dis
turbed by the tack you and Mr.
Magnuson evidently would have
taken, that of trying, as Mr.
Magnuson put it. "to quietly
pressure the administration."
That is. to hush up the report.
It is remarkable that neither
of you seem to realize that a
newspaper has a solemn obliga
tion to illuminate dark corners
to vigorously pursue a ques
tion so it is brought out into
the open.
The alternatives are rumors,
or that Pravada "journalism"
formula: News is what and
when we want it to be. Neither
are compatible with a society
that purports to be democratic.
Hopefully, that includes a uni
versity, where freedom of speech
and press should be held at a
premium.
Some will argue that the or
ganization of a university is
different from thai of a demo
cratic government. Granted, the
administrative officialdom here
is not elected. But does that
mean that other democratic in
stitutions like civil liberties—
should be junked? Does that
mean that students, who have
made a considerable investment
in their education, should be de
nied the right to know what's
happening in the university?
(This is my answer to those
who think a campus newspaper,
somehow, should be different
from its city kin.)
True, sometimes people will
get hurt when newspapers print
what Mr. Magnuson calls un
harmonious "conflict" articles;
some, perhaps excruciatingly so,
for many. But don't editor Leo
pold and columnist Magnuson
believe that the consequences of
withholding stories are far more
unsalubrious than the conse
quences of impinging on what
Mr. Magnuson calls the "desire
for unity"? Whatever that is.
Really, gentlemen this is al
most elementary civics! And. be
lieve me, if we can't find it in
a university community, there's
not much hope of finding it else
where.
BILL MOORE
Daily Editor, Volume 145
(Ed. note: Mr. Moore, we prob
ably would not take the same
"lark" with Mr. Magnuson even !
if we were both in the same boat. I
We deplored Miss Steffen's;
tactics, —pardon the pun— not
lier strategy.)
• Ooolin Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Doolin's letter has both
merit and a severe defect. The
merit is that it opposes unin
formed emotional debate, that it
offers a more constructive op
portunity for debate, and that it
suggests some possible sources
of information for study. These
comments are in the best spirit
of free inquiry, and I applaud
them.
However. Mr. Doolin's insis
tence on the possession of all!
(or 4 out of 7> of the credentials |
he listed as a precondition to
debate is not as much in that
spirit. A basic ideal of a democ
racy has always been the discus
sion of nationally important is
sues by laymen non-specialist;
Senators and Congressmen, the I
press, and all interested citizens.!
While these laymen may not be
as qualified as the specialists
they can read the specialists,
such as Barnard Fall and sub
mit specialized information to
scrutiny. If. after making as
much of an investigation as i
they can, they feel that it is
imperative to speak out they
should do so. This is the basis
of a democracy run by the peo- J
pie rather than by the "ex
perts." and the burden falls
more and more on the citizen
when the press and Congress do
not debate the issues enough to
satisfy the curiosity of the
population.
As a direct reply to Mr. Doo
lin. I would like to meet with
him to discuss sources he may
have discovered that would en
lighten my opinion (I haw al
ready acquired book lists from j
the SCPV and the Stanford \
ROTC faculty), and I would like j
to invite him to attend a formal ,
debate between the SCPV and
CONSCIENCE to be held next
week (I believe Monday in
Roble).

• Dr. F. Satirized
Editor, The Daily:
(I was interviewed by L'.S.
Viwes and World Snort as a
sequel to their interview of Dr. !
P. They decided to forego pub-1
lishing rights but said that 11
may publish excerpts from the
interview in The Daily. The ex- j
cerpts follow.)
Q. As a natural sequel to our'
interview with Dr. P. we are
seeking an interview with a stu- \
dent duped by the Communists.
Would you answer a few ques
tions to establish your identity?
A. Yes.
Q. Are you now or have you

ever been in favor of peace?
A. I guess so.
Q. Have you ever worked for
civil rights?
A. Yes.
(J. Have you read any philos
ophy? Men such as Hume, Mill,
Russell, etc.?
A. Oh yes. I'm a philosophy
major.
Q. Ideal! You're obviously the
type of dupe we're looking for.
Dr. P. thinks Communism is a
"time bomb" on the campus. Do
you have any comments on
that?
A. Well, you can never take
scholars too seriously. They all
Ihink their own work is vital;
P. studies Communism who
would interview him if he didn't
think it was a time bomb?
Q. You evaded the question.
But what do you think of Dr.
P's theory that the current
marches are due to failure of
youth to get sufficient physical
exercise?
A. I thought the marches
were due to the war in Vietnam.
Q. Now that you've discussed
Dr. P's opinions on irresponsible
students, perhaps you would like
to comment, on irresponsible
scholars?
A. Not on irresponsible schol
ars but on ones with dual re
sponsibility. I mean by that re
sponsibility to their government
contracting office as well as to
their discipline. This seems to
me most serious; I've heard it
said that the size of his first
government grant means as
much to many a young scholar
these days as the length of his
first paper. Scholars in the nat
ural sciences, therefore, keep
quiet. Scholars in the social sci
ences well, let us say, they try
to serve two masters.
Q. Do you think some schol
ars slant their research to get
government grants or that, once
they have the grant, they just
produce what is desired?
A. Well, that's like asking
which came first: Prof. P. with
his hand out or the Air Force
offering the highest bid.

• "A Ticket, A Taskel*
Editor, The Daily:
Early lust Friday morning our
court in Escondido Village was
visited by the Stanford Police.
Every unregistered ear (about
50 per cent ) was ticketed.
We realize that the campus
police force has begun to issue
a large number of tickets for
laws which have been "over
looked" in the past without com
plaints. However, the recent
purge of the bicycle ridel's was
at least announced in The Daily.
Many of the Escondido residents
were not even aware of the ten
dollar fee to park in their in
dividual assigned park in g
places. Most have felt that only
those who drive to the public
campus parking lots required
registration. Literature issued
by the married student housing
clearly describes parking facili
ties in the village without men
tioning a required fee in addi
tion to rent. This is the first
mass ticketing since the con
struction of increment II two
years ago, which further leads
us to believe that, the interpreta
tion of "on campus parking" did
not include the assigned parking
in Escondido Village. According
to the map issued by the police,
Escondido Village is not included
as legal on campus parking!!
It seems that if the
police force is sincere in their
request (through the Married
Student Housing administra
tion) for Escondido residents to
leave their cars at home, they
could make an adjustment in the
registration fee for these people.
The campus police legal au
thority is based on California
VC '21113 which allows complete
l'rt edom to pass any law they de
sire. The police claim the nebu
lous University is responsible.
We appeal then to Mr. Univers
ity, whoever you are, to be reas
onable. A public announcement
of new laws and decisions to
enforce laws which have been
ignored in the past would be
appreciated.
