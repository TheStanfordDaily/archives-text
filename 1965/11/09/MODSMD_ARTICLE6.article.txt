# TELEGRAM TO CONSCIENCE
## Kuchel Supports Petition 
### 
Senator Thomas H. Kuchel in a
telegram yesterday to CONSCIENCE
urged all his fellow Americans tn
support the policy of our government
in Vietnam.
"Were we now to turn our backs and
run away, then another free land
would fall, and America's word would
be held in scorn by both friend and
foe alike. I urge all my fellow Amer
icans to sustain the position of our
government in time of crisis."
The telegram came in response to
a letter mailed Friday asking the .Sen
ator to associate himself with the
general goals of CONSCIENCE. The
letter was signed by Robert Naylor
and Jeff Chirm, co-chairmen of the
California Executive Committee of
CONSCIENCE.
Naylor and Chinti told the Daily
that they hoped to receive similar re
sponse from other major officials in
California but declined to mention the
other officials who have been con
tacted.
Founded two weeks ago at Stan
ford. CONSCIENCE hopes to give
students the opportunity to express
their agreement with the basic U.S.
position in Vietnam. This is the pur
pose of the petition now being cir
culated among students to illustrate
student support for the Administra
tion's policy. In the petition's two

weeks of circulation here at Stanford,
2100 student signatures have been
collected.
According to Bob Beyers of the
Stanford News Service, this set a
"new record for student expression."
By November 22. sponsors of the peti
tion hope to have 6,000 signatures to
be merged with other petitions across
the nation and sent to either the
President or the Secretary of Defense.
From there it will be directed to
Genera] Westmoreland, chief of the
U.S. military mission in Vietnam.
In a nationwide program on No
vember 22, major campuses of all
fifty slates, through the bipartisan

leadership of the Young Democrats
and Republicans, will schedule an
evening lecture under the topic. "Viet
nam: Responsible Democratic Citizen
ship in the University Community.''
Stanford, initiator of this national
program, is the focus.
An opposing group, the Americans
for Reappraisal of Far Eastern Pol
icy, a three week old voluntary stu
dent group at Stanford, said at last
count it had obtained 250 signatures,
mainly from students, favoring a UN
supervised cease fire by both sides in
Vietnam and negotiation toward rec
ognition of Red China by the U.S.
and in the U.N.

would fall, and America's word would
be held in scorn by both friend and
foe alike. I urge all my fellow Amer
icans to sustain the position of our
government in time of crisis."
The telegram came in response to
a letter mailed Friday asking the .Sen
ator to associate himself with the
general goals of CONSCIENCE. The
letter was signed by Robert Naylor
and Jeff Chirm, co-chairmen of the
California Executive Committee of
CONSCIENCE.
Naylor and Chinti told the Daily
that they hoped to receive similar re
sponse from other major officials in
California but declined to mention the
other officials who have been con
tacted.
Founded two weeks ago at Stan
ford. CONSCIENCE hopes to give
students the opportunity to express
their agreement with the basic U.S.
position in Vietnam. This is the pur
pose of the petition now being cir
culated among students to illustrate
student support for the Administra
tion's policy. In the petition's two

weeks of circulation here at Stanford,
2100 student signatures have been
collected.
According to Bob Beyers of the
Stanford News Service, this set a
"new record for student expression."
By November 22. sponsors of the peti
tion hope to have 6,000 signatures to
be merged with other petitions across
the nation and sent to either the
President or the Secretary of Defense.
From there it will be directed to
Genera] Westmoreland, chief of the
U.S. military mission in Vietnam.
In a nationwide program on No
vember 22, major campuses of all
fifty slates, through the bipartisan

leadership of the Young Democrats
and Republicans, will schedule an
evening lecture under the topic. "Viet
nam: Responsible Democratic Citizen
ship in the University Community.''
Stanford, initiator of this national
program, is the focus.
An opposing group, the Americans
for Reappraisal of Far Eastern Pol
icy, a three week old voluntary stu
dent group at Stanford, said at last
count it had obtained 250 signatures,
mainly from students, favoring a UN
supervised cease fire by both sides in
Vietnam and negotiation toward rec
ognition of Red China by the U.S.
and in the U.N.
Senator Thomas H. Kuchel in a
telegram yesterday to CONSCIENCE
urged all his fellow Americans tn
support the policy of our government
in Vietnam.
"Were we now to turn our backs and
run away, then another free land
would fall, and America's word would
be held in scorn by both friend and
foe alike. I urge all my fellow Amer
icans to sustain the position of our
government in time of crisis."
