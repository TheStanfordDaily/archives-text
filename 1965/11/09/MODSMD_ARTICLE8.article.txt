# ON STUDENT'S REQUEST
## Night Prowls Nab Untagged Cars 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
A recent wave of tickets for unreg
istered ears is the result of an intensi
fied effort to L, r <M all vehicles properly
licensed, Stanford Police Chief Gor
don Davis said today.
Davis said officers have been in
structed to cheek all living group
parking lots during the night to catch
any offenders. He said he had re
ceived several complaints from Escon
dido Village residents concerning the
need to buy a $10 vehicle tag.
"Registration is not buying a park
ing place." Davis said. "It's like a
license for operating a vehicle. Be
cause the University doesn't receive
tax monies as incorporated cities do.
funds for roads and parking areas
have to come from other sources."

Although Eseondido Village resi
dents pay for their apartments. Davis
said, this does not entitle them to fret*
parking. llf said all students had to
purchase registration tags if they
park on University property.
Davis, who has bee'n at Stanford
since 1930, recalled the beginning of
ear registration in the early HMO's.
"Originally, only staff members had
to register cars," Davis said. He said
there was no fee. and the registration
was only for reserved parking privi
leges.

A few years later students were
asked to register their ears too. Later,
a fee of $1 was eharged, and it was
increased to S3 and then to $10.
Fees Total $58,(100
A spokesman for the Colitrollers
Office said registration fees totaled
$."SB,OOO a year income for the Univer
sity. Me said the money was all put
in the General Fund from which
many general costs are paid.
Davis said the crackdown on regis
tration violations was spurred after
he had been asked by students why

"non-registered cars were not. being
ticketed.
Stanford policemen don't have quo
tas on the number of tickets they
have to get. the police chief said, and
thus there is no ticketing "for the
sake of ticketing." Davis said the Uni
versity is more concerned with re
ducing accidents and keeping order
than in taking revenue from traffic
fines.
Registration Fee Is Low-
Davis noted that the $10 registra
tion fee was rather low compared to
many other campuses. He said at

schools like Illinois and Wisconsin
fees as high as $t>u to $110 a year
were charged. Other campuses allow
no cars within certain areas, he said,
and at some schools parking spaces
are several miles from classrooms.
In schools like these, Davis said,
students have to take a bus to get
to campus.
The Stanford police chief also com
mended students for their careful
driving. "Occasionally there's a show
off." Davis said. "But the great ma
jority of our students are very safety
conscious.'

license for operating a vehicle. Be

tax monies as incorporated cities do.

Although Eseondido Village resi
dents pay for their apartments. Davis
said, this does not entitle them to fret*
parking. llf said all students had to
purchase registration tags if they
park on University property.
Davis, who has bee'n at Stanford
since 1930, recalled the beginning of
ear registration in the early HMO's.
"Originally, only staff members had
to register cars," Davis said. He said
there was no fee. and the registration
was only for reserved parking privi
leges.

A few years later students were
asked to register their ears too. Later,
a fee of $1 was eharged, and it was
increased to S3 and then to $10.
Fees Total $58,(100
A spokesman for the Colitrollers
Office said registration fees totaled
$."SB,OOO a year income for the Univer
sity. Me said the money was all put
in the General Fund from which
many general costs are paid.
Davis said the crackdown on regis
tration violations was spurred after
he had been asked by students why

"non-registered cars were not. being
ticketed.
Stanford policemen don't have quo
tas on the number of tickets they
have to get. the police chief said, and
thus there is no ticketing "for the
sake of ticketing." Davis said the Uni
versity is more concerned with re
ducing accidents and keeping order
than in taking revenue from traffic
fines.
Registration Fee Is Low-
Davis noted that the $10 registra
tion fee was rather low compared to
many other campuses. He said at

schools like Illinois and Wisconsin
fees as high as $t>u to $110 a year
were charged. Other campuses allow
no cars within certain areas, he said,
and at some schools parking spaces
are several miles from classrooms.
In schools like these, Davis said,
students have to take a bus to get
to campus.
The Stanford police chief also com
mended students for their careful
driving. "Occasionally there's a show
off." Davis said. "But the great ma
jority of our students are very safety
conscious.'
A recent wave of tickets for unreg
istered ears is the result of an intensi
fied effort to L, r <M all vehicles properly
licensed, Stanford Police Chief Gor
don Davis said today.
Davis said officers have been in
structed to cheek all living group
parking lots during the night to catch
any offenders. He said he had re

need to buy a $10 vehicle tag.
