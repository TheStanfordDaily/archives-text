## 
### 
The Rev. John Tirrell, former as
sistant chaplain at Stanford, refused
;m order Sunday from the Episcopal
bishop of Edinburg. Scotland, to stop
preaching in a Presbyterian church
t here.
The Rev. Mr. Tirrell, an Episcopa
lian. had signed a two-year contract
to preach at St. Giles' Presbyterian
Church. In light of the young priest's
refusal, the bishop. Dr. Kenneth Car
ey, forbade him to conduct services in
any Episcopal churches in the Edin
burgh Diocese.
The Rev. Mr. Tirrell left Stanford

a year and a halt ago to go to Edin
burgh. where lie is studying for a
Ph.D. at Edinburgh University.
Fear Disunity
Church leaders said they fear the
dispute would disrupt ecumenical re
lations between the Presbyterian and
Episcopal churches in Scotland.
The Rt. Rev. James A. Pike, Epis
copal bishop of California and the
Rev. Mr. Tirrell's direct superior, said.
"In this ecumenical age, I am at a
loss to understand the action of the
bishop of Edinburgh."
"There io no prohibition in the can

on law that would bar the arrange
ment at St. Giles'," he continued.
Bishop Carey, however, says his
order was based on Canon XVI ruling
that one man cannot be minister in
two churches.
Whatever the case, Bishop Tike said
he would be forced to take discipli
nary acntion against the Rev. Mr. Tir
roll if he continues preaching at St.
Giles' in violation of Bishop Carey's
order.
The Kev. "Mr. Tirrell said he would
ignore the bishop's order and "con
tinue by God's grace as one ol Ihe
assistants."
