STOP THE BOMBING
A FACULTY LETTER TO PRESIDENT JOHNSON
More than 150 Faculty Members from virtually every Stanford de
partment have endorsed the Advertisement (below) which is to be pub
lished in the Washington Post later this month.
Because other Bay Area schools (Berkeley, San Jose and S. F. State)
are still collecting names for this ad and because some Stanford faculty
may not have received the letter requesting signatures the deadline has
been extended to Friday, November 1 2.
If you wish to endorse this ad, sign below and mail to;
TOM PLAUT
Human Problems Institute
Stanford, California
Though signatures do not entail any financial obligation, it is hoped
that most signers will be able to aid in defraying the cost of the ad (ap
proximately $5,000) by contributing about $5.00. Checks should be
made payable to Tom Plaut (Post ad) and sent to him at the above
address.
Dear Mr. President:
We the undersigned urge that our country immediately and un
conditionally stop the bombing of North Vietnam.
It is still our hope that the United States government seeks no
wider war. We agree with you, Mr. President: "Weapons do not make
peace; men make peace, and peace comes not through strength alone
but through wisdom and patience and restraint.
We understand that our Government, through our Ambassador
in Warsaw and the good offices of other states, has already entered
into indirect communications with both Peking and Hanoi. Political
realism requires that we enter into direct negotiations with all con
cerned parties in the spirit of "Pacem in Terris. We, therefore, urge
that our country unmistakably indicate its willingness to participate
in a peace conference and to recognize the National liberation Front
as one party to the negotiations.
Our doing so will be a sign of strength, not weakness; it will
signify the sincerity of our willingness to negotiate, a willingness
which we have so often asserted; it will spare the tragic killing of tens
of thousands of innocent Vietnamese, as well as thousands of our
sons and brothers who may lose their lives in this brutal and unnec
essary conflict.
We the undersigned understand that our signatures will appear
an an advertisement in the Washington Post in November 1965.
I endorse the above ad
(Signature) (Department)
