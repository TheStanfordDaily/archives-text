'Notes On The War'
Some knowledgable onservers say that a total American commitment of
| 400,000 troops within a year is not unlikely.
"Even then," one key official told me, the morale of South Vietnamese
! peasants will be crucial. If they believe the Viet Cong is losing and begin to
I work against it, we can win; but should they be turned the other way by the
i I largep resence of U.S. troops and give the Viet Cong more co-operation, we've
J had it." (Carl T. Rewan, S.F. Examiner, Nov. 1.)
Here in Chu Lai we may send out patrols for weeks without ever sighting a
j : Viet Cong. Then there may be engagements for several days straight. The
| people may wave and smile at us in the local villages while hiding their
j j weapons behind their backs. . . . We are fighting not only for these people's
I freedom, but for the freedom of men everywhere. (Pfc. William R. Whitacre,
in U.S. News and World Report, Nov. 1).
The Communist Viet Cong has gained strength in South Vietnam during the
! last four months despite a 'dramatic increase in their losses, U.S. officials
' said Thursday. The officials told reporters there now are 75,000 to 80,000
regulars and 100,000 to 120,000 part-time guerillas in the Viet Cong fighting
i forces. Losses were put at more than 60 a week or 75 per cent above last year.
(San Jose Mercury, October 22.)
American officials ore aware that the presence of massive numbers of
U.S. troops may prove to be as much of a political liability as they are a military
| asset.
One recent survey by the U.S. Information Service showed that fewer Viet-
I namese respected U.S. troops than respected the regular Vietnamese army,
which has never en|oyed much popularity among the nation's warweary
i ! peasantry.
High-ranking Vietnamese officials, each denying his own guilt, readily ad
mit that corruption is more widespread today than at any time since the over
! throw of diem.
There is mounting resentment among city dwellers and lower military ranks
over unfulfilled promises to eradicate corruption and relieve the inflation spur- J
j red by the influx of free-spending American troops.
After agreeing to a truce and sending its men back to propagandize in the
villages, the Viet Cong could launch an appear for—and possibly win —na-
I tional elections which the "Free World ' would hardly oppose. (Ray Herndon,
UPI, in S.F. Sunday Examiner rind Chronicle October 31.)
The only way we canl ose this wa r now, say [Ky's Chief of State, Major
, Genera! Nquyen Van) Thieu, is in a political or moral way — not in a tactical
! way. So why should any of talk of negotiations? If we talk about negotiation
now, we give the enemy hope and confidence. (Time Magazine, Ociober 22.)

The Communist Viet Cong has gained strength in South Vietnam during the
! last four months despite a 'dramatic increase in their losses, U.S. officials
' said Thursday. The officials told reporters there now are 75,000 to 80,000
regulars and 100,000 to 120,000 part-time guerillas in the Viet Cong fighting
i forces. Losses were put at more than 60 a week or 75 per cent above last year.
(San Jose Mercury, October 22.)
American officials ore aware that the presence of massive numbers of
U.S. troops may prove to be as much of a political liability as they are a military
| asset.
One recent survey by the U.S. Information Service showed that fewer Viet-
I namese respected U.S. troops than respected the regular Vietnamese army,
which has never en|oyed much popularity among the nation's warweary
i ! peasantry.
High-ranking Vietnamese officials, each denying his own guilt, readily ad
mit that corruption is more widespread today than at any time since the over
! throw of diem.
There is mounting resentment among city dwellers and lower military ranks
over unfulfilled promises to eradicate corruption and relieve the inflation spur- J
j red by the influx of free-spending American troops.
After agreeing to a truce and sending its men back to propagandize in the
villages, the Viet Cong could launch an appear for—and possibly win —na-
I tional elections which the "Free World ' would hardly oppose. (Ray Herndon,
UPI, in S.F. Sunday Examiner rind Chronicle October 31.)
The only way we canl ose this wa r now, say [Ky's Chief of State, Major
, Genera! Nquyen Van) Thieu, is in a political or moral way — not in a tactical
! way. So why should any of talk of negotiations? If we talk about negotiation
now, we give the enemy hope and confidence. (Time Magazine, Ociober 22.)

'Notes On The War'
Some knowledgable onservers say that a total American commitment of
| 400,000 troops within a year is not unlikely.
"Even then," one key official told me, the morale of South Vietnamese
! peasants will be crucial. If they believe the Viet Cong is losing and begin to
I work against it, we can win; but should they be turned the other way by the
i I largep resence of U.S. troops and give the Viet Cong more co-operation, we've
J had it." (Carl T. Rewan, S.F. Examiner, Nov. 1.)
Here in Chu Lai we may send out patrols for weeks without ever sighting a
j : Viet Cong. Then there may be engagements for several days straight. The
| people may wave and smile at us in the local villages while hiding their
j j weapons behind their backs. . . . We are fighting not only for these people's
I freedom, but for the freedom of men everywhere. (Pfc. William R. Whitacre,
