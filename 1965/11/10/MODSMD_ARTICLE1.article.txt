# New Dean Views Role As 'Exhilarating'
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
"I don't .think it's lair to define my role by
the tasks historically assigned to the Dean's
Office," said Joel Smith, the new Associate
Dean of Students for Student Organizations,
in an interview witli The Daily recently.
Smith's job, which grew out of the recent
reorganization of the Dean's Office following
last year's resignations, is that of being t he
administration's overseer for student activi
ties. "My task is one of being responsible for
working with all of the student organizations
- ASSU. AWS, and some 200 other groups
representing student interests of a varied
sort," he noted. "1 look upon my role as being
able to respond to student initiative.
"To me, my job is an extremely important
one very exhilarating and very challenging."
The new dean regards the enhancement of
communications among students, faculty, and
administrators as one of his basic responsi
bilities. "I'm inclined to look upon a dean's

position as being to help create a climate
which is congenial for the more essential busi
ness of education, namely, instruction and re
search," lie said. "I have an ardent philosophi
cal interest in education."
As an ex-officio member of several Univer
sity committees, another of his tasks is to
participate "in major policy questions which
affect students."
Marshall Scholar
Dean Smith, 32, comes to Stanford with an
impressive list of qualifications.
He was graduated summa cum laiuhe in 1955
from Beloit College in Wisconsin, where he
made Phi Beta Kappa and was president of
the student body. As an undergraduate, he
thought he might like to pursue a career in
undergraduate education.
From Beloit, he went to Oxford for two
years on a Marshall Scholarship.
After returning to the United States, he
enrolled at the University of Wisconsin Law
School. "I originally planned to teach," he
recalls, "but changed my mind and decided to

get an LLB instead of a PhD.'' He received his
law degree in 1961.
But his wish to work in an academic com
munity never vanished. After working with
a law firm in Minneapolis for four years, he
came to Stanford last January to work as a
lawyer in the General Secretary's Office.
Smith was tapped for his present job last
summer.
"I don't have the conventional background
of someone doing this sort of work," he noted
modestly.
'Adventuresoine' Programs
Smith believes that the administration of
the University ought to sustain a situation in
which students can be "as self-governing as
is practical." As to the limits of this practi
cality, he said that it "depends on the partic
ular* issue and the particular circumstance.
"There is no doubt in my mind, however,
that University policies must determine the
context in which student government oper
ates," he asserted. "That is imperative."
lie added, though, that he thought such

policies should give students the maximum
opportunity to be "adventuresome" in formu
lating their own programs.
Smith felt that it would be premature for
him to evaluate Stanford's student govern
ment at this point.
However, he was ready to venture an opin
ion on the general studentry. "The Stanford
student body is certainly the most able that
I've ever had contact withâ€”probably also the
most aware," he said. "I'm extremely im
pressed with Stanford students."
A James Bond Figure?
Since the beginning of the year, Smith has
been attending various meetings of the Legis
lature and of several ASSU boards and com
missions, giving rise to the fears of some that
he is a James Bond for the Stanford Intelli
gence Agency.
However, the dean explained that his pres
ence has been due to a more positive reason:
"When I was appointed to this job, I thought
it made sense for me to spend several months
trying to get a sophisticated feeling of the

student situation at Stanford. I was never a
student here, and was here only a short while
before becoming dean, so 1 wanted to get an
impression before making judgments."
Students who have had contact with Smith
have been impressed with his interest in them.
Before the recent (50-hour White Plaza vigil
of the Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam, the dean agreed to be sure that the
vigilers would be adequately protected. Dur
ing the second night of the sleep-out, several
students began to harrass the protestors.
According to David Ransom, SCPV chair
man, the Stanford Police were called, Ivut were
not able to help as they did not have enough
men. Finally, about 1:30 a.m., Ransom called
Smith. "He came to the Plaza himself," said
Ransom. "He was very angry about the har
rassment, but held his anger well."
Smith stayed with the vigilers both that
night and the next "for quite a while," ac
cording to Ransom, and saw to it that extra
protection would be available for the demon
strators.
