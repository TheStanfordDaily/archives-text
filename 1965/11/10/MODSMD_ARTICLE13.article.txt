# Volunteers Work For Mental Health
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
"It's nice to meet you," the
efficient woman said as she has
tily removed the tag I was wear
ing giving my full name. She
replaced it with one bearing
only "Sandy," explaining, "We
never use last names here."
This was my introduction to
the Stanford Volunteers for
Mental Health, a small, enthusi
astic group of students, inter
ested in learning about and help
ing mental patients. Once a
week they visit either Agnews
State Hospital or the Menlo
Park Veterans Administration,
a branch of the Palo Alto Neuro
psychiatric Hospital.
I chose to visit Ward 15 in the
Veterans Administration. Armed
with a deck of cards and instruc
tions to mix, I entered the large
lounge where about forty men
were sitting around the edges.
Need Community Contact
The men in Ward 15 have
been there for an average of
fourteen years. All hough they
are free to come and go and are
awarded privileges for good be
havior, many are quite content
to remain within the secure sur
roundings of the ward. The pro

fessional staff attempt to help
them to adjust to life on the
"outside," but their efforts are
somewhat restricted by the sur
roundings and the lack of con
tact with the community.
Stanford volunteers can pro
vide the opportunity for the
men to be exposed to young
people. The patients look for
ward to these Wednesday night
visits, and t hough some may not
actively participate in the pro
gram, all benefit from the
smiles, personal conversations,
and the break in routine.
Extended Friendships
Some of the friendships be
tween volunteers and patients
can extend beyond the hospital
gates. A group interested in dra
ma, for instance, could be in
vited by t heir Stanford friend
to attend a local play. Volun
teers can work with the men on
an individual basis or in a group
therapy situation. They need not
be psychology majors; nor is
previous experience necessary.
Groups leave from behind the
bookstore every Wednesday eve
ning at 6:50 for Agnews State
Hospital and at 7:15 for the
Menlo Park Veterans Adminis
tration. Students interested in
the program should call 321-2300,
extension 4502.

"It's nice to meet you," the
efficient woman said as she has
tily removed the tag I was wear
ing giving my full name. She
replaced it with one bearing
only "Sandy," explaining, "We
never use last names here."
This was my introduction to
the Stanford Volunteers for
Mental Health, a small, enthusi
astic group of students, inter
ested in learning about and help
ing mental patients. Once a
week they visit either Agnews
State Hospital or the Menlo
Park Veterans Administration,
a branch of the Palo Alto Neuro
psychiatric Hospital.
I chose to visit Ward 15 in the
Veterans Administration. Armed
with a deck of cards and instruc
tions to mix, I entered the large
lounge where about forty men
were sitting around the edges.
Need Community Contact
The men in Ward 15 have
been there for an average of
fourteen years. All hough they
are free to come and go and are
awarded privileges for good be
havior, many are quite content
to remain within the secure sur
roundings of the ward. The pro

fessional staff attempt to help
them to adjust to life on the
"outside," but their efforts are
somewhat restricted by the sur
roundings and the lack of con
tact with the community.
Stanford volunteers can pro
vide the opportunity for the
men to be exposed to young
people. The patients look for
ward to these Wednesday night
visits, and t hough some may not
actively participate in the pro
gram, all benefit from the
smiles, personal conversations,
and the break in routine.
Extended Friendships
Some of the friendships be
tween volunteers and patients
can extend beyond the hospital
gates. A group interested in dra
ma, for instance, could be in
vited by t heir Stanford friend
to attend a local play. Volun
teers can work with the men on
an individual basis or in a group
therapy situation. They need not
be psychology majors; nor is
previous experience necessary.
Groups leave from behind the
bookstore every Wednesday eve
ning at 6:50 for Agnews State
Hospital and at 7:15 for the
Menlo Park Veterans Adminis
tration. Students interested in
the program should call 321-2300,
extension 4502.
