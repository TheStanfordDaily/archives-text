# AAWU Squads Bury Non-Conference Foes
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
In a year when there are
good football teams but few
great ones, one group is a bas
tion of consistency. The AAWU
of which Stanford is a member
has mowed down non-conference
foes with utter abandon.
Led by surprising Washington
State's five non-league victories,
the AAWU has a fine 26-84 rec
ord against non-members. Stan
ford and Oregon are both un
defeated, though tied, in their
efforts. Both have records of
4-0-1.
Cal and UCLA, two schools
which were supposed to be at
the bottom of the pack, are cur
-4-1 and 3-1-1 respectively. Ore
gon State is another school with
four wins. They also have two
losses. The two teams with the
worst records are the league
leading Trojans of Southern Cal
ifornia and Washington's Hus
kies. They each have one win
in three tries.
Even With Big 10
Against perennial powerhous
es in the Big Ten, the AAWU
is exactly even, 5-5-1. Washing
ton State is again leading the
West Coast with three wins in
three games versus the Mid
westemers.
Almost all of the contests have
been hotly fought battles right
down to the final gun. Eight of
the games were decided by one
touchdown or less. Three of
those edgewise wins go to Wash
ington State. The Cougars beat
lowa, 7-0; slipped past Minne
sota, 14-13; and overcame Indi
ana, 8-7, with a no-time-remain
ing two-point conversion.
Two familiar faces among
conference opponents are Idaho
and Air Force. Each has played
four members of the AAWU.
The Vandals have a 1-3 record.

They have lost close games 1o
Oregon State, Washington, and
Oregon. The biggest margin of
victory or defeat was five points.
Their lone triumph came at the
expense of Washington State. It
is Washington's only loss.
The Falcons have lost to Stan
ford in a 17-16 thriller, 24-7 to
Cal, and 10-0 to UCLA. In their
other game with the AAWU
they tied Oregon.
Last Loses
Ranked as the top team in
the East early in the season and
still near that spol, Penn Stale
may think twice before sched
uling a University of California
team again. They lost a close
one to UCLA, 24-22, a month
ago, but the topper came two
weeks ago. Leading Cal, 17-14,
with time running out; Penn
Stale watched Cal's Jerry Brad
ley catch a deflected 16 yard
pass in the end '/.one with no
time remaining on the clock to
give the Bears a 21-17 win.
Syracuse, the team that un
seated Penn State for number
one ranking in the East is an
other "cousin" to the AAWU.
UCLA trounced Syracuse 24-7,
and Oregon State edged the
Orangemen, 13-12, last weekend.
Oregon Slate's win over Syra
cuse enabled the AAWU to
maintain an undefeated record
against the East. The record is
7-0-1. The tie came from the
Stanford-Navy contest w h ic h
ended 7-7.
Stanford Wins
Stanford atoned for the tie by
squashing Army 31-14 a few
weeks later. Army was ranked
number three in the East at the
time.
Against assorted other foes,
the AAWU sports a 14-3-2 mark.
Some of these "other foes" are
Kansas, Utah, Tulane, and Notre
Dame.

The Fighting Irish are the
only team that has been as
suredly unholy in their attitude
towards the West. In the first
game of the season, they tram
plod Cal 48-6. Three weeks ago
they settled a score with USC
from the 1964 season when the
Trojans ruined Notre Dame's
perfect record witli an exciting
20-17 win on the last day of the
season.
War llorsc Limps
The Irish keyed on Mike Gar
rett and dismantled the Trojan
machine, 28-7.
Four more non-conference
games remain for the AAWU j
three of which could add con
siderably to the West's prestige.
USC plays Pittsburgh and
Wyoming, and UCLA meets
Tennessee.
Wyoming has only lost one
game, and is romping over its
opponents.
Tennessee is the probable win
ner of the Southeastern confer
ence, and just last week beat
Georgia Tech, 21-6.
