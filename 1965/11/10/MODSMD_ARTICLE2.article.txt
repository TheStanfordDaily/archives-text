• Northeast Blacks Out
NEW YORK A massive electric
power failure plunged New York City,
Boston and vast areas of the North
east back into the days of candle
light yesterday, choking traffic and
disrupting communications. The
blackout, which extended into parts
of Canada, was estimated to have hit
cities, towns and countryside in which
at least 20 million people live.
Countless commuters were stranded
in subways and elevators and on elec
tric trains. Airliners were diverted
from New York's blacked-out airports
to Newark and Philadelphia ports.
National Guardsmen were alerted
to prevent looting. President Johnson
was informed that the blackout,
which first closed in about 5:30 p.m.
EST, would l)o over by 10 p.m., as har
ried power experts strove 1o remedy
the break or breaks.
• Pacifist liar as Self
NEW YORK A young Roman
Catholic pacifist, almost every inch
of his body burned, lingered on the
brink of death after turning himself
into a human torch yesterday outside
the United Nations to protest the Viet
nam war. Later, lie apparently re
pented the ghastly deed. "I'm anti
war, all wars. I did this as a religious
action," said Roger LaPorte, 22, the
second American in a week to set fire
to himself in such a protest.
