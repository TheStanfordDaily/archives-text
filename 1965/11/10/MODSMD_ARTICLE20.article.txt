## Prof, Doolin's Letter Raises Questions Of Citizen's Role 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Doolin's letter in the
Nov. Bth Daily raises fundamen
tal questions not only on the
role of the citizen in judging
foreign policy, but on the matter
of democracy itself. For exam
ple, what entitles Prof. Doolin
to vote on any number of issues
on which he does not have ex
pert knowledge? Why not leave
all government, not only foreign
policy, to the experts? Does
Aristotle's answer to Plato's Re
public still hold: that though
chefs may know most about
cooking, it belongs to the eaters
to decide what is good food. We
have to live in this world, and
hence have as much importance
in deciding whether it is fit to
live in as Southeast Asian
specialists.
There are further implications
in Prof. Doolin's letter, which
lists "must" reading. If a person
has read all that Doolin specifies
plus one more document, is Doo
lin then outclassed? Are we com
puters in which output is purely
the result of input, machines
which process information pre
dictably and innocently? One
may understand more about war
in Vietnam from reading Erik
son on human aggrtvssion than
from reading Chen Yi (?). Can
we limit the amount and variety
of material we bring to an ap
praisal of the Vietnam problem
to Prof. Doolin's narrow list? I
do not intend to single out Erik
son as required reading, certain
ly: does The Iliad have anything
to say, or Jesus? or Hume?
I mention Hume pointedly.
The great Scotsman emphasized
better than anyone else the gap
between facts and values. There
is no way of logically leaping
from "is" to "ought". No mat
ter what esoteric data on Viet
nam is collected, it can never
imply by itself that we ought
to act in any particular way.
There is a debate on policy, and
this is valid. But there is also a
debate on values, the resolution
of which will in the long run
be much more important to the
quality of life in America than
any special knowledge about
Vietnam or the Far East.
I do hope the other side has a
champion who will do battle
with Professor Duolin on his
own terms. Let us give expertise
its due. But let us keep in mind
as well, that to bow down before
arcane knowledge is to renounce
not only an essential political
function in a democracy, that of
choice, but to renounce our hu
manity as well.

• Doolin Criteria
Preclude Pope, LBJ
Editor, The Daily:
Dr. Doolin's letter, which ap- j
peared in Monday's Daily, reads ;
like a parody on an academi- j
cian's flaunting of smug expert- '
ise. It strikes me as somewhat |
ironic that his criteria for in- i
formed dialogue would doubt- !
less preclude his condescending '
to debate Vietnamese policy with
Pope Paul or even President
Johnson.
1 am aware of two basic argu
ments for thi' presence of our
forces in Vietnam: 1) They are
containing Chinese Communist i
imperialist expansion. 2) They :
are there to guarantee the right j
of the South Vietnamese people '
to govern themselves.
I would like to point out three

facts which have led me to re
gard as unjustifiable the war in
Vietnam: 1) U.S. forces are now
in the process of killing large
numbers of Vietnamese, many
guilty of no worse crime than
looking suspiciously like Com
munists frpm the air. 2» The
ratio of American soldiers to
Red Chinese imperialists in
South Vietnam is well over a
thousand to one. 3) In 19o(> Ihe
U.S. selected and supported Pres
ident of South Vietnam publicly
and unilaterally abrogated that
clause of the Geneva Agree
ments of 1954 calling for reuni
fication of Vietnam by means
of general elections to be held
in both zones in 1956. I must
confess to having arrived at
these conclusions without the
benefit of reading any of Chiang
Kai-Chek's key statements in the
original Chinese. 1 have relied
rather on more popular sources
such as wire-service articles and
President Eisenhower's Mandate
for Change.
Finaly may I take the liberty
to suggest some homework to
Dr. Doolin as preparation to his
confronting the forces of ignor
ance and hysteria: a thoughtful
reading of 1) the Declaration of
Independence and 2) the New
Testament.

• Univ. Medicare
Kditor, The Daily:
This letter is to express my
dissatisfaction with the way the
University is handling certain
changes in the health and hospi
talization insurance available to
the Stanford faculty and staff.
Late last week all Stanford
faculty and staff currently cov
ered by the Family Medical
Care Plan of the Palo Alto Med
ical Clinic received a large pack
et of information on changes in
the Clinic Plan and on a new
Blue Cross-Blue Shield Plan.
This information was sent to
over 1700 members of the Stan
ford community. They now have
until November 10th to make
their choice among these two
plans. The material prepared by
the Palo Alto Clinic and by Blue
Cross is quite technical and di
rect comparisons of the two
plans are extremely difficult to
make. It appears to me that the
University officials should have
prepared a point-for-point com-!
parison (at least of major fea-'
tures) of the two plans so that
Stanford faculty and staff would
have some more reasonable ba
sis for making their decision.
In the meeting held earlier
this week to explain the details
of the plans, an excellent com

parison of the plans was finally :
presented by one of the repre
sentatives from the Clinic. Why
was such a comparison not in
cluded in the original mailing? !
1 am certain that tho many per- 1
sons moi at this meeting would |
very much want to have this in- j
formation before 1 lie close of
the enrollment period next
Wednesday.
Apparently, the discussions be
tween the University and the
Clinic began many months ago |
- and it was known that the I
new plan was to begin on Dei
comber Ist. Why was it not pos-.
sible to send more complete
and meaningful information at
an earlier time? 1 also under
stand that Blue Cross was only
informed about the changes in j
the Clinic plan at the last mo-!
ment so that they had very lit-1
tie time to prepare their own !
counter-proposal.
The large turnout for the!
meeting to discuss these plans
suggest the high level of faculty •
and staff concern about matters i
of medical and hospital insur- i
ance. The University should be j
able to operate more efficiently !
and with more consideration for '
its employees in matters that j
relate to such basic questions as ,
health care.
There still is time for the Uni- .
versity to make available the j
kind of point-for-point compari- !
son of the two plans mentioned
above.

• Trick Or Treat ?
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University has many :
able scholars specializing on j
Communist doctrine, strategy, !
and tactics. It is thus unfortu- j
nate that a national magazine
should disseminate the opinions
regarding "Red activity on cam-;
pus" of one whose work has j
never met even the loosest!
standards of scholarship. It was j
very appropriate, however, that
this interview was published in
the Halloween edition.
