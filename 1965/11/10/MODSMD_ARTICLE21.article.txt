# Changed Inside

It is one thing to quiet the symptom, another to cure the disease. To wash
the body is not to cleanse the soul. Sin is never just what we do, but what we
are. To reform the outer man and leave untouched the human heart is to
build the kind of hypocrites Jesus Christ so soundly condemned: "Woe to you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and
the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Phari
see! First cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also
may be clean. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like
whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of
dead men's bones and all undeanness. So you also appear righteous to men,
but within you are full of iniquity and hypocrisy" (Matthew 23:25â€”28).
To hypocrites, and liars, to the immoral and adulterous, in fact to all of
us, Greek and Jew, the Bible says, "God has concluded all under sin, that he
may have mercy upon all' (Romans 11:32), and"the wages of sin is death *
(Romans 6:23).
In the perfect sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, God has bridged for us a
Way reconciling His holiness with our sinfullness, putting away sin by the sac
rifice of Himself. The Bible is Good News because it says to you: God has rec
onciled and forgiven you, "the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ
our lord (Romans 6:23).
Why not start today on that New Life which God offers you today? For
we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various pas
sions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and
hating onp another; but when the goodness and loving kindness of God our
Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness,
but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in
the Holy Spirit, which he poured out upon us rickly through Jesus Christ our
Savior, so that we might be |ustified by his grace and become heirs in hope of
eternal life" (Titus 3:3-7).
Washed inside? You con be today. Why be half-clean, it's the inside mctn
that counts!
