# Stanford-in- Washington: Of Success And Funding
## 
### 
As the Stanford-in\\ ashington Program be
gins its fourth year of Operation Today and
Tomorrow, it somew hat unsettles our critical na
ture to note that there is much to praise about
this ambitious project and almost nothing to
find fault with.
Inaugurated three years ago by then-student
Jamie Hunter in conjunction with the staff of
the Alumni Association, SIW lias grown from
a beginning of I I interns to 88 last year, making
Stanford the single largest contributor of sum
mer interns in the nations capitol. Moreover,
there is a marked amount ot diversity in the
tvpe of jobs included in the program; a success
ful applicant may find himself in a freshman
Senator's office, the archives of the Voice of
America, the lilcs of a Congressional committee,
or the labyrinthine reaches of the Pentagon.
The work is not always excitingâ€”but the
program directors have never promised it
would be. Some arc stuck with endless filing
and tvping; others do research ol a measureful
and educational nature; most do some of both;
and all learn more about politics and the dav
to-dav operation of the federal government than
any course can teach.
Administered for the most part by unpaid stu
dent volunteers, the program serves not only as
a clearing house for applicants seeking work in
Washington but it also attempts to provide low
cost housing and financial support for those
employed in non-paying or low-paying jobs.
Here is where there is room for progress.
In each of the last two years, the program has
been supported b\ $4,700 in gifts from five
private donors. Hopefully, these funds will be
augmented this year, since several students
were forced to make decided financial sacrifices

last similiter in order to participate in the pro
gram.
Surely some publicity and effort by the people
who put PACE over the $110 million mark
would insure that one of the University's newest
and most successful vetures does not lose par
ticipants because of inability to meet legitimate
financial needs.
