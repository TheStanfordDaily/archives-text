A few weeks ago, some perceptive representa
tive proposed to the Legislature that the Presi
dent of tlu' Associated Students investigate the
disposition of the $10 automobile registration
fee and report back on the feasibility of a re
duction.
Soon after, irate letters began to appear in
our office attesting to and protesting against
a massive campaign by the Police Department
to ticket every unregistered car on campus,
We u ill not argue cause and effect, but we do
think the coincidence a bit odd. We somehow
find it hard to believe that Chief Gordon Davis
and 1 lis men began this effort after several stu
dents had asked why non-registered ears were
not being ticketed.
11 such concern is w hat precludes action on
Stanford's increasingly confused and unevenly
administrated traffic problem, then perhaps
some interested students might inquire of the
Chief and the powers that be just what the
858,000 a year income from these registration
fees is used for. We also think a long look at the
entire problem of parking and ticketing—for
cars, motorcycles and bicycles, might profitably
be* examined.
