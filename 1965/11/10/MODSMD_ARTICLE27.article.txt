## The 						'Great Society' And Elections In Megalopolis 
### Walter Lippmann 
One of the most significant
things about the municipal elec
tions, especially in New York, is
what didn't happen. II is like the
story in which Sherlock Holmes
solved the mystery by noting
that in the night the dog had
not barked.
The country has ju<t seen a
tremendous legislative program
enacted by Congress designed to
begin the construction of what
is called the Great Society. Yet
very little, almost nothing, has
been said by the national leaders
of either party about, the fact
that, while the Great Society
can be authorized and in part
financed in Washington, it will
have to be worked out and paid
for and administered and en
forced in the great urban con
glomerations where an increas
ing majority of our people live.
The Goldwater Republicans
can be excused here because, as
a matter of fact, they do not be
lieve in the Great Society. The
other Republicans may be al
lowed to plead that ihey cannot
be expecicd to line up as Lyndon
Johnson Democrats.
What Of The Democrats?
Put what of 1 ho Democrats?
They passed through the cam
paign acting as if the paramount
issue in New York were wheth
er a Democrat, any Democrat,
is elected over a Republican, any
Republican.
Reading what was reported of
the Vice President's speeches in
New York and the text of Bill
Moyers' statement from Texas,
the striking fact is that the dog
did not bark. There was no rec
ognition, apparently there was
no realization, of the intimate
and organic connection between
the government of the Great So
ciety and the government of the
great cities.
Yet the connection is at the
very heart of the problem. Un
der the President's leadership
the 89th Congress has enacted
a most impressive and most
promising batch of legislation.
But legislation is no more than
a batch of architect's plans and
a few holes in the ground. The
edifice of the Great Society will
have to be built, if it is to be
built at all. in the great cities
which are now the focal point
of the new American way of
living.
The Easiest Part
However promising and im
pressive the legislation enacted
by Congress, il is a mere begin
ning and much t he easiest part

of the whole undertaking. The
hard nub of the matter is the
political backwardness of local
government, state, county, mu
nicipal. The backwardness is not
only in the archaic legal struc
ture of local government which
comes down from an earlier
America- but in the political
habits of the local politicians
and of the local pressure
groups.
The renovation and modern
ization and reconstruction of lo
cal governments is the make-or
break business of the Great So
ciety. The study of this problem
has just begun, and there is as
yet .just a bare beginning of a
serious discussion among ex
perls. In my view, the issue in
New York has been whether the
voters would or would not en
dorse a serious attempt not to
solve but to look at the problem
â€¢ itself. The problem of governing
a great city like New York is
by all odds the most important,
I lie most pressing and the most
unavoidable domestic problem
that we have to face.
'This Don lias Not Barked'
This gap. this void, this dog
that has not barked is enough
to make one ask how deeply the
problem of creating a Great So
ciety is appreciated by those
who have made the legislative
blueprints. Last summer Rich
ard Goodwin, in his memorable
valedictory speech on resigning
from t lie White House staff,
said that il is necessary "to re
shape the historic relationships
of our federal structure. Today's
problems ignore the traditional
boundaries of city, state and
nation. We are not wise enough
to solve them from the top, nor
are there resources enough to
solve them from the bottom."
In the light of its altitude to
ward the municipal elections
this year, it is impossible not to
wonder whether the administra
tion has taken these truths to
heart.
That may well be the reason
why the dog did not bark. The
ideas which the administration
needs are ideas of how to get
t lie Great Society constructed
upon the foundations which the
89th Congress has authorized.
The absence of any urgent in
terest in the local elections this
year suggests that the adminis
tration has been too busy and
too preoccupied to grapple with
the truth that legislation is only
the frame, not the actual sub
stance and structure, of great
changes in human society.
