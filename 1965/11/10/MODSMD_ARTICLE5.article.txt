# Stanford-In-Washington Offers Political Practice
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Editor 
What began three years ago as an
interesting idea has grow into the
multi-faceted, ever-expanding Stan
ford- in-Washington Program.
Last summer, for the second year
in a row, Stanford led all colleges in
the number of interns working in the
nation's capitol with 88. Of these, 40
worked on the Mill, while the rest
worked "Downtown" amidst the
bureaucracy.
According to Jay Kittle, chairman
of the program last year, "the pri
mary objective of the program is to
provide Stanford students with an op
portunity to learn how their govern
ment operates by working for it."
This, however, docs not mean that all
applicants must be interested in gov
ernment work or politics as a career.
Summer Tasks
Tasks for the summer laborers
range from writing newsletters for
Congressmen to researching legisla
tion, from filing in the Peace Corps
office to studying the problems of the
Atlantic Community. Some arc lucky
enough to find meaningful work;
others don't. Some are paid well—
"well" in the lexicon of the intern
meaning at least the $750 stipend
each Congressman is allotted to pay
his summer help others receive no
remuneration and take a financial
pounding.
Many interns began their summer
stay by doing menial work such as
letter-writing, sorting mail and run
ning errands, but later in the summer
they found themselves writing press
releases and even speeches, answering
searching minor pieces of legislation.
Often, those who worked without pay
were allowed more freedom to attend
committee hearings, pursue interest
ing topics for study, and hear the
great debates in the House and Senate
chambers,
"At Least Break Even"
"We hope that most of Ihe people
in the program will be able to at
least break even," the newly elected
chairman Stefan Halper said.
Financial assistance alleviates some
of the problem, with $-1700 being ap
propriated for the use of SIW. "The
funds were not adequate to assure all
interns of a subsistence wage." Kittle
reported, "and those who could best
afford it were asked to make Ihe nec
essary financial sacrifices. The fact
that almost all students did make
some financial sacrifice is a testimony
of their willingness to participate in
a challenging program."
Moreover, ,1 few Indent \vei< abl"

to obtain free housing for the sum
mer with Stanford alumni in the
Washington area. One student spent
half the summer with the family of
his ex-high school girl friend and the
oilier half with alumni, and thus
managed to barely break even while
working for free in a Senator's office
and using an SIW stipend of $130 for
expenses.

Seven girls in the program allevi
ated their housing problem by mov
ing en masse into a Georgetown home
vacated for the summer.
However, the office work and its
rewards are not the only considera
tions interns used to assess their
experience in the program. Before
departing, a number of Sunday after
noon seminars were held at Bowman
Alumni House (whose staff still aid
the volunteer student leadership with
paper work and contacts), and a few
senior colloquiums were geared espe
cially to Washington-bound interns.
Once in Washington, the group was
held together to some extent by
alumni-sponsored picnics, a "Stanford
in-Washington Togetherness Sheet"
put out by one of the interns in Sen
ator Thomas Kuchel's office, by spe
cial programs featuring various Con
gressmen and Senators including
breakfasts with California Congress
men from both parties, and by infor
mal parties in Georgetown!.

put out by one of the interns in Sen

gressmen and Senators including
breakfasts with California Congress
men from both parties, and by infor

What began three years ago as an
interesting idea has grow into the
multi-faceted, ever-expanding Stan
ford- in-Washington Program.
Last summer, for the second year
in a row, Stanford led all colleges in
the number of interns working in the
nation's capitol with 88. Of these, 40
worked on the Mill, while the rest
worked "Downtown" amidst the
bureaucracy.
According to Jay Kittle, chairman
of the program last year, "the pri
mary objective of the program is to
provide Stanford students with an op
portunity to learn how their govern
ment operates by working for it."
This, however, docs not mean that all
applicants must be interested in gov
ernment work or politics as a career.
Summer Tasks
Tasks for the summer laborers
range from writing newsletters for
Congressmen to researching legisla
tion, from filing in the Peace Corps
office to studying the problems of the
Atlantic Community. Some arc lucky
enough to find meaningful work;
others don't. Some are paid well—
"well" in the lexicon of the intern
meaning at least the $750 stipend
each Congressman is allotted to pay
his summer help others receive no
remuneration and take a financial
pounding.
Many interns began their summer
stay by doing menial work such as
letter-writing, sorting mail and run
ning errands, but later in the summer
they found themselves writing press
releases and even speeches, answering
searching minor pieces of legislation.
Often, those who worked without pay
were allowed more freedom to attend
committee hearings, pursue interest
ing topics for study, and hear the
great debates in the House and Senate
chambers,
"At Least Break Even"
"We hope that most of Ihe people
in the program will be able to at
least break even," the newly elected
chairman Stefan Halper said.
Financial assistance alleviates some
of the problem, with $-1700 being ap
propriated for the use of SIW. "The
funds were not adequate to assure all
interns of a subsistence wage." Kittle
reported, "and those who could best
afford it were asked to make Ihe nec
essary financial sacrifices. The fact
that almost all students did make
some financial sacrifice is a testimony
of their willingness to participate in
a challenging program."

half the summer with the family of
his ex-high school girl friend and the
oilier half with alumni, and thus
managed to barely break even while
working for free in a Senator's office
and using an SIW stipend of $130 for
expenses.

Seven girls in the program allevi
ated their housing problem by mov

However, the office work and its
rewards are not the only considera

experience in the program. Before
departing, a number of Sunday after
noon seminars were held at Bowman
Alumni House (whose staff still aid
the volunteer student leadership with
paper work and contacts), and a few
senior colloquiums were geared espe
cially to Washington-bound interns.
