# Huck, Holbrook Captivate Crowd
## 
### RISSA WHITE 
Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn
and the backwoods South visited the
Stanford campus last night, and it
was difficult for the capacity crowd
at the Tuesday Evening Series pro
gram to keep in mind that all these
personalities were Hal Holbrook,
American humorist.
Holbrook immediately captured his
audience with a mood which the pre
lude music failed lo create.
He introduced himself "so he could
get in all the facts," and expressed
regret that he was named among the
great authors, since they all had a
sad habit of dying. "Take Chaucer.
And I'm not feeling at all well my
self."
Subtle Approach
Comments such as these were typi
cal of his subtle approach to humor.
His act was based on audience par
ticipation, for his lines, answered by
laughter, form a dialogue which
erupts finally in a gust of appreci
ative applause.
Mark Twain 窶馬o, Holbrook walked
stiffly across the stage between his
lonely podium on one side and his
period chair and table on the other.
He was preceded by a puff of smoke
from the cigar he took great care in
lighting.
His throaty cough and breaking
voice added to the image of an old
story-teller, and his hands thrust into
his pockets (looking for lint?) com
pleted the picture.
Holbrook found his humor in simple
truths, not the sickness of the Ameri
can mind or contemporary problems.
When I Was Fourteen
"When I was 14," he said, "my
father was so stupid I couldn't stand
to have him around. By the time I was
21, I was surprised at how much he'd
learned."
The greatest gusts of laughter for
they were quick gusts hushed quickly
in anticipation of the next line re
warded Holbrook's poetic expressions:
"happy as a martyr when the fire
won't burn . . . knocked the everlast
ing aspiration out of him . . . all his
feet together in a bunch."
Holbrook silenced the audience with
a dramatization from "Huckleberry

Finn." He became Huck when he
scratched out letters on the stage
floor with his foot . . . when he slump
ed in his chair, only lo sit up abruptly
at the call of his matronly aunt . . .
when he naively wondered that his
Negro companion could feel deeply for
his family.
Huck soon transformed back into
Murk Twain, wise philosopher, and
the audience relished the suggestion
that God invented man because He
was disappointed in the monkey.
"Sometimes it's a shame that Noah
and his party didn't miss the boat . . .
remember that man was made at the
end of the week's work . . . and who is
it that keeps saying man is God's most
noble creature?"

ing aspiration out of him . . . all his
feet together in a bunch."
Holbrook silenced the audience with
a dramatization from "Huckleberry

Finn." He became Huck when he
scratched out letters on the stage
floor with his foot . . . when he slump
ed in his chair, only lo sit up abruptly
at the call of his matronly aunt . . .
when he naively wondered that his
Negro companion could feel deeply for
his family.
Huck soon transformed back into
Murk Twain, wise philosopher, and
the audience relished the suggestion
that God invented man because He
was disappointed in the monkey.
"Sometimes it's a shame that Noah
and his party didn't miss the boat . . .
remember that man was made at the
end of the week's work . . . and who is
it that keeps saying man is God's most
noble creature?"
Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn
and the backwoods South visited the
Stanford campus last night, and it
was difficult for the capacity crowd
at the Tuesday Evening Series pro
gram to keep in mind that all these
personalities were Hal Holbrook,
American humorist.
Holbrook immediately captured his
audience with a mood which the pre
lude music failed lo create.
He introduced himself "so he could
get in all the facts," and expressed
regret that he was named among the
great authors, since they all had a
sad habit of dying. "Take Chaucer.
And I'm not feeling at all well my
self."
Subtle Approach
Comments such as these were typi
cal of his subtle approach to humor.
His act was based on audience par
ticipation, for his lines, answered by
laughter, form a dialogue which
erupts finally in a gust of appreci
ative applause.
Mark Twain 窶馬o, Holbrook walked
stiffly across the stage between his
lonely podium on one side and his
period chair and table on the other.
He was preceded by a puff of smoke
from the cigar he took great care in
lighting.
His throaty cough and breaking
voice added to the image of an old
story-teller, and his hands thrust into
his pockets (looking for lint?) com
pleted the picture.
Holbrook found his humor in simple
truths, not the sickness of the Ameri
can mind or contemporary problems.
When I Was Fourteen
"When I was 14," he said, "my
father was so stupid I couldn't stand
to have him around. By the time I was
21, I was surprised at how much he'd
learned."
The greatest gusts of laughter for
they were quick gusts hushed quickly
in anticipation of the next line re
warded Holbrook's poetic expressions:
"happy as a martyr when the fire
won't burn . . . knocked the everlast
ing aspiration out of him . . . all his
feet together in a bunch."
