# Brown Supports Lectures
## 
### 
(Ed. Note: The following mes
sage was received yesterday by
Jeff Chinn and liobert Naylor,
Co-Chairmen of the California
Executive Committee of CON
SCIENCE, from Gov. Edmund
G. Brown.)
I want to express my personal
support of (be bi-partisan, na
tionwide series of "ieeture-ins"
scheduled for November 22 and
of ot her efforts by CON
SCIENCE at Stanford Univers
ity to demonstrate support of
United States policy in Vietnam.
We must vigorously protect
the right of peaceable dissent
by 1 hose whose views differ
from ours. But such demonstra
tions of dissent can convey a
misleading impression to our
servicemen abroad and our
friends around the world that
they are an expression of major
ity opinion.
I am convinced that they rep
resent a minority opinion, and
that Hie great majority of Call
fornians, students and non-stu
dents alike, are in fundamental
agreement with United States
policies.
For these reasons, I believe
CONSCIENCE is rendering all
important service and making
an important contribution to the
cause of peace and freedom.
EDMUND G. BROWN,
Governor
