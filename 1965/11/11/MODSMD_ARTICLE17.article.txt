## CONSCIENCE Clarifies Lecture-In 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Scott and I have read your
editorial "Whither Debate?"
with interest and concern. Al
though we in part agree with
your criticism, we would clarify
two points.
First, regarding speakers for
tin 1 lecture-in, moderates are
more than just "pi'eferred";
i hev are in every case stipulated.
CONSCIENCE explicitly dis
avows all extremist positions.
Second, we understand your
"mixed emotions" concerning
the the format of the lecture-in.
But we would point out that
a national "debate-in" would not
accomplish the purpose of CON
SCIENCE: to express qualified
support for the national govern
ment on Vietnam. The question
then is: Does the expression of

support mean the denial of de
bate? We think not.
In its moderate, eonsensual
approach and policy position,
CONSCIENCE implicitly re
quires debate. For consensual
moderation, as a guiding prin
ciple, can be reached only
through dialogue: thesis, anti
thesis, synthesis — again and
again.
CONSCIENCE has debated
ARFEP on CBS radio; Messrs.
Scott, Hopmann, and I are de
hating the SCPV next week; Mr.
Scott and I are going to Berk
eley next Monday to debate Mr.
Rubin and the VDC.
Continual dialogue is a requis
ite of decision-making in a demo
cracy. But exhaustively conclus
ive answers may still prove
elusive at a time when decision
is essential. The supporters of

CONSCIENCE believe that now
is such a time. They have opted,
therefore, for a one-hour sus
pension of the continuing dia
logue — from 8 to 9 p.m., No
vember 22, the hour of the CON
SCIENCE national lecture-in.

• Doolin Debunked
Editor, The Daily:
Like Mr. Doolin and Mr. Pol
hemus, I am discouraged by the
ignorance and hysteria some
times characteristic of the dis
pute over current American pol
icy in Vietnam. Unlike Mr.
Doolin, I do not believe that the
discussions of that policy have
been, as he asserts, "often un

informed, inaccurate, untrue,
and hysterical presentations
served up as teach-ins lather
than the monologues they really
are." Nor do I believe that one
must have the credentials of a
Research Associate al the Hoo
ver Institution in order to judge
the political wisdom and moral
justness of the war in Vietnam.
Since he was himself a par
ticipant in the Stanford teach-in
last: spring, Mr. Doolin should
know better than to categorize
all teach-ins as "monologues."
in fact, the faculty and students
who organized the Stanford
teach-in went to great lengths
to provide speakers supporting
the administration position; they
included, in addition to Mi*.
Doolin, Gordon Craig (Stanford),
Milorad Drachkovitch (Hoover
Institution), John Mecklin (Time-
Life), and John Horner (Direc
tor, Public Affairs Bureau, State
Department). Although other
programs, like the proposed
CONSCIENCE lecture-in, have
not been so scrupulously well
balanced, such noted adminis
tration supporters as 'A. K.
Brzezinski, A. Berle, .Jr.. R.
Sealopino. and Wm. Bundy have
appeared in the Berkeley, Wash
ington, D.C. and Ottawa teach
ins and debates.
Even during this quarter, Mr.
Doolin has had numerous oppor
tunities to argue his views. (Of
course he may not be able to
find many who support unilat
eral withdrawal; certainly the
majority of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
does not, as Mr. Doolin discov
ered when he spoke with that
group Monday night.) Last
month he spoke to a group in
Soto House. Like all other mem
bers of the Stanford commu
nity, he has frequently been
Urged to add his questions or
comments to the remarks made
at the Noon School and at other
rallies; he was free to enter the
debate all during the week-long
vigil conducted by the SCPV.
Of course informational fo
rums and teach-ins are not the
only activities organized by the
■SCPV and similar groups. Or
derly, legal demonstrations, like
those held October 15 and 16 in
Berkeley, Palo Alto, and else
where, serve primarily to testify
to the growing number of citi
zens whose point of view is rare
ly given unbiased attention in
the news media. The Palo Alto
Times, for example, reported
Sen. Robert Kennedy's defense
of blood donors for the North
Vietnamese only in the last par
agraph of a story on page two.
It did not report a meeting of
300 members of the Palo Alto
Concerned Citizens held across
the street from the Tunes, al
though Editor Bodi was in the
crowd. It did not report a tele
gram of protest sent to Presi
dent Johnson by 147 Stanford
faculty members, although it
did report a telegram of support
sent by J 3.").
The statements (and omis
sions) of those who seek mili
tary victory in Vietnam are not
only often inaccurate, but also
hysterical. Are we to equate the
behavior of the Berkeley demon
strators with that of the Hell's
Angels who attacked them, or
the behavior of the participants
in the SCPV vigil with that of
those who threw them in the
fountain, or Mr. Polhcmus' out
rage with the bigotry of Ihose
who called Mr. Franklin "a dirty
jew bastard"? To burn your
draft card may bp illegal, but
since it does not infringe on
anyone else's rights, it repre
sents a more morally defensible
choice than to throw things at
a professor.
To make rationally the moral

and political decision to burn
one's draft card—or oneself—
floes not depend, as Mr. Doolin
implies, exclusively on extensive
reading. Of course it is impos
sible to make an intelligent de
cision without some knowledge
of the facts and their various
interpretations. By substituting
specialization for political com
petence and moral integrity, Mr.
Doolin further encourages the
"abdication of political will on
the part of the electorate" de
scribed by Morgenthau in the
introduction to The Crossroads
PajH'rs.
Of course Mr. Doolin's knowl
edge of Asian affairs is superior
to that of most of us. We would
be foolish to ignore the informa
tion which he has to offer. But
we would be fools to abdicate
the responsibility of making our
own decisions about the political
wisdom and moral justness of
the war. Indeed, if we accept
Mr. Doolin's criteria as prereq
uisites, we must disqualify John
son. Rusk. Humphrey, MacNa
mara. et al. from making policy
decisions.

• Bay Betrayed
Editor, The Daily:
Having taken the trouble to
prepare and distribute to the
press a full text of my speech
in support of the Medical Aid
Committee, I was disappointed
in the inaccuracy of the refer
ence to my argument in Nov. 3's
Daily. I did not call for complete
withdrawal of U.S. troops. And
the quotation attributed to me,
Time magazine-style, is not in
my manuscript, which I fol
lowed carefully. My quarrel
with the mass media was not
over misreporting of the war;
the better newspapers have of
ten reported very searchingly
and courageously in spite of
government attempts at sup
pression and intimidation. Is it
not clear in the text of my
speech that my complaints were
directed to the misreporting of
responsible dissent in this coun
try?
For the record, may I also
amplify my comment on the na
ture of the rally reported on in
a different news story. I did
mind the behavior of a few very
loud bystanders. What surprised
me was that even Ihese individ
uals actually seemed capable of
starting to listen after a while.
My expressed desire for "proper
publicity" for this rally emphat
ically did not refer to the
amount of coverage there could
be no doubt after Tuesday noon.
I believe the day will come
when Stanford will look back
with pride to the launching on
this campus of a national drive
to aid civilian victims of our
government's policy of gradual
genocide by way of continuing
bombing and napalming of "un
friendly" open cities and vil
lages in Vietnam. I believe our
traditions of humanity in this
country will prevail and conquer
the present ugly mood of hatred
and know-nothing-ism, which has
become visitble on the periphery
become visible on the periphery
nity.
