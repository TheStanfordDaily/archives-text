## If Buckley's Your Enemy, You Don't Need A Friend 
### 
I wandered into the campaign
headquarters of John Lindsay,
a few days after the election,
and found one of his campaign
workers struggling with a prob
lem.
"We're trying to think of a
present to send William Buckley
for all he did to help us during
the campaign."
"You must be kidding?" I
said.
"I certainly am not. Buckley
won it for us. Even Abe Beame
says so."
"How do you figure that?"
BM'ore Buckley
"Well, before Buckley got into
the race we wore in real trouble.
The Democratic registration was
overwhelming, the voters were
lethargic, and we had a heck of
a time raising money. Then
Buckley announced he was run
ning on the Conservative ticket
for Mayor, and he made no
bones about the fact, he was out
to destroy Lindsay's chances of
winning, on Ihe grounds that
there is nobody a conservative
Republican would like to see
lose more than a liberal Repub
lican.
"At first we were nervous,"

lie said, "because we figured we
"needed every Republican vote
we could get. but then Buckley
started campaigning against
Lindsay and people began pay
ing attention. Suddenly many
Democrats who had no intention
of voting for Lindsay .said, 'Any
body who is being attacked by
Bill Buckley can't lie all bad.' "
"Incredible." I said.
"But true," he replied. "The
wilder Buckley got, the less le
thargic the voters became, and
pretty soon many people decid
ed to vote for Lindsay as a pro
test vote against Buckley. In the
meantime Buckley attracted a
lot of conservative Democrats
to his cause, so lie took crucial
votes away from Beame.
"Are you trying to say that
Buckley, in trying to gel Lind
say defeated, defeated Beame in
stead?"
Buy Bill A Present
"Exactly. That's why we want
lo buy Buckley a present. We
have to show our gratitude."
"But if Buckley realized he
was helping Lindsay by attack
ing him, why didn't he attack
Beame instead?
"He realized it too late. He
was so determined to do John

in that he ignored Beame. Had
Buckley attacked Beame earlier
in the campaign the sympathy
might have gone to Beame in
stead of to Lindsay.
"How could a smart guy like
Buckley make such a mistake?"
"My own personal opinion is
that he got to telling jokes and
forgot why he was in the race.
It can happen. I wonder if
Buckley would like a desk set."
"How do you feci the election
will affect the national political
picture?"
"I believe Buckley could save
the Republican party."
"By opposing it?"
"Naturally. Our only hope in
a national election is if the con
servatives go all out to destroy
us. If they do, we may be able
to pick up enough Democratic
votes to win."
"Do you think Mr. Lindsay
has a chance as Presidential
candidate?"
"Only," he said, "if Buckley
would agree to run against him."
"Bedfellows sure make strange
politics," I said.
"Or," he said, "to put it an
other way, if you have Bill Buck
ley for an enemy, you don't need
a friend."
