# Paul Does Not Contradict Jesus, Prof. Ramm Says

Confronted with "static which is
pretty loud and strong that God is
dead," Professor Bernard .Ramm last
night asserted at. Tresiddcr that "If
one has to vote for the gravediggers
or the corpse, I am going to vote for
the corpse," to preface his talk on
"Paul and Jesus: Friend or Foe?"
Answering the charge of some con
temporary theologians that Paul is
the "enemy of Jesus," Prof. Ramm of
the California Baptist Theological
Seminary at Covina developed the
idea that Paul is the "friend of Jesus".
He claimed that their true relation

ship is not "Jesus or Paul" or "Jesus
vs. Paul" but "Jesus and Paul."
Prof. Ramm, speaking in the Faith
and History lecture series, expressed
his belief in "the fundamental har
mony between Paul and Jesus with
admitted elaborations by Paul but in
consistency with the original inten
tions of Jesus." This harmony of faith
is supported by the continuity be
tween Jesus's four gospels and Paul's
epistles.
Harmony Shown
According to Prof. Ramm, the
gospels and the epistles are both
rooted in the conviction of the resur
rection and lordship of Christ, lie
claims "Here then is not divergence;
here then is fundamental harmony."
Prof. Ramm gave three general
reasons for his belief in the basic
compatibility of Paul and Jesus:
First, as a companion of the apostle
Luke, Paul was exposed to as much
detailed knowledge of Christ's life as
were the authors of the gospels. When
Paul wished to prove an essential
theological point "his highest court
of appeal was Christ's words," Prof.
Ramm said.
"I.atecoiller"
Second. Paul as the "latecomer" of
the apostles is considered by Prof.
Ramm to be "foursquare in the Rab
binic, Palestinian-Jewish tradition."
In customary Jewish language de
scribing apostleship, Paul wrote "that
which I have received I have deliver
ed." reaffirming that his teachings
were derived from Christ.
And finally, Prof. Ramm holds that
Paul was theologically oriented and
was therefore intensly concerned with
the Implications of the incarnation,
the crucifixion, and the resurrection.
In stressing these three aspects of
Christ's life and omitting the parables
and miracles, Prof. Ramm said that
Paul "takes out (tie t icam" fit (he
Jesus stoiy.
