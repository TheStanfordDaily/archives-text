### JACK TRINKLEIN 
In what turned out to be an aggres
sive denunciation of U.S. foreign pol
icy in Latin America and Southeast
Asia, Peter Camejo outlined his views

on world neo-coloniaiism at the Noon
School of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The wirey secretary of the Young
Socialist Alliance particularly cen
sured American business interests and
the U.S. government acting in busi
ness' behalf for the under developed
conditions in Asia and South America.
Need Factories
Concentrating on Venezuela, Cam
ejo stated, "Though they have a bil
lion dollar economy, millions live in
poverty. What they need are factories
large factories." American capital
istic interests have supressed this vi
tal need in order to garner their own
profits from raw material export, he
said.
The speaker's volume increased pro
portionately to the length of his
speech. Twice the amplifier had to be
turned down. Never far from sarcasm
such as, "the President's recent fam
ily problems," he kept his audience
smiling.
Only two comments were thrown to
the speaker from the audience. Once,
when he was elaborating on the slums
of Caracus, a Venezuelan contradict
ed, "They have TV sets."
Have Cars Also
"Oh sure. Camejo came back, "and
1 suppose they have cars also, to drive
into their slum areas where there are
not even roads.''
Toward the end another heckler
questioned, "What about Puerto
Rico"? The reply was a sneering,
"Puerto Rico? We'll get to that too."

As to Vietnam Camejo gaev his I
listeners a choice between withdrawal I
and iuiLL, unphjvi-iiu, "11 you Hindi !

we are going to kill millions of them,
you're wrong, they are going to kill
millions of us."

"They fought for their indepeud
ence against . . . the Japanese, then
the French, and now it's Grand-dad
dy's turn," ho said. "They have been
fighting for fifty years and they are
not going to give up now."
Camejo concluded with advice to
his audience. "Check into the facts."
he said, "because it is your life on
