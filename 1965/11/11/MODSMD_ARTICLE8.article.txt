# Religious Issue Heads Agenda
## 
### 
A resolution affirming the right of
free religious expression will be con
sidered tonight in the Legislature as
the measure with time priority, ac
cording to LASSU speaker Jay Ka
datte.
Under the new agenda, time pri
ority business comes before non
controversial and controversial bills
and is given to matters considered
by the Rules Committee as of crucial
importance and pressing nature.
Religion Resolution
The religion resolution, introduced
by Clark Brown for the Executive,
urges that the Trustees "change the
present policy to recognize the right
of freedom of worship for all groups."
because "the existing rules prohibit
ing worship are an unreasonable
abridgment of the right to free reli
gious expression and are, further, in
conflict with the spirit of the present
[cooperative! University religious pro
gram."
"The resolution was drafted by the
Student Body President's Advisors
Committee on Religion, which has
broad support from the denomina
tions. The members have sought to
work with the Chaplain and his asso
ciates and this resolution has their
backing as well as the Committee's,"
Brown reported yesterday.
Controversial Legislation
The Legislature will also consider
three pieces of controversial legisla
tion held over from last week. The
first matter is a bylaw change in the
from Engineering and Humanities
and Sciences, whereby they would be
apportioned by department instead of
by school as is now done. "It is not
now clear what would be the status
of the people recently nominated for
these seats if the measure were to
pass," Kadatie said yesterday. Since
there were fewer nominations than
places for both Engineering and Hu
manities and Sciences, all nominees
would be automatically seated under
existing provisions.
The second piece of controversial
legislation is the amended version of
a resolution presented last week on
the possible violation of the Funda
mental Standard by the solicitation of
blood and money for North Vietnam.

The resolution now states that the
Medical Aid Committee be "enjoined
from disbursing funds and blood"
and that a special Committee of the
Legislature determine the legality of
such actions. ''The Rules Committee
feels this legislative injunction is of
doubtful legality," lsadane stated.
The third resolution is one to limit
the range of loudspeakers.
The meeting will be held in room
370, beginning "promptly" at 7:3<)
p.m., the speaker reported.
