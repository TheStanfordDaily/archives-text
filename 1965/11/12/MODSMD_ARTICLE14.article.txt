IN A COLD HOTEL and THE 101st will have their final perfonn
ances in the Nitery tonight and tomorrow night (see review on this
page).
BLUE AM) CJOLI) FINGER, Ram's Head's 1965 Big Game
Gaieties, is opening on Tuesday in Memorial Auditorium. It will
take off on James Bond and other spy-types, more or less.
Films
Today's Tresidder offering is LAURA, starring Gene Tierney and
Dana Andrews. Directed by Otto Preminger, this detective story
has an interesting twist, namely, guessing which one is really Laura.
BREATHLESS is Saturday's Tresidder film. Bring a cylinder of
oxygen just in case.
THE MIRACLE WORKER will undoubtedly get manifestly un
fair treatment at Ihe Flicks Sunday. It's about Helen Keller's fight
to lead a normal life.
The International Film Discussion Series will present THE
MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT: 19(50 on Wednesday evening. It is
a documentary film adapted from Theodore White's book of the
same name.
An INGMAR BERGMAN FILM FESTIVAL is currently going on
at the Bel Art in Belmont. All his films are being shown, and in
chronological order.
The Bijou has RETURN FROM THE ASHES and MASQUER
ADE. You may definitely forget about the former; and the latter
is a little late, even for the Halloween set.
CASANOVA 70 is at the Fine Arts (see review on this page).
Rod Steiger, as THE PAWNBROKER, and his friends, are still
having enormous psychological problems (not to mention getting
shot up) at the Guild.
The Paris has SHIP OF FOOLS, which is excellent in spite of
script problems, and GENEVIEVE, who is 0.K., if you like her type.
THE KNACK, which was Best Picture at the 1965 Cannes Film
Festival, and which stars Rita Tushingham (what more could any
one ask for?), is at the Park. It's about three people iu search of
security and a home in London; their misadventures are really
very funny.
The Stanford has I>R. GOLDFOOT AND RIS BIKINI MACHINE
and BEACH BALL. They got terrible reviews, but if you like this
kind of clean-cut, sun-tanned, vacuous comedy, the present combina
tion is unbeatable.
THE BEDFORD INCIDENT, a suspense drama set during World
War 11, is at the Varsity, and stars Richard Widmark and Sidney
Poitier. With it is Joan Crawford in I SAW WHAT YOU DID. She
was talking to her director, who had made a terrible movie.
Other
The HELSINKI UNIVERSITY CHORUS will sing tonight in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium as a part of the Music Department's Sub
scription Series. They will perform Sibelius' ".Rakastava" and the
Machaut Mass, a famous but rarely-done prc-Renaissance composi
tion.
