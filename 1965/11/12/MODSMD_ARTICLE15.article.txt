# Nitery Has Mixed Offering
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
| The t wo student - produced
; plays which opened Wednesday
I night at the Nitery managed to
; come off pretty well in the face
j of two disasters. One disaster
I was the theater itself; it is
j cramped, and a great portion of
the already too sparse (and
• thoroughly uncomfortable) seats
gave their occupants limited and
unsatisfactory vision of the
stage.
The second disaster was the
more damaging: the first of the
plays, "In a Cold Hotel," by Ben
Maddow, is some of the worst
theater it has been my misfor
tune to run across. If, to give
it the benefit of the doubt, it
is intended as a joke, a farce,
then it clearly doesn't come off.
If, as seems more likely, it is
intended to be Ironic and Seri
ous and Meaningful, it stinks
out loud.
The play, briefly, concerns a
World War 1 doughboy, played
j by Ralph Liddle, who comes up
to a shabby hotel room to visit
J his father, a traveling, second
rate magician played by Mike
Gillespie. The father has run
around the country leaving a
string of illegitimate children
and broken affairs. Liddle is his
only legitimate child, and makes
an effort to understand the
father who deserted him. Liddle
1 is naive, idealistic; Gillespie is
j hard, cynical.
The Girl
There is also a girl, called,
imaginatively, Girl, and played
j by Gretchen Diebenkorn. She is
the magician's assistant, in love
j with him ("though I don't know
' why," she says, and neither does
the audience) but tempted to
run off somewhere witli the
j handsome young soldier.
The performances are ado
! quate. Liddle seems inexperi
j enced, and tries too hard, but
the naivete is well conveyed,
j Gillespie is less good, funny dur
i ing the comedy bits, but stereo
typical and monotonous through
i out most of the action. Miss

Diebenkorn does well in a ghast
ly. cliche-ridden, overwritten and
unbelievable role; I cannot think
of an actress great enough to
make the part work.
The three actors work hard,
and I am unfairly dismissing
their efforts without detailed
analysis. The play itself, how
ever, is so depressingly bad, so
loaded with hackneyed situa
tions and clumsy dialogue, that
it negates even the successful in
their attempts.
A Gas
The second play, on the other
hand, is a gas. "The 101st," by
Kenneth Cameron, deals with a
slum family trying to make ft
charity's list of the 100 neediest
families in their city, which
award would mean substantial
cash benefits.
Unfortunately, they are only
the 101st neediest family, and
two of their neighbors, who did
make the list, lord it over them,
until the husband (Manny Free
man) discovers the courts won't
prosecute someone as needy as j
he, and gets rich by stealing. |
However, one of the neighbors !
drops off the list and the hus- 1
band, Mr. Stockstill, is elevated |
to the list, then prosecuted, tries
to escape and is shot by a policc- '
man.
Sound like bad melodrama? It
is, rather, delightful absurdist
farce, an extended sick joke, if j
you will, but one which scores
repeatedly, both through the j
ludicrousness of its conception 1
and through some sharp, funny •
dialogue. The first and last
scenes are particularly effective, I
and the first scene, in its broad j
ridicule of every conceivable!
tragedy which might afflict the j
underprivileged, is brilliantly
paced and extremely funny. Di-'
rector Glenn Cannon's pacing is
excellent during the entire play, ;
in fact, and he has imparted a
knack for comic timing to all
the players.
Freeman Effective
Freeman, who has the longest'
and most difficult role, is re• j

markably poised and effective. •
lie underplays and understates
the broad comedy in a highly !
sophisticated manner, and is a
sparkplug from whom the rest
of the cast draws vitality.
Lesley Crosten as Stocks! ill's |
cruel and crusty wife, Karen
Hayes as his daughter, whom ;
his wife turns into a prostitute
to supplement the family in-!
come, and Dennis Johnson as j
his son all give first-rate per-1
formances.
The technical aspects of the j
plays are as good as can be ex-1
pected in the inadequate theater. !
Wendell Cole's scenery, especial-!
ly the "Cold Hotel" set, and
Carol Markley's lighting are j
appropriate.
