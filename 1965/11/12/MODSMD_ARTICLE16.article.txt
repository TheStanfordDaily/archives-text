						Peerless Mastroianni Rescues 'Casanova 70'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
There are some actors who
call take absolutely nothing and
turn it into something fairly
presentable. Then there are ac
tors, but only a very few, like
Marcello Mastroianni, who can,
and usually does, start with less
than nothing and make some
thing splendid out of it. He is
unquestionably one of the great
est living actors, perhaps the
greatest; but he always has to
prove it the hard way.
Consider a case in point. In
"Casanova 70," Mastroianni
plays a French NATO officer
who '-peaks nothing but Italian.
As if that weren't enough, he
also has another problem: he
simply can't get interested in a
woman unless seducing her in
volves some kind of danger,
preferably mortal.
And that's it. There are no
variations on this theme, or
even any catchy subplots. Mar
cello just repeats himself, like
a broken record, in a succession
of bedrooms with a succession
of leggy and eager women, here
in a palace as a guided tour
goes by, there with the general's
wife, and so on.
Too Much Sex?
Now whether producer Carlo
Ponti realizes it or not. it is
possible to have too much of
even a good thing like sex. A
bunch of broad-beddings strung
together on a spider web of a
plot just will not make a decent
movie, no matter how it's done.
Unless, of course, Marcello Mas
troianni happens to be doing the
bedding.
For he plucks this complete
disaster out of the cinematic
scrap heap and shapes it; into a
vehicle for his own incompara
ble virtuosity. Like a great pia
nist making some twangy up
right sound as if it were a

concert grand, ho creates a
wealth of high comedy and deli
cate pathos where before there
was only burlesque and bathos.
Faces
Somehow he has learned, not
a few, but all the faces of man,
and not. only in broad outline,
but down to the smallest detail;
and to express them, he has
what must be the subtlest face
in the world. Anybody who can
epitomize the dandy in three sec
onds flat with a mirror, a nail
file, and that certain smile, (to
cite only a minor example), has
annihilated the competition be
fore the contest has even begun.
Maybe Mastroianni seems so
good because his fellow actors
are so mediocre; maybe he is
great precisely because he has
to prove it the hard way. Maybe
he would be a failure in a movie
with a first-rate scenario. Per
haps; but then maybe lie would
be dazzlingly brilliant, a god
among mortals.
And it's high time ho were
given a chance to prove it. Un
til he does, however, "Casanova
70" will do just fine.
