# Poloists Face Long Beach And San Jose State This Weekend
## Daily Sports 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Riding on the crest of last
i week's impressive 12-9 victory
j over USC, Stanford's varsity
' water poloists meet two stiff
competitors this weekend.
Long Beach State, always one
I of the nation's top teams, comes
! to the Encina Pool this after
noon at 3:30. Tomorrow morn
ing, the tribe takes on San Jose
State at 11:00, also here.
In a game earlier this season,
' Long Beach edged Southern Cal,
j 8-7. Judging from comparative
1 scores, the Indians will have a
i rough time of it when the <19'ors
; come to Palo Alto.
Two years ago, Stanford beat
| the 49'ers, 9-8 in double over
time, to decide the national

championship. Last year, Stan
ford foil, 7-3, at Long Beach's
pool.
San Jose Stubborn
San Jose, using a deep bench,
several outstanding JC trans
fer's, and a number of returning
lettermen, has fielded one of its
strongest teams in years.
Stanford subdued the Spar
tans, 5-4, in the San Jose pool
three weeks ago. The Indians
held a 5-1 lead in the fourth
quarter, hut San Jose scored
three in the closing minutes of
the quarter. It was that game
in which Gary Sheerer , the
tribe's leading scorer at that
time, had his hand broken as he
attempted a shot.
Stanford will be eager to set
tle the San Jose account more
decisively tomorrow morning.
Card Offense Potent
The Indian offense jelled solid
for the first time last weekend
against the Trojans. Passes
clicked, patterns functioned, the
fast break was effective, and

shots were good. The 8-2 shel
lacking of the Trojans in the
first half serves as evidence of
the tribe's revitalized scoring
threat.
One of the reasons for the In
dians' effective scoring attack
is that the offense does not key
on any one particular player.
The opponent's defense is forced
to keep close watch on everyone
in the field, since no one player
will dominate all the shooting.
The development of iho potent
offensive unit can be seen from
the results of last week's game.
Five different Stanford players
scored two or more goals each,
hitting the Trojan goalie from
every angle of the field.
Frosli, 9-2, Meet SJS
Stanford's freshman squad,
9-2 after last weekend's loss to
CSM, meets the San Jose fresh
man squad at 10:00 Saturday,
here. Earlier this season, the
Papoose's squashed the Sparta
babes, 13-3.
Next Tuesday evening, the

frosh travel to Treasure Island
to participate in the Northern !
California Closed Tournament. |
The Papooses must win two i
games to reach the finals, where,
in all likelihood, they will bump
noses with the College of San 1
Mateo once again.
The varsity is idle through ;
next week. The morning of Big |
Game, Cal and Stanford will !
si age a watery version of the !
classic struggle at 11:00 in the
Encina Pool.

i week's impressive 12-9 victory
j over USC, Stanford's varsity
' water poloists meet two stiff
competitors this weekend.
Long Beach State, always one
I of the nation's top teams, comes
! to the Encina Pool this after
noon at 3:30. Tomorrow morn
ing, the tribe takes on San Jose
State at 11:00, also here.
In a game earlier this season,
' Long Beach edged Southern Cal,
j 8-7. Judging from comparative
1 scores, the Indians will have a
i rough time of it when the <19'ors
; come to Palo Alto.
Two years ago, Stanford beat
| the 49'ers, 9-8 in double over
time, to decide the national

championship. Last year, Stan
ford foil, 7-3, at Long Beach's
pool.
San Jose Stubborn
San Jose, using a deep bench,
several outstanding JC trans
fer's, and a number of returning
lettermen, has fielded one of its
strongest teams in years.
Stanford subdued the Spar
tans, 5-4, in the San Jose pool
three weeks ago. The Indians
held a 5-1 lead in the fourth
quarter, hut San Jose scored
three in the closing minutes of
the quarter. It was that game
in which Gary Sheerer , the
tribe's leading scorer at that
time, had his hand broken as he
attempted a shot.
Stanford will be eager to set
tle the San Jose account more
decisively tomorrow morning.
Card Offense Potent
The Indian offense jelled solid
for the first time last weekend
against the Trojans. Passes
clicked, patterns functioned, the
fast break was effective, and

shots were good. The 8-2 shel
lacking of the Trojans in the
first half serves as evidence of
the tribe's revitalized scoring
threat.
One of the reasons for the In
dians' effective scoring attack
is that the offense does not key
on any one particular player.
The opponent's defense is forced
to keep close watch on everyone
in the field, since no one player
will dominate all the shooting.
The development of iho potent
offensive unit can be seen from
the results of last week's game.
Five different Stanford players
scored two or more goals each,
hitting the Trojan goalie from
every angle of the field.
Frosli, 9-2, Meet SJS
Stanford's freshman squad,
9-2 after last weekend's loss to
CSM, meets the San Jose fresh
man squad at 10:00 Saturday,
here. Earlier this season, the
Papoose's squashed the Sparta
babes, 13-3.
Next Tuesday evening, the

frosh travel to Treasure Island
to participate in the Northern !
California Closed Tournament. |
The Papooses must win two i
games to reach the finals, where,
in all likelihood, they will bump
noses with the College of San 1
Mateo once again.
The varsity is idle through ;
next week. The morning of Big |
Game, Cal and Stanford will !
si age a watery version of the !
classic struggle at 11:00 in the
Encina Pool.

Long Beach State, always one
I of the nation's top teams, comes
! to the Encina Pool this after
noon at 3:30. Tomorrow morn
ing, the tribe takes on San Jose
State at 11:00, also here.
In a game earlier this season,
' Long Beach edged Southern Cal,
j 8-7. Judging from comparative
1 scores, the Indians will have a
i rough time of it when the <19'ors
; come to Palo Alto.
Two years ago, Stanford beat
| the 49'ers, 9-8 in double over
time, to decide the national

championship. Last year, Stan
ford foil, 7-3, at Long Beach's
pool.
San Jose Stubborn
San Jose, using a deep bench,
several outstanding JC trans
fer's, and a number of returning
lettermen, has fielded one of its
strongest teams in years.
Stanford subdued the Spar
tans, 5-4, in the San Jose pool
three weeks ago. The Indians
held a 5-1 lead in the fourth
quarter, hut San Jose scored
three in the closing minutes of
the quarter. It was that game
in which Gary Sheerer , the
tribe's leading scorer at that
time, had his hand broken as he
attempted a shot.
Stanford will be eager to set
tle the San Jose account more
decisively tomorrow morning.
Card Offense Potent
The Indian offense jelled solid
for the first time last weekend
against the Trojans. Passes
clicked, patterns functioned, the
fast break was effective, and

shots were good. The 8-2 shel
lacking of the Trojans in the
first half serves as evidence of
the tribe's revitalized scoring
threat.
One of the reasons for the In
dians' effective scoring attack
is that the offense does not key
on any one particular player.
The opponent's defense is forced
to keep close watch on everyone
in the field, since no one player
will dominate all the shooting.
The development of iho potent
offensive unit can be seen from
the results of last week's game.
Five different Stanford players
scored two or more goals each,
hitting the Trojan goalie from
every angle of the field.
Frosli, 9-2, Meet SJS
Stanford's freshman squad,
9-2 after last weekend's loss to
CSM, meets the San Jose fresh
man squad at 10:00 Saturday,
here. Earlier this season, the
Papoose's squashed the Sparta
babes, 13-3.
Next Tuesday evening, the

frosh travel to Treasure Island
to participate in the Northern !
California Closed Tournament. |
The Papooses must win two i
games to reach the finals, where,
in all likelihood, they will bump
noses with the College of San 1
Mateo once again.
The varsity is idle through ;
next week. The morning of Big |
Game, Cal and Stanford will !
si age a watery version of the !
classic struggle at 11:00 in the
Encina Pool.
