# Stanford Attempts Spoiler Role
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford will boar t ho Farm's
well-known, smooth-worn spoil
er's yoke onto ihe field tomor
row against UCLA's barreling
Bruins. UCLA, now 5-1-1, and
rated number 6, is in ihe middle
of its first successful football
years since the 1950'5, and will
be fighting to maintain tho sta
tus quo, as of 1965.
Thp Indians learned how to

upset a Tommy Prothro football
team last year, as the tribe post -
ed a 16-7 victory over Bowl
bound Oregon State. With this
viud experience under their
belts, ihe Cards are keyed to
stage a repeat performance.
UCLA went into each of its
first four season games as a
complete underdog. The Uclans
lost their opener to Michigan
State, currently on top of the
nation. After the initial setback,
the Bruins became overbearing.
Three Upsets
The Uclans upset Penn State,
24-22, then proceeded to knock
off favored Syracuse lo the luno
of 24-14.-Next in line was Mis
souri, rated a 2 TD victor. The
Bruins clawed their way to a
14-0 lead only to watch Missouri
score the tying two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter.
On the strength of their early
season successes, the Bruins
have ceased to incur the under
dog stigma. They have taken
Cal easily in stride (56-3), jolted
the Air Force, 10-0, and came
from behind to kick ihe Huskies,
28-24.
The Bruins keep climbing
higher, and higher. And what
goes up must eventually come
down.
Bebun Key to Success
The surprising performances
of sophomore quarterback Gary
Beban must be counted as one
of the prime factors contribut
ing to the Uclans' successes on
the gridiron. Beban now is the
league total offense leader with
907 yards passing and 352 on
the ground.
Dave Lewis is second with
1123 yards total offense.
Beban has scored seven touch
downs and passed for six more.
In completing 51 of 97 aerials,
Beban has thrown only two in
terceptions.
The sophomore flash showed
his true colors in last week's
game with Washington. Three
times the Bruins were down by
two touchdowns, but they ral
lied to pull out a 28-24 victory.
Beban scored on runs of 1 yard
and 60 yards, and threw bombs
of 58 and 60 yards to account
for the other two TD's.
Strong Backfield
Beban is not the only success
ful name in the Bruin backfield.

Left halfback Mel Fair has net
led 561 yards in 76 carries to
past a 7.40 average. Paul Hor
gan, a workhouse fullback, has
carried 76 limes for a 3.88 av
erage.
Dick Witcher, a right half
back, currently has an average
of 30.3 yards per pass reception
and three touchdown catches. It
was Witcher who was on the
sticky end of Bcban's long arch
ers in the Washington tilt.
Kurt Altenberg and Byron
Nelson, right and left Uclan
ends, have caught 456 yards
worth of passes between them,
adn have bucketed three touch
down passes.
Stiles lias Sticky Fingers
Bob Sliles, a newcomer to
UCLA, is the biggest threat on
the Bruin defense. Playing at
defensive light halfback, Stiles
has bagged five passes aimed
for someone else, and has run

back a total of S3 yards on in
terceptions.
Stiles also handles Ihe kickoff
return chores for the Bruins,
averaging 18 yards a shot.
UCLA currently carries a punt
return average of 5.4 yards. At
least it doesn't appear the tribe
will get stung on runbaeks as
badly as it was at Washington.
The Bruins top the league in
total offense with 318 yards per
game. Stanford ranks third, 25
yards behind the Uclans. On the
defensive side, however, the In
dians are on top with 211 yards
per game. UCLA resides in fifth
place wtih a 278 yard average.
Bruius Weak in 4th Quarter
One significant statistic is
UCLA's quarter by quarter scor
ing. While the Bruins have out
scored their opponents 159-90
(largely on account of the 56-3
Cal massacre), they have been

hurt 13-24 in the fourth quarters
so far this year.
Perhaps the Indians can take
advantage of this late-game
weakness, as has happened peri
odically through the year. With
a few early-game weaknesses in
flicted. the Indians could once
again mash the UCLA Vin Rose
brew.

Stanford will boar t ho Farm's
well-known, smooth-worn spoil
er's yoke onto ihe field tomor
row against UCLA's barreling
Bruins. UCLA, now 5-1-1, and
rated number 6, is in ihe middle
of its first successful football
years since the 1950'5, and will
be fighting to maintain tho sta
tus quo, as of 1965.
Thp Indians learned how to

upset a Tommy Prothro football
team last year, as the tribe post -
ed a 16-7 victory over Bowl
bound Oregon State. With this
viud experience under their
belts, ihe Cards are keyed to
stage a repeat performance.
UCLA went into each of its
first four season games as a
complete underdog. The Uclans
lost their opener to Michigan
State, currently on top of the
nation. After the initial setback,
the Bruins became overbearing.
Three Upsets
The Uclans upset Penn State,
24-22, then proceeded to knock
off favored Syracuse lo the luno
of 24-14.-Next in line was Mis
souri, rated a 2 TD victor. The
Bruins clawed their way to a
14-0 lead only to watch Missouri
score the tying two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter.
On the strength of their early
season successes, the Bruins
have ceased to incur the under
dog stigma. They have taken
Cal easily in stride (56-3), jolted
the Air Force, 10-0, and came
from behind to kick ihe Huskies,
28-24.
The Bruins keep climbing
higher, and higher. And what
goes up must eventually come
down.
Bebun Key to Success
The surprising performances
of sophomore quarterback Gary
Beban must be counted as one
of the prime factors contribut
ing to the Uclans' successes on
the gridiron. Beban now is the
league total offense leader with
907 yards passing and 352 on
the ground.
Dave Lewis is second with
1123 yards total offense.
Beban has scored seven touch
downs and passed for six more.
In completing 51 of 97 aerials,
Beban has thrown only two in
terceptions.
The sophomore flash showed
his true colors in last week's
game with Washington. Three
times the Bruins were down by
two touchdowns, but they ral
lied to pull out a 28-24 victory.
Beban scored on runs of 1 yard
and 60 yards, and threw bombs
of 58 and 60 yards to account
for the other two TD's.
Strong Backfield
Beban is not the only success
ful name in the Bruin backfield.

Left halfback Mel Fair has net
led 561 yards in 76 carries to
past a 7.40 average. Paul Hor
gan, a workhouse fullback, has
carried 76 limes for a 3.88 av
erage.
Dick Witcher, a right half
back, currently has an average
of 30.3 yards per pass reception
and three touchdown catches. It
was Witcher who was on the
sticky end of Bcban's long arch
ers in the Washington tilt.
Kurt Altenberg and Byron
Nelson, right and left Uclan
ends, have caught 456 yards
worth of passes between them,
adn have bucketed three touch
down passes.
Stiles lias Sticky Fingers
Bob Sliles, a newcomer to
UCLA, is the biggest threat on
the Bruin defense. Playing at
defensive light halfback, Stiles
has bagged five passes aimed
for someone else, and has run

back a total of S3 yards on in
terceptions.
Stiles also handles Ihe kickoff
return chores for the Bruins,
averaging 18 yards a shot.
UCLA currently carries a punt
return average of 5.4 yards. At
least it doesn't appear the tribe
will get stung on runbaeks as
badly as it was at Washington.
The Bruins top the league in
total offense with 318 yards per
game. Stanford ranks third, 25
yards behind the Uclans. On the
defensive side, however, the In
dians are on top with 211 yards
per game. UCLA resides in fifth
place wtih a 278 yard average.

back a total of S3 yards on in
terceptions.
Stiles also handles Ihe kickoff
return chores for the Bruins,
averaging 18 yards a shot.
UCLA currently carries a punt
return average of 5.4 yards. At
least it doesn't appear the tribe
will get stung on runbaeks as
badly as it was at Washington.
The Bruins top the league in
total offense with 318 yards per
game. Stanford ranks third, 25
yards behind the Uclans. On the
defensive side, however, the In
dians are on top with 211 yards
per game. UCLA resides in fifth
place wtih a 278 yard average.
Bruius Weak in 4th Quarter
One significant statistic is
UCLA's quarter by quarter scor
ing. While the Bruins have out
scored their opponents 159-90
(largely on account of the 56-3
Cal massacre), they have been

hurt 13-24 in the fourth quarters
so far this year.
Perhaps the Indians can take
advantage of this late-game
weakness, as has happened peri
odically through the year. With
a few early-game weaknesses in
flicted. the Indians could once
again mash the UCLA Vin Rose
brew.


I'IIIL SCHNEIDER, a fi-0 ISr»

holds down a starling; position
as defensive end.


GARY BEBAN, six foot. IXI

is from nearby Redwood City,
lie leads the AAWU in total
offense.


BI.AINi: NYK, 6-4 and 235
pounds, alternates at the oflen
siv<- flu! positions with John
Mason and Fergus Flanagan.
Stanford will boar t ho Farm's
well-known, smooth-worn spoil
er's yoke onto ihe field tomor
row against UCLA's barreling
Bruins. UCLA, now 5-1-1, and
rated number 6, is in ihe middle
of its first successful football
years since the 1950'5, and will
be fighting to maintain tho sta
tus quo, as of 1965.
Thp Indians learned how to

upset a Tommy Prothro football
team last year, as the tribe post -
ed a 16-7 victory over Bowl
bound Oregon State. With this
viud experience under their
belts, ihe Cards are keyed to
stage a repeat performance.
UCLA went into each of its
first four season games as a
complete underdog. The Uclans
lost their opener to Michigan
State, currently on top of the
nation. After the initial setback,
the Bruins became overbearing.
Three Upsets
The Uclans upset Penn State,
24-22, then proceeded to knock
off favored Syracuse lo the luno
of 24-14.-Next in line was Mis
souri, rated a 2 TD victor. The
Bruins clawed their way to a
14-0 lead only to watch Missouri
score the tying two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter.
On the strength of their early
season successes, the Bruins
have ceased to incur the under
dog stigma. They have taken
Cal easily in stride (56-3), jolted
the Air Force, 10-0, and came
from behind to kick ihe Huskies,
28-24.
The Bruins keep climbing
higher, and higher. And what
goes up must eventually come
down.
Bebun Key to Success
The surprising performances
of sophomore quarterback Gary
Beban must be counted as one
of the prime factors contribut
ing to the Uclans' successes on
the gridiron. Beban now is the
league total offense leader with
907 yards passing and 352 on
the ground.
Dave Lewis is second with
1123 yards total offense.
Beban has scored seven touch
downs and passed for six more.
In completing 51 of 97 aerials,
Beban has thrown only two in
terceptions.
The sophomore flash showed
his true colors in last week's
game with Washington. Three
times the Bruins were down by
two touchdowns, but they ral
lied to pull out a 28-24 victory.
Beban scored on runs of 1 yard
and 60 yards, and threw bombs
of 58 and 60 yards to account
for the other two TD's.
Strong Backfield
Beban is not the only success
ful name in the Bruin backfield.

Left halfback Mel Fair has net
led 561 yards in 76 carries to
past a 7.40 average. Paul Hor
gan, a workhouse fullback, has
carried 76 limes for a 3.88 av
erage.
Dick Witcher, a right half
back, currently has an average
of 30.3 yards per pass reception
and three touchdown catches. It
was Witcher who was on the
sticky end of Bcban's long arch
ers in the Washington tilt.
Kurt Altenberg and Byron
Nelson, right and left Uclan
ends, have caught 456 yards
worth of passes between them,
adn have bucketed three touch
down passes.
Stiles lias Sticky Fingers
Bob Sliles, a newcomer to
UCLA, is the biggest threat on
the Bruin defense. Playing at
defensive light halfback, Stiles
has bagged five passes aimed
for someone else, and has run

back a total of S3 yards on in
terceptions.
Stiles also handles Ihe kickoff
return chores for the Bruins,
averaging 18 yards a shot.
