# A 						Crock Of Shibboleth

### 
The "Freedom of Worship ' resolution, passed
overwhelmingly by tlw Legislature last night,
should easily preclude any further contention
that the continuing attempt to transform the
present "non-sectarian" religions policy into a
"pan-sectarian" policy is nothing more than the
work of a "noisy minority.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Uni
versity, by clinging to the traditional interpre
tation of the Founding Grant's injunction that
"the University must forever be maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis, ' is rapidly turning into a case study in
schizophrenia, at least in the field of religion.
The prohibition of any religious service on
campus, save for the "non-denominational
offerings at Memorial Church, is not in keeping
with the spirit of the newly developed religious
program of the University.
The term "non-denominational", as it is used
to describe the Protestant-oriented services in
Memorial Church, is itself a shibboleth. More
over, it conflicts markedly with the ecumenical
nature of recent developments in the Depart
ment of Religious Studies — w here the stalf has
been "pan-sectarianized" — and the Chaplain's
office — where the denominational campus min
isters have been added as chaplain's associates.
Finally, it should be noted that sectarian wor

ship services have been tacitly accepted by the
University for years, Lutheran vespers being the
most prominent example.
If the Founding Grant is to be changed in this
instance so that, in the words of the Legislature
resolution, "it can now be viewed as enabling
rather than restrictive," more than words must
be used by those students and faculty members
interested in reform.
Currently, the proposal that students be
added to the vital Presidential Advisory Com
mittee on Religious Affairs is in limbo, pending
a decision by President Sterling. It is to be hoped
that even if this petition is turned down by the
President, the "pan-sectarian" student ad hoc
committee created by ASSU President Sandy
Mackenzie will be able to serve in some consult
ative or advisory capacity to the Religious Af
fairs Committee.
We do not think that Mrs. Stanford meant
the religious section of the Founding Grant to
be interpreted in such a manner as to prevent
students from worshipping on campus. But as
tht' student body has diversified over the years,
this has increasingly become the case. Extend
ing the freedom of worship to all denominations
seems a rather basic requirement for a Uni
versity which wislics to surpass the "edge of
greatness."
