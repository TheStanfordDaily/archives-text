## 'We Wish To Stay In Union' 
### 
We wish to stay in Union Resi
dence until June for tin? follow
ing reasons:
• The sophomores, a vital ele
ment in any living group will not
be allowed to live in the high
rise;
• Tiie small lobby and the lack
of common dining facilities
within or near the residence can
not replace the informal Union
dining area and adjacent lobby;
• Apartmenl living in itself
enlarges the gulf between small
circles of friends and even be
tween one pair of roommates
and another;
• The distance from campus
makes transportation to campus
from residence a difficulty. The
purchase of a bicycle won't help
much on rainy winter nights and
for those who can afford cars,
no parking facilities will be pro
vided except those outside the
high-rise, for they are "on
campus" students;
• Rent in a dormitory is SI 10
per quarter, while the high-rise
costs $180 per quarter per per
son ;
• Savings on board bills by
cooking for oneself does not

make up the $40 difference per
quarter if one takes into consid
eration the time factor involved
in shopping, food preparation,
etc., and the added expenses of
dishes, flatware, pots and pans,
etc;
<» The maid service available
in the dormitory is not provided
in the high-rise;
• The linen service available
in the dormitory is not provided
in the high-rise;
• The telephone service avail
able in the dormitory is not pro
vided in the high-rise;
• It is presently not known
whether a fairly liberal open
house (''residence guest") policy
will be instituted which would
provide a chance for the survival
of the Union tradition of enter
taining faculty and friends at
meal times.
It was planned to ready Union
for remodeling in January and
to begin construction on May 20.
The first date, however, has
been moved to February or
March.
Why not keep Union open
until the end of this academic
year, allowing the girls who will

continue at Stanford in 1966-67
to draw in larger blocs into other
dormitories or move to the high
rise as a body?
We realize that the high-rise
must be filled in order to meet
costs. We also realize that Stan
ford is admitting about 40 wo
men transfer students this win
ter quarter and that they must
have housing. With Union left
open, opening the high-rise to
123 girls from other residences
would leave empty bods in those
residences, approximately 83 of
which would not be filled by the
transfer students. However, by
filling the high-rise with a mix
ture of S3 graduate women and
40 undergraduates (the latter
chosen on the basis of a draw)*,
the problem would be dispensed
with. For that matter, why not
allow 50 to 60 undergraduate
women to live in the high-rise,
thus alleviating some of the
crowding in women's dormitor
ies such as Lagunita and on the
Row?

Allowing the transfer students
to fill the 40 emptied spaces in
the dormitories.
