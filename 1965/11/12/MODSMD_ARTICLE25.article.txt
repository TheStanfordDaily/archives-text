## Dear Auto Registrars, Would You Be So Kind 
### 
Editor, The l)ail,\:
Your article on the first page
of Tuesday's Daily states that,
according to Stanford Police
Chief Gordon Davis, automobile
registration fees al "schools like
Illinois and Wisconsin" are as
high as $00 to $110 per year.
Perhaps this is indeed the case
at schools LIKE Illinois and
Wisconsin, but it certainly is not
the case at Illinois. Undergradu
ate students register their ve
hicles for $7.50 per semester, or
$15 yearly, in return for the
privilege of parking in any of
the numerous lots reserved for
undergraduates, or at any me
tered city street. These metered
streets are less than two min
utes from any classrooms. Grad
uate students, on the other
hand, have an option of not pay
ing at all and receiving free
registration and the privilege of
parking in the same places as
undergraduates, or paying the
same $7.50 and receiving virtu
ally unlimited parking pri\ i
leges. The people who do pay
about $30 per semester are the
faculty and staff people who
wish to have their own individ
ual parking place, which no one
else is permitted to use.
It is certainly not unreason
able to pay $.10 per year for
registration of vehicles, it the
law is enforced to protect those
wiio pay the fee, and if roads
are kept in good repair, and if
parking facilities are not far re
moved from campus. If Police
Chief Davis had ever been to
Illinois, he would certainly be
able to observe that those who
take buses to class are not
forced to do so for want of
nearby parking places, but be
cause they do not have vehicles.
One last comment. Motor
scooters and cycles at "schools
like" Illinois and Wisconsin cost
half the price of registering a
car, while at Stanford, whether
you register a car or a motor
scooter, you still are liable for
the whole ten dollars. At
"schools like" Illinois and Wis
consin, motor scooters and cycles
have their own parking places,
right next to the bicycle lots.
Stanford's similar facilities are
scarce and, as any who drive
cycles and scooters know, less
than adequate.
If a university is going to
charge a fee for registration of
vehicles and compare it with
other schools, comparison cer
tainly ought to be made care
fully, both regarding the price
of the fee and the facilities
offered.

• Parking Space
Editor, The Daily:
The existing campus parking
regulations are enough to turn
one towards anarchy. As if the
situation were not ludicrous
enough already, the University
seems to be striving to make it

more so. An already existing
source of consternation is the
parking lot on the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, which
is labeled "Reserved Parking"
and which I have yet to see
filled. It is infuriating to off
campus, class-bound students
who are searching for parking
space to pass a lot in which
there are often approximately
thirty vacant places.
Admittedly, the spaces go to
better use on Mondays, Wednes
days, and Fridays when more
people come to campus, but if it
is only out of token respect for
certain university officials that
these empty places continue to
be reserved then I suggest that
it is a token which could and
should be abandoned. At least
the sign could be changed to read
"Reserved on Mondays, Wednes
days, and Fridays," or else a lim
ited number of spaces within the
lot could lie painted yellow and
designated as off-bounds to stu
dents.
My new gripe arises from the
fact that the flirt areas on both
sides of Lomita Drive (leading
up to Lake Lag) are now to be
relegated to the verboten. Many
cars have been able to park in
this area, without in any way
impeding either pedestrian or
other traffic. The only motive
I can imagine for eliminating
this from the all-too-scarce avail
able parking space (in order to
install curbing) would be an
aesthetic one. If this is the case,
I would strongly recommend
that Sullivan's twentieth-century
aesthetic dictum be heeded: i.e.
"Form follows Function"!

• LASSU Petitions
Editor, The Daily:
Legislature seats remain va
cant in Education, Engineering,
Humanities and Sciences, and
Medicine. This may in part be
due to lack of Daily coverage of
the elections. Announcement of
the elections was made only
once, and no reminder of when
petitions were due was ever
printed. There remains a way
for these seats to be filled. An
interested candidate may pick
up a petition from the ASSU
office. After getting signatures
from fifteen constituents the pe
tition should be returned to ihe
office. Announcement of the fil
ing of the petition will then be
made in the Daily (hopefully).
If after ten days the number of
candidates does not exceed the
number of vacancies, all candi
dates will be seated. Otherwise
an election will be held.
