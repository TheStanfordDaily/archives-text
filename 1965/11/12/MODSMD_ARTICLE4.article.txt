# Sectarian Services--As Old As Jane
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
Sixth in a Series
Unpublicized sectarian worship services have
been held on campus on a regular basis for
the last ten years, The Daily has learned.
In addition to these student-led but adininis
t rat ion-approved services, many precedents
dating hack to the times of the Founders
exist for holding public, formal sectarian wor
ship on campus, even though official University
policy prohibits all services but the non
denominational ones in Memorial Church.
The denominational services include the
Lutheran vespers, held for three years in Me
morial Church and for the last seven years in
the Women's Clubhouse.
The vespers and the other denominational
services are technically prohibited by a Trustee
policy statement of spring, 1963 on voluntary
organizations, which allowed denominational
groups to meet for any lawful purpose but
worship. They have been allowed because of
their informality, being student-led, "a spon
taneous expression of fellowship," a spokesman
told The Daily this week.
Legit imate Devot ion
The prohibition was directed against regular
worship services an official act of a denom
ination. "The intention was to leave leeway for
legitimate student devotion," Chaplain R. M.
Minto told The Daily this week. "It is obviously
impossible t<> prohibit students from praying.

but it was understood that the student-led
prayers would come at the begining or end of
a meeting held for purposes not primarily of
worship.
"Formal religious exercises (led by a minis
ter | raise another question," the chaplain said.
Many public, minister-led worship services
have been held on campus, however, mostly in
Memorial Church and mostly as liturgy demon
strations.
The first series of this type was held in the
early thirties and included Jewish and Greek
Orthodox services, among others.
I.it urgy Demonstration
A four-week liturgy program was held last
fall to "show the campus what is happening
in the current liturgical renewal," according to
the chaplain. It consisted of a sermon Sunday in
Memorial Church, a mid-week lecture in Tres
sider, and a Thursday afternoon service in the
Church. The Protestant service was Episco
palian, followed in successive weeks by Roman
Catholic, Russian Orthodox and Church of
South India services.
Attendance ranged from 30-75 with the ex
ception of the Roman Catholic mass, which
attracted 600. "We think of that mass not so
much as a liturgy demonstration but as a
demonstration of a need and desire in the
Stanford Catholic community for regular wor
ship on campus," Father John Duryea, Catholic
chaplain to Stanford said this week.
There is also evidence to show that around
the time Memorial Church was built there were

regular sectarian services held in a chapel lo
cated at the site of the present Deans' office.
Hugh Moran, 1905 graduate, recalled this week
that "voluntary religious services" were held in
that building and in some classrooms, "during
Mrs. Stanford's life." Records in the Stanford
archives support his report.
Sectarian Services
"The fact that earlier administrations have
permitted sectarian services is at least evidence
that they did not consider such services in con
flict with the prohibitions of the Founding
Grant," Cassius L. Kirk, University Staff Coun
sel for Business Affairs, had said.
These precedents and the establishment of a
cooperative religious association between the
chaplain and the denominational ministers may
help to answer this "other question" raised by
formal religious exercises. "Worship is now
viewed not as a concession to outsiders, but as
part of the natural expression of a cooperative
religious enterprise," the chaplain said.
The chaplain traced the "trend to a coopera
tive ministry to the entire campus." At. one
time, there were no denominational ministers,
Minto related, and the chaplain had charge of
all the ministering to the community.
The arrival of the other ministers raised prob
lems of jurisdiction and of the ministers' rights
under the Charter, which prohibits "all denom
inational alliances, however slight the bolid
may be."
The 1963 policy statement by the Board of
Trustees permitted use of University facilities

hy denominational groups for closed meetings
(members and guests) subject to scheduling
and open meetings subject to approval by the
Committee on Religious Affairs. Last year, the
terminology was reinterpreted so that "closed''
now means for members of the University
community and "open" applies to meetings
where the general public is invited.
Tart of Community
The slow process of allowing the involvement
of the denominational groups and their minis
ters in on-eampus religious activities a process
that included the policy statement of 1963
culminated this fall in the naming of the full
time denominational ministers as chaplain's
associates.
The creation of the chaplain's staff made up
of the chaplain and the campus ministers
"seems to be within the intent of the Founding
Grant which wanted to encourage cooperation,
and therefore the establishment of the staff
would not be in conflict with the Grant's non
sectarian provisions." the chaplain said. (The
Founding Grant states that "the University
must forever be maintained upon a strictly
non-partisan and non-sectarian basis." >
"We have fostered freedom of worship a long
way," the chaplain concluded. "The new atmo
sphere of understanding and cooperation by
both ministers and students means that varied
opportunities are no longer divisive. Granting
of the right of freedom of worship would be
not a recognition of the various sects but a
recognition of the existing situation."
