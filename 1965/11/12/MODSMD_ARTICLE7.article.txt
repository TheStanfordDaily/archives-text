### JACK TRINKLEIN 
The DKE's Christmas drive for
books for soldiers in Vietnam has so
far attracted only a minimum re
sponse from Stanford students, ac
cording to Mouse spokesmen.
The drive's kick-off, headed by
Ernie Novel's, Stanford's all-time loot
ball great, lost out in competition with
the Noon Teach-in Wednesday. "What
notice we did receive was highly grati
fying." remarked Clay Gregory, eo
ordinator of the 30-man chapter.
"We had people come bv and march
right into the bookstore. They bought
a book, came right back out, and con
tributed it," Gregory continued.
On the whole, however, the campus
response has been apathetic, another
member of the fraternity, David
Nateller, reported, "As ol llntrsday
we had collected only a total of .>(•
books from on campus, while from
the surrounding communities close to
2,000 books had flowed in,"
Science fiction and mysteiy books
seem to be the most popular contribu
tions to date, but this is not to the ex
elusion of periodicals. "Magazines like
Playboy certainly would not be
thrown away," the DKE's emphasized.
The House did comment that it is
"essentially interested in getting
quite a bit more of a meaningful re
.ooii.c from the ijuoplc on campus."
