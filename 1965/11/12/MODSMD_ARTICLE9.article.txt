# HOMOSEXUALITY
## Speaker Cites Causes

How widespread is homosexuality
in contemporary society, and how
should the community deal with this
problem legally and socially?
These questions were posed last
night by Dr. John Gagnon of the
Kinsey Institute for Sex Research at
the University of Indiana. Gagnon
was featured as the first speaker in
Tresidder's series on contemporary
morality.
He told a diverse group of students
and area residents that 30 percent of
all males and 6 percent of all females
experience some homosexual relation
ship during adolescence.
Learned, Not Inherited
These figures are based on a sur
vey conducted several years ago
among 51,000 college students. How
ever, only 3 to 6 of the men and

1 to 3 percent of the women ques
tioned confined their sexual activity
only to members of the same sex.
Dr. Gagnon stated these statistics
were still fairly representative of the
extent of homosexuality today.
Much of the information available
on homosexuality is based on limited
samplings of homosexuals in penal
institutions or those few who seek
psychiatric care. This often results in
the stereotypes of the effeminate man
and the masculine woman; however,
the determining factors of homosex
uality are not immediately evident,
the researcher stressed.
Though some authorities have as
serted that homosexuality is a genetic
tendency. Dr. Gagnon feels it is
learned in early childhood rather than
inherited.
