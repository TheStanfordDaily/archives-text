HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
Eighteen years ago Evelyn Wood, a Utah schoolteacher, made a startling
discovery that led to the founding of Reading Dynamics. While working
toward a master's degree, she handed a term paper to a professor and
watched him read the 80 pages at 6,000 words per minute—with out
standing recall and comprehension. Determined to find the secret be
hind such rapid reading, she spent the next two years tracking down
50 people who could read faster than 1,500 words per minute. She
studied their techniques, taught herself to read at these faster rates.
Now, after years of experience in public schools and universities, she
has made it possible for you to benefit from this great discovery.
IS IT SIMPLY A PROMOTION STUNT? &
Over the past eleven years more than 200,000 graduates have been
convinced that Reading Dynamics is a proven method. About Reading
Dynamics' impact on our nation's legislators, Time Magazine said
"Washington has seen nothing like it since the days when Teddy Roose
velt read three books a day and ran the country at the same time."
Conventional rapid reading courses aspire to 450-600 words per mirv
ute. Most Reading Dynamics graduates can read between 1,500 and
► 3,000 words per minute, and many go even higher. ~***
