The Intellectual Approach to God
Every generation produces its scholars and students, whose keen minds lead
them deeply into philosophy and religion. Books on comparitive religion flood
the stands, yet the Power Beyond seems untapped and remote, unavailable
to man. To raise questions is one thing, to supply answers another,- and today s
theologians and religious philosophers have still not told us who we are or
how to overcome.
But the God of the Bible is neither dead nor unapproachable, neither remote
nor unavailable. To the intellectual Greeks of Athens Paul said, The God who
made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not
live in shrines mode by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he
needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and every
thing. And he made from one, every nation of men to live on all the face of
the earth, having determined alloted periods and boundaries of their habitation,
that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find
him. Vet he is not far from each one of us, for in him we live and move and
have our being" (Acts 17:24-28).
But to a skeptical, unbelieving age, and to the intellectually proud, unwilling
to discover the facts of faith, the sovereign God remains far off, available only
to those who come to Jesus Christ in simple, humble faith: ' The word of the
cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved
it is the power of God . . . for, since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not
know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the foolishness of what we
preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek
wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified . . . Christ the power of God and the
wisdom of God" (I Corinthinians 1:18-25).
Tired of intellectual answers which don't work and never satisfy? Why not
settle for the wisdom of God and the mind of Christ, which are yours for the
asking. . . the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord." Why
sit on the sidelines of life with the skeptics?
