# Pitch Black Residences Cause Tears
## 
### MARSHA COOK 
Darkness fell from the wings of
night as the power was shut off all
over tho campus Saturday morning
from 12:10 to 1:30 a.m.
A female motorist hit a power pole
in Menio Park and set off a chain
reaction of blood, sweat, and tears in
blaeked-out Stanford residences.
Those walking home suddenly found
themselves shrouded in darkness. The
overcast skies and ladling rain made
the evening complete.
In the row houses, girls stole can
dles off the dining room tables.
Frightening black permeated the ster
ile stairways of Flo Mo and the dismal
castle of Toyon.
But the main damage involved the
morale of more than 500 seniors who
were 1o take the very important Law
Boards and Graduate Record Exam
inations Saturday morning. The prob
lem was TIME.
Electric alarm clocks were useless.
The majority of seniors had to stay
up until well after midnight to set
alarms. Even then, they could only
cross their fingers and hope for the
best.
Those id ready asleep when the ca
lamity occurred were saved only by
their friends who ran up and down
the halls arousing them.
Late Saturday afternoon when the
testing was nearly finished the lights
flickered and died twice, for about a
minute each time. One senior said,
"When those lights went off we were
all ready to flick it in. We were dying
for any excuse not to have those
scores count."
But the light went on, the rain
poured down, and the senior delib
erated over popular methods of sui
cide to end their miserv.
