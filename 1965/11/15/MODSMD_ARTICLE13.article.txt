# 'Make Implied Official' — Duryea
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor (Seventh in a series 
"A mere administrative decision is all that is
now required to put into effect what is obviously
implied in the current religious situation at Stan
ford," Father John Duryea, Catholic chaplain to
Stanford told The Daily yesterday.
"The anomoly that needs to be resolved is that
the position of the denominational ministers now
allows them to organize, participate, and lead ev
ery type of religious activity but the central reli'
gious activity: worship."
Chaplain's Stall
The creation of the chaplain's staff, made up of
the chaplain, and the denominational ministers has
meant the emergence of "a de facto pan-sectarian
situation, in accordance with Mrs. Stanford's ideal
of non-alignment." he said.
Given the nature of the current ministry, co
operative and ecumenical, the recognition of the
rightof worship would be merely the fulfillment
of the existing situation, rather than the granting
of a concession to an outside group, he feels.
The reasons for recognition of the right to wor
ship are two-fold, he stated. "The ministers seek
religious freedom for each denomination to hold
their own services led by a minister. The schedule
can be worked out among the chaplains the struc
ture is already there. Ii would be done within the
existing ecumenical climate and be another in
stance of a collaborative effort to provide what
is needed for the religious life at Stanford."
Mill the recognition of denominational groups'
rights is not enough. "There should also be a
recognition of freedom of worship in the broad
sense; the constitutional right for anvhody, an\
where lo .issemhle lor prayer, given the recogni
tion o| others' righ! lo traffic, etc."
The to celebrate muss twice weekly and

the access to regular office space are Father Dur
yca's hopes at present. "I would be satisfied with
those two. They would form the basis for any
other developments."
"Neither T nor any of the other campus minis
ters want to construct our own chapels on campus.
In ihe long run, we would hope that Stanford
would build a church house, but in the intervening
time, we would be happy to use any university
facility."
Heart of Campus
Father Duryea would hope to say one mass on
Sunday and one during the week on campus, lie
expressed a desire to use Memorial Church on
occasion, as it is "symbolically at the heart of the
campus," but thinks it 100 formal and large for
the regular services.
"The main tilings aer the convenience to the
students and giving them opportunity to witness
better to their faith," he said. "Any Universiy
facility where a service can be conducted with
simplicity and dignity will be fine."
A "decided interest" in worship on campus was
shown at the Newman convocation, held in early
October, Father Duryea reported. "II dominated
ihe discussion. The people there mainly freshmen
couldn't see any reason why not."
"If religious freedom is to be meaningful." lie
continued, "the ministers must have a place out
of which to work. The current arrangement in
which we each spend an afternoon al Wilbur is
one in which we are inaccessible there is no
phone, we haev only a few office hours, and we
are located far from Ihe heart of campus."
Temporary Solution
Regular office space, "where I could spend two
or three hours a day, a place that would l>e m>
own," would be ,111 adequate temporary solution
to ihe problem, lie feels. IJnt a building for reli
gious actiivlici—"Coiiicll provide,, the übviuu., e.v

ample"—would be the most desirable resolution
of the issue.
"Annabell Taylor Hall at Cornell, is the best
example of a 'church house' solution. There are
facilities for meetings, offices for the ministers,
and a rotating altar so the several services can
be held consecutively or simultaneously."
On the question of general interest in freedom
of worship, Father Duryea feels "the proper func
tion of journalism is to present issues to the pub
lic. There was an unformed urgency in the student
body on the question of freedom of worship: the
series of articles on the religious situation has
provided the opportunity to crystalize these feel
ings. which have existed since the 1930'5, when I
was a student here. The situation has changed
since then; the climate is now one of freedom and
action."
He feels that the suggestion to have students
affiliated with the President's Advisory Commit
tee on Religious Activities is "an excellent one.
This seems the best way to bring student feeling
to the Committee. The long-range viewpoint will
have to eome from the faculty and the ministers,
tint students have immediate needs, which need to
be articulated and solved immediately."
"Iti addition, students need to feel a sense of
responsibility to the campus religious life: unless
they can do something, this will be stifled."
He traced the development of the relationship
between Memorial Church and the ministers as
"moving from opopsition of interest to coopcra
tion." The chaplain's recent asking Jim Corson
i Methodist campus minister) to preside at the
weekly chaplain's meetings has brought a further
change in the atmosphere. W'e are now more con
scions of the chaplain's confidence in u>- and the
discussions this year on the nature of campus
ministry and further means of cooperation- have
shown Ucplli tliuu evu bci'oic."
