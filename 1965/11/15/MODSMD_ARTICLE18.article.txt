# BEBAN, FARR STAR
## Bruins Battle Indians 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
It was a dismal day for foot
ball last Saturday, and UCLA's
red hot football team made it
doubly uncomfortable for Stan
ford fans as it dealt the tribe its
third consecutive AAWU loss,
30-13.
The Bruins took control of ihe
game at its very outset, and
played well over the heads of
their Indian counterparts for the
rcsl of t ho game. UCLA amassed
280 yards rushing and 172 in the
air, as sophomore pilot Gary
Eeban convincingly demonstrat
ed to 20,500 spectators his highly
touted skill with ihe pigskin.
Stanford ran for 131 yards and
passed for another 137 to post
a 268 total for the game.
Beltnii (licks
Beban threw only nine passes.
He completed six, two of them
going for 58 and 68 yards. Dale
Rubin picked off one Beban aeri
al, only ihe third Beban inter
ception this year. The Redwood
City artist also rushed for 75
yards.
The Bruins' Mel Farr, left
halfback, ran 12 plays to net 72

yards, bill his running attack
was not the biggest blow to tho
Indians. Fan* found himself on
tho receiving end of three Beban
passes. One was good for .">8
yards, one 27, one 5. Tho puny
one scored a touchdown.
John Read, who accumulated
a 5.3 rushing average and a
touchdown, could ho considered
rho Cards' only bright spot in
the hack field. Ray Handley was
hold to 1 yards for the day, and
Dave Lewis picked up a meagre
31 yards on the ground.
Bruins Hit Quickly
Stanford took tho opening
kickoff and Handley ran it to
the Stanford 28. Three plays
later, Bob Stiles picked off a
pass deflected off Hand ley's fin
gertips. That gave UCLA pos
session on the Stanford 48.
The Bruins ripped off three
quick first downs, placing the
ball on the Stanford 14. The Rod
defense finally held, forcing the
Bruins to settle for a 7 yard
field goal.
UCLA wasn't satisfied. After
a 29 yard kickoff runback by
Handley, the Bruin defense sti
fled the tribe.
UCLA took over on their own
20 and wasted no time. Beban
chucked a 58 yarder to Farr, set
ting the Bruins on the Stanford
16. After one unproductive play,
Beban squirted through an on
slaught of missed tackles to
score.
Seven More for UCLA
Three series later, the Bruins
again attacked. Beban carried
once, then unleashed his second
bomb of the afternoon, hitting
Kurt Alton berg for 68 yards.
Craig .Ritchey, faked out of the
play early in Altenberg's pat
tern, came back to nail the Bruin
end on the 6 yard line.
Beban tossed to Farr for the
TD one play later.
Down 17-0, the Stanford of
fense finally got moving. From
Stanford's 33, Lewis hit Humph
reys at the 45. Another pass to
Connelly broughl the ball down
to the UCLA 33. The tribe ef
fectively outguessed tho Bruin
blitzing defense.
Stanford Gets First TD
John Read stung the Bruins
for 11 yards, bringing the ball
to the 22. After Handley picked
up three, Lewis hit Humphreys
who made his way down to the
9. Read then blasted through
the middle, hurdling tacklers
and dragging a few more into
the end zone.
UCLA took the second half
kickoff and pushed to the Stan
ford one in 1() plays. Bruin full
back Paid Horgan fumbled in
the end zone and John Guillory
pounced on it for Stanford. The
break soon broke the other way.
A Lewis pitchout was wide,
and UCLA recovered on the
Stanford 22. Four plays later.
Beban trotted around right end
for the Bruins' third TD.
Six More for Cards
Stanford took over late in the
third quarter. To complete a 54
yard journey, Lewis hit Conrad
on a 9 yard pass to register the
Card's second score. The two
point conversion was no good.

UCLA bounced right back,
driving to their final score with
Farr plunging in from the 1.
Th,e rest of the game saw lit
tle action save a flurry of fisti
cuffs that resulted in UCLA's
Terry Donahue and Stanford
QB Dave Lewis being ejected
from the game.
