## 
### JACK TRINKLEIN 
Federal District Court Judge Wil
liam T. Sweigert said last Friday that
the Vietnam Day Committee will be
allowed to hold its scheduled 20,000
man protest march through Oakland
next Saturday, "under reasonable reg
ulations" by the city.
The occasion was a formal hearing
of the Vietnam Day Committee's pe
tition for a Federal injunction to keep
the City of Oakland from barring its
planned march.
Informal Expression
Judge Sweigert directed the antag
onists in the long and bitter contro
versy to get together and hammer out
the compromises necessary to insure
both the rights of the Vietnam Day
Committee to demonstrate and of the
residents of Oakland to safety and
reasonable convenience.
