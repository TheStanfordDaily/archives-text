# Overseas Campiâ€” The Exported 'S'
## 
### STEVE BAIER And BRUCE MILLER Germany XIV 
The Overseas Campus Pro
gram is designed to educate a
large number of Stanford stu
dents in Europe. The opening of
the new campuses in Austria
afid Britain demonstrate the Ad
ministration's confidence in the
program's effectiveness. While
most of us who have attended
an overseas campus agree that
the program is worthwhile, we
are unable to ignore a number
of obvious deficiencies.
For example, the Administra
tion considers Stanford-in-Ger
many a very successful campus.
One reason is its location, near
a large city, and yet close to a
small farming community. But
from the students' position, high
up on a hill, forty-five minutes
from the nearest Beutelsbacher,
it is not close enough for close
personal contact with the vil
lagers. The climb from Beutels
bach is difficult, the provided
transportation is infrequent, and
the weather is often bad. The
student is tempted to stay in the
warm security of the Burg.
i Why Leave U.S.?
The American atmosphere of
the Burg is to an extent both
necessary and desirable: neces
sary because there are 70 or 80
Americans living, learning and
traveling together; desirable be
cause of the unique opportunity
to observe yourself and others
in the group grappling with new
situations. But to have little es
cape from an American commu
nity when you are in Germany
can make you wonder why you
left the U. S. A. at all.
Yet we see in the new cam
puses in Austria and Britain an
extension of the ideal of isola
tion. Campuses are located ac
cording to the prinicple that stu
dents will tend to be more
serious toward their studies
when the diversions of the sur
rounding milieu are minimal.
This principle suggests an inter
esting parallel: Stanford in New
York should be located in New
Jersey. To presume that a Stan
ford student will learn only as
a last resort does not demon
strate a great deal of confidence
either in his seriousness or in
the value of the academic pro
gram.
L
Transferred Courses
This program offei's little to
ins pi re anyone's confidence.
Since its advent the program has
been saddled with the illusion

that Stanford courses, like rifles,
can be transported lock, stock,
and barrel to Europe and retain
their effectiveness. A student in
a European country, confronted
wtih the challenge of a new cul
ture, often finds it difficult to
see the relevance of a course
such as Economics I. Courses
taught at the German campus
should pertain to Germany,
those at the French campus to
France, and so on.
Moreover, the structure of
courses at the home campus is
equally unsuited to the condi
tions at the European campus.
Inadequate library facilities pre
clude extensive background read
ing and even the most cursory
research required by most Stan
ford courses.
'In Loco Parentis'
The result need not be aca
demic despair. The smallness of
the group and the resulting op
portunity for intimate associa
tion and exchange of ideas with
professors allows an approach to
learning seldom feasible at Stan
ford itself. The adherence to the
lecture format and the reluc
tance to utilize the seminar is
an unfortunate waste.
Concurrent with the adminis
tration's unwillingness to trust
the seriousness of the students
overseas is the extension of the
obsolete principle of in loco pa
rentis. Attendance at guest lec
tures is required. Unfortunately
Ihe lectures are often carelessly
screened and irrelevant. In plan
ning the field trips, the adminis
tration is so concerned with the
formal educational value of the
trip, that often too much of the
students' time is taken up with
lectures and guided tours. At the
campus itself, the student finds
himself sharing with 70 or 80
others a ritualistic daily routine,
from which there is little re
course. In this restrictive con
text, the student's time is all too
rarely his own, and opportunity
for reflection and individual ex
ploration is infrequent. The phi
losophy of regimentation is
sometimes intensified by an
overseas administrator's preoc
cupation with placating the in
ner quad establishment. As a
result, the student tends to feel
that Stanford has formed its
conception of a "European Ex
perience," bottled it, and given
each student his own little vial.
Stanford is clearly committed
to its overseas campus program.
We feel that it should be. Im
plicit in our confidence is the
assumption that a change of
emphasis is near.
