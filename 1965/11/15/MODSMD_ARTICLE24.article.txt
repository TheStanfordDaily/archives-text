## 'Masculine Meter Maids' Or How To Handle Ford's Folly 
### 
i _______________________
Editor, The Daily:
Because Chief Davis and his
masculine meter maids appear
to be nothing more than com
puter programed robots, they
are beyond criticinas, but surely
the university planners are
aware of the increasing severity
of Stanford's traffic problem.
It has been said that the Uni
versity hopes to phase out the
automobile. This would be a
great boon to everyone—except
the off campus student. Not
only did the builders of Tres
sider Union mistake the archi
tect's thumb print for the cafe
teria, but there appears to be a
shortage of on campus housing
as well. If Stanford can not or
will not offer equitable facili
ties to off-campus studeiAs,
surely it should make access to
the campus as easy as possible.
Unless, of course, the object of
university policy is to discour
age off-campus living. In such
case, why not come out and in
sist upon residency?
In any case would it be possi
ble to:
• Pave the road that runs
past the Stanford stables?
• Remove the blockade on
Los Arboles that prevents thru
traffic to Junipero Serra from
Quad.
• Chai'ge the staff $20 for
preferred parking, and off-cam
pus students nothing for the dis
tant plots presently reserved for
them. After all, who is paying
for the privilege of working
here?
• Ban bicycles from inner
quad and if possible confine
them to specified bicycle paths,
if only for their own safety. Al
most every day some crazy bike
rider tries to pass a car on the
right, just as it is signalling for
a right turn.
And, if Stanford wishes to
prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt that it is not just totter
ing on the edge of greatness but.
has truly taken off, why hot
have its engineers come up with
the solution to the incredible
automotive maelstrom that oc
curs twice a day on Junipero
Serra between Sandhill and Al
pine? You would win the eternal
blessings of hundreds of area
residents.

You can not expect to please
all of the people all of the time,
but you can at least let them
know what the "hell you're try
ing to do so they can protest
adequately. Given the traffice
situation on campus, why should
anyone feel obligated to pay $10
to register his vehicle?

• The Deke Drive
Editor, The Daily:
The Deke's effort to collect
books for American troops in
Vietnam is designed solely to al
low expression of support for
American involvement in that
war. In other words, the books
are just a token in spite of the
effort 1o describe the drive as a
"constructive" thing to do.
This book drive is not unlike
the cookie collections or the ef
fort to collect blood for the mili
tary blood bank even though
blood is not presently needed.
The various needs of fighting
forces may be debated: one lady
sent soap, Saigon's General Ky
suggests brothels, and we know
that 450 tons of liquor recently
met with the warmest response
from our Gl's. Yet none of these
plans for comforting or support
ing our forces in Vietnam is go
ing to reduce the suffering and
agony resultant from the war.
The war cannot be romanticized.
Of course, the Dekes should ex
press their opinion and convic
tion, but possibly those books
they are collecting could mean a
lot more if sent where they are
truly needed.
There are many groups within
our own country who need more
than token support. Right now
there are 7,000 children being de
nied an education, in the state
of Mississippi, because their par
ents are residing out of state
and they cannot afford a tuition
of $360 a year. Six thousand of
these children are Negro; the
median income of Negroes in
Mississippi is $520 a year; and
many of the youngsters are
orphans.
I would suggest that if the
Dekes want to be truly construc
tive, they should send their
books to Mississippi, and pro
test the unfair violation of fair
education standards in this coun
try. Then the Dekes could send
,r

a letter ox support to the service
men in Vietnam and explain
what they are doing to help
build America here at home.

Some interesting information
concerning the Walter Army So
ciety's blood drive has recently
been brought to my attention.
The Walter Army Society is as
we all know a voluntary associ
ation composed of cadets in the
AROTC program at Stanford.
As an apparently spontaneous
gesture of support for U.S. mili
tary activity in Vietnam, they
began soliciting blood donations.
It has been revealed to me that
the Society is using U.S. Depart
ment. of the Army mailing privi
leges in carrying out its plans.
I question both the propriety
and the implications of this pro
cedure.

• Doolin Defended
Editor, The Daily:
In Thursday's Daily, Tom
Sherman assumes a stand of
righteous aghastness which bor
ders on know-nothingism in con
demning Dr. Dennis Doolin's re
quest that someone meet him in
debate after becoming acquaint
ed with the relevant materials
on Vietnam.
Each of Dr. Doolin's attackers
in this past week has stressed
the right of laymen to discuss
Vietnam. Dr. Doolin does not
deny that right. He 1 simply calls
for a more informed dialogue.
Why do these people spend
their time finding excuses for
not doing the homework Dr.
Doolin suggests, rather than, as
good scholars, investigating his
sources and then meeting him in
debate?
Dr. Doolin is simply exercis
ing the first requisite of schol
arly discussion: the setting of
criteria for the acceptance of
amateurs into a debate with
himself. He seeks to raise the
debate to a higher plane than
the one on which is has hereto
fore been conducted.

• The Deke Drive
Editor, The Daily:
The Deke's effort to collect
books for American troops in
Vietnam is designed solely to al
low expression of support for
American involvement in that
war. In other words, the books
are just a token in spite of the
effort 1o describe the drive as a
"constructive" thing to do.
This book drive is not unlike
the cookie collections or the ef
fort to collect blood for the mili
tary blood bank even though
blood is not presently needed.
The various needs of fighting
forces may be debated: one lady
sent soap, Saigon's General Ky
suggests brothels, and we know
that 450 tons of liquor recently
met with the warmest response
from our Gl's. Yet none of these
plans for comforting or support
ing our forces in Vietnam is go
ing to reduce the suffering and
agony resultant from the war.
The war cannot be romanticized.
Of course, the Dekes should ex
press their opinion and convic
tion, but possibly those books
they are collecting could mean a
lot more if sent where they are
truly needed.
There are many groups within
our own country who need more
than token support. Right now
there are 7,000 children being de
nied an education, in the state
of Mississippi, because their par
ents are residing out of state
and they cannot afford a tuition
of $360 a year. Six thousand of
these children are Negro; the
median income of Negroes in
Mississippi is $520 a year; and
many of the youngsters are
orphans.
I would suggest that if the
Dekes want to be truly construc
tive, they should send their
books to Mississippi, and pro
test the unfair violation of fair
education standards in this coun
try. Then the Dekes could send
,r

a letter ox support to the service
men in Vietnam and explain
what they are doing to help
build America here at home.

Some interesting information
concerning the Walter Army So

been brought to my attention.
The Walter Army Society is as
we all know a voluntary associ

AROTC program at Stanford.
As an apparently spontaneous
gesture of support for U.S. mili

began soliciting blood donations.
It has been revealed to me that
the Society is using U.S. Depart

• The Deke Drive
Editor, The Daily:
The Deke's effort to collect
books for American troops in
Vietnam is designed solely to al
low expression of support for
American involvement in that
war. In other words, the books
are just a token in spite of the
effort 1o describe the drive as a
"constructive" thing to do.
This book drive is not unlike
the cookie collections or the ef
fort to collect blood for the mili
tary blood bank even though
blood is not presently needed.
The various needs of fighting
forces may be debated: one lady
sent soap, Saigon's General Ky
suggests brothels, and we know
that 450 tons of liquor recently
met with the warmest response
from our Gl's. Yet none of these
plans for comforting or support
ing our forces in Vietnam is go
ing to reduce the suffering and
agony resultant from the war.
The war cannot be romanticized.
Of course, the Dekes should ex
press their opinion and convic
tion, but possibly those books
they are collecting could mean a
lot more if sent where they are
truly needed.
There are many groups within
our own country who need more
than token support. Right now
there are 7,000 children being de
nied an education, in the state
of Mississippi, because their par
ents are residing out of state
and they cannot afford a tuition
of $360 a year. Six thousand of
these children are Negro; the
median income of Negroes in
Mississippi is $520 a year; and
many of the youngsters are
orphans.
I would suggest that if the
Dekes want to be truly construc
tive, they should send their
books to Mississippi, and pro
test the unfair violation of fair
education standards in this coun
try. Then the Dekes could send
,r

a letter ox support to the service
men in Vietnam and explain
what they are doing to help
build America here at home.

Some interesting information
concerning the Walter Army So
ciety's blood drive has recently
been brought to my attention.
The Walter Army Society is as
we all know a voluntary associ
ation composed of cadets in the
AROTC program at Stanford.
As an apparently spontaneous
gesture of support for U.S. mili
tary activity in Vietnam, they
began soliciting blood donations.
It has been revealed to me that
the Society is using U.S. Depart

I question both the propriety

In Thursday's Daily, Tom

righteous aghastness which bor

demning Dr. Dennis Doolin's re
quest that someone meet him in
debate after becoming acquaint

on Vietnam.
Each of Dr. Doolin's attackers
in this past week has stressed
the right of laymen to discuss
Vietnam. Dr. Doolin does not
deny that right. He 1 simply calls

Why do these people spend
their time finding excuses for
not doing the homework Dr.
Doolin suggests, rather than, as

Dr. Doolin is simply exercis
