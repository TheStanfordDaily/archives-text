# Store Strikes Colors
## 
### 
Last week the sign over the Itoos/
Atkins store in Berkeley was its usual
red and white. But when Cal students
started pointing at the sign, the store
manager ordered it repainted blue and
gold.
"We really didn't think it was in
the spirit of things for it to be red
and white," explained the manager.

Although his directives were
couched in an "informal expression
of the feeling of the court"—not a
formal court order—Judge Swcigert
also laid down some guidelines for
what he considered "reasonable" re
strictions on the march.
These included making sure that
ilie march ends before dark; requiring
the VDC to get permission from the
Post Office Department which owns
the land, to use the big, vacant lot
at Seventh and Peralta streets for a
rally; and not marching beyond that
point to the Oakland Army Base, the
avowed objective for its marches.
John A. Morin, Oakland's acting
city manager, rejected the Commit
tee's application for a march permit
on grounds that it would seriously
disrupt traffic and might precipitate
violence. In order to get to the army
base, the marchers would have to pass
through a narrow underpass on Sev
enth street.
"It is not reasonable to expect local
taxpayers to suffer inconvenience and
exposure to possible violence as well
as having to pay (he high cost of
protection," Morin said.
