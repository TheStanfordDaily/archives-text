# Job-Retraining Speech Slated
## 
### 
Mr. Joseph Chretien, staff member
of the Opportunities Industrialization
Center West in Menlo Park, will speak
this afternoon at 1:15 in Tresidder,
room 270 on the purpose and organ
ization of this recently-established
job retraining program. The OICW,
the fourth such center in the United
States, has now begun vocational
classes in typing and electronic as
sembly and will soon expand into
other courses.
The program also emphasizes a ba
sic "feeder program" of reading, writ
ing, and communication skills for all
trainees. In addition, accompanied by
extensive counseling, the OICW at
tempts to go beyond technical train
ing to increase the self-confidence and
motivation of the individual.
Student volunteers are needed now
for clerical work and will be needed
soon for tutoring individual trainees
in the feeder program. Students inter
ested in working with the OICW may
apply at the meeting this afternoon
or at the NSA desk in the ASSU loft
of Tresidder.

The lengthy court hearing in Sun
Francisco found Benjamin Preyfuss.
attorney for VDC. demanding their
rights of free speech and assembly.
Oakland's assistant City Attorney
George Cahalan countered that the
general welfare of the citizenry must
also be considered.
Judge Sweigert agreed that the gen
eral Welfare must be considered, but
stated, "The City of Oakland hasn't
made, a reasonable attempt to allow
these people to march under peaceful
conditions."
He then asked why the officials of
Oakland couldn't work out safety de
tails in consultation with the VDC
as the City of Berkeley has. Indeed,
Berkeley's granting of a parade per
mit to the. demonstrators Friday in
cluded plans for an alternative route
in the event that the marchers are
stopped at the Oakland City Limits
once again.
"I was wondering," Judge Sweigert
asked "what tin 1 distinction is between
the City of Berkeley and the City of
Oakland."
When he finally issued his ''infor
mal expression" at ti p.m.. the judge
suggested that the Oakland City
Council, which meets Tuesday eve
ning, might eliminate the necessity of
a formal order from him by making
a proposal along the lines he sug
gested.
