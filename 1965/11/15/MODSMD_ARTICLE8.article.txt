More than 170 Stanford faculty
members have signed an open letter
to President Johnson seeking an end
to the Vietnam war.
The letter, to be published as a
full page advertisement in the Wash

mediately and unconditionally stop

the bombing of North Vietnam."
The letter also urges that "our
country unmistakably indicate its
willingness to participate in a peace
conference and to recognize the Na
tional Liberation Front as one party
to the negotiations."
About 300 signatures have been ob
tained at the Universitv of California

at Berkeley, another 100 at San Fran
cisco State, and other colleges in the
area have brought the total to over

Strohman, Berk e 1 e y coordinator.
Strohman stressed that all signees are
Ph.D.'s.
He said that he expects to have
1000 signatures on the ad by the dead

article in the San Francisco Chronicle
last Friday, Strohman has received
calls from colleges and universities up
to 250 miles away.
A total of about $230(3 has been col
lected from the signees, $500 of it at
Stanford, and Strohman said he is
"sure the ad will run at least one day,
and I hope it will run on both a week
day and a Sunday." The cost of two
