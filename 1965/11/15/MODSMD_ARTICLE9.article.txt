# Washington Personality Will Speak

### SUSAN KENT 
Washington "Merry-Go-Round" col
umnist Drew Pearson will reveal
what's "Behind the Scenes in Wash
ing, Peking, and Moscow" tonight at
8 p.m. ky Cubberley Auditorium.
A coffee-hour discussion in Wilbur's
Traneos Lounge will follow his
speech, sponsored by Political Union.
Pearson, according to a Saturday
Review of Literature poll, is the col
umnist whose writings exert the
greatest influence on the nation. He
regards the job of a Washington re
porter as that of "watchdog of the
people," and his biggest exposes have
generally hit the politicians in power.
Me is distinguished as almost the
only reporter to be publicly castigated
from the White House by or under
Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, Roose
velt, and Eisenhower.
.McCarthy Battle
Pearson's best known single case
was a running battle with the late
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wiscon
sin. The case culminated in a vote of
censCire by the Senate and in Mc-
Carthy's resulting loss of power and
prestige.
In early 10.39, just after Fidel Cas
tro seized power in Cuba, Pearson
warned at a time most writers Were
hailing Fidel as as hero— that: his
regime posed a serious Communist
threat which might give Russia a
base in the U.S. front yard.
Pearson held three interviews with
Khrushchev in Russia in 1961. 1963,
and 196,3. Khrushchev discussed in an
apparently frank spirit not only U.S.-
Soviet relations but also his own prob
lems in Russia and Red China.
Service Projects
Pearson has alsto promoted numer
ous service projects. In 1917 he staged
what was termed by the Christian
Science Monitor as "one of the great
est projects ever born of American
journalism" The Friendship Train.
Pearson provided the funds necessary
to get the train rolling across the
United States; seven hundred carloads
of food (worth $40 million) were col
lected for France and Italy.
Pearson graduated from Swart h
more College in 1919 where he made
Phi Beta Kappa and edited the college
newspaper. He has taught at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and at Colum
bia University.

Stanford coordinators for the proj
ect are Professor Charles Drekmeier
of the Political Science department
and Tom Plant of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Advertising Refused
Plant commented that the ad in the
Post is especially important because
"it seems to be getting increasingly
difficult to express opinions at vari
ance with the current administration
policy."
Radio stations KYA and KAYVK
have both refused to carry advertising
which the Californians for Peace in
Vietnam (CPV), a Stanford faculty
group, wanted to buy.
CPV sponsored two one-minute
spots each day throughout September
on stations KIBE and KDFC, using
quotations from Sen. Wayne Morse
and Rep. Edith Green, both of Oregon,
part of a statement signed by 11,000
clergymen in the New York Times,
and part; of Norman Mailer's speech
at the Berkeley teach-in last May. All
of the ads were critical of administra
tion policy in Vietnam.
Response to the ads was favorable,
wtih listeners sending in contributions
covering a substantial part of their
cost.
Civil Liberties
Plaut said that the civil liberties
aspects of the denial of advertising
time are being explored. He noted
that "it is striking that this denial
of the right of freedom of expression
occurred immediately following the
International Days of Protest and the
strong governmental reaction to that."
The American Civil Liberties Union
is presently taking an East Bay tran
sit company to court for refusing to
sell ad space on its buses to a wom
en's peace group.
KYA and K'EWB said that they had
refused ad time to both sides of the
Vietnam issue, and had a new policy
of not accepting political advertising
except for candidates and issues to
appear on ballots in elections.

Washington "Merry-Go-Round" col
umnist Drew Pearson will reveal
what's "Behind the Scenes in Wash
ing, Peking, and Moscow" tonight at
8 p.m. ky Cubberley Auditorium.
A coffee-hour discussion in Wilbur's
Traneos Lounge will follow his
speech, sponsored by Political Union.
Pearson, according to a Saturday
Review of Literature poll, is the col
umnist whose writings exert the
greatest influence on the nation. He
regards the job of a Washington re
porter as that of "watchdog of the
people," and his biggest exposes have
generally hit the politicians in power.
Me is distinguished as almost the
only reporter to be publicly castigated
from the White House by or under
Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, Roose
velt, and Eisenhower.
.McCarthy Battle
Pearson's best known single case
was a running battle with the late
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wiscon
sin. The case culminated in a vote of
censCire by the Senate and in Mc-
Carthy's resulting loss of power and
prestige.
In early 10.39, just after Fidel Cas
tro seized power in Cuba, Pearson
warned at a time most writers Were
hailing Fidel as as hero— that: his
regime posed a serious Communist
threat which might give Russia a
base in the U.S. front yard.
Pearson held three interviews with
Khrushchev in Russia in 1961. 1963,
and 196,3. Khrushchev discussed in an
apparently frank spirit not only U.S.-
Soviet relations but also his own prob
lems in Russia and Red China.
Service Projects
Pearson has alsto promoted numer
ous service projects. In 1917 he staged
what was termed by the Christian
Science Monitor as "one of the great
est projects ever born of American
journalism" The Friendship Train.
Pearson provided the funds necessary
to get the train rolling across the
United States; seven hundred carloads
of food (worth $40 million) were col
lected for France and Italy.
Pearson graduated from Swart h
more College in 1919 where he made
Phi Beta Kappa and edited the college
newspaper. He has taught at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and at Colum
bia University.

Stanford coordinators for the proj
ect are Professor Charles Drekmeier
of the Political Science department
and Tom Plant of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Advertising Refused
Plant commented that the ad in the
Post is especially important because
"it seems to be getting increasingly
difficult to express opinions at vari
ance with the current administration
policy."
Radio stations KYA and KAYVK
have both refused to carry advertising
which the Californians for Peace in
Vietnam (CPV), a Stanford faculty
group, wanted to buy.
CPV sponsored two one-minute
spots each day throughout September
on stations KIBE and KDFC, using
quotations from Sen. Wayne Morse
and Rep. Edith Green, both of Oregon,
part of a statement signed by 11,000
clergymen in the New York Times,
and part; of Norman Mailer's speech
at the Berkeley teach-in last May. All
of the ads were critical of administra
tion policy in Vietnam.
Response to the ads was favorable,
wtih listeners sending in contributions
covering a substantial part of their
cost.
Civil Liberties
Plaut said that the civil liberties
aspects of the denial of advertising
time are being explored. He noted
that "it is striking that this denial
of the right of freedom of expression
occurred immediately following the
International Days of Protest and the
strong governmental reaction to that."
The American Civil Liberties Union
is presently taking an East Bay tran
sit company to court for refusing to
sell ad space on its buses to a wom
en's peace group.
KYA and K'EWB said that they had
refused ad time to both sides of the
Vietnam issue, and had a new policy
of not accepting political advertising
except for candidates and issues to
appear on ballots in elections.
