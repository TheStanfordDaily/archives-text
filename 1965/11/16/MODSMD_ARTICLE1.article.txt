# Mackenzie Lowers The Boom On Housing Dilemma
## 
### 
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie released
a statement to The Daily yesterday calling for
a "complete statement of the University's resi
dence philosophy" and a "reasonably detailed
long-range plan of implementation of that
philosophy."
At the same time, he announced that the
following names have been submitted to Dean
of Undergraduate Education Robert Wert for
membership on the housing subcommittee of
the Committee on Undergraduate Education of
the Academic Council: Mike Cohen, Sheila
McCarthy, Barbara Ramsey, Jonathan Reider
and Jane Sokolow.
Mackenzie Statement
"Stanford University has long claimed a
commitment to the ideal of a residence uni
versity. It is strange indeed that it has never
articulated, except in the most general terms,
what it considers to be the components of a
successful residence policy. In the recent dis

cussions over the closing of Union Residence,
even those who have decided to close it agree
that it, among women's dorms, best approxi
mates this hazy idea. Union has succeeded to
a degree unparalleled by other undergraduate
residences in integrating intellectual and aca
demic pursuits into their living situation. This
is attested to by the letters of support they
have received from faculty members who have
participated in their activities.
"Nonetheless, Union residence will be closed.
Clearly, residence policy considerations have
assumed a secondary importance in this de
cision. While the Univesrity gives painstaking
attention to its long range office space re
quirements, housing decisions are made on a
relatively ad hoc basis. This is most strikingly
evident in viewing the existing hodge-podge of
student housing.
"Wilbur Hall was built as quickly and inex
pensively as possible because Encina Hall—the
former residence hall for freshmen men—had

been condemned for that purpose. Until recent
extensive and costly renovations, Stern Hall
typically had empty rooms by spring quarter
because no one wanted to move in to fill va
cancies. This is especially significant because
there is a housing shortage for undergraduate
men.
Women's Residences 'Even Worst*'
"Undergraduate women are required by the
University to live on campus. This require
ment is justified because once again it is said
that Stanford is a residence university. Yet
the facilities provided for women are in many
respects even worse than the men's and cer
tainly do not even approximate those required
by any reasonable residence philosophy. There
is not a single women's dormitory wtih pro
visions for a faculty resident. Moreover, no
women's residence hall can have a successful
Guest-in-Residcnce program because none have
adequate guest room facilities.

"These mistakes are extremely expensive to
correct once they are made. Some cannot be
corrected. The same attention and forethought
should be devoted to the rationale and func
tioning of its residence policies that the Uni
versity seems prepared to give to the problem
of office space.
"On the problem of Union Residence, I am
surprised and concerned that the University
lias not voluntarily offered at least to make
up the rent differential between Union and the
high rise, pay for the installation of phones,
and as best it can provide other concessions
to in part make up for what is being lost in
the move out of Union. These are surely min
imal requests.
"I Call On The University"
"With respect to residence policy as a whole,
I call on the University to publish with par
ticulars:
• a complete statement of the University's
residence philosophy, and

• a reasonably detailed range plan of
implementation of that philosophy. The Moore
and Jacks residences will contain many of the
features that are lacking in other residence
systems. They, however, are still near the
beginning of their building program and no
doubt many decisions of detail remain to be
made. Beyond their construction, it is not clear
what is in store with respect to future resi
dence halls.
"What is clear is that the students who live
in these dormitories and the faculty who live
or associate in them must be brought into
their planning on the policy-making level. This
is true for decisions involving new construc
tion, renovation, student programs and the
selection of Resident Assistants, Faculty Resi
dents, and Faculty Masters. In order to be able
to participate in these decisions, they must
have a clear idea what the University's aims
in a residence system are and how they are
proposed to be brought about."
