# Water Poloists Win Two More; Press For NCAA Second Spot
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's water poloists took
a giant step toward securing the
nation's number iwo ruling as
they won a 7-6 battle in double
overtime over a stubborn Long
Beach State squad last Friday.
Saturday, the Card poloists hu
miliated San Jose, 9-2.
It remains for Stanford to beat
Foothill College in the ISTorCal
Open Tournament next week to
tie down the number two spot.
The Indians have split, with the
Owls so far this season. UCLA,
currently undefeated, has all but
sewed up the top pocket.
History does seem to repeat
itself. The last time Long Reach
played in the Enoina Pool, Stan
ford fame from behind to win
in double overtime, 9-8.
Parmely Opens Scoring
Mark Parmely opened Ihe
scoring with a hard shot from
the wing. Parmely made it 2-0
as he took Doug Jensen's set up
pass to hammer the ball past,
the 49'er goalie. Mike Eshleman
tallied Stanford's third goal of
the period.
Long Beach's Timpone also
threw in two goals in the open
ing quarter. Both shots wore
partially blocked by goalie Vance
Simonds and then floated into
the goal.
Doug Jensen put in the only
goal of the second quarter to
give the Indians a 4-2 edge at
half time.

The third quarter brought on
the Stanford doldrums, as has
been the case throughout Ihe
year. Timpone and llman scored
one each to move the 49'ers into
a 4-4 tie with one period to go.
Timpone scored his fourth
goal of the day midway through
the last period, putting the In
dians in the hole, .>4. However,
t he Long Beach fouling rate was
beginning to hurt, as lour of
their starters accumulated the
four foul limit.
Meyer Evens Count
With 1:30 left in the game,
Bill Meyer broke away from his
guard and pounded in the tying
goal. A Stanford break at the
end of the quarter came too late,
and the game went into over
time.
During the first overtime pe
riod, neither team could muster
a score, but both teams began
to feel the bite of foulouts. Stan
ford's depth came to the fore, as
it has periodically through the
year.
Mark Parmely won the sprint
at the outset of the last period.
Moments later, Gary Sheerer
tossed the ball to Bill Meyer who
bombed it over the goalie's head.
Midway through the period,
Meyer scored his third consecu
tive goal, this one destined to be
the winning tally. Long Beach's
Sheldon Ellsworth scored once
to bring the game within one
point, but Stanford held onto its

margin.
Mike Sorem made nine saves
in front of the Stanford goal
against the hard-throwing 49'ers.
Cards Humble Spartans
Bill Meyer, who scored the last
three goals againsi Long Beach,
shot in five more as Stanford
stomped upon San Jose. At one
time, the Indians wore blanking
the Spartans, 9-0, in a game
where every Stanford player
was able to see action.
San Jose's philosophy —rely on
your strong bench and foul all
you want backfired miserably.
San Jose lost 8 men to the four
foul limit and 3 more had three
fouls at the end of the game.
Every time a foul is called,
the opposing team is given pos
session of the ball Stanford got
it the easy way 415 times from
San Jose.
When the officials were not
busy whistling San Jose fouls,
Stanford got the ball the hard
way, intercepting close to 50 per
cent of the Spartan passes and
engaging in blatant brigandry
from the San Jose ball-handlers.
Ready "Fouled" Out
Stanford's hole threat, Pete
Ready, who at the time was lead
ing the tribe scorers, was fouled
out of the game. No, he didn't
commit the conventional four

fouls—ho moroly got his eye
gashed resulting from a foul.
Once again, San Jo.so tactics
backfired. Ready's substitute
was one Gary Sheerer. Sheerer,
who broke his hand at San
Jose's pool three weeks ago, saw
limited action for ihe first time
in the Long Beach gamo. Sheer
er burned the Spartans for three
goals.
Stanford beat San Jose, Hi,
at the Spartans' pool earlier this
season, in a game that saw a
5-1 Stanford lead dwindle in the
final quarter. The 9-2 thrashing
Saturday settled the SJS ac
count: decisively, once and for
all, and may have pointed oul a
few manners to the Cretan polo
ists.
Meet Cal Next
Stanford takes on Cal in a
watery version of the Big Game
next Saturday morning at Stan
ford. The Indians beat the Bears,
10-7, in a close contest at Cal at
the opening of the season.
Next week, Stanford partici
pates in the Northern California
Tournament. In the Round Rob
in affair, the Cards meet
hill, the San Francisco Olympic
Club, Cal, and San Jose. The In
dians have split (1-1 > with Foot
hill this season, and lost once to
the Olympic Club.

Club, Cal, and San Jose. The In
dians have split (1-1 > with Foot
hill this season, and lost once to
the Olympic Club.
Stanford's water poloists took
a giant step toward securing the
nation's number iwo ruling as
they won a 7-6 battle in double
overtime over a stubborn Long
Beach State squad last Friday.
Saturday, the Card poloists hu
miliated San Jose, 9-2.
It remains for Stanford to beat
Foothill College in the ISTorCal
Open Tournament next week to
tie down the number two spot.
The Indians have split, with the
Owls so far this season. UCLA,
currently undefeated, has all but
sewed up the top pocket.
History does seem to repeat
itself. The last time Long Reach
played in the Enoina Pool, Stan
ford fame from behind to win
in double overtime, 9-8.
Parmely Opens Scoring
Mark Parmely opened Ihe
scoring with a hard shot from
the wing. Parmely made it 2-0
as he took Doug Jensen's set up
pass to hammer the ball past,
the 49'er goalie. Mike Eshleman
tallied Stanford's third goal of
the period.
Long Beach's Timpone also
threw in two goals in the open
ing quarter. Both shots wore
partially blocked by goalie Vance
Simonds and then floated into
the goal.
Doug Jensen put in the only
goal of the second quarter to
give the Indians a 4-2 edge at
half time.

The third quarter brought on
the Stanford doldrums, as has
been the case throughout Ihe
year. Timpone and llman scored
one each to move the 49'ers into
a 4-4 tie with one period to go.
Timpone scored his fourth
goal of the day midway through
the last period, putting the In
dians in the hole, .>4. However,
t he Long Beach fouling rate was
beginning to hurt, as lour of
their starters accumulated the
four foul limit.
Meyer Evens Count
With 1:30 left in the game,
Bill Meyer broke away from his
guard and pounded in the tying
goal. A Stanford break at the
end of the quarter came too late,
and the game went into over
time.
During the first overtime pe
riod, neither team could muster
a score, but both teams began
to feel the bite of foulouts. Stan
ford's depth came to the fore, as
it has periodically through the
year.
Mark Parmely won the sprint
at the outset of the last period.
Moments later, Gary Sheerer
tossed the ball to Bill Meyer who
bombed it over the goalie's head.
Midway through the period,
Meyer scored his third consecu
tive goal, this one destined to be
the winning tally. Long Beach's
Sheldon Ellsworth scored once
to bring the game within one
point, but Stanford held onto its

margin.
Mike Sorem made nine saves
in front of the Stanford goal
against the hard-throwing 49'ers.
Cards Humble Spartans
Bill Meyer, who scored the last
three goals againsi Long Beach,
shot in five more as Stanford
stomped upon San Jose. At one
time, the Indians wore blanking
the Spartans, 9-0, in a game
where every Stanford player
was able to see action.
San Jose's philosophy —rely on
your strong bench and foul all
you want backfired miserably.
San Jose lost 8 men to the four
foul limit and 3 more had three
fouls at the end of the game.
Every time a foul is called,
the opposing team is given pos
session of the ball Stanford got
it the easy way 415 times from
San Jose.
When the officials were not
busy whistling San Jose fouls,
Stanford got the ball the hard
way, intercepting close to 50 per
cent of the Spartan passes and
engaging in blatant brigandry
from the San Jose ball-handlers.
Ready "Fouled" Out
Stanford's hole threat, Pete
Ready, who at the time was lead
ing the tribe scorers, was fouled
out of the game. No, he didn't
commit the conventional four

fouls—ho moroly got his eye
gashed resulting from a foul.
Once again, San Jo.so tactics
backfired. Ready's substitute
was one Gary Sheerer. Sheerer,
who broke his hand at San
Jose's pool three weeks ago, saw
limited action for ihe first time
in the Long Beach gamo. Sheer
er burned the Spartans for three
goals.
Stanford beat San Jose, Hi,
at the Spartans' pool earlier this
season, in a game that saw a
5-1 Stanford lead dwindle in the
final quarter. The 9-2 thrashing
Saturday settled the SJS ac

Tournament. In the Round Rob
in affair, the Cards meet
hill, the San Francisco Olympic
Club, Cal, and San Jose. The In
dians have split (1-1 > with Foot
hill this season, and lost once to
the Olympic Club.
Stanford's water poloists took
a giant step toward securing the
nation's number iwo ruling as
they won a 7-6 battle in double
overtime over a stubborn Long
Beach State squad last Friday.
Saturday, the Card poloists hu
miliated San Jose, 9-2.
It remains for Stanford to beat
Foothill College in the ISTorCal
Open Tournament next week to
tie down the number two spot.
The Indians have split, with the
Owls so far this season. UCLA,
currently undefeated, has all but
sewed up the top pocket.
History does seem to repeat
itself. The last time Long Reach
played in the Enoina Pool, Stan
ford fame from behind to win
in double overtime, 9-8.
Parmely Opens Scoring
Mark Parmely opened Ihe
scoring with a hard shot from
the wing. Parmely made it 2-0
as he took Doug Jensen's set up
pass to hammer the ball past,
the 49'er goalie. Mike Eshleman
tallied Stanford's third goal of
the period.
Long Beach's Timpone also
threw in two goals in the open
ing quarter. Both shots wore
partially blocked by goalie Vance
Simonds and then floated into
the goal.
Doug Jensen put in the only
goal of the second quarter to
give the Indians a 4-2 edge at
half time.

The third quarter brought on
the Stanford doldrums, as has
been the case throughout Ihe
year. Timpone and llman scored
one each to move the 49'ers into
a 4-4 tie with one period to go.
Timpone scored his fourth
goal of the day midway through
the last period, putting the In
dians in the hole, .>4. However,
t he Long Beach fouling rate was
beginning to hurt, as lour of
their starters accumulated the
four foul limit.
Meyer Evens Count
With 1:30 left in the game,
Bill Meyer broke away from his
guard and pounded in the tying
goal. A Stanford break at the
end of the quarter came too late,
and the game went into over
time.
During the first overtime pe
riod, neither team could muster
a score, but both teams began
to feel the bite of foulouts. Stan
ford's depth came to the fore, as
it has periodically through the
year.
Mark Parmely won the sprint
at the outset of the last period.
Moments later, Gary Sheerer
tossed the ball to Bill Meyer who
bombed it over the goalie's head.
Midway through the period,
Meyer scored his third consecu
tive goal, this one destined to be
the winning tally. Long Beach's
Sheldon Ellsworth scored once
to bring the game within one
point, but Stanford held onto its

margin.
Mike Sorem made nine saves
in front of the Stanford goal
against the hard-throwing 49'ers.
Cards Humble Spartans
Bill Meyer, who scored the last
three goals againsi Long Beach,
shot in five more as Stanford
stomped upon San Jose. At one
time, the Indians wore blanking
the Spartans, 9-0, in a game
where every Stanford player
was able to see action.
San Jose's philosophy —rely on
your strong bench and foul all
you want backfired miserably.
San Jose lost 8 men to the four
foul limit and 3 more had three
fouls at the end of the game.
Every time a foul is called,
the opposing team is given pos
session of the ball Stanford got
it the easy way 415 times from
San Jose.
When the officials were not
busy whistling San Jose fouls,
Stanford got the ball the hard
way, intercepting close to 50 per
cent of the Spartan passes and
engaging in blatant brigandry
from the San Jose ball-handlers.
Ready "Fouled" Out
Stanford's hole threat, Pete
Ready, who at the time was lead
ing the tribe scorers, was fouled
out of the game. No, he didn't
commit the conventional four

fouls—ho moroly got his eye
gashed resulting from a foul.
Once again, San Jo.so tactics
backfired. Ready's substitute
was one Gary Sheerer. Sheerer,
who broke his hand at San
Jose's pool three weeks ago, saw
limited action for ihe first time
in the Long Beach gamo. Sheer
er burned the Spartans for three
goals.
Stanford beat San Jose, Hi,
at the Spartans' pool earlier this
season, in a game that saw a
5-1 Stanford lead dwindle in the
final quarter. The 9-2 thrashing
Saturday settled the SJS ac
count: decisively, once and for
all, and may have pointed oul a
few manners to the Cretan polo
ists.

Stanford takes on Cal in a
watery version of the Big Game
next Saturday morning at Stan
ford. The Indians beat the Bears,
10-7, in a close contest at Cal at
the opening of the season.
