# Ralston Praises UCLA
## 
### ARLEN HOLTER 
"We were beaten by a better
team, which has every chance of
beating USC next week. UCLA
is an alert, heads-up ball club
with as much team speed as we
have faced all season."
With these words an obviously
dejected and disappointed John
Ralston summed up Stanford's
rat her surprisingly mistake
ridden loss to UCLA, 30-13.
As he flipped an empty brown
coffee mug from one hand to
the other, Ralston cited the
many Indian mistakes as the

cause of the loss. "We moved
the ball very well at times today,
but UCLA did an excellent job
of capitalizing on our mistakes.
1 am pleased with the individual
efforts but feel that overall we
played poorly."
Poor Start
Feeling that Stanford was just
not ready to play ball at the
start of the game, Ralston said.
"They got the big jump on us
with that pass interception and
the field goal. The long passes
10 Farr and Altenbcrg really
hurt. Field position just didn't
mean too much in this game."
The quarterback delay on
which UCLA Quarterback Gary
Beban gained so much yardage
all afternoon was a play which
UCLA had not used previously.
"That was a new play which
they had put. in to take advan
tage of the way our linebackers
line up. Generally speaking,
though, they beat us on their
bread and butter plays. Their
reverse pass was a well executed
play," Ralston said.
Minor Flare-up
In regards to the fourth pe
riod scuffle in which Indian
quarterback Dave Lewis and
Bruin defensive tackle Terry
Donahue were ejected from the
game, Ralston quoted Lewis as
saying that it was "just a little
minor thing" that flared up
when the game was pretty well
decided.
