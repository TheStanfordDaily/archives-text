# Union Hall—RIP
## 
### 
With the Committee of 15's decision to final
ize plans for the closing of Union Residence at
the end of this quarter, the student body has lost
another battle to the Administration. However,
this time it is apparent that the long-range goal
of student-faculty-administration consultation is
now much closer to becoming a reality.
It was not the idea of transforming Union into
a centrally-located, unified office or student serv
ices that caused such an adverse reaction among
students, for .we think most would agree that
this move is a desirable one. Ilathcr, it was the
method of decision-making that rankled. Neither
the Union girls nor any student official was
consulted prior to the administrative proclama
tion.
Moreover, the decision to close Union, a resi
dence which probably best meets the criteria of
the academic-living group ideal in student hous
ing, was ironically timed to coincide with the an
nouncement of a new Faculty Master program
for Wilbur Hall, a program which was designed
to encourage just those attributes* exemplified by
Union Ilall.
In order that such arbitrary and contradictor/

decisions cease being the rule instead oi the ex
ception. we would urge Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert Wert to quickly move ahead
with his announced intention to name students
to his subcommittee on housing so that the prom
ised "Master Plan for the Future of Undergrad
uate Housing" can receive the complete and
lengthy consideration it deserves. For such a
"Master Plan" should not just be the concern of
a subcommittee; its recommendations should be
made public early enough in the academic year
to allow for reactions, questions and criticisms—
in other words, a debate as to whither we are
tending in the field of housing.
This mode of operation was utilized to some
extent last year as students consulted with the
subcommittee on certain segments of the pro
posal concerning Moore-Jacks Ilall. We think
such consultation should be expanded to all
aspects of the housing dilemma.
However, for the time being, we suggest that
this subcommittee is needed to work out some
equitable arrangements for the victims of this
bureaucratic faux pas— the girls of the Union,
who will have to move to high-priced, decentral
ized high-rise apartments come January.
