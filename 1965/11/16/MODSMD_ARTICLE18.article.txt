## Walker And The 'New Look' Overseas 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I read with interest in the
recent Daily supplement edition
on the overseas campuses the
article on the "new look" for the
Overseas Campus Board. I was
very glad to find that the board
is going to try "to serve as the
mouthpiece" for student opin
ions on the overseas campus
program, even though this added
responsibility is long overdue
and was accepted only after a
recent returnee spelled it out for
the board point by point.
It is dubious, however, that
the suggestions will be given
"serious consideration" by Dr.
Walker. This would be a com
plete reverasal of Dr. Walker's
attitude of over a year ago. As
an officer of an overseas campus
group about to leave for Europe,
1 attended a meeting of the offi
cers, Dean Winbigler, and Dr.
Walker for the purpose of dis
cussing the problems that we,
as officers, would face. There
would be, of course, the inevi
table judicial board cases and
the need to stir the enthusiasm
of the students, but we were
warned also of the probable at
tempts of the students to effect
changes either in our specific
campus or in the program itself.
We were told that these at
tempts would be fruitless, and
that we should try to discourage
potential rebels. Not once was it
admitted that the so-called gripes
of the students might be legiti
mate or constructive. The exact
phrase used was (and dare I

quote?): "Do not try to change
the system."
And we found liiat this state
ment was made in earnest. Val
id criticisms and suggestions
concerning the lack of proper
sanitation, medical facilities, or
library facilities at the campus
were either ignored or, in the
case of the library, dismissed
because of the misinterpretation
of a single word. Dr. Walker has
even gone so far as not to ac
knowledge the reports of return
ing professors. Some day T
would like to see some small
indication that Dr. Walker "wel
comes the assistance of groups"
such as the Overseas Campus
Buard except to be used as a
method of "bringing together
and putting in a usable form
suggestions" so that they can be
forgotten in one lump sum and
not one at a time.
But at least the Board will
cut down on the line of rebels
waiting outside of Dr. Walker's
office.

• Big Game, Humbug!
Editor, The Daily:
This week the festivities of
Big Game will start, sweeping
the entire campus like a fever.
Everyone will be roused to a
frenzy of excitement and lust to
beat Cal. Voices will chant in
increasingl monotony, "Beat Cal
. . . Kill Cal." The masses will
sway and the solidarity will soon
increase until the whole campus

is of one mind, one soul, and
one heart. Thousands of dollars
will be spent and countless
hours wasted in preparation for
Big Game.
The virtues of being a Stan
ford man and of showing loyalty
to the school and conformity
will be extolled to all freshman
men. They as well as many oth
ers will be led into the game not
out of respect for tradition and
the University but out of the
fear of being different.
It was terribly subtle and
crafty to hang Beat Cal in block
letters on a sixty-foot long ban
ner from the leaning Tower of
Pisa or to hang an incompre
hensible banner from Cal's clock
tower, using a "German" visitor
as a decoy.
"But RFs are fun," claim some
Stanford students. They may be
fun and they may be quite hu
morous but they can also be
quite dangerous. If destruction
of property is involved the
prankster may be arrested or
turned over to the Judicial Coun
cil.
On November 19, 1964, a Stan
ford student was arrested while
exchanging cards for cannons
with Cal. As the opposition at
tempted to enter his truck, he
took a loaded revolver and, some
witnesses claimed, threatened to
use it. He then crashed into sev
eral cars and was locked up for
part of the night.
Of course Cal plays its little
game of running Blue and Gold

mice through the girls' dormi
tories and puts soap in the foun
tain, but t hat is no excuse to do
the very thing for which Cal is
being damned — descending to
their infantile level. Lawlessness
can not be condoned and let off
with the expression, "Well they
are only letting off steam." They
don't care about Big Game, just
the excitement and the whetting
of the blood thirst leads them
on. They become both animals
and hypocrites swept along by
mass hysteria into believing that
they really do want to take part.
It is The Daily among others
that helps this to be so powerful
by continually reviving old tra
ditions and not bothering to
examine these traditions for
their worth. Meanwhile the edi
tors sneer at their ignorant cre
ation. They give fodder to the
student who shows his good
sense by saying, "Wouldn't it be
great to get drunk, really drunk
for the Cal game."

Editor, The Daily:
"Thus CONSCIENCE doth make
cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of
resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast
of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch
and moment
With this regard their currents
turn awry
And lose the name of action."

• Cotizen'g Cozzen
Editor, The Daily:
I noticed with interest Mr.
Couzens' comments on the Se
lective Service resolution. I tend
to agree wtih him that the reso
lution was in fact illegal to the
extent that its complaint ran
beyond the boundaries of the
A.S.S.IJ. constituency.
Unfortunately, this objection
did not occur to Mr. Couzens in
his capacity of parliamentarian
and legislator extraordinaire
while on the floor of L.A.S.S.U.
Misfortune is compounded by
the publication of Mr. Couzens'
cogent remarks on Tuesday, less
than eight hours after the Presi
dent could have acted on them
and vetoed the resolution.
Mr. Couzens' daring defense
of "the wall" is most amazing in
view of his speech before the
Legislature, May 20th, 196.1. in
which he said: "Resolutions 011
the Free Speech Movement, on
national issues relating 1o edu
cation, might have been daring,
but they might also have won us
the initiative." Mr. Couzens' so
licitude for the injunction
against legislating on off-campus
issues is most touching — but
then, California which produced
"the new IVixon" must certainly
be capable of creating a new
Couzens.
This Tuesday morning quar
terbacking makes me wonder:
just whom is Mike trying to
cozzen?
