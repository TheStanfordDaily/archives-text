## Pre-Big Game Bonfire The Student Body Card 
### Jon Roise 
I have a confession to make.
I burned my student body card
last night. As a matter of fact,
I burned my whole damn wal
let.
Now, it isn't every day that
I do something like this. In fact,
I don't think I've ever done it
before. But I was mad. Morally
indignant. The whole world hat
ed me, and I hated the world.
And there was nothing I could
do about it.
I suppose the final straw was
when the Committee on Univer
sity Policy decided that students
who burn student body cards
should be given -172 corp-yard
hours, or 19 quarters of unsus
pended suspension, or both.
"Student body cards are a priv
ilege and not a rite," President
Sterling announced after the de
cision. That ticked me off.
A Putrid Mixture
But there it is. The curdled
English-Morocco leather is cool
now. And all within it is reduced
to a putrid mixture of melted
plastic and crisp black ash.
Fortunately, my draft card
wasn't inside. It was hanging on
the clothes line, drying out. You
see, it says on the back, "The
law requires you to have this
certificate in your possession at
all times." And the law won't let
you seal it in plastic. And I
really did need a bath. Badly.
So my student body card is
gone. Along wtih my $2 bill from
the University for registering
late. Maybe it was just the
weather that made me do it. The
high pressure area on Inner
Quad. Or maybe it was the two
parking tickets the Stanford
fuzz slipped under my wind
shield wiper last week. But it's
gone.
Gone, too, is my picture of
Elinore. Sweet Elinore. Long
haired Elinore. Dirty-footed Eli
nore. Dirty-minded Elinore. But

I suppose that really isn't too
important anymore. She was de
ported from campus last month
after the Women's Unstanford
like Activities Committee
charged her with being a com
munist for not signing out. She
is gone. And so is her picture.
I'll miss my Social Security
card. Ever since 1 was a fresh
man, I've felt insecure. Especial
ly at social functions and during
finals week. I used to prop that
little card up against my study
lamp, and .just stare at it. It
made me feel better. But no
longer. That's the price one pays
for moral indignily.
Not to mention my Stanford
Bank perpetual calendar, good,
unlike my credit, until 1962. "A
penny saved, a penny earned,"
it admonished but my wallet
was empty, except for a few
five-cent stamps. (They glow in
the dark when they're burned.)
Hard-Core Dupe
And then there was my mem
bership card in the Hard-Core
Young Communist Dupes
League. It had probably expired
anyway. I haven't been duped
since the San Francisco job in
1960. IIUAC paid me for that
one.
Nor, I guess, do I need my
membership card for UNCON
SCIOUS the United National
Committee On National Student
Committees Instituted to Organ
ize Unorganized Students. They
all know who I am. I put. in a
lot of work, helping to organize
it, and they even made me inter
national co-chairman. Certainly
they'll recognize me. I hope.
But somehow, now that it's all
over, 1 don't feel relieved. I'm
still mad, I'm still indignant. I
feel the need to register my de
fiance elsewhere. Mostly, I want
to burn something else. Like au
tomobile registration stickers,
or kiosks, maybe .
