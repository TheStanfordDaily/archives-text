# Debate Over Vietnam Highlights Atrocities
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
South Vietnam is now an "absolute
monarchy without a king," Eisen
hower believed that Ho Chi Minh
would have gotten 80',; of the votes
if an elected were held, and the Viet
Cong are "more than twice as atro
cious" as American forces. •
These and other charges were aired
last night in Roble Hall during a de
bate between the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam and CON
SCIENCE on the subject "Resolved
that the United States should take
measures immediately to withdraw
from Vietnam." More than 100 people
attended.
Taking the affirmative for the
SPCV were Art Zelman. Rich Lenon
and Cyril Sia. Opposing them were
CONSCIENCE members Mike Cum
mings, Hal Scott and Terry Hopmann.
Detrimental To All
Zelman began the debate by charg
ing that "United States presence in
Vietnam is detrimental both to the
Vietnamese people and to our own
interests." He claimed that the insur
rection was a grass-roots movement
begun without Communist support.
Zelman also attacked the State De
partment White Paper, calling North
Vietnamese aid to the rebels "insig
nificant."
The SPCV proposed that the United
States U) stop all bombing immedi
ately, (2) begin fighting a wholly de
fensive war, <3> negotiate with the
Viet. Cong, and <4» make arrange
ments for free elections under UN
supervision.
Answering for CONSCIENCE, Mike
Cummings maintained that the United
States must remain in South Vietnam
because we "oppose all seizures of
land by alien military forces" and
"we must honor our commitments if
we aer to deserve the trust of the rest
of the world."

He remarked thai more Vietnamese
are likely to be killed through V.C.
reprisals than would be if we fought
to a successful peace. "It isn't a ques
tion of kill or not to kill but who gets
killed, by whom and for what.
CONSCIENCE cited an "atrocity in
dex" compiled by Professor Aaron
Wildavsky in which the Viet Cong
rated 8.91 and the Americans 2.38.
Ten is maximum atrocity.
Although Cummings did not deny
that South Vietnam is no democracy,
he asserted "popular governments are
romantic and largely unattainable
goals in underdeveloped countries."

South Vietnam is now an "absolute
monarchy without a king," Eisen
hower believed that Ho Chi Minh
would have gotten 80',; of the votes
if an elected were held, and the Viet
Cong are "more than twice as atro
cious" as American forces. •
These and other charges were aired
last night in Roble Hall during a de
bate between the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam and CON
SCIENCE on the subject "Resolved
that the United States should take
measures immediately to withdraw
from Vietnam." More than 100 people
attended.
Taking the affirmative for the
SPCV were Art Zelman. Rich Lenon
and Cyril Sia. Opposing them were
CONSCIENCE members Mike Cum
mings, Hal Scott and Terry Hopmann.
Detrimental To All
Zelman began the debate by charg
ing that "United States presence in
Vietnam is detrimental both to the
Vietnamese people and to our own
interests." He claimed that the insur
rection was a grass-roots movement
begun without Communist support.
Zelman also attacked the State De
partment White Paper, calling North
Vietnamese aid to the rebels "insig
nificant."
The SPCV proposed that the United
States U) stop all bombing immedi
ately, (2) begin fighting a wholly de
fensive war, <3> negotiate with the
Viet. Cong, and <4» make arrange
ments for free elections under UN
supervision.
Answering for CONSCIENCE, Mike
Cummings maintained that the United
States must remain in South Vietnam
because we "oppose all seizures of
land by alien military forces" and
"we must honor our commitments if
we aer to deserve the trust of the rest
of the world."

He remarked thai more Vietnamese
are likely to be killed through V.C.
reprisals than would be if we fought
to a successful peace. "It isn't a ques
tion of kill or not to kill but who gets
killed, by whom and for what.
CONSCIENCE cited an "atrocity in
dex" compiled by Professor Aaron
Wildavsky in which the Viet Cong
rated 8.91 and the Americans 2.38.
Ten is maximum atrocity.
Although Cummings did not deny
that South Vietnam is no democracy,
he asserted "popular governments are
romantic and largely unattainable
goals in underdeveloped countries."
