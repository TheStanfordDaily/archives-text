# Pearson Calls Johnson Decision To Bomb N. Vietnam 'Disastrous'
## 
### JOE ROSEN BLOOM Associate Editor 
Drew Pearson last night said Presi
dent Johnson's decision to bomb
North Vietnam was a "tragic political
mistake."
Speaking from notes to a respons
ive audience of 400 in Cubberley
Auditorium, the Washington column
ist disclosed "inside" information to
document a tale of United .States
political failures in Vietnam.
He said the decision to begin bomb
ing North Vietnam on February 7
was "disastrous." since it coincided
with Russian Premier Andrei Kosy
gin's visit to Hanoi. Kosygin, he said,
had just returned from Peking where
he had put presurc on the Chinese
to join with Russia in order to bring
about negotiations " to help the
United States out of Vietnam."
Undermines Friendly Feelings
The bombing had the effect of un
dermining the "friendly feelings" that
were increasingly characterizing the
United States-Russian relations, Pear
son said.
Johnson was finally forced to accept
the solution of his military advisors
because he waited too long to begin
negotiations, the syndicated columnist
declared.
"When Johnson was in the middle
of the election, the North Vietnamese
were for peace, but with Goldwater
talking about appeasement, he waited
until after the election to do anything.
Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese
government changed at an average of
once every three weeks, and the North
Vietnamese decided they could win
the war without peace."

Pearson stated that the decision to
bomb North Vietnam was also "dis
astrous" in that it did not stop the
flow of supplies from the North and
ii has "alienated some of our best
friends in Asia.''
"While il is true that we are begin
ning to win the war. we have suffered
a lot of political defeats."
In addition, he warned that if we
follow the advice of the military and
bomb Hanoi and Russian ships in the
port of Haiphong, "it could possibly
lead us to the verge of World War
III."
President Johnson, he said, is sensi
tive about the press, and he "likes to
have a consensus." He praised the
President as a man who knows "when

to use the carrot and when to use
the stick." and a "great salesman."
In a critique of the press, Pearson
warned of an "alliance" betwen mili
tary contractors and the news media.
He cited several corporations such as
Westinghouse and General Electric,
which depend heavily on military con
tracts, as owners of radio and tele
vision stations.
Moreover, he said the "opinion
makers" such as Time magazine have
a monopoly on the news. Time, which
he said had ben an enthusiastic sup
porter of the Vietnam War, also owns
a powerful television station. "This
bloc moulds American opinion more
than you think."
Stroking his white moustache from

time to time. Pearson poked fun at
Presidents Truman and Eisenhower
and Nikita Khrushchev, much to the
crowd's amusement.
Eisenhower, he said, did not at
tempt to manage the news because
he never read the newspaper. And he
admitted that he and Truman "are
more friendly than before, although
there is still plenty of room for im
provement."

He told of an occasion when he had
changed clothes with Khrushchev at
the Russian Premier's swimming
pool.
"Afterwards, my wife asked mi'
what it was like to be all alone with
the head of the Communist world
stark naked."

In a critique of the press, Pearson

He cited several corporations such as
Westinghouse and General Electric,

tracts, as owners of radio and tele

Moreover, he said the "opinion
makers" such as Time magazine have
a monopoly on the news. Time, which
he said had ben an enthusiastic sup
porter of the Vietnam War, also owns
a powerful television station. "This

Presidents Truman and Eisenhower

Eisenhower, he said, did not at

Drew Pearson last night said Presi

North Vietnam was a "tragic political
mistake."

political failures in Vietnam.
He said the decision to begin bomb
ing North Vietnam on February 7
was "disastrous." since it coincided
with Russian Premier Andrei Kosy
gin's visit to Hanoi. Kosygin, he said,
had just returned from Peking where
he had put presurc on the Chinese
to join with Russia in order to bring
about negotiations " to help the
United States out of Vietnam."
Undermines Friendly Feelings
The bombing had the effect of un
dermining the "friendly feelings" that
were increasingly characterizing the
United States-Russian relations, Pear
son said.
Johnson was finally forced to accept
the solution of his military advisors
because he waited too long to begin
negotiations, the syndicated columnist
declared.
"When Johnson was in the middle
of the election, the North Vietnamese
were for peace, but with Goldwater
talking about appeasement, he waited
until after the election to do anything.
Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese
government changed at an average of
once every three weeks, and the North
Vietnamese decided they could win
the war without peace."

Pearson stated that the decision to
bomb North Vietnam was also "dis
astrous" in that it did not stop the
flow of supplies from the North and
ii has "alienated some of our best
friends in Asia.''
"While il is true that we are begin
ning to win the war. we have suffered
a lot of political defeats."
