## Committee To Review Social Regs 
### 
Social regulations specifically con
cerning freshmen will be discussed at
tonight's AWS Social Regulation
Committee meeting. Ellen Cook, chair
man of the group, explained the rea
son for this special meeting, "Fresh
men girls and their sponsors have
presented the most questions, criti
cism, and comments on the new
policies."
The open meeting will be held in
the Florence Moore Conference Room
at 7:00 p.m. Three specific sugges
tions are on the agenda which would

effect the differentiation of 1:30 and
2:30 late leaves, the extension of the
honor code to violation notices, and
the handling of minor infractions.
The first topic, the difference be
tween 1:30 and 2:30 late leaves, was
initiated by the girls' sponsors. Pres
ently, the twenty-five leaves are split
into ten 2:3o's and fifteen l:3o's. The
philosophy behind this ruling, accord
ing to one Roble sponsor, is to provide
a period of adjustment to college for
the freshmen.
The other two topics relate to the
handling of infractions of the social
regulations. Branner sponsors have
suggested that girls be responsible for
their own violation notices. This
would merely extend the honor code
upon which the sign-out procedure is
built. Changes of this nature would
have to have the approval of Women's
Council and would affect all girls'
residences.
Last week the Social Regulations
Committee approved a change in the
open lobby hours of freshmen girls'
dorms. Upon the acceptance of the
director and girls of Branner and Ro
ble, theve dorms will have open lob
bies until midnight each evening.
The nine-member committee: seven
AWS members, one representative of
Women's Council, and one LASSU
representative, encourage any inter
ested freshmen women to attend. El
len Cook implied that any subject
related to the regulations which par
ticularly interests those who attend
could be discussed. "The purpose of
the committee is to make and to in
terpret the regulations and to present
them to all Stanford women."
The LASSU Student Affairs Com
mittee will meet this afternoon in the
LASSU office at Tresidder to discuss
pro and con arguments concerning
the bill introduced last Thursday
night which proposes to transfer the
Social Regulations Committee admin
istration from AWS to LASSU.
The Social Regs Committee itself,
chairmaned by Ellen Cook, opposes
the bill, which was initiated by a
group of women students (including

several freshmen sponsors ) who want
to improve existing committee-student
communication.

into ten 2:3o's and fifteen l:3o's. The
philosophy behind this ruling, accord
ing to one Roble sponsor, is to provide
a period of adjustment to college for
the freshmen.
The other two topics relate to the
handling of infractions of the social
regulations. Branner sponsors have
suggested that girls be responsible for
their own violation notices. This
would merely extend the honor code
upon which the sign-out procedure is
built. Changes of this nature would
have to have the approval of Women's
Council and would affect all girls'
residences.
Last week the Social Regulations
Committee approved a change in the
open lobby hours of freshmen girls'
dorms. Upon the acceptance of the
director and girls of Branner and Ro
ble, theve dorms will have open lob
bies until midnight each evening.
The nine-member committee: seven
AWS members, one representative of
Women's Council, and one LASSU
representative, encourage any inter
ested freshmen women to attend. El
len Cook implied that any subject
related to the regulations which par
ticularly interests those who attend
could be discussed. "The purpose of
the committee is to make and to in
terpret the regulations and to present
them to all Stanford women."
The LASSU Student Affairs Com
mittee will meet this afternoon in the
LASSU office at Tresidder to discuss
pro and con arguments concerning
the bill introduced last Thursday
night which proposes to transfer the
Social Regulations Committee admin
istration from AWS to LASSU.
The Social Regs Committee itself,
chairmaned by Ellen Cook, opposes
the bill, which was initiated by a
group of women students (including

several freshmen sponsors ) who want
to improve existing committee-student
communication.
Social regulations specifically con
cerning freshmen will be discussed at
tonight's AWS Social Regulation
Committee meeting. Ellen Cook, chair
man of the group, explained the rea
son for this special meeting, "Fresh
men girls and their sponsors have
presented the most questions, criti
cism, and comments on the new
policies."
The open meeting will be held in
the Florence Moore Conference Room
at 7:00 p.m. Three specific sugges
tions are on the agenda which would

effect the differentiation of 1:30 and
2:30 late leaves, the extension of the
honor code to violation notices, and
the handling of minor infractions.
The first topic, the difference be
tween 1:30 and 2:30 late leaves, was
initiated by the girls' sponsors. Pres
ently, the twenty-five leaves are split
into ten 2:3o's and fifteen l:3o's. The
philosophy behind this ruling, accord
ing to one Roble sponsor, is to provide
a period of adjustment to college for
the freshmen.
