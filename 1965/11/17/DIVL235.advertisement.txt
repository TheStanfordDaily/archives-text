The Death of God
There is no death like the death of the cross. In agony and bitter pain the
victim dies a slow death of suffocation and exhaustion with the inner horror
of joints ripped loose and blood oozing through torn flesh. To die on a cross
was, in ancient times, to be also subjected to the curse of a despised and vile
form of death reserved for the scum of the earth.
Jesus Christ knew ahead of time he was 16 die the death of the cross. More
than once he revealed the plan of God which he bad come to bring about,
"... we are going to Jerusalem" he said, ' and the son of man will be delivered
to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and
deliver him to the' gentiles; and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and
scourge him, and kill him,- and after three days he will rise . . . for.the Son
of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom
for many" (Mark 1 0:33, 34, 45).
John the Baptist heralded Jesus Christ by saying, "Behold the Lamb of God
who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:1:29), and the Book of the
Revelation, picturing the risen Lord with nail-pierced hands, describes him
as "the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 1 3.8).
The cross of Jesus Christ, no mere passing incident in world history, is an
eternal, cosmic event where the self-giving love of a holy God is revealed.
God is always prepared to suffer and to die for those he loves and His heart
of love finds its deepest expression in the pain and sin which Jesus bore for
you, that you might share his endless life:
' My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me, Why art thou so far from
helping me, from the words of my groaning? Oh my God, I cry by day, but
thou dost not answer,- and by night but find no rest ... I am a worm, and no
man, scorned by men, and despised by the people. All who see me mock at
me, they make mouths at me, they wag their heads ... I am poured out like
water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, it is melted
within my breast; my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue
cleaves to my jaws; thou dost lay me in the dust of death. Yea, dogs are round
about me, a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands
and feet—l can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me,- they divide
my garments among them, and for my raimant they cast lots" (Psalm 22).
What are you doing with Jesus Christ, crucifying him, or serving him?
ignoring him; or permitting him free access to your life?
Jesus Christ, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, loves you.

form of death reserved for the scum of the earth.
Jesus Christ knew ahead of time he was 16 die the death of the cross. More
than once he revealed the plan of God which he bad come to bring about,
"... we are going to Jerusalem" he said, ' and the son of man will be delivered
to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and
deliver him to the' gentiles; and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and
scourge him, and kill him,- and after three days he will rise . . . for.the Son
of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom
for many" (Mark 1 0:33, 34, 45).
John the Baptist heralded Jesus Christ by saying, "Behold the Lamb of God
who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:1:29), and the Book of the
Revelation, picturing the risen Lord with nail-pierced hands, describes him
as "the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 1 3.8).
The cross of Jesus Christ, no mere passing incident in world history, is an
eternal, cosmic event where the self-giving love of a holy God is revealed.
God is always prepared to suffer and to die for those he loves and His heart
of love finds its deepest expression in the pain and sin which Jesus bore for
you, that you might share his endless life:
' My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me, Why art thou so far from
helping me, from the words of my groaning? Oh my God, I cry by day, but
thou dost not answer,- and by night but find no rest ... I am a worm, and no
man, scorned by men, and despised by the people. All who see me mock at
me, they make mouths at me, they wag their heads ... I am poured out like
water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, it is melted
within my breast; my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue
cleaves to my jaws; thou dost lay me in the dust of death. Yea, dogs are round
about me, a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands
and feet—l can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me,- they divide
my garments among them, and for my raimant they cast lots" (Psalm 22).
What are you doing with Jesus Christ, crucifying him, or serving him?
ignoring him; or permitting him free access to your life?
Jesus Christ, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, loves you.

The Death of God
There is no death like the death of the cross. In agony and bitter pain the
victim dies a slow death of suffocation and exhaustion with the inner horror
of joints ripped loose and blood oozing through torn flesh. To die on a cross
was, in ancient times, to be also subjected to the curse of a despised and vile
form of death reserved for the scum of the earth.
