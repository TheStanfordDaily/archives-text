# Grad Students Active In Political Events
## 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE (First in a series 
Few groups emerged from last year's turbid
political arena with more notoriety than the
Graduate Coordinating Committee—the GCC.
It seemed last year to be involved in vir
tually every controversy from judicial reform
to social legs; from Stickney's to the Free
University. In fact, one student during the
ASSU presidential campaign caustically char
acterized the quarter's happenings as "the
GCC revolt."
Accused of being a monolithic radical power
bloc able to sway two-thirds of Legislature
with a mere wave of its charismatic wand,
the GCC nevertheless maintained that it was
indeed a coordinating committee, acting as
a "forum in which Stanford graduate students
can exchange ideas about topics of current
social and political interest."
Whatever the eventual achievements of the
group, its beginnings were modest enough.
According to English T. A. Tom Sherman,
one of t ho first members, the GCC was con
ceived during an informal discussion among
a handful of graduate students shortly after
the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley had
begun to capture banner headlines.
As Ilmar Waldner, a member of that hand
ful. recounts, the sense of the gathering was

that a group should be formed to show sup
port for some of the issues for which the
Berkeley students were fighting.
Press Distortion
It was also felt that the press was heavily
distorting the events on the UC campus and
a need existed for more objective reporting
of the situation.
The idea of such a group spread through
the various graduate schools and on December
8, 1961— the day the Berkeley Academic Sen
ate was meeting to consider the FSM's de
mands about 40 graduate students gathered
in a room in Tresidder for the first meeting
of the groups that was already referring to
itself as the GCC. The name was adopted
more or less by default, Waldner noted. "No
one could really think of anything better to
call it,"he said.
The original purpose of (lie meeting, Sher
man recalls, was to send some sort of com
munication to the U.C. Academic Senate, ex
pressing the GCC's support of many of the
goals and stands of the FSM.
However, by the time of the meeting, the
Senate had already passed a resolution sup
porting the FSM demands by an overwhelm
ing vote, and discussion turned more to the
purpose of the GCC.
It was not decided that the Committee should
not be an ad hoc group addressing itself only

to the Berkeley problem, but rather it should
lie an organization that could "fulfill the need
for a permanent group on the Stanford cam
pus to represent the opinions and interests
of graduate students before the university as
a whole, and the public."

The next day, however, several members
of the U.C. Board of Regents expressed their
opposition to the resolution of the Academic

■h.
Tomorrow night, the Graduate Coordinat
ing Committee, with the Political Union
will sponsor a symposium on "Civil Liber
ties, the War and the Draft."
The symposium will l>e held at 8:0(1 p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium. It will be pre
ceded at 7:i5 by an open meeting of the
GCC.

Senate, and the GCC initiated its first project.
A petition was drawn up supporting the Sen
ate's resolution, and the GCC launched a drive
which attracted more than 1200 student and
200 faculty signatures during fall quarter
dead week and finals week.
The Committee also issued a fact sheet on
the Berkeley sit-ins. and set up a forum to
discuss the affair.

Although the GCC initially concerned itself
almost entirely with the Berkeley uprising, its
intention to become involved in Stanford po
litical affairs was clear from the start. One
of its earliest releases notes that "the GCC
will provide a means of unified action both on
and off campus . .
Sherman observes, "the FSM demonstrated
that students, and especially graduate stu
dents, do have political power to effect change
in the university. The GCC hoped to use its
strength to get students a larger role in man
aging the University and governing their own
affairs, both academic and non-academic."
"One pervading feature of our meetings was
unending discussion of what the GCC should
be doing," Waldner said, "and there was never
really complete agreement."
There was agreement on one course of ac
tion. however. Although the ASSU Constitu
tion provided for graduate representation on
Legislature, only a handful of grads had ever
been interested enough to gain seats. The
GCC therefore decided to press for increased
graduate participation in that body, and in
an open letter, published in Tin- Daily, called
upon graduate students "from all departments
and schools" to seek seats in LASSU. Special
elections were held by the ASSU to select
graduate representatives, and as a result some
38 grads gained seats in Legislature. The

number shortly rose to 50 ol' whom 13 were
GCC members.
Other I'rojerts
A number of other projects were initiated
by the GCC at this time, as well. These in
eluded forums on controversial topics ranging
from U.S. policy in Vietnam to the problems
of migrant workers. There was also a pro
gram of seminars taught by graduate stu
dents and TA's, and a formal criticism of
President Wallace Sterling's State of the Uni
versity address, taking sharp exception with
his stand on the Berkeley sit-ins, among other
things.
Thus, in little more than a month, the GCC
grew from an idea in the minds of a few
graduate students to a large organization,
closely involved with a number of programs,
both within and without the Stanford campus.
However, the event which would catapult
both the GCC and student government as a
whole into the limelight, was already peeking
over the horizon. Darrell Halverson and Nora
Crow were putting the finishing touches 011
a report which was to shake the entire cam
pus, and permanently alter the face of student
government. Tomorrow's story will deal with
the responses of the GCC, both to the initial
controversy and to the multi-faceted questions
which came as a result of it.

Senate had already passed a resolution sup
porting the FSM demands by an overwhelm

purpose of the GCC.
It was not decided that the Committee should
not be an ad hoc group addressing itself only

to the Berkeley problem, but rather it should
lie an organization that could "fulfill the need
for a permanent group on the Stanford cam
pus to represent the opinions and interests
of graduate students before the university as
a whole, and the public."

Tomorrow night, the Graduate Coordinat

Senate, and the GCC initiated its first project.
A petition was drawn up supporting the Sen
ate's resolution, and the GCC launched a drive
which attracted more than 1200 student and
200 faculty signatures during fall quarter
dead week and finals week.
The Committee also issued a fact sheet on
the Berkeley sit-ins. and set up a forum to
discuss the affair.

Although the GCC initially concerned itself
almost entirely with the Berkeley uprising, its
intention to become involved in Stanford po
litical affairs was clear from the start. One
of its earliest releases notes that "the GCC
will provide a means of unified action both on
and off campus . .
Sherman observes, "the FSM demonstrated
that students, and especially graduate stu
dents, do have political power to effect change
in the university. The GCC hoped to use its
strength to get students a larger role in man
aging the University and governing their own
affairs, both academic and non-academic."
"One pervading feature of our meetings was
unending discussion of what the GCC should
be doing," Waldner said, "and there was never
really complete agreement."
There was agreement on one course of ac
tion. however. Although the ASSU Constitu
tion provided for graduate representation on
Legislature, only a handful of grads had ever
been interested enough to gain seats. The
GCC therefore decided to press for increased
graduate participation in that body, and in
an open letter, published in Tin- Daily, called
upon graduate students "from all departments
and schools" to seek seats in LASSU. Special
elections were held by the ASSU to select
graduate representatives, and as a result some
38 grads gained seats in Legislature. The

number shortly rose to 50 ol' whom 13 were
GCC members.
Other I'rojerts
A number of other projects were initiated
by the GCC at this time, as well. These in
eluded forums on controversial topics ranging
from U.S. policy in Vietnam to the problems
of migrant workers. There was also a pro
gram of seminars taught by graduate stu
dents and TA's, and a formal criticism of
President Wallace Sterling's State of the Uni
versity address, taking sharp exception with
his stand on the Berkeley sit-ins, among other
things.
Thus, in little more than a month, the GCC
grew from an idea in the minds of a few
graduate students to a large organization,
closely involved with a number of programs,
both within and without the Stanford campus.
However, the event which would catapult
both the GCC and student government as a
whole into the limelight, was already peeking
over the horizon. Darrell Halverson and Nora
Crow were putting the finishing touches 011
a report which was to shake the entire cam
pus, and permanently alter the face of student
government. Tomorrow's story will deal with
the responses of the GCC, both to the initial
controversy and to the multi-faceted questions
which came as a result of it.
Few groups emerged from last year's turbid
political arena with more notoriety than the
Graduate Coordinating Committee—the GCC.
It seemed last year to be involved in vir
tually every controversy from judicial reform
to social legs; from Stickney's to the Free
University. In fact, one student during the
ASSU presidential campaign caustically char
acterized the quarter's happenings as "the
GCC revolt."
Accused of being a monolithic radical power
bloc able to sway two-thirds of Legislature
with a mere wave of its charismatic wand,
the GCC nevertheless maintained that it was
indeed a coordinating committee, acting as
a "forum in which Stanford graduate students
can exchange ideas about topics of current
social and political interest."
Whatever the eventual achievements of the
group, its beginnings were modest enough.
According to English T. A. Tom Sherman,
one of t ho first members, the GCC was con
ceived during an informal discussion among
a handful of graduate students shortly after
the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley had
begun to capture banner headlines.
As Ilmar Waldner, a member of that hand
ful. recounts, the sense of the gathering was

that a group should be formed to show sup
port for some of the issues for which the
Berkeley students were fighting.
Press Distortion
It was also felt that the press was heavily
distorting the events on the UC campus and
a need existed for more objective reporting
of the situation.
The idea of such a group spread through
the various graduate schools and on December
8, 1961— the day the Berkeley Academic Sen
ate was meeting to consider the FSM's de
mands about 40 graduate students gathered
in a room in Tresidder for the first meeting
of the groups that was already referring to
itself as the GCC. The name was adopted
more or less by default, Waldner noted. "No
one could really think of anything better to
call it,"he said.

Legislature, only a handful of grads had ever
been interested enough to gain seats. The
GCC therefore decided to press for increased
graduate participation in that body, and in
an open letter, published in Tin- Daily, called
upon graduate students "from all departments
and schools" to seek seats in LASSU. Special
elections were held by the ASSU to select
graduate representatives, and as a result some
38 grads gained seats in Legislature. The

number shortly rose to 50 ol' whom 13 were
GCC members.
Other I'rojerts
A number of other projects were initiated
by the GCC at this time, as well. These in
eluded forums on controversial topics ranging
from U.S. policy in Vietnam to the problems
of migrant workers. There was also a pro
gram of seminars taught by graduate stu
dents and TA's, and a formal criticism of
President Wallace Sterling's State of the Uni
versity address, taking sharp exception with
his stand on the Berkeley sit-ins, among other
things.
Thus, in little more than a month, the GCC
grew from an idea in the minds of a few
graduate students to a large organization,
closely involved with a number of programs,
both within and without the Stanford campus.
However, the event which would catapult
both the GCC and student government as a
whole into the limelight, was already peeking
over the horizon. Darrell Halverson and Nora
Crow were putting the finishing touches 011
a report which was to shake the entire cam
pus, and permanently alter the face of student
government. Tomorrow's story will deal with
the responses of the GCC, both to the initial
controversy and to the multi-faceted questions
which came as a result of it.
Few groups emerged from last year's turbid
political arena with more notoriety than the
Graduate Coordinating Committee—the GCC.
It seemed last year to be involved in vir
tually every controversy from judicial reform
to social legs; from Stickney's to the Free
University. In fact, one student during the
ASSU presidential campaign caustically char
acterized the quarter's happenings as "the
GCC revolt."
Accused of being a monolithic radical power
bloc able to sway two-thirds of Legislature
with a mere wave of its charismatic wand,
the GCC nevertheless maintained that it was
indeed a coordinating committee, acting as
a "forum in which Stanford graduate students
can exchange ideas about topics of current
social and political interest."
Whatever the eventual achievements of the
group, its beginnings were modest enough.
According to English T. A. Tom Sherman,
one of t ho first members, the GCC was con
ceived during an informal discussion among
a handful of graduate students shortly after
the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley had
begun to capture banner headlines.
As Ilmar Waldner, a member of that hand
ful. recounts, the sense of the gathering was

that a group should be formed to show sup
port for some of the issues for which the
Berkeley students were fighting.
Press Distortion
It was also felt that the press was heavily
distorting the events on the UC campus and
a need existed for more objective reporting
of the situation.
The idea of such a group spread through
the various graduate schools and on December
8, 1961— the day the Berkeley Academic Sen
ate was meeting to consider the FSM's de
mands about 40 graduate students gathered
in a room in Tresidder for the first meeting
of the groups that was already referring to
itself as the GCC. The name was adopted
more or less by default, Waldner noted. "No
one could really think of anything better to
call it,"he said.
The original purpose of (lie meeting, Sher
man recalls, was to send some sort of com
munication to the U.C. Academic Senate, ex
pressing the GCC's support of many of the
goals and stands of the FSM.
However, by the time of the meeting, the
Senate had already passed a resolution sup
porting the FSM demands by an overwhelm
ing vote, and discussion turned more to the
purpose of the GCC.
It was not decided that the Committee should
not be an ad hoc group addressing itself only

to the Berkeley problem, but rather it should
lie an organization that could "fulfill the need
for a permanent group on the Stanford cam
pus to represent the opinions and interests
of graduate students before the university as
a whole, and the public."

A petition was drawn up supporting the Sen
ate's resolution, and the GCC launched a drive
which attracted more than 1200 student and
200 faculty signatures during fall quarter
dead week and finals week.
The Committee also issued a fact sheet on
the Berkeley sit-ins. and set up a forum to
discuss the affair.

Although the GCC initially concerned itself
almost entirely with the Berkeley uprising, its
intention to become involved in Stanford po
litical affairs was clear from the start. One
of its earliest releases notes that "the GCC
will provide a means of unified action both on
and off campus . .
Sherman observes, "the FSM demonstrated
that students, and especially graduate stu
dents, do have political power to effect change
in the university. The GCC hoped to use its
strength to get students a larger role in man
aging the University and governing their own
affairs, both academic and non-academic."
"One pervading feature of our meetings was
unending discussion of what the GCC should
be doing," Waldner said, "and there was never
really complete agreement."
There was agreement on one course of ac
tion. however. Although the ASSU Constitu
