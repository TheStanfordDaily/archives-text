# Bemudded Booters Fall Before Berkeley Blitz
## 
### TOM EDISON 
, Attempting to recover from a
j -1-0 deficit in the first half, Stan
lord's soccer learn literally fell
lo the University of California,
â€¢1-2, Saturday at Berkeley, in
their final game of the season,
in the face of horrendous game
conditions.
Not only was ihe weather a
factor with neither team able to
secure good footing on the mud
| dy turf, but t lie lights also were
I inadequate. Each contributed to
i a hectic evening for both
squads.
( ill Uses Mud
Cal got off to an early lead
and then proceeded to use the
mud to their advantage. Playing
a defensive game Cal merely

kicked the ball down field and
,let the mud do most of their
work, slowing down and de
stroying any type of offensive
threat the Indians could muster.
The only time ihe Indians did
score was from more than 20
yards out; because of their in
ability to maneuver in front of
Cal's goal.
Free Shot Opens Sewing
The Bears opened the scoring
on a penalty shot and added
three more first-half goals. C'al
evened their scoring out; with
two in the first quarter and two
in the second.
Another of Cal's goals came
off a miscue. A pass from a
Stanford player lo his own
goalie was slightly off its mark

and Iho mud slowed the gonlio
down enough that the ball neat
ly rolled into the Indian goal
for a Cal tally.
Alter the half time break
Stanford completely controlled
ihe contest and set out to erase
their four-point deficit.
Score From Kadi
Stanford's first goal came off
ihc by now soiled and muddy
boot of Karriel Kadi. The score
was set up by a Bill Palmer
pass.
Johny Bradt also penetrated
the Cal goal from nearly 40
yards out but the gallant effort
by the stubborn Indians was not
enough as they suffered their
sixth conference loss.
Stanford .finished .fourth in
the conference with the Univer
sity of San Francisco taking
first with a 7-1 record. USF will
play Aii- Force November 20 for
the right to play in the National
Soccer Championships in St.
Louis.
