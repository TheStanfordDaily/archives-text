## DEFENDING CHAMPS READY Chis Seeded First 
### 
The Sigma Chis exploded for
three touchdowns in the second
half to down the KA's 26-0, end
ing regular season play with a
perfect 5-0 record. The KA's re
lied on its usual powerful de
fense to hold the Chis for all but
the last minute of the first half.
An eight-yard Paul Ha/elrig
pass to Walt Stamm. however,
at this point marked the begin
ning of the KA's end.
The Chis proceeded to put the
game out of reach with two
touchdown passes to Ken Jern
stedt and Jack Owens, plus an
interception runback by Bruce
Hagensen. Jernstedt's reception

was good for all but three yards
of the length of the field. He
was evidently angered because
the KA's had earlier separated
him from one of his beloved con
tact lenses.
Thus the Sigma Chis seem
ready and able to defend their
position as University Champs.
But with playoffs beginning this
week, there stands a formidable
group of contenders standing
between them and the title clash
on December 3.
Stern Tough Too
Both Stern teams are tough,
Burbank rolling to seven victo
ries and no defeats. And after
an initial loss to Burbank, 7-6,
Fremont won its last six games
in convincing fashion. Cuadro
swept all five of its games in
club action and looks ready to
continue its winning ways.
Other top contenders include
the Theta Delts and the Phi
Psis, both winning their respec
tive leagues with perfect five
game records. In League Two
the Phi Delts beat the DU's but
loss to the Phi Kapsâ€”'who did
it the other way around. As soon
as they figure out who is the
best, one of them might cause
some trouble. Soto and Juni
pero, both 4-1, might surprise.
Maybe.
