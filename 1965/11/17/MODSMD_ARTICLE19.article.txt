## 
### 
The rain fell steadily Satur
| day at the Stanford Golf course
| as the Indian harriers trudged
I through a triangular meet
against UCLA and the Univer
sity of California.
Bruins Bob Day and Jeff Pine
apparently took no heed of
dampening effects of the weath
er. matching each other stride
for stride for first place.
The Uelans easily won the
meet with 26 points to Cal's -14
and Stanford's 04.
The first Stanford runner lo
cross the line was sophomore
dependable Alex Whittle, whose
20:44 time over the four-mile
course secured him fourth place.
Whittle appeared to tire in tho
last stages of the race.
The next Stanford finisher
! was Marly Hill with a lime of
! 21:56.
Frosh Successful
More successful were the In
dian frosh, who beat the Cal
; freshmen. 25-30. Mike Ryan cov-
I ered the four miles virtually by
himself, crossing the tape yards
ahead of the pack for the Indi
ans. Ryan's time was 21:09.8,
though he was under no pres
sure.
Wall Johnson and Bob Bukers
secured fourth and fifth place
for the Papooses.
The Indian Harriers are now
training for the West Coast
Championships to be held this
Saturday.
