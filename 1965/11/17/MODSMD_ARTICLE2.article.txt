# '72 Frosh To Live Together
## 
### JOHN BROADWIN 
Backed l»y the successful overseas
campuses experience -where men and
women, living and education, are
housed under one roof-the Univer
sity has given the go-ahead signal to
a pair of new building projects that
will represent a new experience in
coeducational living on the Stanford
campus.
The two new dormitories, to be
called Robert Moore and Margaret
Jacks Halls, will embody two revolu
tionary innovations in Stanford's un
dergraduate housing program. Not
only will the dormitories have coedu
cational dining, recreation and study
facilities, but they will also participate
in the most extensive academic pro
gram ever implemented in a Stanford
living group. One of the units will
have facilities to partially carry the
teaching-for-credit program into the
living unit.
Identical Houses
The two new campus residences will
be practically identical. Each is to be
built on seven and one-half acres. The
two houses will each accommodate
2XO undergraduates, and be divided
into four separate units for 70 stu
dents two for women, two for men—
grouped around a central core build
ing or buildings. This central unit will
house dining facilities, recreational
facilities, a lounge, study, and a guest
in-residence apartment.
While both houses will encompass
the co-educational idea in central din
ing and active-passive recreational
areas, only the Jacks house will be
built to include facilities for the aca
demic program.
Besides rooms for seventy students,
each of the four separate living units
will contain its own lounge and sem
inar room, as well as two tutor's
suites and a faculty residence.
Student rooms will resemble those
of Fraternity Cluster IT. There will
be singles, and two-room suites for
two persons.
Seminar Rooms
In an interview last May. Dean
Wert foresaw the possibility of teach
ing senior colloquia and other small
seminar courses in the seminar rooms
which are planned for each living unit.
"This program seems to be a culmi
nation, a logical conclusion, in the
development of the integration of aca
demic affairs and housing," Dean
Wert stated.
Total cost for the two dormitories
will be $8,."500,000. They will be by far
the most expensive dormitories ever
built at Stanford, but the."560 students
they will house will not live in luxury
any greater than that afforded pres
ent residents of the fraternity clusters.
The building schedule—a tight one
calls for construction to begin about
Spring of 1967, with an activation
date of September 1968.

grouped around a central core build
ing or buildings. This central unit will
house dining facilities, recreational
facilities, a lounge, study, and a guest
in-residence apartment.
While both houses will encompass
the co-educational idea in central din
ing and active-passive recreational
areas, only the Jacks house will be
built to include facilities for the aca
demic program.
Besides rooms for seventy students,
each of the four separate living units
will contain its own lounge and sem
inar room, as well as two tutor's
suites and a faculty residence.
Student rooms will resemble those
of Fraternity Cluster IT. There will
be singles, and two-room suites for
two persons.
Seminar Rooms
In an interview last May. Dean
Wert foresaw the possibility of teach
ing senior colloquia and other small
seminar courses in the seminar rooms
which are planned for each living unit.
"This program seems to be a culmi
nation, a logical conclusion, in the
development of the integration of aca
demic affairs and housing," Dean
Wert stated.
Total cost for the two dormitories
will be $8,."500,000. They will be by far
the most expensive dormitories ever
built at Stanford, but the."560 students
they will house will not live in luxury
any greater than that afforded pres
ent residents of the fraternity clusters.
The building schedule—a tight one
calls for construction to begin about
Spring of 1967, with an activation
date of September 1968.
Backed l»y the successful overseas
campuses experience -where men and
women, living and education, are
housed under one roof-the Univer
sity has given the go-ahead signal to
a pair of new building projects that
will represent a new experience in
coeducational living on the Stanford
campus.
The two new dormitories, to be
called Robert Moore and Margaret
Jacks Halls, will embody two revolu
tionary innovations in Stanford's un
dergraduate housing program. Not
only will the dormitories have coedu
cational dining, recreation and study
facilities, but they will also participate
in the most extensive academic pro
gram ever implemented in a Stanford
living group. One of the units will
have facilities to partially carry the
teaching-for-credit program into the
living unit.
Identical Houses
The two new campus residences will
be practically identical. Each is to be
built on seven and one-half acres. The
two houses will each accommodate
2XO undergraduates, and be divided
into four separate units for 70 stu
dents two for women, two for men—
grouped around a central core build
ing or buildings. This central unit will
house dining facilities, recreational
facilities, a lounge, study, and a guest
in-residence apartment.
