# SAUS And Policy-making
## 
### 
Begun last year as an ambitious attempt to
initiate informal student-faculty discussion on
the meaning of the University community—both
to its members and to the larger society—the
Stanford Association of University Scholars
(SAUS) plans to renew operation tonight.
The concept behind SAUS is sound; however,
wo think much can be done to enhance its func
tion as a practical organization dealing with rele
vant issues confronting the community. Last
year, the membership spent far too much time
time debating along "Who are we? Where are
we?" lines.
It seems to us that the very nature of the or
ganization precludes such a debate. SAUS is a
body comprised of "practicing university schol
ars/' whose membership is thereby limited for
the most part to faculty and students. Its basic
premise is that the University is a "community of
scholars" and that the raison d'etre of Univer
sity policy and structure is to facilitate the at
tainment of this admittingly Utopian ideal.
The debate, therefore, should not be about
"Who are we?", but should concern itself with
what the "community of scholars" can do to les
sen administrative control of the decision-mak
ing process at this University. It is unreal to
argue that the Administration should be elimi
nated and that the resulting "Free University"
is the only way to insure that "depersonaliza
tion" does not eventually transform every stu
dent into an IBM card ready for processing by
faculty computers.
Bureaucracy—expanding bureaucracy—is an
inevitable component of any modern university.
For faculty members and physical facilities re
quire money and coordination. It is only when
those who should be coordinators become the
dominating power in our tripartite system
that the other members—faculty and students
must reassert their age-old right to primacy in
the community's deliberations .
The relevancy of this question is obvious: 0114.'.

need only look to Berkeley to see what can
happen if faculty and students too long abstain
from asserting their right to influence, if not
determine, policy. Such problems as housing,
religion, social and judicial regulations are not
for the alumni and the administration to decide
alone. Those who live here and learn here should
have a voice—a deciding voice—in these deci
sions.
Since the FS\l crisis of last year, students and
faculty have begun to confront the problem.
SAUS will hopefully provide yet another forum
for those vitally affected by university policy
to debate the merits of those policies and make
recommendations for those changes which they
feel are necessary.
