# On Parking
## 
### 
Recent criticisms of parking and road facili
ties point to an increasingly aggravated traffic
problem. With more than 11,000 student and
staff cars registered and only 8,680 parking
places, it is little wonder that tempers flare w hen
drivers circle the block ten times and end up in
a mud flat a mile away .
With parking at a premium, ib would seem
that the entire traffic policy should be re-eval
uated as soon as possible. One area that might
be reviewed is the fact that faculty and staff
members pay no fees for road maintenance and
construction while students are charged SlO an
nually to register their cars.
Staff and faculty cars account for at least half
the traffic ou campus, and they receive priority
in reserved lots. The student fee has been justi
fied by the University as a "tax" 011 those who
benefit the most from traffic facilities. While 110
doubt there are good arguments lor special stall
privileges, the critical parking problem may
make these parking privileges too costly to con
tinue. Ml.
