# RE. OFF-CAMPUS ISSUES
## The 						'Surreptitious' LASSU Campaign 
### JOHN BONINE 
A surreptitious campaign is
being mounted to undermine the
by-law passed by the student
body last spring, limiting the
ASSU to "matters pertaining to
student affairs on the Stanford
campus."
The first open admission of
this intent was made in a Daily
column by Mike Couzens last
week. He claims "there are is
sues outside 'the wall' which
command [LASSU's] attention."
Those who opposed the stu
dent body's position on the off
campus issue last spring have
been devising means of circum
venting the by-law's restrictions
all this quarter. For example,
they proposed that LASSU ap
propriate $50 for a program put
on by a group opposing U.S.
policy in Vietnam. In the end,
the m on e y was channeled
through Political Union, with
some question remaining as to
its legality.
Partisan Ends
A growing effort in this direc
tion can be expected because the
by-law prohibits the GCCers and
their friends from using the stu

dent government for partisan
political ends. As Couzens says
in his artcile, "Legislature has
a plethora of these [borderline
off-campus proposals], to which
it commits entirely too much
time."
Couzens' solution is to make
"procedural reforms" in order
to give LASSU more time to
devote to off-campus issues. His
claim is that the lack of such
reforms, and LASSU's immatu
rity, motivated the student body
in passing the off-campus pro
hibition.
But in truth it was not
LASSU's sluggishness, but the
opposite—its overzealousness in
the political arena — which
aroused opposition.
Those who supported and
passed the "off-campus by-law"
maintain that student govern
ment is uot established for the.
purpose of political lobbying.
Membership in the ASSU is
compulsory, and there exist a
host of voluntary organizations
through which activist students
can promote their individual po
litical causes, without presum
ing to speak for all their fellows.

There arc legitimate spheres
in which LASSU can act; in
these spheres it gains deserved
respect from its constituents.
Open house restrictions, liquor
policy, religious policy — even
discrimination by the draft
against Stanford's foreign cam
pus program—arc examples.
The two alternatives which
LASSU sought to have approved
by the student body last spring
were both overwhelmingly Re
jected, because, regardless of
possible reforms in LASSU, the
students simply do not agree
that off-campus issues "com
mand LASSU's attention."
Men of Good Will
Now it is up to men of good
will within LASSU to resist the
plethora of test cases by which
the GCC and others arc seeking
to undermine that decision.
If Couzens personally felt that
the resolution on the restrictive
ness of draft deferments was in
violation of the by-laws, why did
he wait until it was passed
unanimously (with his support)
before he raised his protest?
After all, conscious violation of

the ASSU by-laws is against the
Fundament al Standard.
If LASSU does not show itself
capable of interior restraint, and
proceeds to abuse its power to
interpret its own by-laws, it may
fiud some students proposing
the creation of an ASSU Court,
specially empowered to review
the constitutionality of LASSU's
actions, similar to that at Cal.
Either that, or some other form
of judicial review, may prove to
be unavoidable.
