## Union Residents-Refuse To Vacate Your Rooms! 
### 
Editor, Tin- Daily:
We should all be grateful that
Mr. Mackenzie "lowers the
boom" on University housing
policy— at the same time that
the Daily lowers into the grave
the coffin of Union Residence.
A grave and gratifying specta
cle indeed!
The Daily seems not really to
understand the Union, or the
housing situation, too well. I
remain unclear how much better
Mr. Mackenzie understands it;
he has been taking an awfully
long time to lower the boom.
The way that the Administra
tion's decision on Union Resi
dence was made is insulting.
That is of little moment; what
is of importance is that an in
jury is done. Free people have
always demanded representa
tion; through representation,
free people insure that "rele
vant issues" are discussed when
decisions are made that affect
their interests. The reason for
representation is not at all pro
cedural; it is to guarantee a cer
tain sort of result.
To exclude students from de
cisions on housing policy is an
oversight; it is another over
sight to set down housing policy
on the basis of space allocation
requirements, but it: is one
which occurred easily in the
case of Union. No representa
tion; no students were consult
ed; decision made on the basis
of blatantly non-relevant cri
teria.
These were oversights, and to
remedy them, both procedural
and substantive as they were,
LASSU called on the Adminis
tration, through the Committee
of Fifteen, to stop the machin
ery until relevant issues had
been considered. The Committee
of Fifteen never bothered to ac
knowledge the charge, although
everyone pretends not to notice
this. Nonetheles, the fact: the
badly - decided Administration
policy still stands; and a major
loss in the substance of student
administration consultation has
come about. Students have bent
like weeping willows in a light
breeze—to accommodate an Ad
ministration plan, the only vir
tue of which is thai it already
exists. Such tractability demon
strates that students are not
taking themselves seriously, and
so are not being taken serious
ly; this is a loss in understand

ing between students and Ad
ministration.
There is, of course, still time
- should Mr. Mackenzie, but
most especially the Union girls,
really "lower the boom" and
actually refuse to cooperate,
and to acquiesce in their own
demise. This sort of thing has
been done before, revolutionary
though it is, and happily it is
the sort of thing that can al
ways be done. The Administra
tion is not the only pressure
group on this campus that can
make decisions.

I do not object to the Stanford
Police ticketing an unregistered
car parked overnight on campus.
I do object to rifling the glove
compartment of a car with
clearly visible California regis
tration, leaving the contents
strewn over the front seat and
floor.

Editor, The Dally:
Pardon tho facts Mr. Tapia,
but il was a Cal student named
Mike Lee who on November J9,
1964 "was arrested when he
took a loaded revolver and
threatened to use it while ex
changing cards for cannons"
during the series of Big Game
R.F.'s last year. He was a fifth
year Senior at the time and was
Secretary-Treasurer of the Cal
Rally Commission.
And furthermore, Mr. Tapia,
what is destructive about, a) the
"Immortal 21's" recapture of the
Axe by disguising themselves as
reporters and using tear gas
flash bulbs in their cameras (we
got the axe back after a twenty
year vacation at Cal), b) replac
ing every Daily Cal with a spe
cial Beat Cal Daily, and e) bor
rowing Cal's Victory cannon
from their Stadium (one lock
damaged) and then one week lat
er borrowing it again from the
fourth floor of their student un
ion (used a key this time). Al
though these student aren't di
rectly related to the classroom,
they seem to be a very practical
exercise in the "real world."

Contrary to popular opinion,
all freshmen girls do not have
dates to Big Game. At last
count, 187 dollies were without
the above-stated necessity. (Get

tickets, we have the time, we
sit next to you in Civ and En
glish. Apply today.

Pardon tho facts Mr. Tapia,
but il was a Cal student named
Mike Lee who on November J9,
1964 "was arrested when he
took a loaded revolver and
threatened to use it while ex
changing cards for cannons"
during the series of Big Game
R.F.'s last year. He was a fifth
year Senior at the time and was
Secretary-Treasurer of the Cal
Rally Commission.
And furthermore, Mr. Tapia,
what is destructive about, a) the
"Immortal 21's" recapture of the
Axe by disguising themselves as
reporters and using tear gas
flash bulbs in their cameras (we
got the axe back after a twenty
year vacation at Cal), b) replac
ing every Daily Cal with a spe
cial Beat Cal Daily, and e) bor
rowing Cal's Victory cannon
from their Stadium (one lock
damaged) and then one week lat
er borrowing it again from the
fourth floor of their student un
ion (used a key this time). Al
though these student aren't di
rectly related to the classroom,
they seem to be a very practical
exercise in the "real world."

We should all be grateful that
Mr. Mackenzie "lowers the
boom" on University housing
policy— at the same time that
the Daily lowers into the grave
the coffin of Union Residence.
A grave and gratifying specta
cle indeed!
The Daily seems not really to
understand the Union, or the
housing situation, too well. I
remain unclear how much better
Mr. Mackenzie understands it;
he has been taking an awfully
long time to lower the boom.
The way that the Administra
tion's decision on Union Resi
dence was made is insulting.
That is of little moment; what
is of importance is that an in
jury is done. Free people have
always demanded representa
tion; through representation,
free people insure that "rele
vant issues" are discussed when
decisions are made that affect
their interests. The reason for
representation is not at all pro
cedural; it is to guarantee a cer
tain sort of result.
To exclude students from de
cisions on housing policy is an
oversight; it is another over
sight to set down housing policy
on the basis of space allocation
requirements, but it: is one
which occurred easily in the
case of Union. No representa
tion; no students were consult
ed; decision made on the basis
of blatantly non-relevant cri
teria.
These were oversights, and to
remedy them, both procedural
and substantive as they were,
LASSU called on the Adminis
tration, through the Committee
of Fifteen, to stop the machin
ery until relevant issues had
been considered. The Committee
of Fifteen never bothered to ac
knowledge the charge, although
everyone pretends not to notice
this. Nonetheles, the fact: the
badly - decided Administration
policy still stands; and a major
loss in the substance of student
administration consultation has
come about. Students have bent
like weeping willows in a light
breeze—to accommodate an Ad
ministration plan, the only vir
tue of which is thai it already
exists. Such tractability demon
strates that students are not

Editor, Tin- Daily:
We should all be grateful that
Mr. Mackenzie "lowers the
boom" on University housing
policy— at the same time that
the Daily lowers into the grave
the coffin of Union Residence.
A grave and gratifying specta
cle indeed!
The Daily seems not really to
understand the Union, or the
housing situation, too well. I
remain unclear how much better
Mr. Mackenzie understands it;
he has been taking an awfully
long time to lower the boom.
The way that the Administra
tion's decision on Union Resi
dence was made is insulting.
That is of little moment; what
is of importance is that an in
jury is done. Free people have
always demanded representa
tion; through representation,
free people insure that "rele
vant issues" are discussed when
decisions are made that affect
their interests. The reason for
representation is not at all pro
cedural; it is to guarantee a cer
tain sort of result.
To exclude students from de
cisions on housing policy is an
oversight; it is another over
sight to set down housing policy
on the basis of space allocation
requirements, but it: is one
which occurred easily in the
case of Union. No representa
tion; no students were consult
ed; decision made on the basis
of blatantly non-relevant cri
teria.
These were oversights, and to
remedy them, both procedural
and substantive as they were,
LASSU called on the Adminis
tration, through the Committee
of Fifteen, to stop the machin
ery until relevant issues had
been considered. The Committee
of Fifteen never bothered to ac
knowledge the charge, although
everyone pretends not to notice
this. Nonetheles, the fact: the
badly - decided Administration
policy still stands; and a major
loss in the substance of student
administration consultation has
come about. Students have bent
like weeping willows in a light
breeze—to accommodate an Ad
ministration plan, the only vir
tue of which is thai it already
exists. Such tractability demon
strates that students are not
taking themselves seriously, and
so are not being taken serious
ly; this is a loss in understand

ing between students and Ad
ministration.
There is, of course, still time
- should Mr. Mackenzie, but
most especially the Union girls,
really "lower the boom" and
actually refuse to cooperate,
and to acquiesce in their own
demise. This sort of thing has
been done before, revolutionary
though it is, and happily it is
the sort of thing that can al
ways be done. The Administra
tion is not the only pressure
group on this campus that can
make decisions.

I do object to rifling the glove

Editor, The Dally:
Pardon tho facts Mr. Tapia,
but il was a Cal student named
Mike Lee who on November J9,
1964 "was arrested when he
took a loaded revolver and
threatened to use it while ex
changing cards for cannons"
during the series of Big Game
R.F.'s last year. He was a fifth
year Senior at the time and was
Secretary-Treasurer of the Cal
Rally Commission.
And furthermore, Mr. Tapia,
what is destructive about, a) the
"Immortal 21's" recapture of the
Axe by disguising themselves as
reporters and using tear gas
flash bulbs in their cameras (we
got the axe back after a twenty
year vacation at Cal), b) replac
ing every Daily Cal with a spe
cial Beat Cal Daily, and e) bor
rowing Cal's Victory cannon
from their Stadium (one lock
damaged) and then one week lat
er borrowing it again from the
fourth floor of their student un
ion (used a key this time). Al
though these student aren't di
rectly related to the classroom,
