### SUE DONNELLY 
Professor St. Clair Drake, empha
sizing broad historical concepts and
cross-cultural perspectives, spoke on
"Race in Society—Changing World
Problems" at the Tuesday Evening
Series last night.
Dr. Drake is a co-author of a study
of Negro life in a northern American
city. Black Metropolis.
Drake pointed out that race is a
relatively recent critereon in societal
relations. Paintings from the ancient
Middle East and Mediterranean world
show appreciation of racial differences
but lack of color prejudice.
New Slavery
He said that New World slavery,
with its sharp color contrast, first af
fixed connotations of status to color
and facial features.
The theory of racial superiority de
veloped further as a defense of slavery
against the Abolitionists, he contin
ued.
"Nationalism rather than racism is
generally tho organizing principle in
international politics," he said "Rac
ism has proven ineffective."

He pointed out that during World
War II the Japanese were first refer
red to as the "Yellow Peril" and later
became allies of the United States.
Paradoxically, the Chinese Com
munists and the Pan-African Move
ment are now trying to evoke racial
sentiment, he commented.
He said that Americans have not yet
decided their place between the ex
tremes of racial relations as exempli
fied by biological amalgamation of
Brazil and apartheid of South Africa.
Science has disproved the Racists'
theory of biological inferiority, Dr.
Drake concluded. "Racism now only ;i
cheap explanation for the preserva
tion of social status."
