# The 						Definitive Gaieties

### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Those who go to the 1060 Big Game
Gaieties expecting Ram's Head's tra
ditional dramatically lightweight and
structurally ramshackle offering are
in for a rude shock. "Blue and Gold
Finger" is a convincingly plotted,
tightly directed musical comedy-drama
whose crowning glory is a superb
score always competently, and some
limes even superbly, sung.
Consider the plot: Predictably, the
Cal subversives (operating under code
name WIMP, led by the mastermind
computer Cassius Com, and materi
ally assisted by ace agent Lotta Love,
have done something dreadful to that
groat Stanford symbol, Hoover Tow
er. Worse, Anita, chairwoman of
BARF, the LASSU committee respon
sible for preventing such things, is
ahoul to get fired.
Stiidlincss
But .Jim Bond, an off-campus man
described rather obliquely by one coed
as having had studliness "thrust upon
him," as opposed to those who are
born to it or merely achieve it, offers
to help. He exercises his not inconsid
erable charm on Lotta Love, seduces
Cassius Corn's whereabouts out of
her. sneaks off to WIMP headquar
ter- m search ol a paint-remover
formula, and, naturally, "ei- himself
.ill Lotta captuied.

But Bond, ever ingenious, wipes
Com out by erasing his tapes, rushes
back to Stanford, and restores old
Hoo Tow just iti time for the finale.
Into this sturdy framework, Mel
Cole and Joel Mills, who wrote the
book, have put some fairly serious
moments as well as the usual satiric
ones. In fact, the spoofing is limited
mostly to perennial Big Game jokes,
to dialogue aimed at making Bond
sound like a pompous ass when he
isn't acting like a fifth-rate stage
lover, and to burlesqued gimmicks
from "Goldfinger."
Equal Time
Equal time is given to Harry Byrd
• the naive turkey personified) in his
pursuit of sophistication and con
scientious Anita. And it is this bal
ance of the serious and the comic,
in conjunction with the score, that
makes Gaieties so indestructibly
professional.
Which brings up Gary Levinson,
who wrote the music and collaborated
with Joel Mills on the lyrics. It would
seem that Stanford has in its midst
a composer oi no small genius; not
only has he written some beautiful
songs for his characters and a group
of snappy production numbers 'in
cluding a brilliant quasi-sacred dirge
on I loovcr Tower) for the chorus, but
he also has composed a score for the
owlie>u<j that olten make.-, the pu

as much a focus of interest as the
stage.
Onstage, competing for top honors
arc Susan Holmes, who is a knockout
visually as Lot la Love, and who is
equally at home belting out a gravelly
throated "Just Put Your Faith in Me"
or being lyrical in a love song; David
Miller, who puts some style into Har
ry Byrd and succeeds in making him
pathetic instead of merely ridiculous,
and who sings the lxvst number in the
whole show, "There's Been a Change
in Me*'; Gretehcn Diebenkorn as
Anita, who acts and sings extremely
well, but whose voice sometimes
doesn't carry over the footlights; and
John Harris, whose Bond is suave
enough but who also lias trouble with
some .of his songs.
Shocking < horns
But the chorus (under Kichard
Grant's directiont provides tin- real
shocker: for the first time in years
it is both audible and coordinated.
Elsewhere. Errol Gay has the orches
tra firmly in hand. John Pasqualetti's
costumes are subtly satiric and in one
case literally stunning, and Robert
Sevra's direction is both imaginative
and spirited enough to keep the show
rolling in spite of some awkward
moments.
