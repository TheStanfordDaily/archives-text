This is Jaguar for men. After-shave and cologne com
bined. Women like it. Because it doesn't smell like the
stuff they wear. Men like it. Because it comes on stronger.
Stays on longer. Jaguar is lusty. Powerful. Potent. It's
bottled in a stark, strong, smoky-glass cylinder. It's only
for the man who gets a bang out of living,a charge
out of leading-who plays to win, whatever the game.
After-shave/cologne, $ 3.50. Soap on a rope, $ 2.50.
Gift soap, box of 3, 5 3.00. Jaguar fromYardfey.
