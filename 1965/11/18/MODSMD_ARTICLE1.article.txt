# Free Worship Would Create Campus Ties
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
(Eighth in a series)
To force students to worship off
campus is to force them to make the
central witness to their faith in a
community with which they do not
identify. They are forced to consider
their commitment in religion as some
tiling extracurricular and separate
from the university environment in
which they live.
These are the views of the students
on the ASSU President's Advisory
Committee on Religion. They ex
pressed eai lier this week, besides their
belief in the right of on-campus de
nominational worship, tiie hope that
students will be involved in the formu
lation of religious programs.
"Opinion is not unanimous, but
there is a large segment of the Uni

versity for whom the right of free
dom of worship is important," Dennis
Hot bar, head of the UCCM student
steering committee, said.
Two Reasons
"People usually cite two reasons
for the desirability of freedom of
worship," added Margie Geib, New
man President. "On the practical lev
el, it is a great inconvenience to have
to attend church two miles away. But
mare importantly one should be able
to identify religious aspects of his
life with the community he lives in."
"Much of the significance of wor
ship is lost if it is done in a commu
nity separate from one tlfe student
lives in the other six days a week,"
Rothar stated. "But freedom of wor
ship is also important for the overall
religious tenor of the campus."
"It is tragic that it has come to this

state of affairs; so basic a right
should have been instuted with no
problem," said Irv Shapiro of Hillel.
Citing the views of Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown, the students called
for further movement in the direction
ol' religious programs which "confront
the entire campus with the religious
option and the religious approach to
contemporary problems."
"The gift of Mr. Berry (which earns
about $30,1)00 a year income) for the
'expansion of Memorial Church and
related activities' provides an excel
lent opportunity to expand religious
programs to benefit non-aligned, as
well as the committed people," Rothar
said.
Involvement
"Students should be involved in the
formulation of the definition of reli
gious activities now being done by

the President's Advisory Committee
on Religious Activities," stated Miss
Geib, "both because students are ob
viously so directly involved in the
activities being considered by this
Committee and because this type of
cooperative effort could lead to a
permanent incorporation of student
initativc in the planning of religious
programs."
i See article below for President
Sterling's announcement regarding
adding three students to the Commit
tee. i
"We have been amazed at the uni
versally open response to our efforts,"
she continued. "Everyone has been
interested that studerlts are concerned
about religion and that they are tak
ing action."
"A group of us visited the chap
lains' meeting last week to talk about

freedom of worship. We got the feel
ing that they were really listening
to what we had to say and that we
have a part in what is going on." she
said.
Work of the student committee so
far has consisted in the drafting of
the "freedom of worship" resolution
passed with one dissenting vote by
LASSU last week and the preliminary
formulation of a definition of the na
ture and scope of religious activities.
"The resolution was intended to
demonstrate to the Trustees the wide
support in the denominational groups,
the ministers, and the non-affiliated
for freedom of worship," stated Clark
Brown, ASSU Vice President.
(The resolution urge* that the
Trustees "change the present policy
to recognize the right of freedom of
worship for all groups," because "the

existing rules prohibiting worship are
an unreasonable abridgment of the
right to free religious expression and
are, further, in conflict with the spirit
of the present [cooperative] Univer
sity religious program."*
Sounding Board
Brown expressed the hope that the
student committee could work "as
more than just a sounding board of
student opinion for the President's
Committee. I would hope the commit
tee could be given a special area of
competence and responsibility such as
the planning of a series of forums
and workshops confronting the entire
community with ethical and religious
problems," he said.
"Resolution of the worship ques
tion," he concluded, "is the catalyst
for expansion of the whole scope of
religious programs."

worship," added Margie Geib, New
man President. "On the practical lev
el, it is a great inconvenience to have
to attend church two miles away. But
mare importantly one should be able
to identify religious aspects of his
life with the community he lives in."
"Much of the significance of wor
ship is lost if it is done in a commu
nity separate from one tlfe student
lives in the other six days a week,"
Rothar stated. "But freedom of wor
ship is also important for the overall
religious tenor of the campus."
"It is tragic that it has come to this

state of affairs; so basic a right
should have been instuted with no
problem," said Irv Shapiro of Hillel.
Citing the views of Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown, the students called
for further movement in the direction
ol' religious programs which "confront
the entire campus with the religious
option and the religious approach to
contemporary problems."
"The gift of Mr. Berry (which earns
about $30,1)00 a year income) for the
'expansion of Memorial Church and
related activities' provides an excel
lent opportunity to expand religious
programs to benefit non-aligned, as
well as the committed people," Rothar
said.
Involvement
"Students should be involved in the
formulation of the definition of reli
gious activities now being done by

the President's Advisory Committee
on Religious Activities," stated Miss
Geib, "both because students are ob
viously so directly involved in the
activities being considered by this
Committee and because this type of
cooperative effort could lead to a
permanent incorporation of student
initativc in the planning of religious
programs."
i See article below for President
Sterling's announcement regarding
adding three students to the Commit
tee. i
"We have been amazed at the uni
versally open response to our efforts,"
she continued. "Everyone has been
interested that studerlts are concerned
about religion and that they are tak
ing action."
"A group of us visited the chap
lains' meeting last week to talk about

freedom of worship. We got the feel
ing that they were really listening
to what we had to say and that we
have a part in what is going on." she
said.
Work of the student committee so
far has consisted in the drafting of
the "freedom of worship" resolution
passed with one dissenting vote by
LASSU last week and the preliminary
formulation of a definition of the na
ture and scope of religious activities.
"The resolution was intended to
demonstrate to the Trustees the wide
support in the denominational groups,
the ministers, and the non-affiliated
for freedom of worship," stated Clark
Brown, ASSU Vice President.
(The resolution urge* that the
Trustees "change the present policy
to recognize the right of freedom of
worship for all groups," because "the

existing rules prohibiting worship are
an unreasonable abridgment of the
right to free religious expression and
are, further, in conflict with the spirit
of the present [cooperative] Univer
sity religious program."*
Sounding Board
Brown expressed the hope that the
student committee could work "as
more than just a sounding board of
student opinion for the President's
Committee. I would hope the commit
tee could be given a special area of
competence and responsibility such as
the planning of a series of forums
and workshops confronting the entire
community with ethical and religious
problems," he said.
"Resolution of the worship ques
tion," he concluded, "is the catalyst
for expansion of the whole scope of
religious programs."
(Eighth in a series)
To force students to worship off
campus is to force them to make the
central witness to their faith in a
community with which they do not
identify. They are forced to consider
their commitment in religion as some
tiling extracurricular and separate
from the university environment in
which they live.
These are the views of the students
on the ASSU President's Advisory
Committee on Religion. They ex
pressed eai lier this week, besides their
belief in the right of on-campus de
nominational worship, tiie hope that
students will be involved in the formu

"The gift of Mr. Berry (which earns
about $30,1)00 a year income) for the
'expansion of Memorial Church and
related activities' provides an excel
lent opportunity to expand religious
programs to benefit non-aligned, as
well as the committed people," Rothar
said.
Involvement
"Students should be involved in the
formulation of the definition of reli
gious activities now being done by

the President's Advisory Committee
on Religious Activities," stated Miss
Geib, "both because students are ob
viously so directly involved in the
activities being considered by this
Committee and because this type of
cooperative effort could lead to a
permanent incorporation of student
initativc in the planning of religious
programs."

Sterling's announcement regarding
adding three students to the Commit
tee. i
"We have been amazed at the uni
versally open response to our efforts,"
she continued. "Everyone has been
interested that studerlts are concerned
about religion and that they are tak
ing action."
"A group of us visited the chap
lains' meeting last week to talk about

freedom of worship. We got the feel
ing that they were really listening
to what we had to say and that we
have a part in what is going on." she
said.
Work of the student committee so
far has consisted in the drafting of
the "freedom of worship" resolution
passed with one dissenting vote by
LASSU last week and the preliminary
formulation of a definition of the na
ture and scope of religious activities.
"The resolution was intended to
demonstrate to the Trustees the wide
support in the denominational groups,
the ministers, and the non-affiliated
for freedom of worship," stated Clark
Brown, ASSU Vice President.
(The resolution urge* that the
Trustees "change the present policy
to recognize the right of freedom of
worship for all groups," because "the

existing rules prohibiting worship are
an unreasonable abridgment of the
right to free religious expression and
are, further, in conflict with the spirit
of the present [cooperative] Univer
sity religious program."*
Sounding Board
Brown expressed the hope that the
student committee could work "as
more than just a sounding board of
student opinion for the President's
Committee. I would hope the commit
tee could be given a special area of
competence and responsibility such as
the planning of a series of forums
and workshops confronting the entire
community with ethical and religious
problems," he said.
"Resolution of the worship ques
tion," he concluded, "is the catalyst
for expansion of the whole scope of
religious programs."
