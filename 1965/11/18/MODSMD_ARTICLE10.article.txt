# '66 Gives Heritage Donation
## 
### 
The Class of '6G will be the twelfth
senior class to give the University
scholarship money as its class gift.
The money will be placed in the Heri
tage Fund.
The Heritage Fund was founded in
1955 as a perpetuating Senior Class
gift to the University. The monies do
nated by local businessmen and
friends are used for scholarships for
freshmen and sophomores who have
demonstrated leadership abilities and
financial need.
The applicants' studies are of im
portance and consideration is also
based upon his participation in extra
curricular activities. The scholarships
help those students whose high school
records indicate promise for them as
business and community leaders of
tomorrow.
Since the Fund's initiation, $146,154
worth of scholarships have been
awarded to 110 outstanding young
men and women. Included within this
group area research engineer, a mem
ber of the Dean of Men's staff at
Stanford, a Peace Corps volunteer,
an attorney, a doctor, a grade-school
teacher, and many others
This year a goal of $25,000 has been
set by the Fund. The amount is both
realistic and necessary. It is realistic
because of the increased interest of
local businessmen and friends in such
a scholarship program. It is necessary
because there are insufficient funds
to provide financial aid to promising
students, and because there has also
been a 25 per cent increase in tuition
over 1960. Tuition charges arc cur
rently $525 per quarter.
Interviews for the Heritage Fund
will be held today from 3:00-6:00 p.m.
in Tresidder 269.
