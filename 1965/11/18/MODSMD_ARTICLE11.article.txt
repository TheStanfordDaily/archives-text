CHICAGO â€” William D. Eekert,
a 56-year-old retired Air Force
general and Wahsington busi
ness executive, became base
ball's fourth commissioner Wed
nesday, succeeding Ford Frick
who is retiring.
The club owners, acting on the
unanimous recommendation of a
screening commit tee, also select
ed Lee MacPhail, president of
ihe Baltimore Orioles, as an ad
ministrator in the commission
er's office. It is a new position
in the new cabinet-type of base
ball government.
Eekert, a former high school
first baseman at Madison, lnd.,
agreed to a seven-year contract
at $65,000 a year plus expenses.
''I would like to schedule a
fast tour to met with the presi
dent of the American and Na
tional Leagues, and as many

owners as possible throughout
the nation before the December
league meetings in Miami." said
Eekert.
The owners had been expect
ed to name the new commission
er at the Florida meetings, but
obviously the screening commit
tee, headed by John Fetzer, pres
ident of the Detroit Tigers,
found its man quicker than had
been anticipated. They had been
searching for Prick's successor
for more than a year because
Frick, soon to be 71, said some
time ago he would not serve a
third term.
Eekert did not make any im
mediate announcement as to
whether he would continue the
commissioner's office in New
York or move it elsewhere. The
owners decided some time ago
to house all baseball officials in
one office. No site was named.
Although Eekert was not ac
tive on a varsity level in major
sports at West Point, from
which lie was graduated in 1930,
he was known as one of the
most sports-minded officers in
the service.
It is reasonable to expect that
ihe new commissioner will be
most active in representing base
ball to the general public with
MacPhail. who came up through
the New York Yankee organi
zation before he moved to Balti
more in 1958, handling ihe de
tails of baseball business.
Eekert became the fourth
commissioner, following in the
line that started with the late
Judge Kenesaw Mountain Lan
dis who was picked in 1921 'at
the time of the Black Sox scan
dal.
Albert B. (Happy) Chandler,
then a U.S. senator from Ken
tucky, succeeded Landis a year
after his death in 1944 and
Frick, former newspaper man
and National League president
and publicity man, was elected
for his first of two terms in
1951.
Other departments in the
commissioner's cabinet, Mac-
Phail said, would encompass
player affairs, public informa
tion. broadcasting and amateur
baseball which would include
Little League, American Legion,
high school and college baseball.
