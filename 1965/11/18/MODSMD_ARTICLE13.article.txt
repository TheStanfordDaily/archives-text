This week finds three top
college games which will decide
the Ivy title, the AAWU Rose
Bowl representative, and the
mythical national championship.
As before throughout the toot
ball season, Associated Press
Sports Writer Will Grimsley has
stuck his neck out on a few oc
casions.
Crystal balls, slide rules, ouija
boards, coffee grounds and
witches' brew--forget them all
this week when only fire and
flint decide championship foot
ball games and traditional ri
valries.
One bound of the ball could
decide any one of the four big
ones, but our vote on little more
than a hunch goes to Notre
Dame, UCLA, Arkansas and
Dartmouth.
The features:
Stanford 22, California 14:
Indians go hunting for Golden
Bears and bring back some glit
tering scalps.
Notre Dame 21, Michigan St.
IS: The Spartans have the su
perior air game with quarter
back Steve Juday and Gene
Washington but the Irish's pow
erful infantrymen — Bill Wolski,
Larry Conjar, Nick Eddy and
Bill Zelch — upset the nation's
No. 1 power.
UCLA 25, Southern California
20: A slight nod to young Gary
Beban over Mike Garrett, the
country's top rusher.
Arkansas 22, Texas Tech 14;
The Razorbacks pour their souls
and muscles into this windup
game.
Dartmouth 15, Princeton 8:
Two of the country's highest
scoring elevens go to the mat in

a rugged defensive duel, and j
this is where the Indians are at
their best.
Harvard 10, Yale 7: For the
men of the Crimson and the j
Blue, ihere is no oilier game but
this.
Nebraska 28, Oklahoma T: The
Cornhuskers, given a lease on
life a week ago, complete their
perfect season on Thanksgiving
Day.
Kentucky 21, Tennessee 7:
One of Dixie's great rivalries
ihe Volunteers can't get up after
their first defeat last week.
