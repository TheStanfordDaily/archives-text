# INTRIGUE APLENTY
## Red-hot Frosh Foil Cal RF Plans 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Invading Berkeley Tuesday
night, two groups of Stanford
freshmen gained valuable access
to Cal's plans for Big Game
RF's and defense against Stan
ford's.
One freshman posed as a Cal
student and sat in on a Rally
Commission meeting, while the
other group talked with a UC
policeman. In addition, a "Beat.
Cal" sign and several large red
"S's" were left on the campus.
Three K's Penetrate
Mitt Romney, Paul Richard
son, and Mike Roarke set out at
about ."> p.m. with the intention
of finding out the strength of
the Cal defense. Romney, head
of the Stanford special police
force, first entered the Cal un
ion under the guise of a Cal
student looking for "Beat Stan
ford" signs. He was told they
were being handed out at a
meeting of Rally Comm. the UC
equivalent of Axe Comm.
Rally Comm was in ihc pro
cess of discussing a plan to paint
Hoover Tower with blue paint
bombs. Giving his name as Tim
Yenmor, a Cal student who had
studied Stanford defense while
ailending the UCLA game, Rom
ney offered an alternative plan:
stealing the wheel for the Stan
ford cannon. The wheel could
then be "decorated" and brought
onto the field at half time to
embarrass Stanford.
Romney explained that the
cannon was kept in four parts
with the wheel in the Band
Shack. The wheel, he told Rally
Comm, could easily be taken by
three or four people. Actually,
the whole cannon is kept in a
Bank of America vault, and
twenty students are guarding
the Band Shack.
Romney's supposition was
that Cal students would attempt
the theft about 4:30 this morn
ing.
In addition, he learned of
other planned RF's, including
putting bumper stickers on cars

and windows about 6 p.m., when
most students are expected to
be in dining halls.
Kieliurdsnn Â»Jnsuccessful
While Romnej was presenting
his "plan" to Rally Comm. Rich
ardson listened in on a similar
meeting in Sproul Ilall. He was
unable to hear any specific
plans, however.
According to Romney, "Wo
learned all their plans. Even if
they found out wo were from
Stanford, we still have the ad
vantage. They will either have
to change their plans or risk
being caught." Romney has ar
ranged for students to guard the

parking lots during the dinner
hour.
The second group, twelve
freshmen from Wilbur, attempt
ed an RF they had been plotting
for weeks decorating Cal's
Sat her Gate, the main gate to
the university, with a "Beat Cal"
banner. The sign had been
soaked in cement which, once
hardened, would bo virtually in
destructible. The group had
made elaborate rope ladders and
had rehearsed the RF at the
Stanford baseball diamond.
When they readied the gate,
however, they found it closely
guarded. The banner was hung

instead on the wall of the track
stadium.
Three Recognized
While on the Berkeley cam
pus, three of the twelve frosh
were recognized as Stanford stu
dents. A policeman warned
them that they could not pierce
Cal's tight defense system. He
said that for the first lime in
several years a student police
force of fifty or sixty people had
been organized to guard the
campus, and individuals were
posted on all sides of the cam
pus.
The officer then proceeded to
give elaborate descriptions of

Iho cars used, the two-way
"walkie-talkie" system, and the
plans for hiding guards at stra
tegic points throughout the cam
pus.
Yesterday a Daily staffer,
posing as a Daily ('alifomiau
reporter, interviewed Frederick
Ever of the Rally Comm. Ever
informed him of other Stanford
RF's including an "S" painted
on the gymnasium and red dye
thrown in Ludwig's fountain, lie
reported that a Stanford stu
dent had been caught wading in
the fountain to spread the paint.
Ever guaranteed that "Tonight
this won't happen."
