## Legislator Quits—'Theatrics' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Last Thursday at the LASSU
meeting Carl Anderson quoted
Mick Lernei 's campaign speech
of May 20, 196i5 for speaker of
the Legislature: "There is no
question in my mind that the
most serious threat to the effect
iveness |of the Legislature! is
a continuous lack of support
from the student body . . . We
are regarded with suspicion and
derision . . . Ask yourselves why
the student body apparently
does not trust us to represent
it. Ask whether LASSU has any
authority whatsoever without
the confidence and support, of
the students."
1 would like to add a state
ment from Mike Couzen's speech
of the same evening: "The only
aspect of Legislature which
makes us an attractive avenue is
our own prestige."
Further, from Jay Kadane's
speech: "If wo are going to keep
the Legislature going, people

have to enjoy meetings and be
willing to come."
My first contact with the Leg
islature came this year after
1 successfully conducted a cam
paign for the office of represen
tative in my constituency t\Vil
bur-Otero). 1 have seen what I
think the above speakers were
getting at. There is no doubt
that the Legislature is held in
questionable esteem even by the
members, let alone by the stu
dent body.
The apathy on the part of the
students is understandable,
especially among those who have
attended meetings. What they
have seen is a show of "Robert's
Rules theatrics." What they have
seen is a decidedly small, but
nevertheless effective group of
members more concerned with
protecting some often fictional
rights on the basis that. "Rob
ert's Rules says ..." What they
have seen is two meetings in a
row being adjourned for lack of
a quorum (.">2 at the last meet
ing).
How could the people who visit
help but become apathetic to
ward such a pathetic show? I
suggest that if the Legislature

Tbe Daily is liappy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
ever, letters should not exceed
.S(M) words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on fio •space
I hies and double-spaced.

ever hopes to become respected
and effective it must first gain
the respect of its own members.
To tlo this a basic change in
attitude toward the goals of the
Legislature may be necessary on
the part of all members. Only
then could it conceivably become
respected among the students.
I hope each member will ask
himself why he is there. 1 hope
he will stop wasting the time of
the other members and start try
ing to do things besides yelling,
"Point of Order!" I hope he will
start to respect the Legislature
and spread its effectiveness.
As for me. I can find more
useful things to do in the time
I have been spending in LASSU.
That is why I have resigned the
post.

Editor, The Daily:
We are pleased to note the in
creasing concern of the Stanford
Community in the Overseas
Campus Program. Given the
growing involvement of the Uni
versity in the program and the
educational ideals upon which
it was conceived, all of us share
in the responsibility to work for
the needed improvements.
If the means by which these
improvements can be brought
about have been slow in coming,
certainly the student body
shares, in part, the blame. And
if needed improvements have
seemed slow in coming, or seem-

Ed not t(j come at all, wo would
do well to remember llie magni
tude and complexity of such an
effort as well as the conflicting
pressures under which its direc
tor, Robert A. Walker, must
labor.
Changes have come witness
i lie separate overseas judicial
council members elected for the
first time this year, the selec
tion by students of professors
to speak at the hostels, fewer
hours taken up by the hostels,
etc. which seem to indicate
that suggestions for policy re
vision are given serious consid
eration. Perhaps some of the
proponents of change have nol
thus far been as convincing as
those who are against their sug
gestions.
May we suggest that the Over
seas Campus Program will gain
more from concrete proposals
than ad hmninem arguments
against the man largely respons
ible for this granted its defects
seemingly successful addition
to the undergraduate program?

Last Thursday at the LASSU
meeting Carl Anderson quoted
Mick Lernei 's campaign speech
of May 20, 196i5 for speaker of
the Legislature: "There is no
question in my mind that the
most serious threat to the effect
iveness |of the Legislature! is
a continuous lack of support
from the student body . . . We
are regarded with suspicion and
derision . . . Ask yourselves why
the student body apparently
does not trust us to represent
it. Ask whether LASSU has any
authority whatsoever without
the confidence and support, of
the students."
1 would like to add a state
ment from Mike Couzen's speech
of the same evening: "The only
aspect of Legislature which
makes us an attractive avenue is
our own prestige."
Further, from Jay Kadane's
speech: "If wo are going to keep
the Legislature going, people

have to enjoy meetings and be
willing to come."
My first contact with the Leg
islature came this year after
1 successfully conducted a cam
paign for the office of represen
tative in my constituency t\Vil
bur-Otero). 1 have seen what I
think the above speakers were
getting at. There is no doubt
that the Legislature is held in
questionable esteem even by the
members, let alone by the stu
dent body.
The apathy on the part of the
students is understandable,
especially among those who have
attended meetings. What they
have seen is a show of "Robert's
Rules theatrics." What they have
seen is a decidedly small, but
nevertheless effective group of
members more concerned with
protecting some often fictional
rights on the basis that. "Rob
ert's Rules says ..." What they
have seen is two meetings in a
row being adjourned for lack of
a quorum (.">2 at the last meet
ing).
How could the people who visit
help but become apathetic to
ward such a pathetic show? I
suggest that if the Legislature

and print letters to the editor.

ever, letters should not exceed

ever hopes to become respected
and effective it must first gain
the respect of its own members.
To tlo this a basic change in
attitude toward the goals of the
Legislature may be necessary on
the part of all members. Only
then could it conceivably become
respected among the students.
I hope each member will ask
himself why he is there. 1 hope
he will stop wasting the time of
the other members and start try
ing to do things besides yelling,
"Point of Order!" I hope he will
start to respect the Legislature
and spread its effectiveness.
As for me. I can find more
useful things to do in the time
I have been spending in LASSU.
That is why I have resigned the

Editor, The Daily:
Last Thursday at the LASSU
meeting Carl Anderson quoted
Mick Lernei 's campaign speech
of May 20, 196i5 for speaker of
the Legislature: "There is no
question in my mind that the
most serious threat to the effect
iveness |of the Legislature! is
a continuous lack of support
from the student body . . . We
are regarded with suspicion and
derision . . . Ask yourselves why
the student body apparently
does not trust us to represent
it. Ask whether LASSU has any
authority whatsoever without
the confidence and support, of
the students."
1 would like to add a state
ment from Mike Couzen's speech
of the same evening: "The only
aspect of Legislature which
makes us an attractive avenue is
our own prestige."
Further, from Jay Kadane's
speech: "If wo are going to keep
the Legislature going, people

have to enjoy meetings and be
willing to come."
My first contact with the Leg
islature came this year after
1 successfully conducted a cam
paign for the office of represen
tative in my constituency t\Vil
bur-Otero). 1 have seen what I
think the above speakers were
getting at. There is no doubt
that the Legislature is held in
questionable esteem even by the
members, let alone by the stu
dent body.
The apathy on the part of the
students is understandable,
especially among those who have
attended meetings. What they
have seen is a show of "Robert's
Rules theatrics." What they have
seen is a decidedly small, but
nevertheless effective group of
members more concerned with
protecting some often fictional
rights on the basis that. "Rob
ert's Rules says ..." What they
have seen is two meetings in a
row being adjourned for lack of
a quorum (.">2 at the last meet
ing).
How could the people who visit
help but become apathetic to
ward such a pathetic show? I
suggest that if the Legislature

Tbe Daily is liappy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
ever, letters should not exceed
.S(M) words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on fio •space
I hies and double-spaced.

ever hopes to become respected
and effective it must first gain
the respect of its own members.
To tlo this a basic change in
attitude toward the goals of the
Legislature may be necessary on
the part of all members. Only
then could it conceivably become
respected among the students.
I hope each member will ask
himself why he is there. 1 hope
he will stop wasting the time of
the other members and start try
ing to do things besides yelling,
"Point of Order!" I hope he will
start to respect the Legislature
and spread its effectiveness.
As for me. I can find more
useful things to do in the time
I have been spending in LASSU.
That is why I have resigned the
post.

We are pleased to note the in
