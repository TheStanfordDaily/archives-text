# Reforming The Legislature
## 
### 
As the legislature convenes for its tilth meet
ing this evening, it should be apparent to anyone
who has had to sit through one of these mara
thons that LASSU is quickly devolving from a
legislative assembly into a debating forum for
the confused, the obstructionist-oriented and
the purists of the Robert s Rules' school.
The blame for this none-too-gradual transfor
mation lies both with the organization of the
body and its membership. The first can be reme
died; the second will take a change of attitude.
On the organizational level, we would recom
mend that the legislators consider the following
proposals—among others:
• A parliamentarian should be appointed who
is not a member of LASSU. The present parlia
mentarians are not neutral, which is not sur
prising seeing that one is on the ASSL Presi
dent's staff and the other is often an outspoken
proponent—or opponent—in the legislative de
bates.
• The minutes of the previous meeting and
the agenda of the forthcoming session should
be compiled and distributed by noon even
Wednesday. This would give the legislators
some time to study items under consideration
before the meeting begins.
• The Speaker should forego his proclivities
toward oversolitiousness and eternal patience.
Those who insist on redundancy, excessive read

ings from the by-laws and general irrelevancy
should be gavelled to order.
• The parliamentary device of the Committee
of the Whole should be utilized when a quorum
is no longer present. This would allow for con
sideration of non-controversial legislation on a
"consensus of the meeting" basis (subject to
ratification or debate—if necessary—at the fol
lowing meeting) as well as first readings and
other mundane legislative requirements.
The enactment of these reforms would help
to revitalize LASSU, but the major reorganiza
tion that needs to be made is in the attitudes of
the representatives themselves. Those who art 4
preoccupied with "Points of Order and
"Quorum Calls," those who have so little trust
in their own committees that they are quite will
ing to delay proceedings for half an hour or
more so that a unanimously-recommended ap
propriation can be debated (and then nearly
alwavs passed by an overwhelming majority),
and those who insist on showing how many sub
tle methods there are to bring off-campus issue s
under consideration should be ignored or repri
manded or both.
For w hen matters of widespread student con
cern come before the Legislature later this year,
they will deserve more meaningful consideration
than the present body now seems capable ol
offering.

the representatives themselves. Those who art 4
preoccupied with "Points of Order and
"Quorum Calls," those who have so little trust
in their own committees that they are quite will
ing to delay proceedings for half an hour or
more so that a unanimously-recommended ap
propriation can be debated (and then nearly
alwavs passed by an overwhelming majority),
and those who insist on showing how many sub
tle methods there are to bring off-campus issue s
under consideration should be ignored or repri
manded or both.
For w hen matters of widespread student con
cern come before the Legislature later this year,
they will deserve more meaningful consideration
than the present body now seems capable ol
offering.
As the legislature convenes for its tilth meet
ing this evening, it should be apparent to anyone
who has had to sit through one of these mara
thons that LASSU is quickly devolving from a
legislative assembly into a debating forum for
the confused, the obstructionist-oriented and
the purists of the Robert s Rules' school.
The blame for this none-too-gradual transfor
mation lies both with the organization of the
body and its membership. The first can be reme
died; the second will take a change of attitude.
On the organizational level, we would recom
mend that the legislators consider the following
proposals—among others:
• A parliamentarian should be appointed who
is not a member of LASSU. The present parlia
mentarians are not neutral, which is not sur
prising seeing that one is on the ASSL Presi
dent's staff and the other is often an outspoken
proponent—or opponent—in the legislative de
bates.
• The minutes of the previous meeting and
the agenda of the forthcoming session should
be compiled and distributed by noon even
Wednesday. This would give the legislators
some time to study items under consideration
before the meeting begins.
• The Speaker should forego his proclivities
toward oversolitiousness and eternal patience.
Those who insist on redundancy, excessive read

ings from the by-laws and general irrelevancy
should be gavelled to order.
• The parliamentary device of the Committee
of the Whole should be utilized when a quorum
is no longer present. This would allow for con
sideration of non-controversial legislation on a
"consensus of the meeting" basis (subject to
ratification or debate—if necessary—at the fol
lowing meeting) as well as first readings and
other mundane legislative requirements.
The enactment of these reforms would help
to revitalize LASSU, but the major reorganiza
tion that needs to be made is in the attitudes of
the representatives themselves. Those who art 4
