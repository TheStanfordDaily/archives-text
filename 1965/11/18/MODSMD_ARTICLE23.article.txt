## Vietnam: Why Commitment 
### 
(Ed. Note: On October 28 and
29, Editor Steve Leopold attend
ed the semi-annual National
Foreign Policy Conference for
Editors and Broadcasters con
ducted by the State Department
in Washington, I).C. Speakers
included Dean Husk, Undersecre
tary of State George Ball, Un
dersecretary of State for Econ
nomic Affairs Thomas Mann,
Ambassador at Large Averill
Harriman, Assistant Secretary
of State for Far Eastern Affairs
William Btindy and other high
department officials. Since the
conference was conducted under
"background only" rules, quotes
of the officials cannot be direct
ly attributed.
Moreover, the following repre
sents not only a coverage of the
conference but the author's own
analysis of the problems dis
cussed there.)
According to a high State De
partment official, there are three
fundamental reasons why the
United States should—and will
remain in South Vietnam.
• The infiltration of men and
equipment from North Vietnam,
an act of foreign intervention
"which Hanoi no longer denies."
• The commitment which the
U.S. has made to South Vietnam,
a committment reiterated by
three administrations. If we re
nege on our commitment, then
"very large dangers would arise
due to misconceptions as to how
we will react in other situations
where we have commited our
selves.
• The need to deter a commu
nist takeover by military means
so that a political solution can
be reached.
Those who oppose U.S. policy
in Vietnam question the validity
of these assumptions, each to a
varying degree.
Interrelated Points
Points one and two are inter
related; indeed, Washington of
ficialdom at this conference
evinced a complete certainty
that their 'North Vietnam's and
China's) chicken came before our
egg. That is, external aid from
the North has necessitated
American aid to the South.
According to one official, Viet
nam is now going through phase
one of America's tripartite pol
icy in the developing nations of
the Far East. Security is the
first necessity, this official held,
"so that we can contain an ex
pansionist enterprise at the peak
of its ideological fervor" (e.g.
Communist China). The second
and third phases are the eco
nomic and social development of
these nations (foreign aid. Peace
Corps, private investment, etc.)
and the gradual healing of scars
left by colonial memories (Brit
ish in the sub-continent, Dutch
on the Archipelago. French in
Indochina and Japanese in Ko
rea ).
Vietnam has not been able to
pass through the first phase be
cause a) the French were too
weak to either stabilize the na
tion or train its leaders, b) the
evolution of the democratic na
tionalist element has been crip
pled by both the French and
Communist tactic of assassina
lifii and c) infiltration from the

North some 40,000 men, gueril
las and regular units, prior to
the beginning of U.S. air opera
tions against North Vietnam.
Righting Each Wrong
U.S. policy, thus, has attempt
ed to right each of these alleged
wrongs. Beginning with Presi
dent Eisenhower's statement of
July 21, 1954 that the United
States is not itself "party to or
bound by the decisions taken by
the Geneva Conference" and that
the U.S. "is actively pursuing
discussions with other free na
tions with a view to the rapid
organization of a collective de
fense in Southeast Asia in order
to prevent further direct or in
direct Communist aggression in
that general area," the United
States has repeatedly commited
itself to preventing a communist
takeover of South Vietnam.
At first, the commitment in
cluded only military "advisors."
foreign aid and urgings to the
government of Ngo Dinh Diem
to undertake social and econom
ie reforms. However, in 1961 and
1962 the situation changed—the
National Liberation Front was
established (probably at the end
of I960) and Northern interven
tion was increased to the extent
that in June, 1962 the Interna
tional Control Commission in
Vietnam concluded that there
was "sufficient evidence to show
beyond reasonable doubt" that
North Vietnam was sending
arms and men into South Viet
nam to carry out subversion, in
violation of the 1951 Geneva Ac
cords. It is these acts and the
accompanying increase in Viet
Cong "terrorism," against peas
ants, government soldiers and
U.S. advisors, that have forced
the U.S. to escalate the war.

End of the State Department's
case.
Those who oppose the war
contend that the U.S. is not sup
porting a "free nation" in South
Vietnam; that—in fact—South
Vietnam was not set up as an
independent country under the
Geneva Accords which hold that
"the military demarcation line is
provisional and should not in
any way be interpreted as con
stituting a political or territorial
boundary"; that the internecine
war is thus a civil war; and that
it is the U.S. which is violating
the Geneva Accords since that
agreement provided for free elec
tions to be held in 1963 and pro
hibited the introduction into
Vietnam of "foreign troops and
military personnel as well as
all kinds of arms and muni
tions," tlie building of any "mil
itary base under the control
of a foreign state" and the
extension of any "mili
tary alliance" to include either
sector of Vietnam. Moreover, the
claims of "massive aggression"
from the North cited in the Feb
ruary, 1965 State Department
White Paper are not proven.
On balance, it appears that the
State Department emerges from
the legal debate over 'who vio
lated what agreements when and
in what numbers' in a none too
secure position.
A much stronger argument re
iterated at the conference, and
one which will be examined in
this space tomorrow, is that the
vital interests of the Free World
— and the United States as lead
in - of the democracies-—are at
stake in this savage struggle
halfway across the world.
