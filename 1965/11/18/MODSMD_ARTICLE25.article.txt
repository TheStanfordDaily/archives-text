# Today and Tomorrow
## Two Chinas And The UN-Neutralize One, Seat Both 
### Walter Lippmann 
For Iho fourth time in five
years the question of whether
Peking or Taipei shall occupy
the seats that belong to China
is again before the United Na
tions.
During these years there has
been a striking change in the
shape of the problem. Sentiment
has grown in most of the world
in favor of seating Peking on
the ground that Mainland China
really is China and that as a
matter of practical politics it
must participate in any peace
able settlement in East Asia.
Peking Stiffens
As this sentiment has grown,
the Peking government has stif
fened the conditions which the
United Nations must meel be
fore it would accept the seats
if they were offered.
If the Peking conditions are
to be taken literally as being
what, in his press conference on
Sept. 29, Foreign Minister Chen
Yi said they are. the debate may
be regarded as over and the
question disposed of. For Hie
position of Peking would then
be that it will not accept the
seats unless the United Nations
surrenders unconditionally, not
only on Taiwan but on a radical
revision of 'he charter and on a
purge, directed by Peking, of the
membership of the United Na
tions-
If all these conditions are to
be regarded as not within the
realm of accommodation and ne
gotiation. then Chen Yi must be
understood as having renounced
Peking's entry into the United
Nations. He must be understood
as preferring for ideological and
other reasons to continue to re
main a hostile outsider.
In consequence, our real prob
lem is not how to keep Red
China out of the United Nations.
Arthur Goldberg was in effect
arguing a case which his Red
Chinese opponents had already
won for him. Polemics are not
statesmanship, and our real
problem and that of the great,
majority of the loyal supporters
of the United Nations is how
the abyss between Red China
and the rest of mankind is to be
bridged, how the alienation of
the Mainland Chinese is to be
overcome, how China is to be
brought into the universal so
ciety.
Preview of Chinese Arguments
When we examine Chen Yi's
conditions, I think we may sup
pose that all the talk about the
revision of the charter and the
purge of the members is no
more than a preview of what
Red China would argue for if
she were in the United Nations.
The real pre-condition is the

old one that Peking must not
only be given Hie seats in the
U.N. organization now occupied
by Taiwan, but that Taiwan
must also be expelled from the
United Nations.
The United States cannot hon
orably agree to this demand or
even tactitly assent to it. Not
all countries are in honor bound
as we are, but it is a virtual
certainty that enough members
will join us in refusing to de
prive Taiwan a state which has
11 million people in it of repre
sentation in 'he United Nations.
Those who will refuse to expel
Taiwan will be enough, it ap
pears, to deny the two-thirds
vote it would take to expel Tai
wan.
It is not certain that this dead
lock over Taiwan will last for
ever, or even far beyond the life
time of Chiang Kai-shek. The
magnetic attraction of China on
Taiwan will be strong, and even
tually a political deal reunify
ing the two Chinas is a distinct
possibility-
Since that is only a future
eventuality, the only hope in the
near future for an agreed solu
tion is for the United Nations
to recognize Peking as China
and to recognize Taiwan as Tai
wan. This is not precisely what
has been called in the past "the
two China" solution. For there
would be only one China.
But that solution would recog
nize the independence of Taiwan
which, as a matter of fact, has
not been under the rule of the
Chinese Mainland since 189.">. It
would amount to treating Tai
wan, which was conquered and
colonized by the Chinese from
Fukien in the 1 Tth century, as
so many other former colonies,
now independent U.N. members,
have been treated.
To back the independence of
Taiwan is to arouse the opposi
tion not only of Peking but of
Chiang Kai-shek as well. But in
principle an independent Tai
wan. neutralized under a U.N.
guarantee, would be in the spirit
of the age. If in the end Peking
were to accept it, it would not
only solve the problem at the
United Nations, but it might
well be a decisive step toward
peaceable coexistence in Asia-
It is, of course, not easy to
believe that such a rational and
civilized accommodation will be
reached. It requires an act of
faith to make such a formula an
objective of policy. But if there
gather behind the idea the pre
ponderant majority of the Unit
ed Nations, we can at least say
that no one who joins this ma
jority will ever need feel
ashamed that he has done so.

Preview of Chinese Arguments
When we examine Chen Yi's
conditions, I think we may sup
pose that all the talk about the
revision of the charter and the
purge of the members is no
more than a preview of what
Red China would argue for if
she were in the United Nations.
The real pre-condition is the

old one that Peking must not
only be given Hie seats in the
U.N. organization now occupied
by Taiwan, but that Taiwan
must also be expelled from the
United Nations.
The United States cannot hon
orably agree to this demand or
even tactitly assent to it. Not
all countries are in honor bound
as we are, but it is a virtual
certainty that enough members
will join us in refusing to de
prive Taiwan a state which has
11 million people in it of repre
sentation in 'he United Nations.
Those who will refuse to expel
Taiwan will be enough, it ap
pears, to deny the two-thirds
vote it would take to expel Tai
wan.
It is not certain that this dead
lock over Taiwan will last for
ever, or even far beyond the life
time of Chiang Kai-shek. The
magnetic attraction of China on
Taiwan will be strong, and even
tually a political deal reunify
ing the two Chinas is a distinct
possibility-
Since that is only a future
eventuality, the only hope in the
near future for an agreed solu
tion is for the United Nations
to recognize Peking as China
and to recognize Taiwan as Tai
wan. This is not precisely what
has been called in the past "the
two China" solution. For there
would be only one China.
But that solution would recog
nize the independence of Taiwan
which, as a matter of fact, has
not been under the rule of the
Chinese Mainland since 189.">. It
would amount to treating Tai
wan, which was conquered and
colonized by the Chinese from
Fukien in the 1 Tth century, as
so many other former colonies,
now independent U.N. members,
have been treated.
To back the independence of
Taiwan is to arouse the opposi
tion not only of Peking but of
Chiang Kai-shek as well. But in
principle an independent Tai
wan. neutralized under a U.N.
guarantee, would be in the spirit
of the age. If in the end Peking
were to accept it, it would not
only solve the problem at the
United Nations, but it might
well be a decisive step toward
peaceable coexistence in Asia-
It is, of course, not easy to
believe that such a rational and
civilized accommodation will be
reached. It requires an act of
faith to make such a formula an
objective of policy. But if there
gather behind the idea the pre
ponderant majority of the Unit
ed Nations, we can at least say
that no one who joins this ma
jority will ever need feel
ashamed that he has done so.
For Iho fourth time in five
years the question of whether
Peking or Taipei shall occupy
the seats that belong to China
is again before the United Na
tions.
During these years there has
been a striking change in the
shape of the problem. Sentiment
has grown in most of the world
in favor of seating Peking on
the ground that Mainland China
really is China and that as a
matter of practical politics it
must participate in any peace
able settlement in East Asia.
Peking Stiffens
As this sentiment has grown,
the Peking government has stif
fened the conditions which the
United Nations must meel be
fore it would accept the seats
if they were offered.
If the Peking conditions are
to be taken literally as being
what, in his press conference on
Sept. 29, Foreign Minister Chen
Yi said they are. the debate may
be regarded as over and the
question disposed of. For Hie
position of Peking would then
be that it will not accept the
seats unless the United Nations
surrenders unconditionally, not
only on Taiwan but on a radical
revision of 'he charter and on a
purge, directed by Peking, of the
membership of the United Na
tions-
If all these conditions are to
be regarded as not within the
realm of accommodation and ne
gotiation. then Chen Yi must be
understood as having renounced
Peking's entry into the United
Nations. He must be understood
as preferring for ideological and
other reasons to continue to re
main a hostile outsider.
In consequence, our real prob
lem is not how to keep Red
China out of the United Nations.
Arthur Goldberg was in effect
arguing a case which his Red
Chinese opponents had already
won for him. Polemics are not
statesmanship, and our real
problem and that of the great,
majority of the loyal supporters
of the United Nations is how
the abyss between Red China
and the rest of mankind is to be
bridged, how the alienation of
the Mainland Chinese is to be
overcome, how China is to be
brought into the universal so
ciety.

Fukien in the 1 Tth century, as
so many other former colonies,
now independent U.N. members,
have been treated.
To back the independence of
Taiwan is to arouse the opposi
tion not only of Peking but of
Chiang Kai-shek as well. But in
principle an independent Tai
wan. neutralized under a U.N.
guarantee, would be in the spirit
of the age. If in the end Peking
were to accept it, it would not
only solve the problem at the
United Nations, but it might
well be a decisive step toward
peaceable coexistence in Asia-
It is, of course, not easy to
believe that such a rational and
civilized accommodation will be
reached. It requires an act of
faith to make such a formula an
objective of policy. But if there
gather behind the idea the pre
ponderant majority of the Unit
ed Nations, we can at least say
that no one who joins this ma
jority will ever need feel
ashamed that he has done so.
For Iho fourth time in five
years the question of whether
Peking or Taipei shall occupy
the seats that belong to China
is again before the United Na
tions.
During these years there has
been a striking change in the
shape of the problem. Sentiment
has grown in most of the world
in favor of seating Peking on
the ground that Mainland China
really is China and that as a
matter of practical politics it
must participate in any peace
able settlement in East Asia.
Peking Stiffens
As this sentiment has grown,
the Peking government has stif
fened the conditions which the
United Nations must meel be
fore it would accept the seats
if they were offered.
If the Peking conditions are
to be taken literally as being
what, in his press conference on
Sept. 29, Foreign Minister Chen
Yi said they are. the debate may
be regarded as over and the
question disposed of. For Hie
position of Peking would then
be that it will not accept the
seats unless the United Nations
surrenders unconditionally, not
only on Taiwan but on a radical
revision of 'he charter and on a
purge, directed by Peking, of the
membership of the United Na
tions-
If all these conditions are to
be regarded as not within the
realm of accommodation and ne
gotiation. then Chen Yi must be
understood as having renounced
Peking's entry into the United
Nations. He must be understood
as preferring for ideological and
other reasons to continue to re
main a hostile outsider.
In consequence, our real prob
lem is not how to keep Red
China out of the United Nations.
Arthur Goldberg was in effect
arguing a case which his Red
Chinese opponents had already
won for him. Polemics are not
statesmanship, and our real
problem and that of the great,
majority of the loyal supporters
of the United Nations is how
the abyss between Red China
and the rest of mankind is to be
bridged, how the alienation of
the Mainland Chinese is to be
overcome, how China is to be
brought into the universal so
ciety.
Preview of Chinese Arguments
When we examine Chen Yi's
conditions, I think we may sup
pose that all the talk about the
revision of the charter and the
purge of the members is no
more than a preview of what
Red China would argue for if
she were in the United Nations.
The real pre-condition is the

old one that Peking must not
only be given Hie seats in the
U.N. organization now occupied
by Taiwan, but that Taiwan
must also be expelled from the
United Nations.
The United States cannot hon
orably agree to this demand or
even tactitly assent to it. Not
all countries are in honor bound
as we are, but it is a virtual
certainty that enough members
will join us in refusing to de
prive Taiwan a state which has
11 million people in it of repre
sentation in 'he United Nations.
Those who will refuse to expel
Taiwan will be enough, it ap
pears, to deny the two-thirds
vote it would take to expel Tai
wan.
It is not certain that this dead
lock over Taiwan will last for
ever, or even far beyond the life
time of Chiang Kai-shek. The
magnetic attraction of China on
Taiwan will be strong, and even
tually a political deal reunify
ing the two Chinas is a distinct
possibility-
Since that is only a future
eventuality, the only hope in the
near future for an agreed solu
tion is for the United Nations
to recognize Peking as China
and to recognize Taiwan as Tai
wan. This is not precisely what
has been called in the past "the
two China" solution. For there
would be only one China.
But that solution would recog
nize the independence of Taiwan
which, as a matter of fact, has
not been under the rule of the
Chinese Mainland since 189.">. It
would amount to treating Tai
wan, which was conquered and
colonized by the Chinese from
Fukien in the 1 Tth century, as
so many other former colonies,
now independent U.N. members,
have been treated.
