## Violent Vociferation And Vietnam 
### 
The greatest disadvantage that is suf
fered by an individual responsive to the
raging and ever increasing muddle
called Vietnam is a lack of information
as to what is now happening in that
country. News censorship is in effect,
and draftees are being sent to fight a
war; no war has been declared, making
the first fact seriously suspicious, and
the second fact illegal.
There is, however, no end to the
racket in opinion columns. Vociferous
elements supporting either extreme of
opinion are heard daily. Such a letter
appeared in The Chronicle Editorial
Page of Monday, November 15:
God On Our Side
Editor—ln a letter (11/10/65) Miss
Pick stated that this war was not
her friends' war, but yet there arc
thousands of free young Americans
who are fighting now so that Miss
Pick and her misguided friends may
continue their education in a free
nation. If this does not involve them
in this war, then God help their
consciences.
I believe that Miss Peck was close
to the truth when she stated that
her friensd were living in a great
fear of something coming along that
will interrupt their own safe little
world of toduv. They don't seem t<>

realize that if they are to have a
safe little world of tomorrow, then
the fighting today is very necessary.
Barry English
This letter is a perfect example of
the baek-and-forth inanity that thrives
in an informationless citizenry. Aca
demic freedom is somehow nurtured by
the imposition of one country's values
upon another country. God is thrown
helplessly into the act as our conscience
in Vietnam (on our side). Life Maga
zine lends its own special support to
our men in Vietnam by making the
issue a Crusade; United States 852
bomber crews are shown praying be
fore a mission to bomb Vietnam.
The government and the news media
seem somehow to be involved in more
of a conspiracy than ever. We are now
told, but only through the voice of a
man who is dead—Adlai Stevenson
that whatever chance Vietnam had in
the past of being settled by negotiation
was squelched by the peace-loving
United States. Not very long ago the
whole Time Magazine Southeast Asia
team of reporters Quit; when a thor
ough report of the Vietnam war was
submitted but never published.
Democracy and Discussion
If the true meaning of democracy is
dt th' u our form ol r/oveni

ment is at best dictatorial. The horror
show that has led to nothing hut the
most medieval display of diplomacy
since The Spanish-American War can
not now be intelligently solved. It
seems that only the students, those who
march and those who heckle, bring
democracy into any visible appearance.
This form of exchange, no matter how
deformed, is more meaningful than
deaths in Vietnam.
In the right-hand corner of this same
C I iron ie Ie editorial page is a letter from
a taxicab driver who tells it as he sees
it; he is a man who put two and two
together, and perhaps the monstrous
problem needs his clarity of thought:
Editor -What I read in the papers
about Vietnam and what I hear driv
ing my taxicab, from guys back
from Vietnam arc two different
things.
They t;ilk about how the people
do not like Americans and how our
goods are robbed by workers and
government troops and sold 011 the
black market. The Vietnam army
will not fight against people and the
Americans do most of the fighting.
If they do not want us there, I
don't see why we went there in the
first place.

Editor -What I read in the papers
about Vietnam and what I hear driv
ing my taxicab, from guys back
from Vietnam arc two different
things.
They t;ilk about how the people
do not like Americans and how our
goods are robbed by workers and
government troops and sold 011 the
black market. The Vietnam army
will not fight against people and the
Americans do most of the fighting.
If they do not want us there, I
don't see why we went there in the
first place.

The greatest disadvantage that is suf
fered by an individual responsive to the
raging and ever increasing muddle
called Vietnam is a lack of information
as to what is now happening in that
country. News censorship is in effect,
and draftees are being sent to fight a
war; no war has been declared, making
the first fact seriously suspicious, and
the second fact illegal.
There is, however, no end to the
racket in opinion columns. Vociferous
elements supporting either extreme of
opinion are heard daily. Such a letter

God On Our Side
Editor—ln a letter (11/10/65) Miss
Pick stated that this war was not
her friends' war, but yet there arc
thousands of free young Americans
who are fighting now so that Miss
Pick and her misguided friends may
continue their education in a free
nation. If this does not involve them
in this war, then God help their
consciences.
I believe that Miss Peck was close
to the truth when she stated that
her friensd were living in a great
fear of something coming along that
will interrupt their own safe little
world of toduv. They don't seem t<>

realize that if they are to have a
safe little world of tomorrow, then
the fighting today is very necessary.

This letter is a perfect example of
the baek-and-forth inanity that thrives
in an informationless citizenry. Aca
demic freedom is somehow nurtured by
the imposition of one country's values
upon another country. God is thrown
helplessly into the act as our conscience
in Vietnam (on our side). Life Maga
zine lends its own special support to
our men in Vietnam by making the
issue a Crusade; United States 852
bomber crews are shown praying be
fore a mission to bomb Vietnam.
The government and the news media
seem somehow to be involved in more
of a conspiracy than ever. We are now
told, but only through the voice of a
man who is dead—Adlai Stevenson
that whatever chance Vietnam had in
the past of being settled by negotiation
was squelched by the peace-loving
United States. Not very long ago the
whole Time Magazine Southeast Asia
team of reporters Quit; when a thor
ough report of the Vietnam war was
submitted but never published.
