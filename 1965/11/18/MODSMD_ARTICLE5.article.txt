# SAUS Sees Campus Role
## 
### LINDSAY MERRYMAN 
At a meeting of the Stanford Asso
ciation of University Scholars yester
day at 8 p.m.. "alternative forms for
the organization and government of
the University community" were dis
cussed.
The leader of the seminar, Bob
Jtosen. was somewhat disappointed by
the small attendance. Last year, in
tlie flurry of excitement concerning
the then new FSM and the recently
formed GCC, the SAUS' first meeting
drew about 200 students. It now has
about one hundred members, a quar
ter of whom are faculty.
Decreased Interest
Rosen offered another explanation
for the decreased interest, the fact

that the administration has been busy
wtih other programs, e.g. freshmen
seminars and the Wilbur faculty pro
grams, thus reducing the need for
student action.
Professor Bay of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems spoke
first. His remarks defined the Univer
sity as an agent liberating the student
from his prejudices and serving the
community both culturally and so
cially.
Senior Skip Martin followed Bay,
limiting himself to the subtopie, "a
practical consideration of the philos
ophy of education."
He dealt with the paradox implied
by the very generality of a university
and by the diverse personalities of the

students involved, and with the for
mer dual position of faculty as "phi
losopher-kings" and their present sta
tus of student guides.
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane pie
sent ed some remarks on what he
called "the fundamental question of
authority in the university, and to
whom are the administrators respon
sible?" He pointed out the irony that
although the administration is respon
sible to the Board of Trustees, there
is almost no chance for trustee
student contact, since almost all of
the Board lives off campus.
Professors Become Conservative
Professor Drokmeier of the Political
Science Department continued the dis
cussion. presenting the fact Ihat the
closer an issue gets to home ground,
the more conservative a professor
seems to become. He criticized the
Academic Council, saying that it is
really "too big to accomplish any
thing"
He sugested tentatively a "prep year"
for twelfth grade students, who would
live in "fraternity clusters," nut wor
rying about grades and majors until
their emergence as upper classmen.
Me oven suggested co-ed fraternities,
where 1 the selection would not be made
on the basis of sex. but purely on the
students' intellectual interest.
He concluded with a hearty approv
al of any educational innovations, im
plying that Stanford is a slightly
stagnant in its consistently "old"
forms of teaching.
