# LASSU To Evaluate Sign-out Procedures
## 
### 
In tonight's meeting LASSU will
consider the motion by Phyllis Cole
that the AWS Social Regs Commis
sion study the feasibility of eliminat
ing sign-out procedure. The Commis
sion would then report to the Student
Affairs Committee and to LASSU on
its findings.
Miss Cole feels that if the only
reason for signing-out is to help rela
tives locate a girl in case of an emer
gency. the procedure is not really
needed. She added that any "reason
able adult person" might leave word
with a friend where he could be found.
Implementing sign-oul also requires
a "large student bureaucracy.''
Back-log
Concerning the rest of the meeting,
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane. in an
interview with the Daily yesterday,
said. "This will be the first meeting
this year that we will be able to get
to our back-log (of legislation).''
Jay expects the legislature to at
tack three particular pieces of legis
lative "back-log" in the meeting. The
first is a motion to put the names of
ex-officio members back into the con
stitution. The names had been dropped
once before because they were con
sidered unnecessary and confusing.
The second motion seeks to provide
a rule for the recall of legislators by
their constituency. Speaker Kadane
admitted that this is now done unof
ficially In many houses and that this
motion would establish the practice
legally.
The third piece of business expected
to be covered is the abolition of the
Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code Commission. A President's com
mittee already has taken over most
of the work of this commission, and
the "occasional pamphlets" which it
does put out are often considered
"l i'li<M!l"U'

Jay also stated that he expected to
have a resolution proposed to "have
the Committee of 15 discuss the reli
gious problem." He added that this
might be necessary because "the sta
tus (of religion> on campus isn't
known."
No further legislation on the park
ing problem or the question of gradu
ate representation distribution is an
ticipated in today's meeting. Jay
described this session of the legisla
ture as an attempt to "clean up the
bills in committee." He added that
"the problems of the Daily may pretty
much dominate the meeting." The
problem he referred to concerns hav
ing the Daily printed off-campus.
Jay feels that the legislature is do
ing more and is better appreciated
this year because last year the "legis
lature pushed and used its authority."
Concerning future legislation he could
only say. "It is very hard to foresee.''
but he did add that he expects further
examination of Stanford's "standing
problems."
