# Wheels Will Bog In Big Game Mud
## 
### 
Director of Athletics Chuck Tay
lor yesterday urged all Stanford
students, faculty, and staff to re
train from driving to .Saturday's
Dig Game. if at all possible.
The heavy rains the past week
have rendered half of the parking
areas unusable and presently there
is not enough parking space to take
care of the huge crowd expected.
Walking to the game will help to
alleviate the traffic situation.
