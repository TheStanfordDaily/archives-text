The newly-appointed ambassador to
the United States is, according to
CONSCIENCE national coordinator
Mai Scott, "one of the most authori
tative on Vietnam."
Thai, who resigned from the Diem
regime, was a member of the Viet
Minh, nationalist coalition which de
feated the French in 19."54. Scott said.
Other speakers will include Kenneth
Young. United States ambassador to
Thailand from 1961 to 15)03 and Guy
I'auker of the Rand Corporation, a
Southeast Asia specialist, who par

McGeorge Bundy.
Scott said he expected to "pack
Pinklespiel" for the "lecture-in."' Its
purposes are twofold, according to
Scull:

1. To show that the great majority
of students are in agreement with the
present United States Vietnam policy.
2. To counteract the publicity im
pact of the planned march on Oakland
Saturday by the Berkeley Vietnam
Day Committee.
Scott explained further. "By coining
you will be expressing your qualified
support for the general outline of the
United States policy in Vietnam and
condemning extremism on either side
of the issue." He said an estimated
3000 Stanford students have signed a
petition to this effect.
CONSCIENCE Committee on Na
tional Student Citizenship In Every
National Case of Emergency was
created at Stanford lasi month in re
sponse to demonstrations against the
Vietnam war. It was founded by Scott,
and Michael Cummings, graduate stu
dents in Political Science.
It now has numerous chapters,
working through bipartisan organiza
tions of Young Republicans and
Young Democrats, on college cam
pu.vj throughout the nation.
