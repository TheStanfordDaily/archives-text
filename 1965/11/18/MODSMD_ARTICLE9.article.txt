'•The committee members have
always believed in having close con
tact with sludent interest on religion;
inclusion of students on the Commit
tee is Ihc most direct way to assure
remaining in close contact with this
interest," Dean Lyman said last
night.
"Students can be helpful in gen
eral formulations of religious policy
and in the planning of specific pro
grams." he stated. "But they can per
haps be most helpful in serving as a
communications link with interested
students."
"We hope to get a lot done this
year; students are coming on the
Committee at an opportune time."
he said.
President Sterling retains the right
to designate any subject for iho ex
clusive consideration of the non-stu
dent members of the Committee. Ly
man said. He sees little likelihood that
this provision will be used extens
ively.
Sludent Committee Remains
Student participation on the Presi
dent's Committee will not mean the
abolition of the student committee,
Brown said last night. "These stu
dents will also be members of the
ASSU committee, which will be active
in working in specific areas of con
cern," he said-
Tn his petition. Brown had stated
"there are few areas at Stanford
where students can be so personally
and deeply affected as religion. It is
therefore useful that students should
be consulted and help to determine
University policies in this area. Since
the President's Committee on Relig
ious Activities has the critical role
in determining the quality and the
scope of religion at Stanford, T [re
quest! that students participate as
full members of the Committee."
Rejected Last Year
The possibility of student members
of tiie Committee was considered antl
rejected early last year, the explana
tion being that the Committee was to
deal with personnel considerations.
The Committee was formed in the
spring of 1964 follow ing a gift to the
University by alumnus Lowell Bern
of $1.3 million. It earns about $30,01)1
a year income.

quest! that students participate as
full members of the Committee."
Rejected Last Year
The possibility of student members
of tiie Committee was considered antl
rejected early last year, the explana
tion being that the Committee was to
deal with personnel considerations.
The Committee was formed in the
spring of 1964 follow ing a gift to the
University by alumnus Lowell Bern
of $1.3 million. It earns about $30,01)1
a year income.
The ASSU petition to add three
student members to tho President's
Advisory Committee on Religious Ac
tivities has been approved by Presi
dent Sterling, Committee Chairman
Richard Lyman announced yesterday.
Approval followed a unanimous
recommendation from the Committee
"This is tangible recognition by the
University that students have a legti
mate part to play in the formulation
of religious policy," said ASSU Vice

President Clark Brown, who submit
ted (he petition. "As several members
ol' the administration have stated,
there are lew committees dealing with
matters in which students are so ob
viously directly involved."
The students will be selected by the
President from a panel of six sub
mitted by student-body President
Sandy Mackenzie. Mackenzie an
nounced last night that he intends lo
present his slate of students for the
Legislature's approval at its meeting

Close ('ontact
'•The committee members have
always believed in having close con
tact with sludent interest on religion;
inclusion of students on the Commit
tee is Ihc most direct way to assure
remaining in close contact with this
interest," Dean Lyman said last
night.
"Students can be helpful in gen
eral formulations of religious policy
and in the planning of specific pro
grams." he stated. "But they can per
haps be most helpful in serving as a
communications link with interested
students."
"We hope to get a lot done this
year; students are coming on the
Committee at an opportune time."
he said.
President Sterling retains the right
to designate any subject for iho ex
clusive consideration of the non-stu
dent members of the Committee. Ly
man said. He sees little likelihood that
this provision will be used extens
ively.
Sludent Committee Remains
Student participation on the Presi
dent's Committee will not mean the
abolition of the student committee,
Brown said last night. "These stu
dents will also be members of the
ASSU committee, which will be active
in working in specific areas of con
cern," he said-
Tn his petition. Brown had stated
"there are few areas at Stanford
where students can be so personally
and deeply affected as religion. It is
therefore useful that students should
be consulted and help to determine
University policies in this area. Since
the President's Committee on Relig
ious Activities has the critical role
in determining the quality and the
