Those Ten Commandments
Few today can name the Ten Commandments (Found in Exodus 20), though
many profess allegiance to this ancient Jewish code which reveals the just,
moral character of our Creator, the God of Israel. Not a set of rules for good
clean living, not a guide to good behavior, the law has come from God to ex
pose the sin of man and reveal his utter depravity. . . Whatever the law
says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be
stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For no human
being will be justified in the sight of God by works of the law, since through
the law comes the knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:19, 20).
Jesus Christ in his Sermon on the Mount intensified the law by showing
that God has always considered the motive of the heart as important as the
external act. "You have heard it said to the men of old 'Thou shalt not commit
adultery', but I say to you that everyone who looks upon a woman lustfully has
already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matthew 5:27, 28). God,
who always seeks the faith and trust of men, still says to men today, "The
law is good, if anyone uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is
not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly
and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers
of mothers, for mcinslayers, for immoral persons, sodomites, kidnappers, liars,
perjurers and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with
the glorious gospel of the blessed God" (I Timothy 1:8-1 1).
To trust Jesus Christ and acknowledge him as Lord is to be set free from
the law and its legal demands, to be released from the strain of self-righteous
living. ' For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for as it
is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in
the book of the law, and do them'. Now it is evident that no man is justified
before God by the law,- for 'the just shall live by faith'j but the law does not
rest on faith, for he who does them shall live by them'. Christ redeemed us
from Ihe curse of the law, having become a curse for us" (Galatians 3:10-13).
Have you been set free from the curse of the law? Jesus said, "You shall
know the truth and the truth shall set you free ... I am the truth."
