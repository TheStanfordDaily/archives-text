# 'Cincinnati Kid’ A Routine Movie
## 
### 
By AL HEINE MAN
What happened, see, was, a
bunch of guys al M-G-M were
sitting around and one said,
"Hey, why don't we make a
movie about a young kid that's
been practicing for years to be
a great pool player so he could
beat the suave old guy who
everybody thinks is the best
around and they finally meet
and have a big tense match and
its very exciting because we
could throw in some women
and some big betting and the
young guy gets beat and . .
"Wait a minute." another guy
says. "Somebody already made
that one. Worked pretty good,
too."
Oh ...
"Oh," says the first guy.
"Well, let's make him a stud
poker player — ha ha, stud, get
it? — and we get Paul New
man to be the hero and Jackie
Gleason to be the old pro and
Myron McCormick to be the
manager and George C. Scott to
be the real baddie "
"They were all in the other
one."
"Oh. Well, how about . ,
How about, indeed, Steve Mc-
Queen, Edward G. Robinson,
Karl Maiden and Rip Torn in an

ill-disguised translation of "The
Hustler" into an aura of New
Orleans poker playing. And des
pite the fact that McQueen al
ways emerges triumphant play
ing himself, that Robinson is con
vincing and has some pithy,
aphoristic and occasionally me
morable dialogue, and that
Tuesday Weld and Ann-Mar
gret often appear wearing very
little protection from the cold,
"The Cincinnati Kid" is a rou
tine movie.
Stereotyped
The characterizations, espec
ially of the minor roles, are
stereotyped, and the situations
are stock, wilh no attempt made
1o set them up credibly. The aud
ience knows from the first few
moments that the Kid must
come to a showdown with Robin
son, not because it is an inevit
able product of the characters'
motivations and circumstances,
but because Flicks Like This
always turn out That Way.
The dialogue is clumsy and
functional in most cases— sur
prisingly so, for its authors, Ter
ery Southern and Ring Lardner
Jr., have produced some good
screen plays. There are some
"neat lines," mostly given to Mc-
Queen and Robinson, but, by and

large, no one seems to care what
anyone else is saying.
The sleeper (pun intended)
performance is turned in by, of
all people, Tuesday Weld, who
makes a touching and sympa
thetic figure out of McQueen's

The other performances are
capable, with two exceptions:
Maiden seems preoccupied with
something — perhaps a better
role in his next picture — and
is generally perfunctory.
Ann-Margret
And Ann-Margret . . . Ann-
Margret . .. words cannot do
justice to her incompetence. She
is one of the few actresses on
Hollywood payrolls who can
screw up a scene in which she
has nothing to do but smile.
(She does, in all fairness, a su
perb job of looking built, or
slavering lustfully after Mc-
Queen). When she opens her
mouth, even disbelief's most
willing suspension system gels
an irreparable jolt.

Rip Torn, as a spoiled million
aire who enjoys controlling oth
ers, and Joan Blondell as a
crusty, wise-cracking poker deal
er (where is Dick Powell?) are
interesting.
Some TVnse Drama
And"The Cincinnati Kid"
really does milk some tense
drama out of the confrontation
between the pro and the upstart.
The drawbacks are too many,
however, the situations too pre
dictable and the ending inexcus
ably arbitrary and unsatisfying-
And most of all the wholesale
borrowing of a successful for
mula with few or no alterations
or innovations and conisderably
less dramatic worth negates
most of the movie's appeal.
