# 'The Knack' Explicates Fine Art Of 'Getting It'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Colin is a mousy looking and
acting schoolteacher who owns
an authentic stained-glass-horror
house in London. He definitely
has not got "the knack"; how
ever, his boarder upstairs, Tolen,
just as definitely has got it, and,
consequently, "gets it" five
hours a day.
In his black suit, black shoes,
black tie, and black gloves, he
hotfoots it to and from engage
ments on a motorcycle, and his
whole life is an endless round
of caressing, undressing, "get
ting," caressing, and dressing.
Colin, whose whole life is an end
less round of teaching little boys
that "the angle of incidence
equals the angle of reflection,"
is dissatisfied and would like to
"get it,""the knack," that is. So
he bogs Tolen to teach him, and
Tolen reluctantly agrees.
Enter Tom, who has a virgin
ity complex and goes around
painling everything white- And
enter the girl, Rita Tushingham,
who is Tolen's downfall. Colin
and Tom meet her as they are
buying a new bed for Colin, a
bigger one, "just in case." They
promise to take her to the
YWCA, so she helps them roll
the bed all the way across Lon
don, which, as they ingeniously
demonstrate, is quite a trick.
Tolen and Rita
Tolen meets Rita and decides
to use her to teach Colin "the
knack." Everything goes wrong:
Tom is a pest, naturally, and
Colin is a poor pupil. But Rita
is the real problem: she doesn't
want; to "do it" so that Tolen
can "get it." She wants to be
loved, of all things. So instead
of sighing, "I surrender," she
shrieks, "I've been raped!" She
hasn't actually; but she wants
to be.
Anyway, this failure (any
thing less than eager submission
is a failure) reduces Tolen to
virtual impotence. And although
Colin thus never "gets" "the
knack," he learns to love and be

loved, something Tolen's un
limited promiscuity would never
have taught him.
It almost seems unnecessary,
after that veritable forest of
quotation marks, to remark that
this movie is called "The Knack
. . . And How To Get It," or that
it is chock full of symbolism, all
sexual- On the other hand, it
seems very necessary to remark
upon what makes "The Knack"
so good.
Exaggeration
For one thing, a lot of the
comedy is lodged in subtle ex
aggeration, of Tolen's prowess,
of Colin's incompetence, of
Tom's chastity fixation. The rest
of it is in the irreverent irrelev
ance with which the cast flaunts
the respectable when rolling a
brass bedstead across London
or playing hide-and-seek in a
wall of old doors.
Roy Brooks, moreover, plays
Tolen with a sensual abandon
that would make the most hard
ened libertine blush. His hands
are like hypnotic feelers, at once
sizing up the prey and ensnar
ing it, and he moves with the
languid but menacing grace of
a panther about to spring, the
epitome of the successful sexual
athlete. Michael Crawford plays
Colin as a gamut of awkward
nesses, pathetically naive and
just as pathetic in his frantic
eagerness to master "the
knack."
Bristling Purity
Donald Donnelly bristles with
purity as Tom; and Rita Tush
ingham brilliantly plays the girl
whose paradoxes, gentle yet
strong, wide-eyed and cynical,
defenseless but resourceful, com
pletely defeat Tolen.
Over it all director Richard
Lester has thrown a subtle net
of understatement that, together
with a tightly written scenario,
makes the pace brisker, the jokes
funnier, the satire deadlier, the
pathos sadder, and"The Knack"
one of the best movies around.
