# Limited Vandalism During Big Games
## 
### 
"Vandalism on the Stanford
campus this year is almost nil,"
commented Chief Gordon Davis
of the Stanford Police Depart
ment yesterday afternoon.
The greatest number of inci
dents occur during Big Game
Week when Stanford and Cal ex
change RF's. Davis said that this
Big Game week is not unusual
with a small number of "good
stunts" from both sides. In gen
eral. the cases of vandalism here
are on the decline, he continued-
In 1963, there were 29 cases of
vandalism. This number dipped
to 19 in 1964, and in the first
nine months of 1965, 14 incidents
occured.
The painting of "Cal" and C's
on the sidewalks that has oc
curred this year are not the ex
tent of "pranks" that have oc
curred in the past. Last year,
damages reached nearly $600
which was the highest in the
past five year's.
These destructive RF's includ
ed the dyeing of Mom Claw gold,
inscribing "Cal" in blue and
gold on the church bells, and the
theft of one bell from the tower-
Also, numerous defamations
were written on the bookstore
and the benches surrounding the
fountain.
In 1958, five Cal men were ar
rested when they painted Hoover

Tower's windows, doors, and
walls for $2,000 damage. On the
sidewalk in front of the tower,
they wrote, "The only good In
dian is a dead Indian. Cal—69,
Stanford—o,"
That year the U.C. men also
painted the right tower at the
entrance to Memorial Court as
well as several plaques in the
court. Also in blue and gold were
the C's on the Art Gallery steps.
Hoover Tower had to have the
extra paint removed and then
was sandblasted and repainted.
As Stanford had attempted to
saw down the Cal goalposts that
same weekend, the Daily ran an
editorial commenting on the sit
uation. "On the surface these
'pranks' may seem humorous
. . . but in reality they are van
dalism especially unbecoming to
students of respected universi
ties-" The editorial continued,
"To indulge in such childish —
and expensive — antics does not
denote loyalty to a school, rather
the opposite."
Other cases of vandalism have
included the theft of Chief Light
foot's headdress worth over a
hundred dollars.
The funds for repairing the
damages to the campus come
from a special vandalism fund,
which is part of the grounds
maintenance budget.

In 1963, there were 29 cases of
vandalism. This number dipped
to 19 in 1964, and in the first
nine months of 1965, 14 incidents
occured.
The painting of "Cal" and C's
on the sidewalks that has oc
curred this year are not the ex
tent of "pranks" that have oc
curred in the past. Last year,
damages reached nearly $600
which was the highest in the
past five year's.
These destructive RF's includ
ed the dyeing of Mom Claw gold,
inscribing "Cal" in blue and
gold on the church bells, and the
theft of one bell from the tower-
Also, numerous defamations
were written on the bookstore
and the benches surrounding the
fountain.
In 1958, five Cal men were ar
rested when they painted Hoover

Tower's windows, doors, and
walls for $2,000 damage. On the
sidewalk in front of the tower,
they wrote, "The only good In
dian is a dead Indian. Cal—69,
Stanford—o,"
That year the U.C. men also
painted the right tower at the
entrance to Memorial Court as
well as several plaques in the
court. Also in blue and gold were
the C's on the Art Gallery steps.
Hoover Tower had to have the
extra paint removed and then
was sandblasted and repainted.
As Stanford had attempted to
saw down the Cal goalposts that
same weekend, the Daily ran an
editorial commenting on the sit
uation. "On the surface these
'pranks' may seem humorous
. . . but in reality they are van
dalism especially unbecoming to
students of respected universi
ties-" The editorial continued,
"To indulge in such childish —
and expensive — antics does not
denote loyalty to a school, rather
the opposite."
Other cases of vandalism have
included the theft of Chief Light
foot's headdress worth over a
hundred dollars.
The funds for repairing the
damages to the campus come
from a special vandalism fund,
which is part of the grounds
maintenance budget.
"Vandalism on the Stanford
campus this year is almost nil,"
commented Chief Gordon Davis
of the Stanford Police Depart
ment yesterday afternoon.
The greatest number of inci
dents occur during Big Game
Week when Stanford and Cal ex
change RF's. Davis said that this
Big Game week is not unusual
with a small number of "good
stunts" from both sides. In gen
