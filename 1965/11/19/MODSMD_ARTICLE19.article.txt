# 'Beat Cal!' Means Win The War Of RF's
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
OK, Stanford men, when I
shout "Beat Cal!" everybody go
crazy.
That's what Big Game is all
about, you know â€” building a
frenzy of spirit to unite all as
sorted members of Stanford Uni
versity. Red and White day, Ban
the Bear buttons, rallies, bon
fires and, above al, ingenious
pranks to demoralize Cal rooters
are the manifestations of this
real Big Game.
On Saturday two determined
varsity elevens fight out their
last football game of the year,
but that contest involves at most
sixty men. The war of spirit,
acted out through Big Game tra
ditions, involves thousands of
students at each campus.
Beat Cal!
Big Game traditions are as
ancient as the ivy on the old
Student Union, and will probably
last a lot longer. The Gaities,
for example, date back to 1909,
when the "Follies of Stanford"
cheered discouraged Stanford
rooters with "good, clean"
vaudeville routines after a loss
to Cal.
But the strongest tradition of
all is the Big Game "RF". Back
in 1904, the Daily announced
that rooters at the Big Game
rally "got another chance to
cheer when the famous Califor
nia 'Big C' fence was carried in."
The fence, stolen by Stanford
RFers, wag burned as a "hoo
doo," which is 19th century slang
for something-or-other.
A classic Stanford RF is paint
ing Cal's big yellow "C" in vivid
cardinal- First record of this feat
is in 1918, when "the sun rose
over the Berkeley hills this
morning to show the big "C"
painted with thirteen gallons of
the fi.iest red paint."
Some aspiring scholar, perhaps
doing research for his PhD
thesis, took a paint scraper in
hand and discovered in 1942 that
the "C" had been painted 120

times since it was built: the first
80 layers were yellow and the
next 40 were alternately red and
yellow.
Cal, not to be outdone in the
RF game, perennially ignites the
Stanford bonfire before the tra
ditional Friday rally can begin.
Since the pyre is usually 60 l'eet
high and doused in gasoline, the
problems of keeping it unlit are
formidible.
Cal will risk life, fortune and
sacred honor to ignite the Bon
fire. In 1921, just 18 years after
the first successful flight of an
airplane, two Cal planes swoop
ed out of the sky and dropped
two bombs on the pyre. Both
bombs were near misses, and the
Daily exulted, "Chalk up a de
feat for the Gold and Blue!"
Last year Cal did light the
bonfire prematurely, and the
Big Game rally chant became
a somber "Cal Will Pay!" They
did, and so did the foolhardy
Cal RFer who threw a flare into
the gasoline-doused pyre. He
barely escaped with his life.
The 1965 bonfire, which is be
ing thrown together by fresh
men today in the shape of Berk
eley's Campanile, will be guard
ed with a vengeance by the en
tire freshman football team and
other vigilantes organized by
bonfire chairman Dick Roth.
Roth flatly claims that "A mine
is the only way it can be set
oil."
Yesterday this reporter fool
isly gloated to a Daily Californ
ian staffer that they'll never
pull the bonfire RF this year
without a mine. He only smiled
knowingly. Watch out, fresh
men.
The most famous RFs of all
involve the Stanford Axe. which
has changed hands through
courageous plots which consti
tute the greatest constructive
efforts of Stanford studentry
(don't take my word for it, just
ask any Axe Comm chairman).
The latest edition of Immortal

21 feats (see page 5) camp last
month when Cal invaders took a
sledgehammer to the Axe's case
in Tresidder. They had punctur
ed just a few of the 18 lamina
tions of plexiglass when police
arrived, alerted by a silent
alarm. Axe Comm's Biff Barn
ard then stashed the Axe away
in the vault of the Stanford
Bank for safekeeping. When it
come out for the Bonfire rally
tonight, it will be carried out
between the broad shoulders of
an elite guard of freshman foot
ball players.
The great age of Axe thefts,
when Stanford and Cal red hots
could pick locks and break com
binations to run off with the
treasured symbol, are over. We
take Big Game warfare to ser
iously now.
Axe thefts are the most spec
tacular RFs, but the eonsumate
RF in the 73-year history of Big
Game involved a few drops of
a stinking chemical. It never
came off.
Beat Cal!
The stink-bomb caper, which
was attempted last year by the
anonymous members of SURF,
planned to set off twelve stink
bombs in the Cal rooting section
at half-time, sending Bear fans
streaming to the exits to escape
the stench. The bombs were
planted when a rainstorm wash
ed away the fresh cement which
hid the ignition wires. Berkeley
custodians foiled the plot, so
SURF had to content itself with
stealing the Bear's cannon.
Twice.
What really frustrates the
modern RFer is not vaults, burly
guards and burglar alarms, but
the knowledge that every prank
has been done several dozens
times before- We lack origin
ality.
I can imagine only one origin
al RF: freshmen, instead of
burning a fake Campanile to
night, burn the real Campanile.
They'll never top that.
