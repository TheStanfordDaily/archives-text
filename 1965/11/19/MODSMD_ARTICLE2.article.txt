# $50,000 Tower Burns At SLAC
## 
### KIRK HANSON Staff Editor 
A nearly-completed water cooling
tower at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center was damaged extensive
ly by fire yesterday afternoon. A
SLAC Plant Engineering official re
ported the structure over half de
stroyed and estimated the damage at
$50,000.
Three men were working in the
redwood and asbestos tower when the
lire broke out at 3 p.m. It apparently
started when two of them were weld
ing. The fire spread quickly up four
redwood lattice-work shafts and shat
tered the cement-asbestos walls of the
tower.
Two volunteer fire units connected
with SLAC responded immediately
and units from the Stanford Fire
Department arrived minutes later. A
sprinkler system in the tower was not
fully operative and failed to aid the
firemen.
