# Operation ‘Immortal 21’ Highlights Spirited History of Stanford Axe
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
The Axe, which today is well
guarded in a hank vault deep
in the freeway muze of the
Peninsula, has not always been
a trophy to he passed from hand
to hand.
Conceived in 1899 as a gim
mick to boost Indian spirit for
a Stanford-Cal athletic contest,
the Axe's worth assumed mono
lithic proportions when Bear
rooters snatched the Axe from
under Indian noses at an ath
letic tussle.
Stanford has had the Axe four
years now and more lhan once
has had to withstand an assault
from the north.
Axe Originates
In 1899, iu a burst of inspira
tion by an Indian cheerleader,
the spirit of the Axe Yell was
materialized. During that school
year, Stanford had lost to Cal
in both football and basketball,
and, with spirits drooping, a
baseball encounter was ap
proaching.
A giant bonfire and rally was
scheduled for centerfield of the
baseball diamond to urge Indian
athletes on to their best per
formances. The rally was held
April 15, 1899, two days before
the baseball game.
Billy Erb, the head yell leader
at the time, saw that something
extra was needed to boost Stan
ford's resolve to beat their
Berkeley brethren.
First Bear Beheaded
He had a 15 inch tomahawk
shaped axe made, and painted
red with a big white "S" on
either side of the head. At the
rally Erb sharpened the Axe and
amid screams of "give 'em the
Axe!", chased and caught an
effigy of a bear, beheaded it,
and threw it into the fire.
At the game, held in San Fran
cisco, the yell leaders brought

the Axe along and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
the game, 9-7.
Later Paul Castlehun, a Cal
football player, snatched the
Axe, and the Cal mob took off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco. Stanford hurdler Frank
St rout grabbed the Axe back,
but he was in turn caught by
Cal "wonder quarterback" Jim
Hopper.
81 Year Exile
The Axe reposed away from
home for the next 31 years. Its
only exposure to the outside
world was once a year at the
rally before the Stanford-Cal
baseball game.
Moroni Jameson, a Stanford
student, actually carried the Axe
into the bank after the 1927 ral
ly. but he was in the midst of a
throng of Cal students and
could not make an exit.
An attempted steal was
thwarted in 1929 when the Los
Angeles Police Dept. would not
supply tear gas bombs.
The "Immortal 21" made their
attempt in 1930. This fabled
group of gentlemen, 21 strong,
satisfied 31 years of grieved
Stanford feelings ten times over.
According to a 1958 interview
with one of them, Matt Lehman,
a Speech and Drama instructor
at Stanford, the plan to regain
the Axe was formally hatched
only two days before the event.
April First Prank
Lehman said he was ap
proached by Gerald Brett man,
who asked, "Matt, do you want
to steal the Axe?" An organiza
tional meeting was held Tues
day, ironically on April 1.
It was decided to pose as
photographers and to set off a
large charge of flash powder
plus a tear gas bomb and grab
the Axe in the ensuing com
motion.
Three cars left for Cal at 4:30

Thursday afternoon, April 3,
1930. One car went to the bank,
another to the Greek Theatre at
Cal where the rally was to be
held, and the other to join in
the parade to the theater.
Five minutes before the rally
ended one group left for the
bank to warn the "camera crew"
to set up. Art Miller was sta
tioned at the door of the bank
with the tear gas bomb under
his overcoat.
Picture Ruse Succeeds
Within moments the armored
truck with the Axe drove into
view. Hanging onto it and riding
on the roof were six Stanford
men. The freshmen guards fell
easily for the picture ruse and
stood back. Norm Horner, the
custodian of the Axe would not
come out to the truck at first.
Finally, he did, and just as he
hit the ground a giant flash of
powder exploded.
Howard Avery pounced on
Horner from the top of the
truck and wrenched the Axe
away. The Axe head was re
moved from the handle and Rob
ert Loofbourow tucked it under
his sweater, calmly walking out
of the crowd just as Miller det
onated his tear gas bomb.
The mob pushed into the bank
to escape the fumes. They
thought Avery had the Axe, and
they had him in their grasp.
Bettman and Eric Hill went to

Avery's rescue. Thanks to tlie
gas, they escaped.
Pursuit Foiled
To delay the Cal crowd, Stan
ford men in the mob yelled for
an organizational gathering at
the Campanile. A Cal convoy
finally got underway, but a
Stanford grad student, "Red"
Okkre, was attendant at the San
Mateo Bridge. He found out
what was happening and raised
the drawbridge while holding a
small axe in the control room
window, much to Cal's conster
nation.
Meanwhile, Loofbourow and
James Trimingham had been
speeding away. Originally, they
had intended to go to Triming
ham's father's ranch in nearby
Niies Canyon. But they decided
to go to campus instead. An
impromptu rally was then held
at Roble after a parade through
the campus.
Stanford Elated
The next day classes were
called off, and a huge rally was
held in front of the library. Fol
lowing the rally, the Axe was
escorted to the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo Alto
by "Tiny" Thornhill, Harry Ma
loney, Don Leibendorfer, A 1
Masters, Jake Erwin, Chuck
Winterbaum, and Johnny Pres
ton among others.
The ex-com of ASSU voted the
"21" all varsity letters.

The next day Horner, who hat!
lost the Axe, pitched and hit
Cal to a 7-6 win over Stanford.
But nothing could take away the
glory that was Stanford's for
regaining the Axe.
The "Immortal 21" turned the
Axe over to the Board of Ath
letic Control later in order that
the BAC become its permanent
guardian.

Stanford. The Axe and Stanford

"If men and women here on

should propose that Cal put up
their Golden Bear along with
the Cardinal Axe as the Big

the Axe 19 times. In that same

shaped axe made, and painted
red with a big white "S" on
either side of the head. At the
rally Erb sharpened the Axe and
amid screams of "give 'em the
Axe!", chased and caught an
effigy of a bear, beheaded it,
and threw it into the fire.
At the game, held in San Fran
cisco, the yell leaders brought

the Axe along and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
the game, 9-7.
Later Paul Castlehun, a Cal
football player, snatched the
Axe, and the Cal mob took off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco. Stanford hurdler Frank
St rout grabbed the Axe back,
but he was in turn caught by
Cal "wonder quarterback" Jim
Hopper.
81 Year Exile
The Axe reposed away from
home for the next 31 years. Its
only exposure to the outside
world was once a year at the
rally before the Stanford-Cal
baseball game.
Moroni Jameson, a Stanford
student, actually carried the Axe
into the bank after the 1927 ral
ly. but he was in the midst of a
throng of Cal students and
could not make an exit.
An attempted steal was
thwarted in 1929 when the Los
Angeles Police Dept. would not
supply tear gas bombs.
The "Immortal 21" made their
attempt in 1930. This fabled
group of gentlemen, 21 strong,
satisfied 31 years of grieved
Stanford feelings ten times over.
According to a 1958 interview
with one of them, Matt Lehman,
a Speech and Drama instructor
at Stanford, the plan to regain
the Axe was formally hatched
only two days before the event.
April First Prank
Lehman said he was ap
proached by Gerald Brett man,
who asked, "Matt, do you want
to steal the Axe?" An organiza
tional meeting was held Tues
day, ironically on April 1.
It was decided to pose as
photographers and to set off a
large charge of flash powder
plus a tear gas bomb and grab
the Axe in the ensuing com
motion.
Three cars left for Cal at 4:30

Thursday afternoon, April 3,
1930. One car went to the bank,
another to the Greek Theatre at
Cal where the rally was to be
held, and the other to join in
the parade to the theater.
Five minutes before the rally
ended one group left for the
bank to warn the "camera crew"
to set up. Art Miller was sta
tioned at the door of the bank
with the tear gas bomb under
his overcoat.
Picture Ruse Succeeds
Within moments the armored
truck with the Axe drove into
view. Hanging onto it and riding
on the roof were six Stanford
men. The freshmen guards fell
easily for the picture ruse and
stood back. Norm Horner, the
custodian of the Axe would not
come out to the truck at first.
Finally, he did, and just as he
hit the ground a giant flash of
powder exploded.
Howard Avery pounced on
Horner from the top of the
truck and wrenched the Axe
away. The Axe head was re
moved from the handle and Rob
ert Loofbourow tucked it under
his sweater, calmly walking out
of the crowd just as Miller det
onated his tear gas bomb.
The mob pushed into the bank
to escape the fumes. They
thought Avery had the Axe, and
they had him in their grasp.
Bettman and Eric Hill went to

Avery's rescue. Thanks to tlie
gas, they escaped.
Pursuit Foiled
To delay the Cal crowd, Stan
ford men in the mob yelled for
an organizational gathering at
the Campanile. A Cal convoy
finally got underway, but a
Stanford grad student, "Red"
Okkre, was attendant at the San
Mateo Bridge. He found out
what was happening and raised
the drawbridge while holding a
small axe in the control room
window, much to Cal's conster
nation.
Meanwhile, Loofbourow and
James Trimingham had been
speeding away. Originally, they
had intended to go to Triming
ham's father's ranch in nearby
Niies Canyon. But they decided
to go to campus instead. An
impromptu rally was then held
at Roble after a parade through
the campus.
Stanford Elated
The next day classes were
called off, and a huge rally was
held in front of the library. Fol
lowing the rally, the Axe was
escorted to the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo Alto
by "Tiny" Thornhill, Harry Ma
loney, Don Leibendorfer, A 1
Masters, Jake Erwin, Chuck
Winterbaum, and Johnny Pres
ton among others.
The ex-com of ASSU voted the
"21" all varsity letters.

The next day Horner, who hat!
lost the Axe, pitched and hit
Cal to a 7-6 win over Stanford.
But nothing could take away the
glory that was Stanford's for
regaining the Axe.
The "Immortal 21" turned the
Axe over to the Board of Ath
letic Control later in order that
the BAC become its permanent
guardian.

group of gentlemen, 21 strong,
satisfied 31 years of grieved
Stanford feelings ten times over.
According to a 1958 interview
with one of them, Matt Lehman,
a Speech and Drama instructor
at Stanford, the plan to regain
the Axe was formally hatched
only two days before the event.
April First Prank
Lehman said he was ap
proached by Gerald Brett man,
who asked, "Matt, do you want
to steal the Axe?" An organiza
tional meeting was held Tues
day, ironically on April 1.
It was decided to pose as
photographers and to set off a
large charge of flash powder
plus a tear gas bomb and grab
the Axe in the ensuing com
motion.
Three cars left for Cal at 4:30

Thursday afternoon, April 3,
1930. One car went to the bank,
another to the Greek Theatre at
Cal where the rally was to be
held, and the other to join in
the parade to the theater.
Five minutes before the rally
ended one group left for the
bank to warn the "camera crew"
to set up. Art Miller was sta
tioned at the door of the bank
with the tear gas bomb under
his overcoat.
Picture Ruse Succeeds
Within moments the armored
truck with the Axe drove into
view. Hanging onto it and riding
on the roof were six Stanford
men. The freshmen guards fell
easily for the picture ruse and
stood back. Norm Horner, the
custodian of the Axe would not
come out to the truck at first.
Finally, he did, and just as he
hit the ground a giant flash of
powder exploded.
Howard Avery pounced on
Horner from the top of the
truck and wrenched the Axe
away. The Axe head was re
moved from the handle and Rob
ert Loofbourow tucked it under
his sweater, calmly walking out
of the crowd just as Miller det
onated his tear gas bomb.
The mob pushed into the bank
to escape the fumes. They
thought Avery had the Axe, and
they had him in their grasp.
Bettman and Eric Hill went to

Avery's rescue. Thanks to tlie
gas, they escaped.
Pursuit Foiled
To delay the Cal crowd, Stan
ford men in the mob yelled for
an organizational gathering at
the Campanile. A Cal convoy
finally got underway, but a
Stanford grad student, "Red"
Okkre, was attendant at the San
Mateo Bridge. He found out
what was happening and raised
the drawbridge while holding a
small axe in the control room
window, much to Cal's conster
nation.
Meanwhile, Loofbourow and
James Trimingham had been
speeding away. Originally, they
had intended to go to Triming
ham's father's ranch in nearby
Niies Canyon. But they decided
to go to campus instead. An
impromptu rally was then held
at Roble after a parade through
the campus.
Stanford Elated
The next day classes were
called off, and a huge rally was
held in front of the library. Fol
lowing the rally, the Axe was
escorted to the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo Alto
by "Tiny" Thornhill, Harry Ma
loney, Don Leibendorfer, A 1
Masters, Jake Erwin, Chuck
Winterbaum, and Johnny Pres
ton among others.
The ex-com of ASSU voted the
"21" all varsity letters.

The next day Horner, who hat!
lost the Axe, pitched and hit
Cal to a 7-6 win over Stanford.
But nothing could take away the
glory that was Stanford's for
regaining the Axe.
The "Immortal 21" turned the
Axe over to the Board of Ath
letic Control later in order that
the BAC become its permanent
guardian.
Ax« —Symbol or Trophy?
Thai was not to be, as an
editorial in The Daily of April
7, 1930 presaged.

Stanford put up its Axe as a
Big Game trophy, to be kept by
the winner of the annual Cardi
nal-Bear football classic . . .
"The Axe is not, and never
was a trophy to be passed from

Stanford. The Axe and Stanford
are inalienable . . .
"If men and women here on

the Axe 19 times. In that same

Trojan" of IJSC ever been pil

The Axe, which today is well
guarded in a hank vault deep
in the freeway muze of the
Peninsula, has not always been
a trophy to he passed from hand
to hand.
Conceived in 1899 as a gim
mick to boost Indian spirit for
a Stanford-Cal athletic contest,
the Axe's worth assumed mono
lithic proportions when Bear
rooters snatched the Axe from
under Indian noses at an ath
letic tussle.
Stanford has had the Axe four
years now and more lhan once
has had to withstand an assault
from the north.
Axe Originates
In 1899, iu a burst of inspira
tion by an Indian cheerleader,
the spirit of the Axe Yell was
materialized. During that school
year, Stanford had lost to Cal
in both football and basketball,
and, with spirits drooping, a
baseball encounter was ap
proaching.
A giant bonfire and rally was
scheduled for centerfield of the
baseball diamond to urge Indian
athletes on to their best per
formances. The rally was held
April 15, 1899, two days before
the baseball game.
Billy Erb, the head yell leader
at the time, saw that something
extra was needed to boost Stan
ford's resolve to beat their
Berkeley brethren.
First Bear Beheaded
He had a 15 inch tomahawk
shaped axe made, and painted
red with a big white "S" on
either side of the head. At the
rally Erb sharpened the Axe and
amid screams of "give 'em the
Axe!", chased and caught an
effigy of a bear, beheaded it,
and threw it into the fire.
At the game, held in San Fran
cisco, the yell leaders brought

the Axe along and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
the game, 9-7.
Later Paul Castlehun, a Cal
football player, snatched the
Axe, and the Cal mob took off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco. Stanford hurdler Frank
St rout grabbed the Axe back,
but he was in turn caught by
Cal "wonder quarterback" Jim
Hopper.
81 Year Exile
The Axe reposed away from
home for the next 31 years. Its
only exposure to the outside
world was once a year at the
rally before the Stanford-Cal
baseball game.
Moroni Jameson, a Stanford
student, actually carried the Axe
into the bank after the 1927 ral
ly. but he was in the midst of a
throng of Cal students and
could not make an exit.
An attempted steal was
thwarted in 1929 when the Los
Angeles Police Dept. would not

easily for the picture ruse and
stood back. Norm Horner, the
custodian of the Axe would not
come out to the truck at first.
Finally, he did, and just as he
hit the ground a giant flash of
powder exploded.
Howard Avery pounced on
Horner from the top of the
truck and wrenched the Axe
away. The Axe head was re
moved from the handle and Rob
ert Loofbourow tucked it under
his sweater, calmly walking out
of the crowd just as Miller det
onated his tear gas bomb.
The mob pushed into the bank
to escape the fumes. They
thought Avery had the Axe, and
they had him in their grasp.
Bettman and Eric Hill went to

Avery's rescue. Thanks to tlie
gas, they escaped.
Pursuit Foiled
To delay the Cal crowd, Stan
ford men in the mob yelled for
an organizational gathering at
the Campanile. A Cal convoy
finally got underway, but a
Stanford grad student, "Red"
Okkre, was attendant at the San
Mateo Bridge. He found out
what was happening and raised
the drawbridge while holding a
small axe in the control room
window, much to Cal's conster
nation.
Meanwhile, Loofbourow and
James Trimingham had been
speeding away. Originally, they
had intended to go to Triming
ham's father's ranch in nearby
Niies Canyon. But they decided
to go to campus instead. An
impromptu rally was then held
at Roble after a parade through
the campus.
Stanford Elated
The next day classes were
called off, and a huge rally was
held in front of the library. Fol
lowing the rally, the Axe was
escorted to the vault of the
American Trust Co. in Palo Alto
by "Tiny" Thornhill, Harry Ma
loney, Don Leibendorfer, A 1
Masters, Jake Erwin, Chuck
Winterbaum, and Johnny Pres
ton among others.
The ex-com of ASSU voted the
"21" all varsity letters.

The next day Horner, who hat!
lost the Axe, pitched and hit
Cal to a 7-6 win over Stanford.
But nothing could take away the
glory that was Stanford's for
regaining the Axe.
The "Immortal 21" turned the
Axe over to the Board of Ath
letic Control later in order that
the BAC become its permanent
guardian.
Ax« —Symbol or Trophy?
Thai was not to be, as an
editorial in The Daily of April
7, 1930 presaged.
"It has been proposed that
Stanford put up its Axe as a
Big Game trophy, to be kept by
the winner of the annual Cardi
nal-Bear football classic . . .
"The Axe is not, and never
was a trophy to be passed from

Stanford. The Axe and Stanford
are inalienable . . .
"If men and women here on
the Farm are inclined to treat
this matter seriously, they
should propose that Cal put up
their Golden Bear along with
the Cardinal Axe as the Big

day in 1930 Stanford has lost
the Axe 19 times. In that same
period of time, Navy has not.
lost her goat nor has "Tommy
Trojan" of IJSC ever been pil
fered.
The Axe, which today is well
guarded in a hank vault deep
in the freeway muze of the
Peninsula, has not always been
a trophy to he passed from hand
to hand.
Conceived in 1899 as a gim
mick to boost Indian spirit for
a Stanford-Cal athletic contest,
the Axe's worth assumed mono
lithic proportions when Bear
rooters snatched the Axe from
under Indian noses at an ath
letic tussle.
Stanford has had the Axe four
years now and more lhan once
has had to withstand an assault
from the north.
Axe Originates
In 1899, iu a burst of inspira
tion by an Indian cheerleader,
the spirit of the Axe Yell was
materialized. During that school
year, Stanford had lost to Cal
in both football and basketball,
and, with spirits drooping, a
baseball encounter was ap
proaching.
A giant bonfire and rally was
scheduled for centerfield of the
baseball diamond to urge Indian
athletes on to their best per
formances. The rally was held
April 15, 1899, two days before
the baseball game.
Billy Erb, the head yell leader
at the time, saw that something
extra was needed to boost Stan
ford's resolve to beat their
Berkeley brethren.
First Bear Beheaded
He had a 15 inch tomahawk
shaped axe made, and painted
red with a big white "S" on
either side of the head. At the
rally Erb sharpened the Axe and
amid screams of "give 'em the
Axe!", chased and caught an
effigy of a bear, beheaded it,
and threw it into the fire.
At the game, held in San Fran
cisco, the yell leaders brought

the Axe along and paraded it
around the field. Stanford lost
the game, 9-7.
Later Paul Castlehun, a Cal
football player, snatched the
Axe, and the Cal mob took off
down the streets of San Fran
cisco. Stanford hurdler Frank
St rout grabbed the Axe back,
but he was in turn caught by
Cal "wonder quarterback" Jim
Hopper.
81 Year Exile
The Axe reposed away from
home for the next 31 years. Its
only exposure to the outside
world was once a year at the
rally before the Stanford-Cal
baseball game.
Moroni Jameson, a Stanford
student, actually carried the Axe
into the bank after the 1927 ral
ly. but he was in the midst of a
throng of Cal students and
could not make an exit.
An attempted steal was
thwarted in 1929 when the Los
Angeles Police Dept. would not
supply tear gas bombs.
The "Immortal 21" made their
attempt in 1930. This fabled
group of gentlemen, 21 strong,
satisfied 31 years of grieved
Stanford feelings ten times over.
According to a 1958 interview
with one of them, Matt Lehman,
a Speech and Drama instructor
at Stanford, the plan to regain
the Axe was formally hatched
only two days before the event.
April First Prank
Lehman said he was ap
proached by Gerald Brett man,
who asked, "Matt, do you want
to steal the Axe?" An organiza
tional meeting was held Tues
day, ironically on April 1.
It was decided to pose as
photographers and to set off a
large charge of flash powder
plus a tear gas bomb and grab
the Axe in the ensuing com
motion.
Three cars left for Cal at 4:30

Thursday afternoon, April 3,
1930. One car went to the bank,
another to the Greek Theatre at
Cal where the rally was to be
held, and the other to join in
the parade to the theater.
Five minutes before the rally
ended one group left for the
bank to warn the "camera crew"
to set up. Art Miller was sta
tioned at the door of the bank
with the tear gas bomb under
his overcoat.
Picture Ruse Succeeds
Within moments the armored
truck with the Axe drove into
view. Hanging onto it and riding
on the roof were six Stanford
men. The freshmen guards fell
easily for the picture ruse and
stood back. Norm Horner, the
custodian of the Axe would not
come out to the truck at first.
