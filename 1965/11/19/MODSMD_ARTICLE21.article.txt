# Prince Lightfoot Dancing Strong
## 
### 
He's been in more Big Games
than any other Indian. Tomor
row will be Number 15, and he's
still going strong.
It all started in 1951, when
Timm Williams, alias Prince
Liglrtfoot, wrote ASSU Presi
dent Wayne Alley that he want
ed to see Big Game, and that
he would like to do an Indian
dance at pre-game festivities.
He got Big Game tickets and
tickets to Gaieties, danced at the
Friday night rally, and hasn't
missed a Big Game since. But it
wasn't that easy.
After the first rally he was
asked if he would be the team's
mascot permanently. He said
he'd like to, but that he didn't
feel that he could unless most
of the school wanted him to,
and they had never shown that
they did.
Permanent Mascot
Next year, the night before
the nationally-televised victory
over Michigan, Light foot danced
at the rally in the sunken dia
mond. After his dance the ASSU
President left it up to the crowd:
"Do you want to keep him?"
They did, and he hasn't missed
a home game since.
In addition to his job and his
duties here, Williams is a chief
of the Yourok Indian tribe- The
Youroks are currently engaged
in a fight with state and federal
authorities over fishing rights
and charges that Yourok land is
being taken without compensa
tion.

"Being the Stanford Indian
makes a lot of difference." he

say*. "When I go before the
press it gives more importance
to what I'm saying, and I get
a number of speaking engage
ments each week because of it."
Lightfoot says that he thinks
this year's rooting section is the
best in recent years. "But no one
has ever had a perfect one," he
says,"and it could be a really
great boost for the team and the
whole school."
He feels that, students "should
take more pride in what they are
doing, and not goof off in the
rooting section." Everyone has
a responsibility to his school and
the team, and if the football
players can spend two or three
hours a day practicing, students
could spend an hour a week
working on one school spirit
committee or another, according
to Lightfoot.
Axe Comm
While he does not think the
Axe Comm is doing a poor .job,
he would like to see more em
phasis 011 rallies and spirit than
on the eommittee's own social
activities.
"I went to an Axe Comm
party a few years ago, and all
t hey worried about was who had
the swimming pool for the next
party and how to get more beer.
They spent about 5 minutes
working on preparations for a
rally and their other work," he
said.
"Once in a while they'll phone
me up and ask me if I'm going
to be at a particular game, and
I can't understand why they do
this, because I haven't missed a
game yet."
