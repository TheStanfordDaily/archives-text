# Frosh Gestapo Patrol
## 
### DAVE CAMPISI 
"The effectiveness of our
group has boon shown by the
fact that nothing has happened
so far." With these words Mitt
Romney, chief of freshmen po
lice guarding the campus this
week, praised the nightly efforts
of his men.
Beginning officially last week
end. the group has students
guarding all the strategic points
on campus from dusk until
dawn. Approximately twenty
hearty, cold, tired students
stand guard in three-hour shifts
each night.
The policemen carry whistles
and airhorns with which to sum
mon help in case they cannot
handle the situation by them
selves. One student noted that
their favorite punishment for
troublemakers was "a good old
Stanford haircut."
Too Quiet
Because it has been so quiet
for the past week, the police
group expects quite a bit of ac
tion in these last two nights be
fore the game. The lack of ex
citement on the night patrols is
a source of concern for the chief
of the police unit.

"That's just the problemâ€”it
gels depressing for the kids 011
guard. They come out expecting
some action, and then nothing
happens. I think it really speaks

for their devotion that they keep
coming out."
Mem Claw has been Hie object
of constant surveillance against
Cal invaders, ever since Stan
ford students dyed a Berkeley
fountain red. Tlie only incident
in White Pla/a took place last
Friday night.
A UCLA supporter sat inno
cently by the side of the foun
tain for more than a half an
hour before he dropped a box
of detergent into it. Unfortu
nately the heavy rain kept po
lice from catching him. but they
noted that getting soaked to tlie
skin was enough punishment for
him.
Inside Information
Working from information
gained from an undercover trip
to Berkeley, tlie guard around
Hoover Tower Wednesday night
was increased to 35, and the
same number surrounded the
Band Shack. Several suspicious
looking cars drove passed these
strategic points, but the number
of guards scared the enemy
away from any actual contact.
Tn all, more than 100 freshmen
were spread out over the cam
pus that night and they did
their work well. Two Cal stu
dents were caught as they de
faced the firehouse doors and
were turned over to the police.
Perhaps the most exclusive

force is that which has guarded
the bonfire cadi night. Girls
have been seen among the ranks
of the defenders, and refresh
ments are served.
Remembering last year's bon
fire incident, the police force is
planning a massive show of
force around the structure to
prevent its premature ignition
by Gil students. The entire
Freshman football team, togeth
er with the musclemen of Otero
house, will form a wall around
it and allow no one inside.
