# BEAT CAL
## Seniors Ready For Final Effort 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Tomorrow afternoon in Stan
ford Stadium, thirteen Stanford
football players will be playing
in their final collegiate gridiron
encounter. One other, who will
definitely not see any action,
will witness his final chance to
play college football from the
Indian sidelines.
These fourteen seniors make
tip the belter percentage of the
strength of this year's squad.
Most of them will most prob
ably be lettermen, which in it
self shows the contribution they
have made.
The fourteen seniors are: Dale
Rubin, Gary Pettigrew (co-cap
taint, Bob Rath, Craig Ritchey,
Terry DeSylvia, Bruce Kehrli,
Phil Humphreys, Mike Connelly,
Don Cook, John Wilbur, Tom
Ross, Glenn Myers, Ray Hand

ley (co-captain), and Fergus
Flanagan.
The two co-captains Ray
Handley and Gary Pettigrew
have had very different seasons.
Pettigrew injured his leg in the
Navy game, underwent surgery,
and will miss the Big Game.
Handley is the leading Stanford
runner and scorer for the sea
son. He has given the Stanford
attack balanoe by combining
with the passing of Dave Lewis
to give the Tribe a diversified
offense.
Handley has scored 38 points
(6 TD's and a PAT) to place
eighth in the conference stand
ings. He is the fifth leading
rusher with 595 yards.
John Ralston, Stanford coach,
had some reflections on the sen
iors and the upcoming Big
Game: "From our point of view.

a special incentive is never nec
essary to get: the Stanford team
fired up for California. Our sen
iors have never lost to Califor
nia and are out to keep this rec
ord intact. Also, this football
team has the chance to become
the first to defeat California for
five straight years."
Player's Prattle
A few of the players had
things to say: DeSylvia: "The
last ballgame in college moans
a lot to seniors, and we're going
to really go out and try to get
a win." Humphreys: "We'll run
over the top of them."
Handley: "This one is a big
one and will gloss over a few
of the disappointments of the
season."
Pettigrew: "Any action I'll be
ready for will bo after the whis
tle and without the consent of

my coaches."
In addition to Handley, Mike
Connelly and Humphreys have
added to the strength of the of
fense. Their principal job was to
be on the receiving end of Lew
is' passes. Connelly is fifth in
receiving in the AAWIJ with 27
catches good for 335 yards.
Rath has given the Stanford
defense, 2nd in the AAWU,
stability at linebacker. He was
the lineman of the week for the
USC game, for he was able to
stymie MLke Garrett et al for
3 1 - quarters. He was also the
top lineman for t ho San Jose
game.
Kick Crew
DeSylvia and Cook form the
place kicking team, though both
see action at quarterback at
times. DeSylvia has taken over
for the departed Braden Beck.

His field goal with only seconds
remaining in the Air Force game
was the margin of victory in
Stanford's 17-Hi win.
Tackles don't generally get
much praise, bill every Stanford
football fan had the name Fer
gus Flanagan well entrenched in
his mind following the Oregon
gam e . Flanagan snagged a
tackle-eligible pass from Lewis
good for nine yards and the
winning touchdown with only
seconds remaining in the Ore
gon game.
Rubin and Ritchey team up to
do the greater number of kick
off and punt returns. Rubin set
up a Stanford field goal in the
Oregon game with a 60 yard ef
fort. F.oiii also see action on de
fense as starters. Rubin has
made a couple of key intercep
tions during the year.
