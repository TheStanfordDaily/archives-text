## Committee Of 15 Chairman Explains Union Hall Decison 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Certain recent statements ap
pearing in the Daily seem to re
flect a radical misconception of
the nature and functions of the
Committee of Fifteen. For ex
ample. in relation to the Union
Residence issue. Gary Pal ton
writes (Daily, November 17) that
"LASSU called on the Adminis
tration, through the Committee
of Fifteen, to stop the machine
ry until relevant issues had been
considered. The Committee of
Fifteen never bothered to ac
knowledge the charge, although
everyone pretends not to notice
this."
Several comments are in or
der:
1. Neither LASSU nor anyone
else can properly "call on the
Administration i hr o u g h the
Committee of Fifteen," since the
Committee of Fifteen is not an
agency of the Admiinstration.
The Committee includes five
members appointed by the Pres
ident of the University, five
members appointed by the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, and five members
appointed by LASSU. The Com
mittee represents faculty, stu
dents, and Administration on an
equal basis. Its function is to
discuss issues of importance
brought to it by any of the ap
pointing constituencies and, if a
consensus arises from such dis
cussions, to express that con

sensus in a purely advisory
capacity.
2. Neither LASSU nor anyone
else can call on the Committee
of Fifteen to "stop the machine
ry." The Committee has no pow
er in make decisions. The power
to make decisions was expressly
excluded when the Committee 1
was set up. It should be noted
that the students were particu
larly insistent on this point, evi
dently fearing that if the Com
mittee had decision - making
powers it might intervene in
student affairs to the detriment
of student autonomy.
3. If the Committee "never
bothered to acknowledge the
charge" it was because no
"charge" of the sort described
by Mr. Patton was given to the
Committee, nor could the Com
mittee have accepted such a
"charge" if it had been submit
ted.
What in fact happened was
that LASSU referred t he issue
of Union Residence to the Corn
mittee of Fifteen for discussion.
The Committee, after hearing
statements from each of the stu
dent members, voted 11-2 (2 ap
pointees of the Administration
bering absent) to adopt an ad
visory statement encouraging
efforts to minimize the disloca
tions by which the residents of
Union are threatened as a result
of the impending closing. If Mr.
Patton has a complaint, it is

that a joint committee of stu
dents, faculty and administra
tors failed to find the position
which Mr. Pat ton adopts suffi
ciently persuasive to warrant an
advisory endorsement of it.
Now Mr. Pat ton is, of course,
free to disagree with the opinion
of the Committee, but, by the
same token, the Committee is
surely free to disagree with the
opinion of Mr. Pat ton.

• Duck, Chief Davis
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the fact that Stan
ford does not receive taN rev
enue from its land, as do most
incorporated cities and towns, I
should like to suggest to Police
Chief Davis that in order to
make every penny of parking
permit money and ticket fines
help Stanford, that he reduce
the size of his overstaffed force,
whose tendencies toward ram
bunetiousness have got out of
hand recently, and that he use
the money thus saved to help
repave Palm Drive or to un
snarl the morning traffic jam.
Last year his mighty force was
unable to prevent a crooked bi
cycle dealer from Stockton from
coming in and stealing 150 bi
cycles, so are we getting the
kind of services from our police
that we should be getting?
