# Why Are Women Educated?

### SUSAN HEILMANN 
Why are women educated? A
nice, safe answer is always wo
men are educated to develop
their potential to become
happy career women or happy
housewives.
However, the philosophy of
education for Stanford women
tends to go a bit deeper. Taking
into acount both probable needs
and potential of the coeds who
graduate from Stanford, uni
versity academians see the pur
pose of education for women to
be twofold: first, to help them
develop an identity and prepare
for meaningful work, second, to
prepare them to give something
to society in return.
Nobody Wants Her
According to Dr. Elizabeth
Cohen, "Education should help
to tell a girl who she is, where
she's going and what she's good
for. And it's got to tell her
quickly, in her undergraduate
years. She's got to find out what
her talents are and develop
them during those immediate
post-graduation years, because
we know that if she tries to wait
till after she marries and her
children are grown, that NO
BODY wants her either grad
school or an employer. Because
of the push to get married and
the probability she will, a girl
has to be MORI'' organized,
MORE dedicated even than a
man."
And, according to Dr. Cohen,
identity does NOT equate with
merely keeping busy til mar
riage. "It's absolutely inexcus
able for a girl to take vocational
courses, to warp her undergrad
uate career and fall into a short
range occupation til she gets
married. Doesn't she know
she's going to live until she's
80? These college years are the
crucial time for finding her
identity. A woman can't suck an
identity out of her husband or
children she's got to develop
her own "
Quoting Dr. Nevitt Sanford
from his forth-coming book. Self
and Society, "The development
of the individual personality de
pends heavily upon the equality
of the sexes, in theory and ideo
logy as well as iti practice. And
the attainment of equality for
women depends on personality
development in women as well
as in men. Higher education can
itself go a Icing way toward de
veloping the kind of self-aware
ness that would accomplish both
these ends."
And. a further concern of edu
cation from Dr. Sanford Dorn
buseh, "Women need special
guidance to sustain their moti
vation. Thej need (o think about
what will happen to them -10
years from now. They need to
know that the trend, the fash
ion. is for women to combine
marriage and a career, and that
a larger and larger proportion

of them won't be satisfied with
diapers and dishes.
"Educating women does not
require special courses or cur
riculum. It does, however, re
quire special guidance. And I
don't feel Stanford is living up
to its responsibilities in this
area." According to Â£rof. Dorn
busch, several factors can hin
der the application of a woman's
education. The biggest is mar
riage. "It's a sociological fact
that a man's status is judged in
terms of his occupation, and a
woman's status is judged in
terms of her HUSBAND'S occu
pation" Women are constantly
aware of a pressure to marry
well, to settle their status.
Thus, a woman's work be
comes her secondary concern.
And, her career is almost cer
tain to be discontinuous. Also,
studies have shown 1 hat women
tend to plan their lives only a
few years at a time. The total
efect is almost certain to put the
pursuit of a career on shaky
ground.
3ntigating 'Senior Panic'
Dr. Cohen also feels the col
lege living situation should do
something to mitigate the con
tageousness of "senior panic" in
women's dorms. She highly fav
ors a program of contact for
women students both with the

dissatisfied middle aged women
who haven't gotten the most
from their education and with
younger women who are doing
something about finding then
identity and putting their edu
cation to use. She cites a Rad
eliffe program providing mone
tary support for women gradu
ate students in exchange for
their contact and accessibility to
undergraduate women. "Women
do need role models and con
tacts a few years ahead of them
who will be honest with them."
According to Dr. Sanford. evi
dence does tend to support the
assertion that it is those women
who do attend graduate schol,
who do at least, begin their
career experience before mar
riage, who gain the most in self
respect and self identity. They're
the women who. in middle age,
find it easiest to get a good job
and develop a satisfying role
outside the home.
But. according to Dr. Cohen,
the concern is not that women
employ their education in a
career per sc. Rather, women of
college caliber have a RESPONS
IBILITY. They have a duty to
be useful to society at large in
SOME capacity. States Dr. Wan
ford. "women who combine mar
riage and involvement in com
munity affairs live good, rich

a'nd rewarding lives they may
be doing more for humanity
than men trapped in largely
rou'inc 8-5 professional careers."
Quoting Dr. Sanford again
from Self and Society, "Our soc
iety, it appears, will have a con
tinuing need for trained intellec
tuals, but it may be doubted that
training should be limited to
the professions as t hey are now
defined. New professions need
to be developed. Our greatest
tasks at the present time have
to do with the development and
improvement of people, with the
expansion and enrichment of
Iheir lives, with the improve
ment of their relations to one
another, and with the develop
ment and maintenance of com
munities in which these things
are possible. These areas have
been neglected by men, and by
the professions that men have
designed and organized. In the
short run, at any rate, women
have here an almost unlimited
opportunity."
This is tho philosophy of wo
men's education:
Educat ion of women can prove
a prime mover in filling society's
needs. It can also prove just
about the only solution for ans
wering the individual woman's
needs.
The point is: Does it?
