## Student Boards And Tenure 
### 
There seems to be a trend in
universities these days to have
college students rate their pro
fessors. Some schools are even
setting up student boards to de
cide whether a teacher should
get tenure or not. If it contin
ues, we can well imagine the
following scene.
A board room with three som
ber students studying a dossier.
There is a timid knock on the
door. "Come in," one of the stu
dents shouts.
Enter Prof. Higgins*, nervous
ly biting his lip. The three stu
dents study him for almost a
minute. Then th e chairman
speaks: "You can smoke if you
want. Professor, this report does
not look very good. M says you
slur your words, have a very
annoying habit of clearing your
throat, and your handwriting on
the blackboard leaves much to
be desired."
"One More Chance"
"All I'm asking is another
chance," Prof. Higgins pleads.
One of the other students says,
"Higgins, 1 would like to remind
you that your parents went to
a great deal of trouble to make
you a professor. It this how you
repay them?"
"I'm sorry, gentlemen. It's
just that I've been writing my
book on Antarctic philosophy
and I haven't had enough time

to work on my lectures.'
"A likely story," another stu
dent says. "If you ask me,
you're probably spending too
much time thinking about your
wife and children. This is not
a country club, Higgins, and the
sooner your discover this the
bet ter off you're going to be."
The chairman says,"The re
port also states you give too
many exams and rely too much
on outside references. What do
you have to say to this?"
"I don't want to complain, but
tin' students are always picking
on me. I just can't seem to do
anything right."
"Higgins, I'd like to ask you
this question. How many hours
of television do you watch at:
night?"
"Two hours, maybe two ami a
hull."
"Why don't you cut it down
and shape up to your responsi
bilities? Decide what you want
out of life. Higgins. We're here
to help you, but we can't do it
if you don't help yourself."
"I'm trying to," Higgins says,
"but it isn't easy. There's so
much pressure on a professor
those days that I seem to lose
sight of my goal."
"Don't you think it's a simple
matter of discipline, Higgins?
You've got to Identify with your
subject matter. Here in there

port it says you're constantly
quoting from your own books.
Do you call thai teaching?''
Concentrate On Coeds
"Higgins," the chairman says,
"1 don't want to get off the
subject, but it also says in the
report you seem to concentrate
on the coeds in the first row
when you're lecturing. Do you
have any excuse for this?"
"No, sir."
"What are we going to do
with you. Higgins? What arc we
going to do with you?"
"Maybe I could tiike an apti
tude test. Perhaps I'm teaching
the wrong subject?"
"If we let every professor
teach the subject he was most
qualified for, Higgins. where
would the university be?
"Higgins. we're going to put
you on probation. We are going
to assign a student to tutor you
and you will report back in two
months. If you don't show any
improvement, we're going to
have to ask you to leave."
"Thank you, gentlemen. I'll
prove your faith in me. You
won't regret it."
"We like your spirit, Higgins.
Now let's see you measure up.
Good day."
The chairman takes out a new
dossier. "Who is next? Oh, no.
Not the Dean of the Law School
again?"
