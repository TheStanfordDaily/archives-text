# CAMPUS OPINION
## ‘The Plan' Triumphs Again As Union Residence Closes 
### CHUCK KLEYMEYER 
Too many members of the
Stanford community, upon read
ing of the Death of Union Resi
dence, are reacting by merely
folding their papers and mutter
ing into their steaming coffee
cups, "Well, that's too damn bad,
isn't it, old sport?"
The sole death wail that floats
across campus, weakly bemoans,
"Pity the outcast Union Girls,
thrown into the street by their
heartless landlord."
My only comment is Hum
bug and that will be my com
ment as long as people fail to
see the full significance of the
Union Death.
Problem Is Not Provincial
The problem faced by Union
Residence is not a provincial
one; it is one which faces every
student who lives on campus.
That is, are people going to be
taken into consideration when
administrative decisions a r e
handed down on housing. The
problem is not a matter of evic

lion but a matter of voice -are
people to run The Plan, or is
The Plan to run the people?
Will we be herded or heard?
So as you run a flag down
for the Vanquished Eighty of
Union Hall, run a flag down for
me too. Run a flag down for the
houses on the Row, whose days
(or years) are now numbered.
Run a flag down lor the Spon
sor System. In fact, run one
down for us all, laddie, for we've
all lost something here.
"Ah, but only wait until next
season," says Coach Mackenzie.
"Next season we'll stand our
ground." Shall 1 say ii again- -
humbug.
We have already acquiesced
and in that there is a certain
finality. For the monolith has
its blueprints and its plans. And
things will roll on and on unless
someone shouts, "My arm is
caught and twisted Stop the
machinery!"
li seems, unfortunately, that
only a parking ticket or auto fee
will elicit such a cry nowadays.
Man sits on his sensitivity and
rises only to add or hold fast to
a few more bucks.
And yet hundreds and hun
dreds of us signed the Save Un
ion petition (who could refuse,
the girls looked so sad). But
where are we now, we con
cerned souls? Back in the nir
vana of our glass and concrete
cells, cut off from relevant ac
tion by the metallic slam of our
dorm-room doors.
Return To Old S.U.
And in twenty years we will
return to Old S.U. to find a
large core of administrative
buildings, r'ngect at its remote
periphery by* a string of High
Rises and Stern Halls — ugly,
alienating, sterile, built with the
best of intentions, but pleasing
only to those who write the
catalogues. And we will all of
us chant, "I was a Stanford man
(sic.)."
So, what lo do? First, we
must recognize that the "dia
logue" which went on between
Union and the administration
was nearly all one-sided. Count
less petitions, suggestions, let
ters, etc. were stamped 'Re
ceived, such-and-such a date. Of
fice of the Dean of Students'
and handed back.
Second, we must attempt to
establish a viable, bilateral dia
logue between students and ad
ministration concerning the cre
ation of "residence communities
which will integrate intellectual
;md academic pursuits into their
living situations."
'Cowed Committee Members'
Third, we must demand recog
nition as, in a real sense, legiti
mate authorities on residence
living and refuse to persist in
being impotent yes-men and
cowed committee-members.
Fourth, we must request an
immediate and clear articulation
of the administration's Resi
dence Philosophy and ask that
on these grounds they justify
the Death of Union and prove
that the Union Decision em
braces this philosophy.
Fifth, we must recognize that
we do care where and how we
live and realize that there are
not only steps that should be
taken but steps that can be
taken. Still water makes no
noise. And contrary to popular
opinion, the administration is
not "out to get" the students—
they are generally acting in
good faith. It is our collective
silence which is at fault, which
allows the machinery to grind
on.
And so, finally, we must re
fuse to accept the demise of
that living group -Union —
which most closely approxi
mates the administration's pur
ported ideal. We must ask that
the administration place its
ideal, if it is an ideal, above its
habitual first consideration
spacial allocation.
In any case, we have seen an
Ideal fall, a good thing die. Let
us now resurrect it . . . in one
form or a not her.

Second, we must attempt to
establish a viable, bilateral dia
logue between students and ad
ministration concerning the cre
ation of "residence communities

'Cowed Committee Members'
Third, we must demand recog
nition as, in a real sense, legiti
mate authorities on residence
living and refuse to persist in
being impotent yes-men and
cowed committee-members.
Fourth, we must request an
immediate and clear articulation
of the administration's Resi
dence Philosophy and ask that
on these grounds they justify
the Death of Union and prove
that the Union Decision em
braces this philosophy.
Fifth, we must recognize that
we do care where and how we
live and realize that there are
not only steps that should be
taken but steps that can be
taken. Still water makes no
noise. And contrary to popular
opinion, the administration is
not "out to get" the students—
they are generally acting in
good faith. It is our collective
silence which is at fault, which
allows the machinery to grind
on.
And so, finally, we must re
fuse to accept the demise of
that living group -Union —
which most closely approxi
mates the administration's pur
ported ideal. We must ask that
the administration place its
ideal, if it is an ideal, above its
habitual first consideration
spacial allocation.
In any case, we have seen an
Ideal fall, a good thing die. Let
us now resurrect it . . . in one
form or a not her.
Too many members of the
Stanford community, upon read
ing of the Death of Union Resi
dence, are reacting by merely
folding their papers and mutter
ing into their steaming coffee
cups, "Well, that's too damn bad,
isn't it, old sport?"
The sole death wail that floats
across campus, weakly bemoans,
"Pity the outcast Union Girls,
thrown into the street by their
heartless landlord."
My only comment is Hum
bug and that will be my com
ment as long as people fail to
see the full significance of the
Union Death.
Problem Is Not Provincial
The problem faced by Union
Residence is not a provincial
one; it is one which faces every
student who lives on campus.
That is, are people going to be
taken into consideration when
administrative decisions a r e
handed down on housing. The
problem is not a matter of evic

lion but a matter of voice -are
people to run The Plan, or is
The Plan to run the people?
Will we be herded or heard?
So as you run a flag down
for the Vanquished Eighty of
Union Hall, run a flag down for
me too. Run a flag down for the
houses on the Row, whose days
(or years) are now numbered.
Run a flag down lor the Spon
sor System. In fact, run one
down for us all, laddie, for we've
all lost something here.
"Ah, but only wait until next
season," says Coach Mackenzie.
"Next season we'll stand our
ground." Shall 1 say ii again- -
humbug.
We have already acquiesced
and in that there is a certain
finality. For the monolith has
its blueprints and its plans. And
things will roll on and on unless
someone shouts, "My arm is
caught and twisted Stop the
machinery!"
li seems, unfortunately, that
only a parking ticket or auto fee
will elicit such a cry nowadays.
Man sits on his sensitivity and
rises only to add or hold fast to
a few more bucks.
And yet hundreds and hun
dreds of us signed the Save Un
ion petition (who could refuse,
the girls looked so sad). But
where are we now, we con
cerned souls? Back in the nir
vana of our glass and concrete
cells, cut off from relevant ac
tion by the metallic slam of our
dorm-room doors.
Return To Old S.U.
And in twenty years we will
return to Old S.U. to find a
large core of administrative
buildings, r'ngect at its remote
periphery by* a string of High
Rises and Stern Halls — ugly,
alienating, sterile, built with the
best of intentions, but pleasing
only to those who write the
catalogues. And we will all of
us chant, "I was a Stanford man
(sic.)."
So, what lo do? First, we
must recognize that the "dia
logue" which went on between
Union and the administration
was nearly all one-sided. Count
less petitions, suggestions, let
ters, etc. were stamped 'Re
ceived, such-and-such a date. Of

ground." Shall 1 say ii again- -
humbug.
We have already acquiesced
and in that there is a certain
finality. For the monolith has
its blueprints and its plans. And
things will roll on and on unless
someone shouts, "My arm is
caught and twisted Stop the
machinery!"
li seems, unfortunately, that
only a parking ticket or auto fee
will elicit such a cry nowadays.
Man sits on his sensitivity and
rises only to add or hold fast to
a few more bucks.
And yet hundreds and hun
dreds of us signed the Save Un
ion petition (who could refuse,
the girls looked so sad). But
where are we now, we con
cerned souls? Back in the nir
vana of our glass and concrete
cells, cut off from relevant ac
tion by the metallic slam of our
dorm-room doors.
Return To Old S.U.
And in twenty years we will
return to Old S.U. to find a
large core of administrative
buildings, r'ngect at its remote
periphery by* a string of High
Rises and Stern Halls — ugly,
alienating, sterile, built with the
best of intentions, but pleasing
only to those who write the
catalogues. And we will all of
us chant, "I was a Stanford man
(sic.)."
So, what lo do? First, we
must recognize that the "dia
logue" which went on between
Union and the administration
was nearly all one-sided. Count
less petitions, suggestions, let
ters, etc. were stamped 'Re
ceived, such-and-such a date. Of
fice of the Dean of Students'
and handed back.
Second, we must attempt to
establish a viable, bilateral dia
logue between students and ad
ministration concerning the cre
ation of "residence communities
which will integrate intellectual
;md academic pursuits into their
living situations."
'Cowed Committee Members'
Third, we must demand recog
nition as, in a real sense, legiti
mate authorities on residence
living and refuse to persist in
being impotent yes-men and
cowed committee-members.
Fourth, we must request an
immediate and clear articulation
of the administration's Resi
dence Philosophy and ask that
on these grounds they justify
the Death of Union and prove
that the Union Decision em
braces this philosophy.
Fifth, we must recognize that
we do care where and how we
live and realize that there are
not only steps that should be
taken but steps that can be
taken. Still water makes no
noise. And contrary to popular
opinion, the administration is
not "out to get" the students—
they are generally acting in
good faith. It is our collective
silence which is at fault, which
allows the machinery to grind
on.
And so, finally, we must re
fuse to accept the demise of
that living group -Union —
which most closely approxi
mates the administration's pur
ported ideal. We must ask that
the administration place its
ideal, if it is an ideal, above its
habitual first consideration
spacial allocation.
In any case, we have seen an
Ideal fall, a good thing die. Let
us now resurrect it . . . in one
form or a not her.
Too many members of the
Stanford community, upon read
ing of the Death of Union Resi
dence, are reacting by merely
folding their papers and mutter
ing into their steaming coffee
cups, "Well, that's too damn bad,
isn't it, old sport?"
The sole death wail that floats
across campus, weakly bemoans,
"Pity the outcast Union Girls,
thrown into the street by their
heartless landlord."
My only comment is Hum
bug and that will be my com
ment as long as people fail to
see the full significance of the
Union Death.
Problem Is Not Provincial
The problem faced by Union
Residence is not a provincial
one; it is one which faces every
student who lives on campus.
That is, are people going to be
taken into consideration when
administrative decisions a r e
handed down on housing. The
problem is not a matter of evic

lion but a matter of voice -are
people to run The Plan, or is
The Plan to run the people?
Will we be herded or heard?
So as you run a flag down
for the Vanquished Eighty of
Union Hall, run a flag down for
me too. Run a flag down for the
houses on the Row, whose days
(or years) are now numbered.
Run a flag down lor the Spon
sor System. In fact, run one
down for us all, laddie, for we've
all lost something here.
"Ah, but only wait until next
season," says Coach Mackenzie.
"Next season we'll stand our
ground." Shall 1 say ii again- -
