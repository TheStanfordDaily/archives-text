# AKL Votes To Go Local
## 
### BILL WERTZ Managing Editor 
The Stanford chapter of Alpha
Kappa Lambda voted last night to dis
affiliate from the national organiza
tion and become a local fraternity.
Five hundred ballots were distrib
uted to fraternity members and alum
ni. Of the 384 that were returned, 265
favored disaffiliation.
AKL follows two other Stanford
fraternities, Beta Chi and Alpha Tan
Omega, who also have gone local in
the past three years.
House president Leon Scales told
The" Daily he felt disaffiliation would
very definitely be an advantage to ihc
chapter.
There was never any real or worth
while contact with the national," he

said. "Disaffiliation will allow us to
become much more realistic and less
hyprocritical."
AKL was suspended on October 27
"for deliberate violations of pledge ed
ucational procedures and financial re
sponsibilities to the national organi
zation."
The AKL's have considered going
local for the past two years. An in
formal questionnaire was sent to AKL

Alumni last spring. Response to this
Letter favored disaffiliation by more
than three to one.
Aeording to Scales, the chapter has
not followed the national's pledge
education procedures since World War
11.
"We do not feel that the national
really pertains to our organization,"
Scales said
Scales said in late October that for

all practical purposes the chapter has
been maintaining itself as a local fra
ternity. "The chapter has long been
disaffiliated in practice if not in fact."
When suspending the chapter in
October, the national fraternity had
accused Stanford University of coop
erating with the chapter and abetting
it in its efforts to go local.
Scales denied this and said that the
University "has maintained strict
neutrality in the chapter's reappraisal
of its relationship wilh the national."
No Effect Oil Hush
Scales said he felt the chapter's de
cision to go local would not seriously
affect its rush program this spring.
According to Scales, AKL had a
very successful rush last spring and
pledged 23 new members. "They were
all told at the time about our relation
ship with the national," he said.
The last step in disaffiliation. Scales
said, was choosing a new name for the
fraternity.
He said one would b t > voted upon
in the very near future.
"We plan to enter into consultation
with our alumni on this matter, too,"
he said.
