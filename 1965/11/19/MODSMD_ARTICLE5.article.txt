# Oakland Fears Viet Marchers
## 
### 
The Oakland City Council declared
yesterday that a state of emergency
will exist when the Vietnam Day
Committee stages its demonstration
there tomorrow.
The Vietnam Day Committee has
pledged to obey orders laid down by
Federal District Court Judge William
T. Sweigert, but the Hell's Angels
have pledged to counter-demonstrate
against the VDC. Sweigert's orders
include instructions that outside
groups refrain from any interference
with the march.
Vice-mayor Fred Maggiora, at the
request of the council, demanded fed
eral and state protection for the ex
pected 15.000 marchers in telegrams
to Governor Brown and Cecil Poole,
U. S. Attorney in San Francisco.
Safety Measures
Brown was asked to call out the
National Guard to supplement the
Oakland police force.
The governor's offices in Sacra
mento answered that "all reasonable
and necessary steps will be taken"
to enforce law during the demonstra
tion. Atty. Gen. Thomas C. Lynch will
coordinate any state action, it was
announced.
Later yestcYday, the VDC was re
fused use of a big. vacant lot at
7th and Peralta streets in Oakland as
a site for its scheduled post-parade
rally.
The U.S. Post Office Department,
which owns the property, did not com
ment on its decision.
The march will start at 11. because
the court order says the first marcher
must cross into Oakland no later
than 11.
The VDC has suggested that all
marchers wear proper footwear and
protective clothing.
SCTV Endorsement
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam supported the demonstra
tion in its general meeting Wednes
day.
Because of the 111111' change, the
Graduate Coordinating Committee
has announced that its car pool to
tlie march tomorrow will leave from
the parking lot behind the library
between Hand 1). rather than between
!> and in as previously planned.
