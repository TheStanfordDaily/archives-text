# Indians Brace For Unpredictable Cal
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
Anger, grief, and frustration over a potentially great season
will be part of the Stanford football team's inspiration as they
face Cal in the 68th annual Big Came tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
The Indians will be after their fifth straight victory over the
Bears. Cal will be striving for this win not only for the honor of
having possession of the Axe, but because a victory will give
Cal their first winning season since 1955.
The Golden Bears have fallen on hard times, that is until
this \ear. Presently sporting a 5-4 record, the\ could be the sec
ond Cal team to have a winning season since 1952.
Short Similarity
CJiil s record of 5-4 is quite similar to Stanford's slate of 5-3-1,
but the similarity between the two rivals ends there. Cal has
been outrushcd by over 500 yards and outpassed by some Goo
vards; the Indians have outrun and outpassed the opposition by
the 500 and 600 yard margins that Cal is in the hole.
Vet the Bears beat Air Force, 24-7, where Stanford only
edged bv, 17-1(1, 011 a last-second Terry DeSvlvia field goal. The
Bears defeated Washington, 16-12, and

Stanford lost, 41-8. The Bears trounced
Oregon, 21-0, while Stanford had to
struggle for a 17-14 win.
The season's performances fade in
to the background, though, when it
comes time for the "big one." The
players' emotions reach violent heights
and previous efforts are mere work
out compared with the cataclysm of
Big Game.
Infectious?
The injury bug bit Stanford hard
earlier in the season when Gary Petti
grew and Bob Blunt were felled with
knee problems. It may have struck
again. Mike Hibler, hard-charging de
fensive guard, is a doubtful starter
because of a strained knee suffered
during this week's practice. Bob Rath,
the team's leading tackier, will have
to play with his arm heavily taped,
if at <>11.
The rest of the defensive crew, led
by linebacker Glen Myers, and front
liners A] Wilburn, Bill Ogle, and
Monty Mohrman, is ready to play.
And play they will have to. Cal's
Dan Berry is the third running quar
terback in a row the Indians have
faced.
Berry's favorite play is the roll-out
pass-run option. He is Cal's second
leading rusher with 285 yards. Shar
ing the quarterback position with Jim
Hunt, the left-handed junior has
thrown for 335 yards. Hunt has con
nected for 281 yards.
Same Style
Bobby Duhon of Tulane is very sim
ilar to Berry, even to throwing from
the left side. Stanford stopped him
cold with a hard rush and by rushing
the defensive ends or cornerbaekers
as they are sometimes referred to.
Tulane netted 77 yards for the entire
night.
Another sophomore. UCLA's Gary
Beban. tried some of the same tricks,
only with more success. Stanford's
