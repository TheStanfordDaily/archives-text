# LASSU Starts Study Of 'Sign-Out' System
## 
### 
Legislature voted last night to di
rect the AWS Social Regulations
Committee to begin a study on the
feasibility of eliminating the "sign
out" procedure for women.
The sponsor of the resolution,
Phyllis Cole, noted that the only ra
tionale behind the regulations, par
ticularly for upperclass women who
have unlimited hours, is to enable
relatives to find a girl in case of emer
gency. The fact that the male stu
dents on campus function quite well
without such a system seems to indi
cate that this function is not impor
tant enough to warrant the large
bureaucracy needed to enforce the
rules, Miss Cole noted.
('ONSCIKNCK Appropriation
It was argued that eliminating the
sign out process would place fresh
men and sophomore women on their
honor to observe the restrictions cur
rently in effect on their hours, but
Chick Sullivan, president of AWS.
noted that this is already the case,
since they arc now on their honor to
report their sign-in time.
LASSU also passed a $3-10 appro
priation to CONSCIENCE to pay the
cost of transportation for two speak
ers to Monday's lecture-in on Vietnam
policy. The money will bring South
Vietnamese Ambassador Vu Van Tha.j
and Rand Corporation expert Guy
Pauker to the campus.
