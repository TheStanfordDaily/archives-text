# RELIGION, PART 9:
## Founding Grants Often Violated 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
Many denomination-endowed and
non-sectarian universities have trans
cended their founding grants to allow
freedom of worship and to encourage
denominational groups to be active
on campus.
While no situation is exactly similar
to the one at Stanford, Cornell is per
haps the closest, having been founded
with the provision that it "never be
delivered over to any one sect." Cor
nell has permitted for over four de
cades denominational worship on cam
pus and has given official recognition
and aid to a united religious program
since 1919.
Cornell United Religious Work was
accepted in 19.16 as a division of the
university to "promote a climate in
which all students may have freedom
and opportunities to praetie their re
spective faiths, to worship in accord
ance with their individual convictions,
and to work together <*i common con
cerns."
"The association." its directors
state, "has from the beginning been
faithful to the pioneering spirit and
philosophy of the founders, who
sought to build a university free from
the religious domination of any single
group, yet open and hospitable to stu
dents and faculty of all faiths and of
none."

The only restriction was that no
action be taken "to change the status
of the University as a non-secretarian
educational institution."
The cooperative programs works
out of the university religious center,
Anabel Taylor Hall. This five-story
building, completed in 19n2, contains
the offices of the fourteen university
chaplains and the other staff members
of CI'RW. a chapel, a library, lounges,
meeting rooms, an auditorium, and
an art gallery.
The chapel, used by all religious
groups for some ser\ ices ot worship,
seats 130 and has a three-sided revolv
ing altar; the Christian side used b>
Protestants, Orthodox, and Roman

Catholics; the Jewish ark, containing
the Torah; and a nonsymbolic setting,
used for meditation.
The Barnes Library contains over
7,000 books on religion and related
subjects, and supplements the uni
versity's main library collection of re
ligious books. Other facilities include:
Blue Room, housing religious art and
used for meetings; One World Room,
an all-purpose room used for recep
tions, lectures, panels, banquets; an
auditorium, seating 400 and used for
worship, lectures, dramatics.

In programming, the United Relig
