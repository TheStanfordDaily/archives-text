# RELIGION, PART 9:
## Founding Grants Often Violated 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
Many denomination-endowed and
non-sectarian universities have trans
cended their founding grants to allow
freedom of worship and to encourage
denominational groups to be active
on campus.
While no situation is exactly similar
to the one at Stanford, Cornell is per
haps the closest, having been founded
with the provision that it "never be
delivered over to any one sect." Cor
nell has permitted for over four de
cades denominational worship on cam
pus and has given official recognition
and aid to a united religious program
since 1919.
Cornell United Religious Work was
accepted in 19.16 as a division of the
university to "promote a climate in
which all students may have freedom
and opportunities to praetie their re
spective faiths, to worship in accord
ance with their individual convictions,
and to work together <*i common con
cerns."
"The association." its directors
state, "has from the beginning been
faithful to the pioneering spirit and
philosophy of the founders, who
sought to build a university free from
the religious domination of any single
group, yet open and hospitable to stu
dents and faculty of all faiths and of
none."
< Impel At ( oriu'll
The only restriction was that no
action be taken "to change the status
of the University as a non-secretarian
educational institution."
The cooperative programs works
out of the university religious center,
Anabel Taylor Hall. This five-story
building, completed in 19n2, contains
the offices of the fourteen university
chaplains and the other staff members
of CI'RW. a chapel, a library, lounges,
meeting rooms, an auditorium, and
an art gallery.
The chapel, used by all religious
groups for some ser\ ices ot worship,
seats 130 and has a three-sided revolv
ing altar; the Christian side used b>
Protestants, Orthodox, and Roman

Catholics; the Jewish ark, containing
the Torah; and a nonsymbolic setting,
used for meditation.
The Barnes Library contains over
7,000 books on religion and related
subjects, and supplements the uni
versity's main library collection of re
ligious books. Other facilities include:
Blue Room, housing religious art and
used for meetings; One World Room,
an all-purpose room used for recep
tions, lectures, panels, banquets; an
auditorium, seating 400 and used for
worship, lectures, dramatics.

In programming, the United Relig
ious Work "offers a variety of oppor
tunities for students to investigate
and explore the spectrum of religious
concern." It includes religious classes,
lecture series, "Dialogue" magazine,
an ecumenical study group, and
"exposure" a n d work-project
trips.
Courses offered include one
series on the doctrine and his
tories of specific transitions and
a second series "concerned with
the broad, fundamental issues in
religious life common to most
traditions, dealing with the quest
for meaning, social ethics, the
nature of faith, and the forms
of religion."
"Dialogue" is "a journal of
significant discussion pledged to
stimulate a free clash of opinion
and has published issues dealing
with anxiety, poverty, civil
rights, and so on."
The exposure trip is called
Project Understanding. "During
spring vacation, two groups of
students interested in under
standing the current situation in
race relations visit cities, one
northern, one southern. After a
series of seminars, reading as
signments, and discussions each
group travels to a city and re
mains there for a week."
Also included in the program
is the Campus Conference on
Religion, which "provides oppor
tunities for the campus to ex
amine seriously the relevance of
religion to its life." It consists

of seminars, study groups, and
visiting lecturers.
ilrnndcis Program
Brandeis, the Jewish-sponsored,
non-sectarian university, has
separate Jewish, Catholic, and
Protestant chapels, and each
year sponsors "The Dialogue," a
series of lecture-discussions in
volving representatives of the
three faiths.
"Ever since the University op
ened its doors in 1948," Law
rence Kane says in an article on
Brandeis, "religion has com
manded an important position in
campus life. The University's
president, Dr. Abram L. Sachar,
has acted on the belief that 'fact
and data must be integrated
with value and purpose, else the
student is left without spiritual
anchorage.' "
Columbia University, non
denominational in control but
historically affiliated with the
Episcopal Church, has Earl Hall,
an interfaith center, "where cler
gymen of all faiths have served
Columbia students since 1904."
The interfaith work there in
cludes the annual Religious Arts
Festival of drama, music and
art; informal dormitory panel
discussions; and campus visits
by religious leaders such as Nei
buhr, Tillieh, Pike, and Buber.

In programming, the United Relig

tunities for students to investigate
and explore the spectrum of religious
concern." It includes religious classes,
lecture series, "Dialogue" magazine,
an ecumenical study group, and
"exposure" a n d work-project
trips.
Courses offered include one
series on the doctrine and his
tories of specific transitions and
a second series "concerned with
the broad, fundamental issues in
religious life common to most
traditions, dealing with the quest
for meaning, social ethics, the
nature of faith, and the forms
of religion."
"Dialogue" is "a journal of
significant discussion pledged to
stimulate a free clash of opinion
and has published issues dealing
with anxiety, poverty, civil
rights, and so on."
The exposure trip is called
Project Understanding. "During
spring vacation, two groups of

In programming, the United Relig

tunities for students to investigate
and explore the spectrum of religious
concern." It includes religious classes,
lecture series, "Dialogue" magazine,
an ecumenical study group, and
"exposure" a n d work-project
trips.
Courses offered include one
series on the doctrine and his

a second series "concerned with
the broad, fundamental issues in
religious life common to most
traditions, dealing with the quest
for meaning, social ethics, the
nature of faith, and the forms

significant discussion pledged to
stimulate a free clash of opinion
and has published issues dealing
with anxiety, poverty, civil

The exposure trip is called
Project Understanding. "During
spring vacation, two groups of
students interested in under
