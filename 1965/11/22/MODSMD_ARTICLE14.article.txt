## 
### TOM EDISON 
Sitting with the game ball be
tween his legs and acting as if
he were sitting on top of the
world. Coach John Ralston made
several remarks on the Big
Game itself, summed up what
he thought about tlie .season,
and expressed his feelings about
the future after Stanford's 9-7
victory over the California Bears
last Saturday.
Jokingly, Ralston, when asked

when he would start recruiting
for next year, looked at his
watch and commented, "Oh, in
about half an hour."
Ralston's first general com
ment about Saturday's game
was, "Neither team played well.
1 was pleased with our team's
ability to come from behind. I
feel generally good about our
overall effort. I do have to give
credit to a well-coached Cal
team. They have a good solid
team."
Them Honest"
In regards to Cal's strengths,
especially their strong line, Ral
ston stated that the game strat
egy was to keep them as honest
as possible. "We wanted to mix
it up as much as possible. We
had planned before the game to
use the quarterback sneak that
Lewis used so effectively on oc
casions and we also had Lewis
pass more. I think we did a good
job in mixing things up."
Reflecting on the breaks in
the contest, directed mainly to
Ray Handley's fumble on the

two-yard line, Ralston stated
"Things like that would have
knocked the stuffings oul of
other teams. Those things can
kill you in a bail game."
Ralston said that Handley felt
he should have handled the ball
on the fumble. "There was 'no
mix-up in the play," Ralston ex
plained. "Ray tried to pick the
ball up and run again instead
of jumping on the ball."
I*iiill Returns Hurt
Probably one of the most im
portant factors in the game was
Cal's punt returns giving them
good field position. Ralston when
asked about this stated that they
work on their punt coverage ev
eryday. "Rut Lewis kicks so far
that we have trouble getting
down field. Dave has been try
ing to kick higher but hasn't
been successful. We knew that
Bradley and Beaty could really
hurt us if they were given room
to run."
Commenting on the outcome
of the entire season, Ralston
phrased it this way, "It has been
a disappointing season. We have
lots of hard work before we can
get up to the caliber of the rest
of our conference opponents. Our
aim is to win the conference
championships . . .
"I think UCLA is a fine rep

resentative if they should go to
the Rose Bowl. I would like to
have picked Stanford as the
team to go, though."
Freshmen Are Future
As for the future he expressed
optimism in regards to this
year s freshman team. "I haven't
seen any of the games, but we
do have all the games on film.
1 know that they are good. I am
eager to get to work on them
as soon as possible. Right now
I have to worry about the East-
West game."
Relating everything to the
speech Ralston gave at the bon
fire, the Big Game was indeed
successful, m this speech Ral
ston explained his general phi
losophy of the Big (lame. "We
tell the boys to think of the sea
son as in two parts. The first
part being our first nine games
and the latter part the Cal game.
"We explain to the players that
the Big Game is actually the be
ginning of next season. Through
I his game we hope to do better
recruiting, working off the im
age thai it creates of Stanford
athletes. We also hope to instill
in the players the feeling that
they are working for the entirr
Stanford athletic program. Wt
want to find those boys who an
willing to work hard."

watch and commented, "Oh, in
about half an hour."
Ralston's first general com
ment about Saturday's game
was, "Neither team played well.
1 was pleased with our team's
ability to come from behind. I
feel generally good about our
overall effort. I do have to give
credit to a well-coached Cal
team. They have a good solid
team."
Them Honest"
In regards to Cal's strengths,
especially their strong line, Ral
ston stated that the game strat
egy was to keep them as honest
as possible. "We wanted to mix
it up as much as possible. We
had planned before the game to
use the quarterback sneak that
Lewis used so effectively on oc
casions and we also had Lewis
pass more. I think we did a good
job in mixing things up."
Reflecting on the breaks in
the contest, directed mainly to
Ray Handley's fumble on the

two-yard line, Ralston stated
"Things like that would have
knocked the stuffings oul of
other teams. Those things can
kill you in a bail game."
Ralston said that Handley felt
he should have handled the ball
on the fumble. "There was 'no
mix-up in the play," Ralston ex
plained. "Ray tried to pick the
ball up and run again instead
of jumping on the ball."
I*iiill Returns Hurt
Probably one of the most im
portant factors in the game was
Cal's punt returns giving them
good field position. Ralston when
asked about this stated that they
work on their punt coverage ev
eryday. "Rut Lewis kicks so far
that we have trouble getting
down field. Dave has been try
ing to kick higher but hasn't
been successful. We knew that
Bradley and Beaty could really
hurt us if they were given room
to run."
Commenting on the outcome
of the entire season, Ralston
phrased it this way, "It has been
a disappointing season. We have
lots of hard work before we can
get up to the caliber of the rest
of our conference opponents. Our
aim is to win the conference
championships . . .
"I think UCLA is a fine rep

resentative if they should go to
the Rose Bowl. I would like to
have picked Stanford as the
team to go, though."
Freshmen Are Future
As for the future he expressed
optimism in regards to this
year s freshman team. "I haven't
seen any of the games, but we
do have all the games on film.
1 know that they are good. I am
eager to get to work on them
as soon as possible. Right now
I have to worry about the East-
West game."
Relating everything to the
speech Ralston gave at the bon
fire, the Big Game was indeed
successful, m this speech Ral
ston explained his general phi
losophy of the Big (lame. "We
tell the boys to think of the sea
son as in two parts. The first
part being our first nine games
and the latter part the Cal game.
"We explain to the players that
the Big Game is actually the be
ginning of next season. Through
I his game we hope to do better
recruiting, working off the im
age thai it creates of Stanford
athletes. We also hope to instill
in the players the feeling that
they are working for the entirr
Stanford athletic program. Wt
want to find those boys who an
willing to work hard."
Sitting with the game ball be

he were sitting on top of the
world. Coach John Ralston made
several remarks on the Big
Game itself, summed up what
he thought about tlie .season,
and expressed his feelings about
the future after Stanford's 9-7
victory over the California Bears
last Saturday.

when he would start recruiting
