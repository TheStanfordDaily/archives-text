# Committee Will Study Open House
## 
### DAVID MYERS 
A surve\ to discover student
feelings about open house pol
icy will in' administered the
week following Thanksgiving by
a subcommittee of the LASSU
Student Affairs Committee. The
results may lead to a liberaliza
tion of University policy.
If there is a favorable reac
tion to proposed changes in open
house policy, said committee
chairman Dan Smith, further
steps will be taken hy the com
mittee to attempt a change, and
a report will be made to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling and the
Trustees.

m/
However, before the proposals
can go to the University's Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee, which advises Sterling,
they must first be recommended
by a subcommittee headed by
Prof. Otis Pease.
Pease would not commenl yet
on any proposals, but Smith said
he expects some form of his
committee's recommendations
will be passed by the subcom
mittee. LASSU was also expect
ed to pass a resolution last night
urging Pease's committee to
adopt the proposals.
The subcommittee's r e p or t
calls for an unlimited number of

open house periods during the
week to bo sot at iho discretion
of the individual living groups,
hours from noon until midnight
on week nights and from noon
until 2:30 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday, with responsibility on
iho host for rule infractions, and
primary jurisdiction by house
judicial bodies.
Although many faculty and
administrative members claim
that such new plans would in
vade Iho privacy of individuals
in dorms, Smith claims much
opposition is based on the fear
of providing an opportunity for
fornication. Ho repudiates both
arguments by saying that com
promises could be made between
roommates so no problems would
arrive that way and that Stan
ford students should be mature
enough to refrain from sexual
activities in the dorms.
If all goes well, Smith expects
the Student Affairs and Services
Committee to begin deliberation
on some kind of proposals by
the beginning of Winter Quarter
and passage some time later on.
Hp pointed out that if the Uni
versity committee fails to pass
now regulations. LASSU could
do so on iis own and create a
conflict between University and
ASSU regulations.

mittee, which advises Sterling,
they must first be recommended
by a subcommittee headed by
Prof. Otis Pease.
Pease would not commenl yet
on any proposals, but Smith said
he expects some form of his
committee's recommendations
will be passed by the subcom
mittee. LASSU was also expect
ed to pass a resolution last night
urging Pease's committee to
adopt the proposals.
The subcommittee's r e p or t
calls for an unlimited number of

open house periods during the
week to bo sot at iho discretion
of the individual living groups,
hours from noon until midnight
on week nights and from noon
until 2:30 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday, with responsibility on
iho host for rule infractions, and
primary jurisdiction by house
judicial bodies.
Although many faculty and
administrative members claim
that such new plans would in
vade Iho privacy of individuals
in dorms, Smith claims much
opposition is based on the fear
of providing an opportunity for
fornication. Ho repudiates both
arguments by saying that com
promises could be made between
roommates so no problems would
arrive that way and that Stan
ford students should be mature
enough to refrain from sexual
activities in the dorms.
If all goes well, Smith expects
the Student Affairs and Services
Committee to begin deliberation
on some kind of proposals by
the beginning of Winter Quarter
and passage some time later on.
Hp pointed out that if the Uni
versity committee fails to pass
now regulations. LASSU could
do so on iis own and create a
conflict between University and
ASSU regulations.
