# A 						BERKELEY MARCHER SPEAK OUT
## An Exercise In Moral Futility? 
### TOM SHERMAN 
In comparison with most civil
rights domonsirators, the march
ers in Berkeley protesting tho
war in Vietnam wore somber.
Much of tho conversation was
about ibo reconl disclosure that
President Johnson had con
cealed from the public Hanoi's
attempt in August, 1964, to
negotiate.
"I had based my support of
Johnson's policy in Vietnam on
the assumption that he seriously
wanted unconditional negotia
tions," one forty-year-old eco
nomic consultant told me. "Now
1 have to join a march, my first,
in order to register my protest."
lie had in his pocket letters to
Goldberg and Johnson. "In order
to avoid jeopardizing my job,"
h< 1 Si lid, "I've got to send them
in plain envelopes, instead of
envelopes from my office,"
li is discouraging to discover
that an established businessman,
with a Ph.D. in economics, might
lose his job if his employer were
to find out how seriously he
questions the present policies of
our government. Distortions of
the truth by the President and
the press are more than dis
couraging. "This march," said
Peter Cohen, a leader of the

Berkeley Vietnam Day Commit
tee, "is an exercise in moral
futility."
Political Impotence
The sense of moral outrage
and political impotence felt by
most of tho demonstrators was
expressed repeatedly by the
speakers in DoFremory Park.
"When Senator Fulbright can
be accused of treason on the
floor of the Senate," said State
Assemblyman John B u r ton,
"there are probably people who
would accuse Pope Paul of stir
ring up the cause of world
peace."
"Although some of us have
faced armed bigots in the South,
we are still called cowards be
cause we refuse to fight in Viet
nam," said Howard Sherman,
representative of the California
Young Democrats.
Dan Healy, who recently re
fused to be drafted, argued that
"the government has forced me
to become a criminal or lose my
self-respect ... A government
that will not allow us to decide
for ourselves whether we should
participate in this war should
not receive unquestioning alle
giance."
In Name of Anti-Coninninism
Robert Scheer, foreign editor
for Ramparts and possible con
testant for Geffery Cohelan's

seat in the House of Represent
atives, said that tho U.S. does
"not have the right to do every
thing in the name of anti
communism."
Tho dissension among Com
munist nations, Scheer said, has
proved false the myth that the
Communist Party is responsible
for every evil in the world. "Our
Vietnam is worse than their
Hungary. The war which we are
now lighting in Vietnam does
such violence to the basic de
cency of our people that they
must bo continuously lied to and
the truth must bo suppressed in
order to allow that war to go
on."
Tho crowd gave two standing
ovations to Dan Duncan, who
has received the Silver Star
from the South Vietnamese, the
Bronze Star and tho Air Modal
from the U.S., and is under con
sideration for tho U.S. Silver
Star and Legion of Merit.
According to Duncan, who
served 18 months in Vietnam,
tlie majority of tho South Viet
namese are in sympathy with
tho Viet Cong. He denied that
Americans wore in Vietnam be
cause tho Vietnamese people
asked for U.S. help, pointing out
that tho first American involve
ment in Vietnam came in an
swer to a French request for

U.S. help and that no elections
of top government officials have
boon hold since.
Diem stayed in power. Duncan
charged, because "we refused to
pay the Vietnamese army if
they didn't support Diem. Then,
in 1955, the United States Gov
ernment paid a group of pro
fessors from Michigan State
University to help found a secret
police force in Vietnam." Ac
cording to Duncan, the force
was trained and armed hv tho
U.S.
Controlled By C'lA
Tho U.S. Special Forces, first
in Vietnam in 1957, had ten
units there in 19G1. "under iho
direct control of the CIA," he
said. "Now if it was legal for
us to ho there according to the
Geneva Accords." Duncan asked,
"why then did we have to ship
our own Special Forces people
to Vietnam in civilian clothes,
on a civilian passport, and call
them 'Mister' instead of 'Sir'?"
Duncan said that ho was
working on a secret project in
Vietnam during the election
campaign when Johnson was
promising no further escalation.
The project required that the
U.S. government meet certain
conditions, but "we couldn't got
permission io implement those
conditions. The magic word at

ilia I time was 'Cool if, baby,
wail 1.1 mil afler the elections.'"
"While tli o Administration
was saying 'No escalation' to
us," Duncan reported, "at the
same time, ground was being
broken at Camrouh Bay in Viet
nam for a military port built
by Americans with American
dollars for use by the military
to bring men and materiel into
Vietnam ... If ihere had been
no anticipated build-up, there
would have been no need for
this port."
Although "the average Amer
ican soldier feels about the Viet
namese the same way an Ala
bama jury leels about Negroes,"
Duncan said, "don't worry about
our protests demoralizing our
men in Vietnam. It won't hap
pen." He said that Americans
in Vietnam have sufficient en
couragement from their officers
and that their pay was more
than twice thai of soldiers based
at home.
Vietnamese Should Decide
Duncan said that he floes 1101
believe thai Ho Chi Minh would
provide the best government for
the South Vietnamese. Rut, "il is
not for me, not for our govern
ment to decide; it's for the Viet
namese people" to decide on
their own government. Napalm
is all that most Vietnamese
know of democracy, he said.
1 )uncan, who was in the Army
for Hi years, said that suppres
sion ol facts and dissent threat
ens American democracy. "The
danger to our country will not
lessen until our leaders again
become our representatives."
"The fight for democracy is be
ing fought here."
If you do not share Mr. Dun
can's apprehension for the fu
ture of American democracy,
send three different letters about
Vietnam to President Johnson.
1 think you will find that get
ting the same reply to all of
them is discouraging. Or attend
a protest demonstration and find
out it the press coverage seems
accurate. Or listen to the parade
bystanders who are so blinded
by unthinking patriotism that
they shout out to clean-shaven
professors, wearing coat and tie,
"(Jo home, you bearded l>eat
niks."
Find out for yourself, what
ever your political views, wheth
er or not all political action has
become "an exercise in moral
fui ility."
