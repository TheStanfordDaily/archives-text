## CFYD's—No CONSCIENCE 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Because CONSCIENCE has
claimed a bipartisan student sup
port for their organization, we
wish to clarify the situation, for
at least California. The Califor
nia Federation of Young Demo
crats, in a White Paper of Aug
ust 29, 1965, made the following
conclusions which are clearly in
substantial opposition to the
purposes of CONSCIENCE.
• The President should call
for a cease-fire pending a settle
ment, announcing that the Viet
Cong would have a seat at any
conference• table and that the
Geneva Accords would be the
basis of any settlement.
• The President should add
that, should ihe United Nations
authorize a neutral peace force
sufficient to assure free elec
tions, they would bo held within
six months, the United States
would honor their result, and all
United States troops would be
withdrawn when the U.N. force
arrived, if all north Vietnamese
forces were withdrawn simultan
eously.
• As the Geneva Accords will
require elaborations, the Presi
dent should be willing to seek
peace, not by military escalation,
but by diplomatic escalation to
consider widening the field of
negotiations to include other
areas of Indochina, as well as
whatever adjustments of our
China policy might lead to a
detente with China.
The National organization has
not endorsed CONSCIENCE and
neither has the local chapter.

Editor, The Daily:
The presence on the Stanford
campus tonight of the so-called
ambassador of the so-called Re
public of South Vietnam is an
occasion for us to return to some
historical facts about the Viet
namese nation.
A nation of people joined by a
common langauge and culture
may be divided by legal treaty
after war, e.g.. North and South
Korea, or by a Cold War stale
mate as in East and West Ger
many where opposing troops
stand nose to nose on the demar
cation line. However, in the case
of Vietnam, after the defeat of
the French colonial masters by
the natives, the treaty granting
independence to Vietnam called
for unification, not division.
In the unmistakable language
of the Geneva Accords, tin l 17th
parallel is a temporary line, for
ceasefire purposes only, pending
the elections planned for 1956

to establish one government for
Vietnam. Although Ho Chi Minh
was in a position to mop up in
the southern areas after Dien
Bien Phu, he acepted the tem
porary dividing line to prevent
further bloodshed and also be
cause he was confident of win
ning the forthcoming elections.
At the international confer
ence in Geneva, the main parties
to the treaty were 110 and the
French. The question of the so
called South Vietnam republic
'being a signatory did not arise:
the south was not an autonom
ous legal entity. What is called
today in the "free world" the
Republic of South Vietnam re
mains de jure a colonial terri
tory of France and is d«* facto a
political if not an economic col
ony of the USA. South Vietnam
has never been an autonomous
state, unless we regard Diem's
abrogation of the 1956 elections
as his declaration of independ
ence. No Saigon regime, there
fore, has ever had the legal, not
to mention moral, authority to
appoint an ambassador.
As far as organized political
parties in the south are con
cerned, the National Liberation
Front is without doubt the
strongest. The American press
has constantly referred to the
NLF as the political arm of the
Viet Cong.
The reverse is true: the Viet
Cong (the smear name given the
guerillas by the Saigon regime
meaning roughly "Viet Com
munists") or the People's Self
Defense Armed Forces (as they
call themselves) are the mili
tary arm of the political coali
tion called the National Libera
tion Front, which was organized
by southern opponents to the
Diem regime in March 1960 and
which received the official bless
ing of Hanoi onlv in September,
1960.
While Diem's own National
Revolutionary Movement num
bered only a few thousand, NLF
membership is estimated by for
mer AP reporter Malcolm
Browne as some 5,000,000 out of
a total population of 14,000,000.
Concludes Browne: "There is no
other party, religious organiza
tion, professional or student
group or military force in South
Vietnam that can come any
where near this figure in
strength" (p. 215, The New Face
of War).
No country outside the Ameri
can bloc recognized Diem's re
gime or any of the succeeding
military ones in Saigon. Of
course, all Eastern bloc nations
recognize the NLF. But most
significant is that NLF diplo
mats are treated as the onlv

legitimate ambassadors of the
area by the leading non-aligned
Afro-Asian countries Indo
nesia, the United Arab Republic,
Algeria.
It will be an insult to the peo
ple in South Vietnam, to the
principle of party politics as be*
ing essential to representative
government and to international
law. if we receive Marshall Ky's
man in Washington as any kind
of ambassador of the people liv
ing south of the 17th parallel.

1 too am "pleased to note the
increasing concern of the Stan
ford Community in ihe Over
seas Campus Program." realize
the "magnitude and complexity"
of effecting improvements, and
appreciate "the conflicting pres
sures under which its director.
Robert A. Walker, must labor."
It is because of this and a per
sonal concern to see that the
much needed improvements are
made that I wrote the "anony
mous" letter which appeared in
the Nov. 16 Daily.
1 am afraid, however, that the
presidents of Italy VIII, France
VIII. and Germany XIV have
failed to see the relevance of my
"ad hominem arguments." It in
volves a very "concrete propos
al" which is more applicable to
the situation than the examples
of change that were offered by
the presidents themselves. Of
the three mentioned, only (me
applied to tlie campuses over
seas: that oi judicial council
member election. It is a valuable
change. The others are insignifi
cant, The selection by students
of professors to speak at the
hostels is closely regulated by
the Overseas Campus Office and
so is hardly a change. And the
number of hours that a hostel
takes will not affect the experi
ences of students overseas.
To say to the students, how
ever. "Do not try to change the
system," is to reveal an attitude
that has prevented and will con
tinue to prevent the important
changes needed by the program.
My intended "concrete proposal"
is this. It must be realized that
the students and professors have
valid and constructive criticisms.
This is especially true when stu
dent opinion, at least, is being
tunneled into the Overseas Cam
pus Board. Without this realiza
tion. there will be no improve
ments.
My other concrete proposals

are far too many to include in
a letter, but I want lo make one
more suggestion. 1 realize, with
out sarcasm, that Dr. Walker is
a valuable man to Stanford.
However, since he is laboring
"under conflicting interests," ii
may well be that he does not
have the necessary time to rec
ognize and solve the existing
problems. 1 suggest that he start
allowing certain aspects of the
program (such as academicst to
be put on the shoulders of a
student - faculty - administration

• The President should call
for a cease-fire pending a settle

Geneva Accords would be the
basis of any settlement.
• The President should add
that, should ihe United Nations
authorize a neutral peace force
sufficient to assure free elec
tions, they would bo held within
six months, the United States
would honor their result, and all
United States troops would be
withdrawn when the U.N. force
arrived, if all north Vietnamese
forces were withdrawn simultan

• As the Geneva Accords will
require elaborations, the Presi
dent should be willing to seek
peace, not by military escalation,
but by diplomatic escalation to
consider widening the field of
negotiations to include other
areas of Indochina, as well as
whatever adjustments of our

The presence on the Stanford
campus tonight of the so-called
ambassador of the so-called Re
public of South Vietnam is an
occasion for us to return to some
historical facts about the Viet
namese nation.
A nation of people joined by a
common langauge and culture
may be divided by legal treaty
after war, e.g.. North and South
Korea, or by a Cold War stale
mate as in East and West Ger
many where opposing troops
stand nose to nose on the demar
cation line. However, in the case
of Vietnam, after the defeat of
the French colonial masters by
the natives, the treaty granting
independence to Vietnam called
for unification, not division.
In the unmistakable language
of the Geneva Accords, tin l 17th
parallel is a temporary line, for
ceasefire purposes only, pending
the elections planned for 1956

to establish one government for
Vietnam. Although Ho Chi Minh
was in a position to mop up in
the southern areas after Dien
Bien Phu, he acepted the tem
porary dividing line to prevent
further bloodshed and also be
cause he was confident of win
ning the forthcoming elections.
At the international confer
ence in Geneva, the main parties
to the treaty were 110 and the
French. The question of the so
called South Vietnam republic
'being a signatory did not arise:
the south was not an autonom
ous legal entity. What is called
today in the "free world" the
Republic of South Vietnam re
mains de jure a colonial terri
tory of France and is d«* facto a
political if not an economic col
ony of the USA. South Vietnam
has never been an autonomous
state, unless we regard Diem's
abrogation of the 1956 elections
as his declaration of independ
ence. No Saigon regime, there
fore, has ever had the legal, not
to mention moral, authority to
appoint an ambassador.
As far as organized political
parties in the south are con
cerned, the National Liberation
Front is without doubt the
strongest. The American press
has constantly referred to the
NLF as the political arm of the
Viet Cong.
The reverse is true: the Viet
Cong (the smear name given the
guerillas by the Saigon regime
meaning roughly "Viet Com
munists") or the People's Self
Defense Armed Forces (as they
call themselves) are the mili
tary arm of the political coali
tion called the National Libera
tion Front, which was organized
by southern opponents to the
Diem regime in March 1960 and
which received the official bless
ing of Hanoi onlv in September,
1960.
While Diem's own National
Revolutionary Movement num
bered only a few thousand, NLF
membership is estimated by for
mer AP reporter Malcolm
Browne as some 5,000,000 out of
a total population of 14,000,000.
Concludes Browne: "There is no
other party, religious organiza
tion, professional or student
group or military force in South
Vietnam that can come any
where near this figure in
strength" (p. 215, The New Face
of War).
No country outside the Ameri
can bloc recognized Diem's re
gime or any of the succeeding
military ones in Saigon. Of
course, all Eastern bloc nations
recognize the NLF. But most
significant is that NLF diplo
mats are treated as the onlv

legitimate ambassadors of the
area by the leading non-aligned
Afro-Asian countries Indo
nesia, the United Arab Republic,
Algeria.
It will be an insult to the peo
ple in South Vietnam, to the
principle of party politics as be*
ing essential to representative
government and to international
law. if we receive Marshall Ky's
man in Washington as any kind
of ambassador of the people liv

The presence on the Stanford
campus tonight of the so-called
ambassador of the so-called Re
public of South Vietnam is an
occasion for us to return to some
historical facts about the Viet
namese nation.
A nation of people joined by a
common langauge and culture
may be divided by legal treaty
after war, e.g.. North and South
Korea, or by a Cold War stale
mate as in East and West Ger
many where opposing troops
stand nose to nose on the demar
cation line. However, in the case
of Vietnam, after the defeat of
the French colonial masters by
the natives, the treaty granting
independence to Vietnam called
for unification, not division.
In the unmistakable language
of the Geneva Accords, tin l 17th
parallel is a temporary line, for
ceasefire purposes only, pending
the elections planned for 1956

to establish one government for
Vietnam. Although Ho Chi Minh
was in a position to mop up in
the southern areas after Dien
Bien Phu, he acepted the tem
porary dividing line to prevent
further bloodshed and also be
cause he was confident of win
ning the forthcoming elections.
At the international confer
ence in Geneva, the main parties
to the treaty were 110 and the
French. The question of the so
called South Vietnam republic
'being a signatory did not arise:
the south was not an autonom
ous legal entity. What is called
today in the "free world" the
Republic of South Vietnam re
mains de jure a colonial terri
tory of France and is d«* facto a
political if not an economic col
ony of the USA. South Vietnam
has never been an autonomous
state, unless we regard Diem's
abrogation of the 1956 elections
as his declaration of independ
ence. No Saigon regime, there
fore, has ever had the legal, not
to mention moral, authority to
appoint an ambassador.
As far as organized political
parties in the south are con
cerned, the National Liberation
Front is without doubt the
strongest. The American press
has constantly referred to the
NLF as the political arm of the
Viet Cong.
The reverse is true: the Viet
Cong (the smear name given the
guerillas by the Saigon regime
meaning roughly "Viet Com
munists") or the People's Self
Defense Armed Forces (as they
call themselves) are the mili
tary arm of the political coali
tion called the National Libera
tion Front, which was organized
by southern opponents to the
Diem regime in March 1960 and
which received the official bless
ing of Hanoi onlv in September,
1960.
While Diem's own National
Revolutionary Movement num
bered only a few thousand, NLF
membership is estimated by for
mer AP reporter Malcolm
Browne as some 5,000,000 out of
a total population of 14,000,000.
Concludes Browne: "There is no
other party, religious organiza
tion, professional or student
group or military force in South
Vietnam that can come any
where near this figure in
strength" (p. 215, The New Face
of War).
No country outside the Ameri
can bloc recognized Diem's re
gime or any of the succeeding
military ones in Saigon. Of
course, all Eastern bloc nations
recognize the NLF. But most
significant is that NLF diplo
mats are treated as the onlv

legitimate ambassadors of the
area by the leading non-aligned
Afro-Asian countries Indo
nesia, the United Arab Republic,
Algeria.
It will be an insult to the peo
ple in South Vietnam, to the
principle of party politics as be*
ing essential to representative
government and to international
law. if we receive Marshall Ky's
man in Washington as any kind
of ambassador of the people liv

The presence on the Stanford
campus tonight of the so-called
ambassador of the so-called Re
public of South Vietnam is an
occasion for us to return to some
historical facts about the Viet
namese nation.
A nation of people joined by a
common langauge and culture
may be divided by legal treaty
after war, e.g.. North and South
Korea, or by a Cold War stale
mate as in East and West Ger
many where opposing troops
stand nose to nose on the demar
cation line. However, in the case
of Vietnam, after the defeat of
the French colonial masters by
the natives, the treaty granting
independence to Vietnam called
for unification, not division.
In the unmistakable language
of the Geneva Accords, tin l 17th
parallel is a temporary line, for
ceasefire purposes only, pending
the elections planned for 1956

to establish one government for
Vietnam. Although Ho Chi Minh
was in a position to mop up in
the southern areas after Dien
Bien Phu, he acepted the tem
porary dividing line to prevent
further bloodshed and also be
cause he was confident of win
ning the forthcoming elections.
At the international confer
ence in Geneva, the main parties
to the treaty were 110 and the
French. The question of the so
called South Vietnam republic
'being a signatory did not arise:
the south was not an autonom
ous legal entity. What is called
today in the "free world" the
Republic of South Vietnam re
mains de jure a colonial terri
tory of France and is d«* facto a
political if not an economic col
ony of the USA. South Vietnam
has never been an autonomous
state, unless we regard Diem's
abrogation of the 1956 elections
as his declaration of independ
ence. No Saigon regime, there
fore, has ever had the legal, not
to mention moral, authority to
appoint an ambassador.
As far as organized political
parties in the south are con
cerned, the National Liberation
Front is without doubt the
strongest. The American press
has constantly referred to the
NLF as the political arm of the
Viet Cong.
The reverse is true: the Viet
Cong (the smear name given the
guerillas by the Saigon regime
meaning roughly "Viet Com
munists") or the People's Self
Defense Armed Forces (as they
call themselves) are the mili
tary arm of the political coali
tion called the National Libera
tion Front, which was organized
by southern opponents to the
Diem regime in March 1960 and
which received the official bless
ing of Hanoi onlv in September,
1960.
While Diem's own National
Revolutionary Movement num
bered only a few thousand, NLF
membership is estimated by for
mer AP reporter Malcolm
Browne as some 5,000,000 out of
a total population of 14,000,000.
Concludes Browne: "There is no
other party, religious organiza
tion, professional or student
group or military force in South
Vietnam that can come any
where near this figure in
strength" (p. 215, The New Face
of War).
No country outside the Ameri
can bloc recognized Diem's re
gime or any of the succeeding
military ones in Saigon. Of
course, all Eastern bloc nations
recognize the NLF. But most
significant is that NLF diplo
mats are treated as the onlv

legitimate ambassadors of the
area by the leading non-aligned
Afro-Asian countries Indo
nesia, the United Arab Republic,
Algeria.
It will be an insult to the peo
ple in South Vietnam, to the
principle of party politics as be*
ing essential to representative
government and to international
law. if we receive Marshall Ky's
man in Washington as any kind
of ambassador of the people liv
ing south of the 17th parallel.

1 too am "pleased to note the
increasing concern of the Stan
ford Community in ihe Over
seas Campus Program." realize
the "magnitude and complexity"
of effecting improvements, and
appreciate "the conflicting pres
sures under which its director.
Robert A. Walker, must labor."
It is because of this and a per
sonal concern to see that the
much needed improvements are
made that I wrote the "anony
mous" letter which appeared in
the Nov. 16 Daily.
1 am afraid, however, that the
presidents of Italy VIII, France
VIII. and Germany XIV have
failed to see the relevance of my
"ad hominem arguments." It in
volves a very "concrete propos
al" which is more applicable to
the situation than the examples
of change that were offered by
the presidents themselves. Of
the three mentioned, only (me
applied to tlie campuses over
seas: that oi judicial council
member election. It is a valuable
change. The others are insignifi
cant, The selection by students
of professors to speak at the
hostels is closely regulated by
the Overseas Campus Office and
so is hardly a change. And the
number of hours that a hostel
takes will not affect the experi
ences of students overseas.
To say to the students, how
ever. "Do not try to change the
system," is to reveal an attitude
that has prevented and will con
tinue to prevent the important
changes needed by the program.
My intended "concrete proposal"
is this. It must be realized that
the students and professors have
valid and constructive criticisms.
This is especially true when stu
dent opinion, at least, is being
tunneled into the Overseas Cam
pus Board. Without this realiza
tion. there will be no improve
ments.
My other concrete proposals

are far too many to include in
a letter, but I want lo make one
more suggestion. 1 realize, with
out sarcasm, that Dr. Walker is
a valuable man to Stanford.
However, since he is laboring
"under conflicting interests," ii
may well be that he does not
have the necessary time to rec
ognize and solve the existing
problems. 1 suggest that he start
allowing certain aspects of the
program (such as academicst to
be put on the shoulders of a
student - faculty - administration
committee where imaginative
solutions might be found.

Because CONSCIENCE has
claimed a bipartisan student sup
port for their organization, we
wish to clarify the situation, for
at least California. The Califor
nia Federation of Young Demo
crats, in a White Paper of Aug
ust 29, 1965, made the following
conclusions which are clearly in
substantial opposition to the
purposes of CONSCIENCE.
• The President should call
for a cease-fire pending a settle
ment, announcing that the Viet
Cong would have a seat at any
conference• table and that the
Geneva Accords would be the
basis of any settlement.
• The President should add
that, should ihe United Nations
authorize a neutral peace force
sufficient to assure free elec
tions, they would bo held within
six months, the United States
would honor their result, and all
United States troops would be
withdrawn when the U.N. force
arrived, if all north Vietnamese
forces were withdrawn simultan
eously.
• As the Geneva Accords will
