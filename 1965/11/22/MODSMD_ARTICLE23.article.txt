## Vietnam: A Transformation In America's 'Vital Interest'

(Ed. Note: On October and 29, Editor Stove
Leopold attended tli«* semi-annual National For
eign Policy Conference for Editors and Broad
casters conducted by the State Department in
Washington,!).<'. Speakers included Dean Husk,
Undersecretary of State (Jeorge Ball, Undersee
retary of State for Econnomle Affairs Thomas
Mann, Ambassador at Large Averlll Harrimau,
Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern
Affairs William Bundy, and other high depart
ment officials. Since the conference was con
ducted under "background only" rules, quotes of
the officials cannot be directly attributed.
Moreover, the following represents not only a
coverage of the conference but the author's own
analysis of the problems discussed there.)
For over 10 years now, the United States lias
been committed to defend South Vietnam from
communist subversion. Il is not realistic to argue,
as some have, that this commitment was made
and re-made by three American Presidents solely
because we wished to protect the "freedom and
self-determination" of South Vietnam.
It is true that the United States has made
sporadic efforts to prod South Vietnam toward
economic, social and political reform—often by
word, sometimes, as in the coup d'etat that ousted
Ngo Dinh Diem, by tacit coercion. However, the
urge to reform lias not been our primary reason
for aiding the South Vietnamese; the primary
objective has been lo protect our own vital in
terests.
Both the Truman and Eisenhower administra
tions supplied military aid and diplomatic sup
port to the French in their efforts to restore
colonial rule in Indochina following World War 11.
Our vital interest at that juncture was not the
right of self-determination in Vietnam, hut the
necessity for French cooperation in the newly
formed NATO alliance. Moreover, the spectre
of Communist China undoubtedly made American
policy-makers quite wary of others who called
themselves agrarian reformers.
The prime objective in Vietnam, then, both
before and after Dienbienphu, was to contain
communism in Asia. In order to contain it, we
built a ring of military alliances about the com
munist world, one of them being the Southeast
Treaty Organization (SEATO) which South
Vietnam belonged to as a prococol member. Upon
request, the government of South Vietnam was
supplied with military equipment and U.S. ad
visors.
Thus, the U.S. moved in these years to integrate
South Vietnam into our forward defense perim
eter in Asia.
Change In 'Vital Interest'
However, in the 1960's the "vital interest"
necessitating U.S. involvement in Vietnam under
went a marked transformation. As it became
clear that nuclear war, or any overt aggression
of the Korean genre which would provoke a
larger war, was unthinkable in the age of ICBM's
and Polaris, the communist world split over the
proper strategy to pursue in overthrowing the
West. While the Russians increasingly relied on
economic and diplomatic pressure to influence the

developing nations, the Chinese clung to 'pure'
Marxist-Leninism and espoused violent over
throw of all non-communist regimes.
Thus, South Vietnam became what Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara has called a "test
case for the new Communist strategy." in reality
it was and is - a test case of the Chinese Com
munist eorrolary to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. As
stated by Chinese leader Lin Pao in what a vet
eran of the State Department called the "Mein
Kampf of Chinese Communism", the communist
revolution must first capture the rural areas of
the world (mostly in the Southern Hemisphere)
and then come to dominate the cities (on a stra
tegic basis, the countries of the Northern Hemis
phere).
South Vietnam, it would seem, is an acid test
case for this theory of violent revolution — first
conquering the peasant areas, then letting the
corrupt and defenseless cities fall to the agarian
reformers. This theory has not been successful
elsewhere; the Chinese have suffered reversals
of some import in the last few months.
According to one high official, they have lost
ground in Africa and Indonesia and, most im
portantly, in the Indian subcontinent where
"Peiping marched up the hill and back down."
Proof In Vietnam
Confronted by failure or, at least, temporary
setbacks in these areas, the Chinese undoubted
ly feel that their policy of irreconcilable militancy
must prove itself in Vietnam. It is this strategy
that Washington feels must be counteracted, by
unilateral military commitment if necessary, in
order to bring China to the realization that peace
ful coexistence is the only modus vivendi between
East and West.
It is for this reason, then, that the Administra
tion has slowly phased out the two rationales for
intervention mentioned earlier: fostering reform
and integrating South Vietnam into our outer
defense perimeter.
Economic aid is still given (over $500 million
this year, an official revealed at the conference),
but most of it goes to repairing war damage -
both U.S. and Viet Cong inflicted.
On the other hand, it seems that the Adminis
tration has on paper, at least given up any
and all aspirations to keep South Vietnam as a
part of any military alliance. As President John
son said at John Hopkins University on April 7
of this year: "... the only path for reasonable
men is the path of peaceful settlement. Such
peace demands an independent South Vietnam -
securely guaranteed and able to shape its own
relationships to all others free from outside
interference tied to no alliance—a military
base for no other country."
Thus, the "vital interest" of the United States
in the Vietnam conflict has changed from one of
questionable military self-interest to a meaning
ful and legitimate commitment to checkmating
a dangerous and brutal mutation of contempor
ary communist ideology.
