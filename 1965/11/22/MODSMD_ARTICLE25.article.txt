						CAPITOL SCENE
## How To Drain U.S. Gold- Invite Meg Twice A Year 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
No one has been able to tally
it up yet, but it is now believed
that Princess Margaret and Lord
Snowden's visit to the United
States cost $8,."507,987.50. This
money, I might add, to prevent
the British from becoming anx
ious, was not spent by the Prin
cess, but by the people who were
introduced to her.
As soon as my wife heard that
we had been invited to a party
for Princess Margaret in Wash
ington. she came up with what
now has been considered one of
the most original statements she
has ever made. She said, ' I don't
have anything to wear."
Dresses In The Closet
I pointed out that there were
at least 14 dresses in her closet,
any one of which would have
made Princess Margaret green
with envy.
But she was determined to
stick by her original statement,
and the next thing I knew she
was preparing a trip to New
York to select a gown for the
dance.
Why New York? Because it is
no secret that, if you bought a
gown in Washington from one
of the better stores, three of
them ws':'o bound to show up at
the same p-irty.
As soon as my wife arrived in
New York, she contacted an inti
mate friend who knew every
dress in New York and whom it
had been sold to and for what
occasion. After two days of
shopping, she came up with a
long pink evening gown with
lots of beads and jazz which
only cost $4(M). But there were
shoes that went with it for $40,
and gloves, and etc. And before
1 knew it, I was down for $600.
discounting the trip to New
York.
A $2.50 Bow Tie
Not to be outdone, I went out
and bought a new black bow tie
for $2.50.
Two days before the dance my
wife announced, "Merney Mc-
Nerney has bought the same
dress for the same dance."
"Does Princess Margaret
know this?" I asked.

"I'm going to have to find
something new."
"But you already put $600 into
that dress. Why doesn't Merney
McNerney find a new dress?"
"Because she says she found
it first."
"Let's show her up and not go
to the dance," I suggested.
"Oh, no, she's not going to get
off that easily. I've called Han
nah Troy and told her to send
another dress to me."
"Another dress?" I cried.
"How can we afford another
dress when we still haven't fig
ured out how we're going to pay
for the first one?"
"Merney McNerney thinks I'm
going to wear the pink dress and
I'm going to make her think so.
But she won't wear hers and
then she'll bo sick when she
realizes I hadn't worn mine
either."
"Why don't you let on you're
going to wear it and then Mer
ney McNerney won't wear hers,
and you'll really have out
smarted her."
"Because to tell you the truth,
I don't like it anymore now that
Merney McNerney has one just
like it."
The dress from Hannah Troy
arrived the next day.
"Which one do you like bet
ter?"
"Either one," I said.
"Do you know something?"
she said. "Suppose Merney Mc-
Nerney saw me in this dress.
She'd know I went out and
bought it because I knew she
had the pink dress."
"It would make Iter evening,"
I said.
"But if I wore the pink dress
and she wore the pink dress, it
would be her problem, not
mine."
"Lord Snowden would certain
ly know you bought yours first."
I said.
"I think I'll wear the pink
one."
"And what about the other
one?"
"I might as well keep it. You
never can tell when Princess
Margaret is coming back."
