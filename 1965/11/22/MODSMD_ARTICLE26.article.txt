# REMEDY FOR LONELINESS
## Group Therapy For The Student 
### 
(Author's Note: Nothing is more important or more
difficult to understand than our own feelings, but there
is little plaee in the college curriculum for talking about
feelings. Part of my medical school training has been a
group therapy experience, one (hat was quite meaning
ful. Perhaps after reading this article, other students
might wish to organize a group in order to undergo such
an experience. II so, call U2.~»-1059 for the answers to any
questions about the concept and its implementation.)
We have all known loneliness, frustration, and anxi
ety, but we don't talk about these feelings very often.
Think of the millions of lonely people in hotel rooms,
on park benches, in burlesque theaters, with pocket
radios; wallflowers, spinsters, Marty's, and handsome
successful people who never admit they are lonely—
the Marilyn Monroes. We live side by side, but for some
reason we are frightened to come together to talk.
Group therapy can be a remedy for loneliness. It
means that people come together and talk about their
feelings. It is easy to organize a group and you don't
really need to have a trained therapist. Get a group of
7 people; they may be similar or different and they
may be acquaintances but it is probably better if they
aren't close friends. Meet once a week for 90 minutes.
Arrange the chairs in a circle so that you can all see
each other. Agree to certain rules: that no one hits any
body; that what goes on in the group is strictly between
ihe members of the group and not to be discussed with
people outside the group.
Come For Different Reasons
People will come to the group for different reasons.
Some will come to meet people. Some will come to talk
about problems. Others will come and they won't really
know why. In the beginning, people will feel uncom
fortable. They imagine that people are going to probe
into their insides and that someone will see the "mon
ster" they've been hiding. They imagine that people will
see through their pretty "self-images" and learn that
they are not really so clever or exciting as they let on.
They don't know what subjects are appropriate for
discussion. Can you talk about the baseball game or do
you have to lalk about problems? You can talk about
anything you want, but try to express your feelings
about it. It is better to say how you feel about a base
ball game than to talk without feeling about your
problem.

The group should listen for the feelings underneath
what is said and respond to the feelings instead of the
actual words. If someone says"I have a dentist appoint
ment tomorrow," it may appear on the surface that
they are merely staling a fact, hut if you observe their
facial expression, posture, and tone of voice, you may
pick up the message that they arc frightened. They
want to talk about their fear but they're afraid that
you will reject their feeling and consider it foolish. So
instead of saying "I'm afraid of the dentist," they give
you clues that they arc frightened; They look fright
ened; their muscles are tense; there is a tremor in their
voice. They are trying to tell you without words that
they are frightened.
If you respond to their words and say, "Do you have
a cavity?" or "Who is your dentist?" you are missing
the point of their communication. Respond to their feel
ing in a way which indicates that you understand what
they are trying to say and that you accept it. If you
*>ay, "I get a feeling that you are frightened about it."
you are showing them that you understand and accept
their feeling of fear and you are communicating in a
meaningful way.
'Noil-Verbal' Messages
We communicate by actions as well as words, and the
group should learn to interpret such "non-verbal" mes
sages. When a member of the group sits near the door
or looks oui the window he may be saying that he
wants to leave. When ho comes late he may be saying
that he didn't want to come at all. When he brings up
his problems near the end of the meeting he may be
saying that he doesn't want to hear the group's re
sponse. When he remains silent he may be saying many
things. It is true that "actions speak louder than words"
but we must train ourselves to hear them.
The group is a little world like tin 1 one outside and
the group can help you to understand and change your
behavior on the outside. Take the person who is shy
and withdrawn, lie lacks confidence and is afraid to
assert himself. In the group, such a person is timid and
doesn't talk very much. When the group points this out,
lie admits that hp is "a timid person." His friends know
him as a timid person and everyone expects him to act
this way. He may prefer to be timid and may use his
passivity to achieve certain ends.
People may speak for him. People may protect and

care for him. It' he really wants to bo bold and aggres
sive the group should help him to he this way. Timidity
is a habit that ho has practiced for many years. He has
developed a timid expression and a quality of hesitation
in his voice and he has learned to walk with an un
certain gait. The group should help him to see what
makes him timid and. within the group situation, he
can learn and practice new behavior. He can learn to
siand straight and look people in the eye. He can learn
to speak and walk with confidence. He can practice
being bold and aggressive until hp learns how.
Looking At The Group
You can look at the group in various ways. Every
thing that goes on in the group happens for a reason
and is usually related to something that has just taken
place. A member of the group may talk about being
spanked as a child because he feels rebuked by the
group. He may talk about Society's loneliness because
he feels isolated from other members of the group. Both
love and hate may serve to strengthen the cohesiveness
of the group. Look at the group as a family constella
lion. Do you react towards certain members of the
group as you react towards certain members of your
own family? Look at the group dynamics. What are the
similarities and differences among members of the
group? Do the passive ones seek out the dominant
ones? Do members with the same religion or philosophy
form subgroups? How does the group respond when
somebody leaves or a now member comes? How does the
group handle problems of discipline?
Stop the meeting every once in awhile and ask.
"What's beeh going on?" What are the themes, the
predominant currents of emotion, which have charac
terized the meeting? And 15 minutes before the mooting
ends, try to sum up or "rehash" what's been going on.
After the initial period of strained conversation, mem
bers of the group will probably go through a stage of
testing each other by expressing angry feelings, and,
finally, when members of the group learn to trust each
other, positive feelings will bo expressed and members
of the group will come to fool very close to each other.
Group therapy offers a way for us to come together
and learn about our feelings and it can help us to deal
with our loneliness, frustration, and anxiety.

saying that he doesn't want to hear the group's re
sponse. When he remains silent he may be saying many
things. It is true that "actions speak louder than words"
but we must train ourselves to hear them.
The group is a little world like tin 1 one outside and
the group can help you to understand and change your
behavior on the outside. Take the person who is shy
and withdrawn, lie lacks confidence and is afraid to
assert himself. In the group, such a person is timid and
doesn't talk very much. When the group points this out,
lie admits that hp is "a timid person." His friends know
him as a timid person and everyone expects him to act
this way. He may prefer to be timid and may use his
passivity to achieve certain ends.
People may speak for him. People may protect and

care for him. It' he really wants to bo bold and aggres
sive the group should help him to he this way. Timidity
is a habit that ho has practiced for many years. He has
developed a timid expression and a quality of hesitation
in his voice and he has learned to walk with an un
certain gait. The group should help him to see what
makes him timid and. within the group situation, he
can learn and practice new behavior. He can learn to
siand straight and look people in the eye. He can learn
to speak and walk with confidence. He can practice
being bold and aggressive until hp learns how.
Looking At The Group
You can look at the group in various ways. Every
thing that goes on in the group happens for a reason
and is usually related to something that has just taken
place. A member of the group may talk about being
spanked as a child because he feels rebuked by the
group. He may talk about Society's loneliness because
he feels isolated from other members of the group. Both
love and hate may serve to strengthen the cohesiveness
of the group. Look at the group as a family constella
lion. Do you react towards certain members of the
group as you react towards certain members of your
own family? Look at the group dynamics. What are the
similarities and differences among members of the
group? Do the passive ones seek out the dominant
ones? Do members with the same religion or philosophy
form subgroups? How does the group respond when
somebody leaves or a now member comes? How does the
group handle problems of discipline?
Stop the meeting every once in awhile and ask.
"What's beeh going on?" What are the themes, the
predominant currents of emotion, which have charac
terized the meeting? And 15 minutes before the mooting
ends, try to sum up or "rehash" what's been going on.
After the initial period of strained conversation, mem
bers of the group will probably go through a stage of
testing each other by expressing angry feelings, and,
finally, when members of the group learn to trust each
other, positive feelings will bo expressed and members
of the group will come to fool very close to each other.
Group therapy offers a way for us to come together
and learn about our feelings and it can help us to deal
with our loneliness, frustration, and anxiety.

(Author's Note: Nothing is more important or more
difficult to understand than our own feelings, but there
is little plaee in the college curriculum for talking about
feelings. Part of my medical school training has been a
group therapy experience, one (hat was quite meaning
ful. Perhaps after reading this article, other students
might wish to organize a group in order to undergo such
an experience. II so, call U2.~»-1059 for the answers to any
questions about the concept and its implementation.)
We have all known loneliness, frustration, and anxi
ety, but we don't talk about these feelings very often.
Think of the millions of lonely people in hotel rooms,
on park benches, in burlesque theaters, with pocket
radios; wallflowers, spinsters, Marty's, and handsome
successful people who never admit they are lonely—
the Marilyn Monroes. We live side by side, but for some
reason we are frightened to come together to talk.
Group therapy can be a remedy for loneliness. It
means that people come together and talk about their
feelings. It is easy to organize a group and you don't
really need to have a trained therapist. Get a group of
7 people; they may be similar or different and they
may be acquaintances but it is probably better if they
aren't close friends. Meet once a week for 90 minutes.
Arrange the chairs in a circle so that you can all see
each other. Agree to certain rules: that no one hits any
body; that what goes on in the group is strictly between
ihe members of the group and not to be discussed with
people outside the group.
Come For Different Reasons
People will come to the group for different reasons.
Some will come to meet people. Some will come to talk
about problems. Others will come and they won't really
know why. In the beginning, people will feel uncom
fortable. They imagine that people are going to probe
into their insides and that someone will see the "mon
ster" they've been hiding. They imagine that people will
see through their pretty "self-images" and learn that
they are not really so clever or exciting as they let on.
They don't know what subjects are appropriate for
discussion. Can you talk about the baseball game or do
you have to lalk about problems? You can talk about
anything you want, but try to express your feelings
about it. It is better to say how you feel about a base
ball game than to talk without feeling about your
problem.

The group should listen for the feelings underneath
what is said and respond to the feelings instead of the
actual words. If someone says"I have a dentist appoint
ment tomorrow," it may appear on the surface that
they are merely staling a fact, hut if you observe their
facial expression, posture, and tone of voice, you may
pick up the message that they arc frightened. They
want to talk about their fear but they're afraid that
you will reject their feeling and consider it foolish. So
instead of saying "I'm afraid of the dentist," they give
you clues that they arc frightened; They look fright
ened; their muscles are tense; there is a tremor in their
voice. They are trying to tell you without words that
they are frightened.
If you respond to their words and say, "Do you have
a cavity?" or "Who is your dentist?" you are missing
the point of their communication. Respond to their feel
ing in a way which indicates that you understand what
they are trying to say and that you accept it. If you
*>ay, "I get a feeling that you are frightened about it."
you are showing them that you understand and accept
their feeling of fear and you are communicating in a
meaningful way.
'Noil-Verbal' Messages
We communicate by actions as well as words, and the
group should learn to interpret such "non-verbal" mes
sages. When a member of the group sits near the door
or looks oui the window he may be saying that he
wants to leave. When ho comes late he may be saying
that he didn't want to come at all. When he brings up
his problems near the end of the meeting he may be
saying that he doesn't want to hear the group's re

reason we are frightened to come together to talk.
Group therapy can be a remedy for loneliness. It
means that people come together and talk about their
feelings. It is easy to organize a group and you don't
really need to have a trained therapist. Get a group of
7 people; they may be similar or different and they
may be acquaintances but it is probably better if they
aren't close friends. Meet once a week for 90 minutes.
Arrange the chairs in a circle so that you can all see
each other. Agree to certain rules: that no one hits any
body; that what goes on in the group is strictly between
ihe members of the group and not to be discussed with
people outside the group.
Come For Different Reasons
People will come to the group for different reasons.
Some will come to meet people. Some will come to talk
about problems. Others will come and they won't really
know why. In the beginning, people will feel uncom
fortable. They imagine that people are going to probe
into their insides and that someone will see the "mon
ster" they've been hiding. They imagine that people will
see through their pretty "self-images" and learn that
they are not really so clever or exciting as they let on.
They don't know what subjects are appropriate for
discussion. Can you talk about the baseball game or do
you have to lalk about problems? You can talk about
anything you want, but try to express your feelings
about it. It is better to say how you feel about a base
ball game than to talk without feeling about your
problem.

The group should listen for the feelings underneath
what is said and respond to the feelings instead of the
actual words. If someone says"I have a dentist appoint
ment tomorrow," it may appear on the surface that
they are merely staling a fact, hut if you observe their
facial expression, posture, and tone of voice, you may
pick up the message that they arc frightened. They
want to talk about their fear but they're afraid that
you will reject their feeling and consider it foolish. So
instead of saying "I'm afraid of the dentist," they give
you clues that they arc frightened; They look fright
ened; their muscles are tense; there is a tremor in their
voice. They are trying to tell you without words that
they are frightened.
If you respond to their words and say, "Do you have
a cavity?" or "Who is your dentist?" you are missing
the point of their communication. Respond to their feel
ing in a way which indicates that you understand what
they are trying to say and that you accept it. If you
*>ay, "I get a feeling that you are frightened about it."
you are showing them that you understand and accept
their feeling of fear and you are communicating in a
meaningful way.
'Noil-Verbal' Messages
We communicate by actions as well as words, and the
group should learn to interpret such "non-verbal" mes
sages. When a member of the group sits near the door
or looks oui the window he may be saying that he
wants to leave. When ho comes late he may be saying
that he didn't want to come at all. When he brings up
his problems near the end of the meeting he may be
saying that he doesn't want to hear the group's re
sponse. When he remains silent he may be saying many
things. It is true that "actions speak louder than words"
but we must train ourselves to hear them.
The group is a little world like tin 1 one outside and
the group can help you to understand and change your
behavior on the outside. Take the person who is shy
and withdrawn, lie lacks confidence and is afraid to
assert himself. In the group, such a person is timid and
doesn't talk very much. When the group points this out,
lie admits that hp is "a timid person." His friends know
him as a timid person and everyone expects him to act
this way. He may prefer to be timid and may use his
passivity to achieve certain ends.
People may speak for him. People may protect and

care for him. It' he really wants to bo bold and aggres
sive the group should help him to he this way. Timidity
is a habit that ho has practiced for many years. He has
developed a timid expression and a quality of hesitation
in his voice and he has learned to walk with an un
certain gait. The group should help him to see what
makes him timid and. within the group situation, he
can learn and practice new behavior. He can learn to
siand straight and look people in the eye. He can learn
to speak and walk with confidence. He can practice
being bold and aggressive until hp learns how.
Looking At The Group
You can look at the group in various ways. Every
thing that goes on in the group happens for a reason
and is usually related to something that has just taken
place. A member of the group may talk about being
spanked as a child because he feels rebuked by the
group. He may talk about Society's loneliness because
he feels isolated from other members of the group. Both
love and hate may serve to strengthen the cohesiveness
of the group. Look at the group as a family constella
lion. Do you react towards certain members of the
group as you react towards certain members of your
own family? Look at the group dynamics. What are the
similarities and differences among members of the
group? Do the passive ones seek out the dominant
ones? Do members with the same religion or philosophy
form subgroups? How does the group respond when
somebody leaves or a now member comes? How does the
group handle problems of discipline?
Stop the meeting every once in awhile and ask.
"What's beeh going on?" What are the themes, the
predominant currents of emotion, which have charac
terized the meeting? And 15 minutes before the mooting
ends, try to sum up or "rehash" what's been going on.
After the initial period of strained conversation, mem
bers of the group will probably go through a stage of
testing each other by expressing angry feelings, and,
finally, when members of the group learn to trust each
other, positive feelings will bo expressed and members
of the group will come to fool very close to each other.
Group therapy offers a way for us to come together
and learn about our feelings and it can help us to deal
with our loneliness, frustration, and anxiety.

can learn and practice new behavior. He can learn to

Looking At The Group
You can look at the group in various ways. Every
thing that goes on in the group happens for a reason
and is usually related to something that has just taken
place. A member of the group may talk about being
spanked as a child because he feels rebuked by the
group. He may talk about Society's loneliness because
he feels isolated from other members of the group. Both
love and hate may serve to strengthen the cohesiveness
of the group. Look at the group as a family constella
lion. Do you react towards certain members of the
group as you react towards certain members of your
own family? Look at the group dynamics. What are the
similarities and differences among members of the
group? Do the passive ones seek out the dominant
ones? Do members with the same religion or philosophy
form subgroups? How does the group respond when
somebody leaves or a now member comes? How does the
group handle problems of discipline?
Stop the meeting every once in awhile and ask.
"What's beeh going on?" What are the themes, the
predominant currents of emotion, which have charac
terized the meeting? And 15 minutes before the mooting
ends, try to sum up or "rehash" what's been going on.
After the initial period of strained conversation, mem
bers of the group will probably go through a stage of
testing each other by expressing angry feelings, and,
finally, when members of the group learn to trust each
other, positive feelings will bo expressed and members
of the group will come to fool very close to each other.
Group therapy offers a way for us to come together
and learn about our feelings and it can help us to deal
with our loneliness, frustration, and anxiety.

(Author's Note: Nothing is more important or more
difficult to understand than our own feelings, but there
is little plaee in the college curriculum for talking about
feelings. Part of my medical school training has been a
group therapy experience, one (hat was quite meaning
ful. Perhaps after reading this article, other students
might wish to organize a group in order to undergo such
an experience. II so, call U2.~»-1059 for the answers to any
questions about the concept and its implementation.)
We have all known loneliness, frustration, and anxi
ety, but we don't talk about these feelings very often.
Think of the millions of lonely people in hotel rooms,
on park benches, in burlesque theaters, with pocket
radios; wallflowers, spinsters, Marty's, and handsome
successful people who never admit they are lonely—
the Marilyn Monroes. We live side by side, but for some
reason we are frightened to come together to talk.
Group therapy can be a remedy for loneliness. It
means that people come together and talk about their
feelings. It is easy to organize a group and you don't
really need to have a trained therapist. Get a group of
7 people; they may be similar or different and they
may be acquaintances but it is probably better if they
aren't close friends. Meet once a week for 90 minutes.
Arrange the chairs in a circle so that you can all see
each other. Agree to certain rules: that no one hits any
body; that what goes on in the group is strictly between
ihe members of the group and not to be discussed with
people outside the group.
Come For Different Reasons
People will come to the group for different reasons.
Some will come to meet people. Some will come to talk
about problems. Others will come and they won't really
know why. In the beginning, people will feel uncom
fortable. They imagine that people are going to probe
into their insides and that someone will see the "mon
ster" they've been hiding. They imagine that people will
see through their pretty "self-images" and learn that
they are not really so clever or exciting as they let on.
They don't know what subjects are appropriate for
discussion. Can you talk about the baseball game or do
you have to lalk about problems? You can talk about
anything you want, but try to express your feelings
about it. It is better to say how you feel about a base
ball game than to talk without feeling about your
problem.

The group should listen for the feelings underneath
what is said and respond to the feelings instead of the
actual words. If someone says"I have a dentist appoint
ment tomorrow," it may appear on the surface that
they are merely staling a fact, hut if you observe their
facial expression, posture, and tone of voice, you may
pick up the message that they arc frightened. They
want to talk about their fear but they're afraid that
you will reject their feeling and consider it foolish. So
instead of saying "I'm afraid of the dentist," they give
you clues that they arc frightened; They look fright
ened; their muscles are tense; there is a tremor in their
voice. They are trying to tell you without words that
they are frightened.
If you respond to their words and say, "Do you have
a cavity?" or "Who is your dentist?" you are missing
the point of their communication. Respond to their feel
ing in a way which indicates that you understand what
they are trying to say and that you accept it. If you
*>ay, "I get a feeling that you are frightened about it."
you are showing them that you understand and accept
their feeling of fear and you are communicating in a
meaningful way.
'Noil-Verbal' Messages
We communicate by actions as well as words, and the
group should learn to interpret such "non-verbal" mes
sages. When a member of the group sits near the door
or looks oui the window he may be saying that he
wants to leave. When ho comes late he may be saying
that he didn't want to come at all. When he brings up
his problems near the end of the meeting he may be
saying that he doesn't want to hear the group's re
sponse. When he remains silent he may be saying many
things. It is true that "actions speak louder than words"
but we must train ourselves to hear them.
The group is a little world like tin 1 one outside and
the group can help you to understand and change your
behavior on the outside. Take the person who is shy
and withdrawn, lie lacks confidence and is afraid to
assert himself. In the group, such a person is timid and
doesn't talk very much. When the group points this out,
lie admits that hp is "a timid person." His friends know
him as a timid person and everyone expects him to act
this way. He may prefer to be timid and may use his
passivity to achieve certain ends.
People may speak for him. People may protect and

care for him. It' he really wants to bo bold and aggres
sive the group should help him to he this way. Timidity
