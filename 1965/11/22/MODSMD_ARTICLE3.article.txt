# SEIZE LASSU CONTROL:
## Was GCC 'Power Bloc'? 
### JIM BRISCOE (Second in series 
The Crovv-lla Ivor son report and the
questions raised by recent Berkeley
demonstrations combined lo produce
a dramatic change in the usually apa
thetic climate ol' student government.
Suddenly large segments of the stu
dent body were talking about student
administration relationships, and the
role of the student in the University.
And the Graduate Coordinating
Committee, which had been discussing
these questions since its conception,
took a major role in the dialogue.
The first political arena in which
these questions were raised was the

Legislature. Much has been said about
the GCC "power bloc" which seized
control of LASSU, but GCC members
firmly deny that there was any sort
of planned takeover.
Kadane Kxplains
As Jay Kadane, a GCC member and
one of the more active members of
Legislature last year, noted, "although
most GCC members agreed in prin
ciple on the basic issues, they were
very individualistic people who could
really never reach an agreement on
tactics except on the most abstract
level."
Kadane added that the 13 GCC mem
bers of Legislature were for the most
part good friends who often discussed
■the issues and questions among them
selves. However, he said, "the degree
to which the GCC operated as a for
mal organization has been overesti
mated. It was more a group of rela
tively like-minded individuals who
tried to bring what they considered
to bp the issues before the commu
nity."
The first of these issues was the
famed "sole jurisdiction" resolution
passed by Legislature immediately
following publication of the Crow-
Hal v orson report.
This resolution, sponsored by Ka
dane. was for the most part very
moderate, and almost apologetic.
However, included in the fourth re
solved clause was the statement: "we
assert that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs and
conduct."
Heated Debute
This sentence was the cause of
much heated debate, with GCC mem
bers being among its strongest de
fenders. Proponents of the section
carried the day as a motion to strike
thi- statement failed
Another GCC member. Gary Fold
man, undertook to write a by-laws

amendment which would include the
sense of this assertion into the ASSU
By-laws. He was joined by fourth-year
law student Robert Sangster. who was
not a member of the GCC. and to
get her they produced the judicial
competence bill which was over
whelmingly approved by Legislature.
The bill provided that all University
policy must be approved by Legisla
ture before becoming official ASSU
policy.
Feldman was later a member of the
Committee of 15 which worked out a
compromise version of this bill that
was accepted by the administration
and the Executive Council of the Aca
demic Council.
GCC members were also active in
working for more liberal social regu
lations for women during the ASSU
presidential campaign and the referen
dum on off-campus issues.
The GCC position on off-campus is
sues according 1 to Tom Sherman, pres
ently chairman of the GCC Steering
Committee, and is that it is difficult,
perhaps impossible to separate <»n
-eampus and off-campus issues.
Sherman Speaks
"How is a stand taken on discrimi
natory hiring practices and adniis

The first of these issues was the
famed "sole jurisdiction" resolution
passed by Legislature immediately
following publication of the Crow-
Hal v orson report.
This resolution, sponsored by Ka

moderate, and almost apologetic.
However, included in the fourth re
solved clause was the statement: "we
assert that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs and
conduct."

Another GCC member. Gary Fold

amendment which would include the
sense of this assertion into the ASSU
By-laws. He was joined by fourth-year
law student Robert Sangster. who was
not a member of the GCC. and to
get her they produced the judicial
competence bill which was over
whelmingly approved by Legislature.
The bill provided that all University
policy must be approved by Legisla
ture before becoming official ASSU
policy.
Feldman was later a member of the
Committee of 15 which worked out a
compromise version of this bill that
was accepted by the administration
and the Executive Council of the Aca
demic Council.
GCC members were also active in
working for more liberal social regu
lations for women during the ASSU
presidential campaign and the referen
dum on off-campus issues.
The GCC position on off-campus is
sues according 1 to Tom Sherman, pres
ently chairman of the GCC Steering
Committee, and is that it is difficult,
perhaps impossible to separate <»n
-eampus and off-campus issues.
Sherman Speaks
"How is a stand taken on discrimi
natory hiring practices and adniis
sions jh Stanford different from a
stand taken on discriminatory hiring
practices by local businessmen, or
businessmen in Mississippi?" Sher
man asked.
In accord of their positions <»n <>ff
campus issues, the Committee organ
ized and sponsored debates and rallies
on such issues as U.S. Policy in Viet

civil rights.
The GCC distributed information
about American financial support of
Apartheid policies in South Africa,
and GCC members joined in the dem
onstrations at banks and corporations
with holdings there.
The Crovv-lla Ivor son report and the
questions raised by recent Berkeley
demonstrations combined lo produce
a dramatic change in the usually apa
thetic climate ol' student government.
Suddenly large segments of the stu
dent body were talking about student
administration relationships, and the
role of the student in the University.
And the Graduate Coordinating
Committee, which had been discussing
these questions since its conception,
took a major role in the dialogue.
The first political arena in which
these questions were raised was the

Legislature. Much has been said about
the GCC "power bloc" which seized
control of LASSU, but GCC members
firmly deny that there was any sort
of planned takeover.
Kadane Kxplains
As Jay Kadane, a GCC member and
one of the more active members of
Legislature last year, noted, "although
most GCC members agreed in prin
ciple on the basic issues, they were
very individualistic people who could
really never reach an agreement on
tactics except on the most abstract
level."
Kadane added that the 13 GCC mem
bers of Legislature were for the most
part good friends who often discussed
■the issues and questions among them
selves. However, he said, "the degree
to which the GCC operated as a for
mal organization has been overesti
mated. It was more a group of rela
tively like-minded individuals who
tried to bring what they considered
to bp the issues before the commu
nity."
