# Five Straight For Tribe
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
A determined Stanford foul hall
team won their fifth consecutive Big
Game from Cal on Saturday, hut tey
had to stage a comeback to do it. The
Indians scored nine points in the sec
ond half to triumph 9-7.
After fumbling away a touchdown
at the end of the first half, a field
goal gave Stanford a 3-0 lead. Then,
at the outset of the fourth period, Cal
came alive and drove for a touchdown
and extra point to put them ahead, 7 3.
Stanford stormed l ight back, however,
and marched 70 yards in 11 plays for
the game's final score.
.Ray Handley capped ihe drive with

;i fine twisting run for 11 yards and
the score. Handley, who was voted
Hack of the Game, was almost the
goat. It was he who fumbled Dave
Lewis' pitch-out on tiie one yard line
of Cal near the end of the first half.
Paul Hoeber, Cal linebacker, pounced
on ihe ball, and Cal ran out the clock.
First Score
The first score of the afternoon
came midway through the third
period. Stanford marched 51 yards in
11 plays following Glen Myers' fumble
recovery, but the drive sputtered to a
halt on the one yard line. Terry De-
Sylvia came in and booted a three
pointer.
One of the key plays in the drive

came on a second down and 12 yards
to go from the Stanford 47. Lewis
charged around left end for a 14-yard
gain and a first down. A few plays
later he did it again.
Lewis turned around to hand off
at the Cal 3."5, but nary a soul was
there. So, he cut over right tackle
and charged straight upfield for 17
yards to the 17-yard line. A run lost
one yard and a pass fell incomplete,
and the Tribe faced a third and 11 sit
uation. Lewis faded back to pass and
rifled one to Bob Conrad on the four
who had outcut his defender on a
down-and-in pattern.
Cal's defense stiffened at this point,
and three runs gained just three

yards. DeSylvia came in and after a
delay of game penalty split the up
rights from 24 yards out.
After an exchange of punts Cal
made their bid for the Axe. With the
ball on their own 3K at the start of
the fourth quarter, quarterback Jim
Hunt and halfback Tom Relies pulled
off what was probably the key play
in the drive. Stanford's front four. Al
Wilburn, Hill Miller, Mike Hibler, and
Monty Mohrman, apparently had
Hunt trapped for a 20-yard loss when
at the last second he flipped the ball
to Relics.
Relies took the pass at the line of
scrimmage and behind a blocker
scooted for 15 yards.
Two runs went nowhere, su
Hunt decided to take to the air
again. Twice in succession he
hit halfback Lloyd Heist with a
flare pass to the right for gains
of 10 and 28 yards. Relies slant
ed over left end from four yards
out on the next play for six
points.
Stanford >loves
Leading 7-3, Cal kicked off to
Stanford. Phil Humphreys took
the ball on the 11 and returned
to the 30. Stanford immediately
started biting off yardage in
first down size chunks. Lewis
fired a bullet to Humphreys on
a deep hook at the Stanford 44
for a first down to start things.
Handley and Lewis then took
turns running and made it to
the Cal 29. Next, Lewis hit Con
rad who caught the ball just

out of tht* end /.one. The same
passing combination came right
back two plays later, and Lewis
hit Conrad on ;i down-and-in pat
tern at the l 11. The pass covered
IS yards and came on a third
and 11 situation.
Handley took the ball on the
next play, cut over l ight tackle,
faked two tacklers, and turned
upfield. He sliced between two
defenders to score the go-ahead
points.
Dp Sylvia missed the extra
point, but Stanford led, 9 7.
Archaic ."Move
After the ensuing kick-off, Cal
made a first down on a play that
is a genuine antique in Ameri
can football. On third down, Cal
needed seven yards for a first
down. Hunt rolled right seem
ingly looking for a downfield
receiver. Heist, who was flanked
right, came behind Hunt, took

the Statue of Liberty liand-olf
from behind Hunl's ear and
swept left end tor eight yards
and a first down.
The Bears were forced to punt
soon afterwards when Wilburn
and Miller nailed Hunt for a 20
yard loss, and Bob Hath, who
was named Lineman of the
Game, hit Relies for a four-yard
loss.
Rath's line backing mate, Glen
Myers, was close behind in the
voting for the game's top line
man.
Time was running out when
Cal got the ball back. After a
sideline pass to Jerry Bradley,
who caught t he last second pass
to win the Pcnn State game,
gave Cal a first on their 30 with
one minute to go.
The Indian defensive quelled
the attack, however, as Mohr
man hit Hunt for a 15 yard loss.

and Craig Ritchey leaped high
to snag a Hunt pass.
Ritchey returned the ball 20
yards to the Cal 32. Two runs
later Stanford had won t ho 68th
annual Big Game.
The first half was a series of
missed opportunities and crucial
defensive plays as Stanford was
thwarted thrice and Cal once on
a p p a r en t 1 y goalward-bound
drives.
Speedy Dale Rubin stopped
Cal when he picked off a de
flected pass the first time the
Bears had the ball. He returned
it 26 yards to midfield.
Stanford couldn't capitalize on
Rubin's interception. The tribe
failed to make a first down on
a fourth and one at the Cal 22.
The Indians muffed another
break near the end of the half.
Miller recovered Hunt's fumble

after Guillory had applied a
bone jarring tackle.
Stanford moved 77 yards to
the one-yard line where Hand
ley fumbled.
Of course, they might not
have ever got there if it hadn't
been for Handley. His 21-yard
run around end set up the scor
ing opportunity.

A determined Stanford foul hall
team won their fifth consecutive Big
Game from Cal on Saturday, hut tey
had to stage a comeback to do it. The
Indians scored nine points in the sec
ond half to triumph 9-7.
After fumbling away a touchdown
at the end of the first half, a field
goal gave Stanford a 3-0 lead. Then,
at the outset of the fourth period, Cal
came alive and drove for a touchdown
and extra point to put them ahead, 7 3.
Stanford stormed l ight back, however,
and marched 70 yards in 11 plays for
the game's final score.
.Ray Handley capped ihe drive with

;i fine twisting run for 11 yards and
the score. Handley, who was voted
Hack of the Game, was almost the
goat. It was he who fumbled Dave
Lewis' pitch-out on tiie one yard line
of Cal near the end of the first half.
Paul Hoeber, Cal linebacker, pounced
on ihe ball, and Cal ran out the clock.
First Score
The first score of the afternoon
came midway through the third
period. Stanford marched 51 yards in
11 plays following Glen Myers' fumble
recovery, but the drive sputtered to a
halt on the one yard line. Terry De-
Sylvia came in and booted a three
pointer.
One of the key plays in the drive

came on a second down and 12 yards
to go from the Stanford 47. Lewis
charged around left end for a 14-yard
gain and a first down. A few plays
later he did it again.
Lewis turned around to hand off
at the Cal 3."5, but nary a soul was
there. So, he cut over right tackle
and charged straight upfield for 17
yards to the 17-yard line. A run lost
one yard and a pass fell incomplete,
and the Tribe faced a third and 11 sit
uation. Lewis faded back to pass and
rifled one to Bob Conrad on the four
who had outcut his defender on a
down-and-in pattern.
Cal's defense stiffened at this point,
and three runs gained just three

yards. DeSylvia came in and after a
delay of game penalty split the up
rights from 24 yards out.
After an exchange of punts Cal
made their bid for the Axe. With the
ball on their own 3K at the start of
the fourth quarter, quarterback Jim
Hunt and halfback Tom Relies pulled
off what was probably the key play
in the drive. Stanford's front four. Al
Wilburn, Hill Miller, Mike Hibler, and
Monty Mohrman, apparently had
Hunt trapped for a 20-yard loss when
at the last second he flipped the ball
to Relics.
Relies took the pass at the line of
scrimmage and behind a blocker
scooted for 15 yards.
Two runs went nowhere, su
Hunt decided to take to the air
again. Twice in succession he
hit halfback Lloyd Heist with a
flare pass to the right for gains
of 10 and 28 yards. Relies slant
ed over left end from four yards
out on the next play for six
points.
Stanford >loves
Leading 7-3, Cal kicked off to
Stanford. Phil Humphreys took
the ball on the 11 and returned
to the 30. Stanford immediately
started biting off yardage in
first down size chunks. Lewis
fired a bullet to Humphreys on
a deep hook at the Stanford 44
for a first down to start things.
Handley and Lewis then took
turns running and made it to
the Cal 29. Next, Lewis hit Con
rad who caught the ball just

out of tht* end /.one. The same
passing combination came right
back two plays later, and Lewis
hit Conrad on ;i down-and-in pat
tern at the l 11. The pass covered
IS yards and came on a third
and 11 situation.
Handley took the ball on the
next play, cut over l ight tackle,
faked two tacklers, and turned
upfield. He sliced between two
defenders to score the go-ahead
points.
Dp Sylvia missed the extra
point, but Stanford led, 9 7.
Archaic ."Move
After the ensuing kick-off, Cal
made a first down on a play that
is a genuine antique in Ameri
can football. On third down, Cal
needed seven yards for a first
down. Hunt rolled right seem
ingly looking for a downfield
receiver. Heist, who was flanked
right, came behind Hunt, took

the Statue of Liberty liand-olf
from behind Hunl's ear and
swept left end tor eight yards
and a first down.
The Bears were forced to punt
soon afterwards when Wilburn
and Miller nailed Hunt for a 20
yard loss, and Bob Hath, who
was named Lineman of the
Game, hit Relies for a four-yard
loss.
Rath's line backing mate, Glen
Myers, was close behind in the
voting for the game's top line
man.
Time was running out when
Cal got the ball back. After a
sideline pass to Jerry Bradley,
who caught t he last second pass
to win the Pcnn State game,
gave Cal a first on their 30 with
one minute to go.
The Indian defensive quelled
the attack, however, as Mohr
man hit Hunt for a 15 yard loss.

and Craig Ritchey leaped high
to snag a Hunt pass.
Ritchey returned the ball 20
yards to the Cal 32. Two runs
later Stanford had won t ho 68th
annual Big Game.
The first half was a series of
missed opportunities and crucial
defensive plays as Stanford was
thwarted thrice and Cal once on
a p p a r en t 1 y goalward-bound
drives.
Speedy Dale Rubin stopped

A determined Stanford foul hall
team won their fifth consecutive Big

had to stage a comeback to do it. The
Indians scored nine points in the sec
ond half to triumph 9-7.
After fumbling away a touchdown
at the end of the first half, a field
goal gave Stanford a 3-0 lead. Then,
at the outset of the fourth period, Cal
came alive and drove for a touchdown
and extra point to put them ahead, 7 3.
Stanford stormed l ight back, however,
and marched 70 yards in 11 plays for
the game's final score.
.Ray Handley capped ihe drive with

;i fine twisting run for 11 yards and
the score. Handley, who was voted
Hack of the Game, was almost the

came on a second down and 12 yards

charged around left end for a 14-yard

Lewis turned around to hand off
at the Cal 3."5, but nary a soul was
there. So, he cut over right tackle
and charged straight upfield for 17
yards to the 17-yard line. A run lost
one yard and a pass fell incomplete,
and the Tribe faced a third and 11 sit
uation. Lewis faded back to pass and
rifled one to Bob Conrad on the four
who had outcut his defender on a
down-and-in pattern.
Cal's defense stiffened at this point,
and three runs gained just three

yards. DeSylvia came in and after a
delay of game penalty split the up
rights from 24 yards out.

A determined Stanford foul hall
team won their fifth consecutive Big
Game from Cal on Saturday, hut tey
had to stage a comeback to do it. The
Indians scored nine points in the sec
ond half to triumph 9-7.
After fumbling away a touchdown
at the end of the first half, a field
goal gave Stanford a 3-0 lead. Then,
at the outset of the fourth period, Cal
came alive and drove for a touchdown
and extra point to put them ahead, 7 3.
Stanford stormed l ight back, however,
and marched 70 yards in 11 plays for
the game's final score.
.Ray Handley capped ihe drive with

;i fine twisting run for 11 yards and
the score. Handley, who was voted
Hack of the Game, was almost the
goat. It was he who fumbled Dave
Lewis' pitch-out on tiie one yard line
of Cal near the end of the first half.
Paul Hoeber, Cal linebacker, pounced
on ihe ball, and Cal ran out the clock.
First Score
The first score of the afternoon
came midway through the third
period. Stanford marched 51 yards in
11 plays following Glen Myers' fumble
recovery, but the drive sputtered to a
halt on the one yard line. Terry De-
Sylvia came in and booted a three
pointer.
One of the key plays in the drive

came on a second down and 12 yards
to go from the Stanford 47. Lewis
charged around left end for a 14-yard
gain and a first down. A few plays
later he did it again.
Lewis turned around to hand off
at the Cal 3."5, but nary a soul was
there. So, he cut over right tackle
and charged straight upfield for 17
yards to the 17-yard line. A run lost
one yard and a pass fell incomplete,
and the Tribe faced a third and 11 sit
uation. Lewis faded back to pass and
rifled one to Bob Conrad on the four
who had outcut his defender on a
down-and-in pattern.
Cal's defense stiffened at this point,
and three runs gained just three

yards. DeSylvia came in and after a
delay of game penalty split the up
rights from 24 yards out.
After an exchange of punts Cal
made their bid for the Axe. With the
ball on their own 3K at the start of
the fourth quarter, quarterback Jim
Hunt and halfback Tom Relies pulled
off what was probably the key play
in the drive. Stanford's front four. Al
Wilburn, Hill Miller, Mike Hibler, and
Monty Mohrman, apparently had
Hunt trapped for a 20-yard loss when
at the last second he flipped the ball
to Relics.
Relies took the pass at the line of
scrimmage and behind a blocker
scooted for 15 yards.
Two runs went nowhere, su
Hunt decided to take to the air
again. Twice in succession he
hit halfback Lloyd Heist with a
flare pass to the right for gains
of 10 and 28 yards. Relies slant
ed over left end from four yards
out on the next play for six
points.
Stanford >loves
Leading 7-3, Cal kicked off to
Stanford. Phil Humphreys took
the ball on the 11 and returned
to the 30. Stanford immediately
started biting off yardage in
first down size chunks. Lewis
fired a bullet to Humphreys on
a deep hook at the Stanford 44
for a first down to start things.
Handley and Lewis then took
turns running and made it to
the Cal 29. Next, Lewis hit Con
rad who caught the ball just

out of tht* end /.one. The same
passing combination came right
back two plays later, and Lewis
hit Conrad on ;i down-and-in pat
tern at the l 11. The pass covered
IS yards and came on a third
and 11 situation.
Handley took the ball on the
next play, cut over l ight tackle,
faked two tacklers, and turned
upfield. He sliced between two
defenders to score the go-ahead
points.
Dp Sylvia missed the extra
point, but Stanford led, 9 7.
Archaic ."Move
After the ensuing kick-off, Cal
made a first down on a play that
is a genuine antique in Ameri
can football. On third down, Cal
needed seven yards for a first
down. Hunt rolled right seem
ingly looking for a downfield
receiver. Heist, who was flanked
right, came behind Hunt, took

the Statue of Liberty liand-olf
from behind Hunl's ear and
swept left end tor eight yards
and a first down.
The Bears were forced to punt
soon afterwards when Wilburn
and Miller nailed Hunt for a 20
yard loss, and Bob Hath, who
was named Lineman of the
Game, hit Relies for a four-yard
loss.
Rath's line backing mate, Glen
Myers, was close behind in the
voting for the game's top line
man.
Time was running out when
Cal got the ball back. After a
sideline pass to Jerry Bradley,
who caught t he last second pass
to win the Pcnn State game,
gave Cal a first on their 30 with
one minute to go.
The Indian defensive quelled
the attack, however, as Mohr
man hit Hunt for a 15 yard loss.

and Craig Ritchey leaped high
to snag a Hunt pass.
Ritchey returned the ball 20
yards to the Cal 32. Two runs
later Stanford had won t ho 68th
annual Big Game.
The first half was a series of
missed opportunities and crucial
defensive plays as Stanford was
thwarted thrice and Cal once on
a p p a r en t 1 y goalward-bound
drives.
Speedy Dale Rubin stopped
Cal when he picked off a de
flected pass the first time the
Bears had the ball. He returned
it 26 yards to midfield.
Stanford couldn't capitalize on
Rubin's interception. The tribe
failed to make a first down on
a fourth and one at the Cal 22.
The Indians muffed another
break near the end of the half.
Miller recovered Hunt's fumble

after Guillory had applied a
bone jarring tackle.
Stanford moved 77 yards to
the one-yard line where Hand
ley fumbled.
Of course, they might not
have ever got there if it hadn't
been for Handley. His 21-yard
run around end set up the scor
ing opportunity.

and Miller nailed Hunt for a 20
yard loss, and Bob Hath, who
was named Lineman of the
Game, hit Relies for a four-yard
loss.
Rath's line backing mate, Glen
Myers, was close behind in the
voting for the game's top line
man.
Time was running out when
Cal got the ball back. After a
sideline pass to Jerry Bradley,
who caught t he last second pass
to win the Pcnn State game,
gave Cal a first on their 30 with
one minute to go.
The Indian defensive quelled
the attack, however, as Mohr
man hit Hunt for a 15 yard loss.

and Craig Ritchey leaped high
to snag a Hunt pass.
Ritchey returned the ball 20
yards to the Cal 32. Two runs
later Stanford had won t ho 68th
annual Big Game.
The first half was a series of
missed opportunities and crucial
defensive plays as Stanford was
thwarted thrice and Cal once on
a p p a r en t 1 y goalward-bound
drives.
Speedy Dale Rubin stopped
Cal when he picked off a de
flected pass the first time the
Bears had the ball. He returned
it 26 yards to midfield.
Stanford couldn't capitalize on
Rubin's interception. The tribe
failed to make a first down on
a fourth and one at the Cal 22.
The Indians muffed another
break near the end of the half.
Miller recovered Hunt's fumble

after Guillory had applied a
bone jarring tackle.
Stanford moved 77 yards to
the one-yard line where Hand
ley fumbled.
Of course, they might not
have ever got there if it hadn't
been for Handley. His 21-yard
run around end set up the scor
ing opportunity.
