# Five Straight For Tribe
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
A determined Stanford foul hall
team won their fifth consecutive Big
Game from Cal on Saturday, hut tey
had to stage a comeback to do it. The
Indians scored nine points in the sec
ond half to triumph 9-7.
After fumbling away a touchdown
at the end of the first half, a field
goal gave Stanford a 3-0 lead. Then,
at the outset of the fourth period, Cal
came alive and drove for a touchdown
and extra point to put them ahead, 7 3.
Stanford stormed l ight back, however,
and marched 70 yards in 11 plays for
the game's final score.
.Ray Handley capped ihe drive with

;i fine twisting run for 11 yards and
the score. Handley, who was voted
Hack of the Game, was almost the
goat. It was he who fumbled Dave
Lewis' pitch-out on tiie one yard line
of Cal near the end of the first half.
Paul Hoeber, Cal linebacker, pounced
on ihe ball, and Cal ran out the clock.
First Score
The first score of the afternoon
came midway through the third
period. Stanford marched 51 yards in
11 plays following Glen Myers' fumble
recovery, but the drive sputtered to a
halt on the one yard line. Terry De-
Sylvia came in and booted a three
pointer.
One of the key plays in the drive

came on a second down and 12 yards
to go from the Stanford 47. Lewis
charged around left end for a 14-yard
gain and a first down. A few plays
later he did it again.
Lewis turned around to hand off
at the Cal 3."5, but nary a soul was
there. So, he cut over right tackle
and charged straight upfield for 17
yards to the 17-yard line. A run lost
one yard and a pass fell incomplete,
and the Tribe faced a third and 11 sit
uation. Lewis faded back to pass and
rifled one to Bob Conrad on the four
who had outcut his defender on a
down-and-in pattern.
Cal's defense stiffened at this point,
and three runs gained just three

yards. DeSylvia came in and after a
delay of game penalty split the up
rights from 24 yards out.
After an exchange of punts Cal
made their bid for the Axe. With the
ball on their own 3K at the start of
the fourth quarter, quarterback Jim
Hunt and halfback Tom Relies pulled
off what was probably the key play
in the drive. Stanford's front four. Al
Wilburn, Hill Miller, Mike Hibler, and
Monty Mohrman, apparently had
Hunt trapped for a 20-yard loss when
at the last second he flipped the ball
to Relics.
Relies took the pass at the line of
scrimmage and behind a blocker
