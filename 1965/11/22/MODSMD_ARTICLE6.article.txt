## 
### 
At noon Saturday, a line of Vietnam
Day Committee marchers reached the
five miles from the University of Cali
fornia campus in Berkeley to DeFre
mery Park in Oakland. Berkeley pol
ice estimated their number at 10,000.
The march, sponsored by the Berk
eley VDC, brought together students,
faculty, and other citizens from as far
away as Eugene and Salt Lake City
to protest both President Johnson's
policy in Vietnam and the policies of
those "who would restrict the Consti
tutional guarantees of freedom of
speech and assembly."
Ginsberg. Kcsey, and YAF
Refused a parade permit by the
Oakland City Council because the
march would "endanger" persons and
property, the VDC obtained from Fed
eral District Court Judge William
Sweigert an injunction requiring that
Oakland issue the permit.
There were no major incidents. The
Hell's Angels, who had previously
planned a counter-demonstration, said
Friday that they would not obstruct
the march. They were persuaded, ac

cording to some, by poet Allen Gins
berg and author Ken Kescy.
Some supporters of the Johnson pol
icy, including members of Young Am
ericans for Freedom, grouped along
the parade route with signs reading
"Stamp Out VDC," "Win in Vietnam,"
"More War," and "We Stand Firm
with i.hr Police." A few bystanders
showered the demonstrators with con
fetti made from copies of a VDC
statement. "Why We March against
the War in Vietnam."
It quoted South Vietnamese Premier
Nguyen Cao Kv as saying in an in
terview with the London Daily Mirror,
"I have only one [hero] -Hitler." In
DeFremery park, speakers were fre
quently interrupted by hecklers and
by an air-horn, later eonfisticated by
the Oakland police.
Nathaniel Walker, a student from
Selma University who stood under a
sign reading "We Come from Selma
for Freedom in Oakland and Peace
in Vietnam," said that many Negroes
who are disenfranchised in the South
are reluctant to support American ef
forts in Vietnam.
