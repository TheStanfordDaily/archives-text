Stanford Origin
CONSCIENCE' the Committee
On National Student Citizenship In
Every National Case of Emergency
was founded by two Stanford stu
dents. Hal Scott of Rockford, 111., and
Michael Cummings of Oxford, Ohio.
It has been organized nationally
through individual Young Republicans
and Young Democrats.
Bi-partisan political support has
come from California Governor Pat
Brown, Senator Thomas Kuchel, and
Congressmen Charles M. Teague.
ttumly ('raises
Presidential Assistant McGeorge
Bundy sent Scott and Cummings a let
ter praising their plans for a "well
reasoned discussion of our country's
purposes in Vietnam.
"I have never doubted that a strong
majority among the universities un
derstands and supports these pur
poses, but your program is most wel
come as a means to further that un
derstanding in accordance with our
country's democratic processes,"
Bundy added.
More than 2~t California institutions
will participate in the "lecture-in,"
which is scheduled two days after Sat
urday's Vietnam Day Committee's
march in Berkeley and Oakland.
Thin'* Views
In recent news interviews. Thai has
indicated that Southeast Asia could
achieve peace and stability if Russian
influence prevailed over Communist
China in that region.
An engineer by training and one of
the original promoters of the Mekong
River development plan. Thai feels the
region must develop an independent
partnership of states, protected by
the big powers without being their
instruments.
Pauker was one of the featured
participants in last spring's Vietnam
"teach-in" in Washington, D.C.. where
he supported the Administration's
basic position.
The CONSCIENCE debate will be
broadcast live by KZSU at S p.m.

. . . lint Lucks Yl)'s Support

The CONSCIENCE group, although founded at Stanford,
has failed to gain the backing of the Stanford Young
Democrats or the California and national YD organizations.
Hal Scott, National Co-Chairman of CONSCIENCE,
claims that "California is the only state where neither the
Young Democratic chairman on the organizing campus nor
the state organization has supported CONSCIENCE."
On the other hand, nearly 3,000 tSanford students have
signed a CONSCIENCE petition backing the view ex
pressed by President Johnson in his Johns Hopkins Uni
versity address. This constitutes an all-time high for in
dividual student expression of opinion on any national
issue at Stanford.

YD's Uncommitted
The Stanford Young Democrats
have remained uncommitted.
President Jack Porter said, "We
have taken no official stand prior to
our voting on a resolution this Tues
day night." At that time the members
will vote on three resolutions, sub
mitted by CONSCIENCE, the Stan
ford Committee For Peace in Viet
nam (SCPV), and an officer of the
club.
Whatever the decision, Porter
added, specific policies, not any par
ticular organization, will be endorsed.
The California Young Democrats
issued a white paper on August 25)
which presented policies "closer to
those of the SCPV than CON
SCIENCE," said the local campaign
chairman.
CONSCIENCE Speaks
In their statement of purpose,
CONSCIENCE notes: "Mass demon
strations against American foreign
policy at a critical juncture such as
the present reduce the chances for
lasting peace and imperil the national
security.
