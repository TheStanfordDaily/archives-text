# Graduates Probe Role Of College

### JIM BRISCOE (Last In a series 
Tho Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee, after its controversial entry
into University politics last year, is
continuing its "re-examination of the
political and educational operation of
the University," this year according to
Igor Webb, co-editor of the GCC
Newsletter and a member of the
Steering Committee.
This year, like last year, the GCC
plans to provide an organizational
means for individual students to pre
sent their programs and ideas to the
University community, he said.
Three Assumptions
In a report on their activities, Steer
ing Committee Chairman Tom Sher
man notes that GCC actions are based
on three assumptions.
• "The basic task of the University
is to perpetuate, enlarge, and criticize
culture, and society must support but
not control this process, for its own
benefit."
• "Although political influences up
on the dialogue of education arc in
tolerable, that dialogue should influ
ence political life; students and teach
ers bear an obligation to apply their
learning actively to society."
• "The faculty and students, the
community of scholars, comprise tho
essential and defining life of the Uni
versity. Administration of procedural
regulations, while not tho normal busi
ness of scholars, is implicitly their
responsibility."
Headings
Sherman goes on to say that GCC
activities can therefore be considered
under three headings corresponding
roughly to these assumptions. The
categories are, debate on the nature
of the University; involvement in po
litical life outside the University; and
involvement in University political
life.
The GCC Newsletter is a good ex
ample of the first type of activity,
Sherman told Th»> Daily. This year's
first issue will be distributed in about
a week. The issue will contain an arti
cle on the involvement of the Univer
sity and the Stanford Research Insti
tute with the defense industries, as
well as several articles on the Viet
nam question, according to Webb.
Symposium
Sherman pointed to the GCC-spon
sored symposium on "Civil Liberties,
the War and the Draft." as the sort
of activity envisioned in the second
category. Last year the GCC spon
sored a number of debates and forums
on such questions as foreign policy,
migrant labor, and civil rights.
It is true however, that the GCC
is not as active in some areas as it
was last year. Sherman believes that
part of the reason lies in the success
of the group last year.
"One of the goals of the GCC is to
promote discussion of the role of the
student in the University and the role
of the University in society," he said.
"Last year we certainly succeeded in
promoting such discussion."
"Considerable progress was also
achieved last year in many of the
areas where the GCC was active, par
ticularly judicial reform and student
participation in the decision-making
process," he added, "although these
isues are by now resolved."
Other Groups
He also noted that, a number of
questions with which the GCC might
otherwise be involved are being taken
up this year by other groups. "The
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam. and SAUS (Stanford Association
of University Scholars) are good ex
amples of such organizations," he said.
In addition the noon rallies spon
sored by the GCC and the GCC news
letter have sparked similar activities
by many other groups, some of them
directly opposed to the GCC.
Another reason for some decline in
tlie GCC's activities is that the mem
bers arc themselves students with
theses to write, courses to take and
teach and exams to pass, Sherman
added.
Nevertheless the GCC remains a
political force on the Stanford cam
pus, and one which neither its sup
porters or its opponents have for
gotten.
