# Vietnam Fights Its Past
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
"For the past 25 years the Viet
namese have had to search for the
meaning of nationhood while living
by the law ol' the gun," Vu Van Thai,
Vietnamese ambassador-delegate to
the United States, told a crowd ol"
several hundred in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
The ambassador's address was part
of a lecture-in presented by CON
SCIENCE, Committee on National
Student Citizenship in Every Case of
Emergency. Similar "lecture-ins" took
place simultaneously across the coun
try at more than 300 college campuses.
Thai said thai the people's fight

for social justice had been usurped
by a series of dictatorships since the
1940'5.
Despite the hardships of the Japan
ese. "the falacious alternative of in
dependence" under French rule, and
the personal dictatorship of Diem,
Thai noted that the Vietnamese have
still not lost their vitality to carry out
a non-communist revolution. He ac
cused communists of manipulating
nationalist values in an attempt to
win over the nation.
Part of the present political tur
moil in the nation is the lack of con
census among the people. Thai noted
that the various dictatorships always
had a tacit agreement with the com-

munists to eliminate non-communist
movements. "The search for positive
progress and unity of tho country has
been hampered in past years because
there was not chance for dialogue,"
the ambassador told the audience.
Crystal ization
With the fall of the Diem regime,
the nation has come to a stage of po
litical crystalization, characterized by
the Buddhist movement, the student
organizations, and the army. Thai
outlined the present goals of the na
tion, and commented that their
achievement in large part "would be
due to the commitment of the United
States." Basically, the nation seeks to
choose its own institutions and mod'-
ify them in accordance with the po
litical progress of the people; peace
in South East Asia; and freedom from
Red Chinese annexation.
Guy Pauker of the Rand Corpora
tion, the other principal speaker on
the program told the audience that
the basic issue in Vietnam is the ef
fectiveness of the Red Chinese policy
of violence in attaining its goals.
Pathological
Pauker described Chinese polities as
being in a "pathological condition."
"As long as the Chinese rely on vio
lence for effecting sociological transi
tions and the execution of foreign
policy, that government must be con
tained."
If America fails to defeat this form
of aggression in Asia, Pauker ol>-
served that within the next few years
the United States could expect the
proliferation of the same sort of war.
"If we lose, it will demonstrate to
activists all over the world the method
of violence works," he said.
Posing the question of why Viet
nam, Pauker said that the United
States had no choice but to fight.
Turning to history, he pointed out
that dominant powers in the world
have also been the dominant force
in shaping the ideas of men.
"Bastion America"
"The structure of American society
would be changed greatly by a change
in the world." he observed. A "bastion
America" policy, though feasible,
would undermine this country as well
as eliminate the free exchange of
ideas in the world which is necessary
for tho well being of America.
Pauker rebuked those who opposed
the war in Vietnam because of
"doubts or guilt feelings" resulting
from the failure of the Vietnamese
government to hold elections in ac
cordance with the Geneva Agreements
of 1954. The agreement, he noted,
decided the fate of 15 million people
yet the document was signed by mili
tary and not representative leaders
for the French and Communists.

"As long as the Chinese rely on vio
lence for effecting sociological transi
tions and the execution of foreign
policy, that government must be con
tained."
If America fails to defeat this form
of aggression in Asia, Pauker ol>-
served that within the next few years
the United States could expect the
proliferation of the same sort of war.
"If we lose, it will demonstrate to
activists all over the world the method
of violence works," he said.
Posing the question of why Viet
nam, Pauker said that the United
States had no choice but to fight.
Turning to history, he pointed out
that dominant powers in the world
have also been the dominant force
in shaping the ideas of men.
"Bastion America"
"The structure of American society
would be changed greatly by a change
in the world." he observed. A "bastion
America" policy, though feasible,
would undermine this country as well
as eliminate the free exchange of
ideas in the world which is necessary
for tho well being of America.
Pauker rebuked those who opposed
the war in Vietnam because of
"doubts or guilt feelings" resulting
from the failure of the Vietnamese
government to hold elections in ac
cordance with the Geneva Agreements
of 1954. The agreement, he noted,
decided the fate of 15 million people
yet the document was signed by mili
tary and not representative leaders
for the French and Communists.
"For the past 25 years the Viet
namese have had to search for the
meaning of nationhood while living
by the law ol' the gun," Vu Van Thai,
Vietnamese ambassador-delegate to
the United States, told a crowd ol"
several hundred in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
The ambassador's address was part
of a lecture-in presented by CON
SCIENCE, Committee on National
Student Citizenship in Every Case of
Emergency. Similar "lecture-ins" took
place simultaneously across the coun
try at more than 300 college campuses.
Thai said thai the people's fight

for social justice had been usurped
by a series of dictatorships since the
1940'5.
Despite the hardships of the Japan
ese. "the falacious alternative of in
dependence" under French rule, and
the personal dictatorship of Diem,
Thai noted that the Vietnamese have
still not lost their vitality to carry out
a non-communist revolution. He ac
cused communists of manipulating
nationalist values in an attempt to
win over the nation.
Part of the present political tur
moil in the nation is the lack of con
census among the people. Thai noted
that the various dictatorships always
had a tacit agreement with the com-

munists to eliminate non-communist
movements. "The search for positive
progress and unity of tho country has
been hampered in past years because
there was not chance for dialogue,"
the ambassador told the audience.
Crystal ization
With the fall of the Diem regime,
the nation has come to a stage of po
litical crystalization, characterized by
the Buddhist movement, the student
organizations, and the army. Thai
outlined the present goals of the na
tion, and commented that their
achievement in large part "would be
due to the commitment of the United
States." Basically, the nation seeks to
choose its own institutions and mod'-
ify them in accordance with the po
litical progress of the people; peace
in South East Asia; and freedom from
Red Chinese annexation.
Guy Pauker of the Rand Corpora
tion, the other principal speaker on
the program told the audience that
the basic issue in Vietnam is the ef
fectiveness of the Red Chinese policy
of violence in attaining its goals.
Pathological
Pauker described Chinese polities as
being in a "pathological condition."
"As long as the Chinese rely on vio
lence for effecting sociological transi
tions and the execution of foreign
