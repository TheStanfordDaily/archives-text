The work of French Sculptor
Francois Stahly, who was artist
in-residence at Stanford last
year, is being exhibited now to

Art Gallery.
Also included is the paper and
cloth collage artistry of his wife,
Claude Stahly, who accompanied
him during his Stanford stay
and who is an internationally
recognized designer of book
bindings.
The wood sculpture presented
by Stahly to the Stanford art
collection is part, of the current
exhibition, as well as several
other sculpture pieces, and
photographs and models of his
work in this country and abroad

Seasons Fountain" at the Golden
Gateway Project in San Fran
cisco, lhe steeple of the Church
of Notre Dame de France at
Bizcrte, Tunisia, the fountain at
Seattle World's Fair —and the
unfinished sculpture, "El Palo
Alto," done while he was at Stan
ford.
In addition to his gift to the
University, other Stahly sculp
ture has been purchased for a
permanent place on the campus.
One piece is at the entrance to
the now Stanford Faculty Club,
another will be placed in the
courtyard of the Graduate
School of Business, now under
construction. The latter was
awarded first prize in the Tokyo
Sculpture Biennial.
