# 'The Greatest' Dumps Patterson In Boxing Match Of Surprises
## 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Cassius Clay tortured a dead
game Floyd Patterson unmerci
fully and handed the ex-cham
pion a fierce beating last night
to score a technical knockout in
2:18 of the 12th round of his
second heavyweight tille de
fense.
Referee Harry Krause finally
stopped the slaughter while Pat
terson wuhhled back from an
other barrage of punches. Floyd
protested weakly through swol
len lips,
Clay, who prefers to be known
by his Black Muslim name of
Muhammad Ali, had Patterson
on the deck in the sixth round.
When Clay failed to go to a neu
tral corner, the referee stopped
the count at five and waited
four more seconds, for Clay to
get in the corner.
Patterson finally got up wob
bly at. the count of nine. That
was ihc only knockdown.
Cassius did nothing but dance
and move in the first round.
After that, he appeared to be
toying with Floyd, who was try
ing to become the first man ever
to win the title three times.
Time after time Buster Wat
son, his trainer, picked Pat
terson up bodily at the end of a
round as if to stretch Floyd's
aching back muscles.
The crowd of some 8,300
cheered Patterson and booed the
champ throughout the night.
They disagreed with the ref
eree's decision to end itâ€”but it
was a humane move by a com
petent official.
Several Clay partisans tried

to charge into the ring at the
end only to bo ejected by a
posse of police officers after a
struggle.
Clay flicked that stinging jab
into Patterson's face all night
long, raising lumps around both
of his eyes. It seemed impossible
that Patterson could continue
but, just when it appeared he
must go, Clay backed off and
started jabbing and moving
again.
Referee Krause warned Clay
several times about talking to
his opponent, yelling "stop iho
chatter" at the super-confident
champion time and again.
"1 was so surprised he could
take so many punches," Clay
said after the fight. "I dare any
man to take what he took. 1 am
a heavyweight Ray Robinson."
Clay fought with his hands
down at his side, flicking the
jab, doubling up with the hook
and occasionally driving home
the right to the head.
Cassius would drop his hands
and just ease his head out of
the way of Patterson's wild
shots. Floyd, painfully slow in
contrast to the quick moves of
Clay, kept plugging along
throwing punches but landing
most of them on thin air.
The live crowd at the Conven
tion Center and the thousands
who watched on the closed cir
cuit telecast had made Patter
son the sentimental favorite, but
the oddsmakers in this garish
gambling town had Clay a 13-5
choice.
"I didn't want to make any

excuses hut 1 want to say to my
millions of fans that I trained
hard," Patterson said. ''I did
everything I could to win it for
my fans all over the country.
"None of my plans worked.
Maybe even without the back
they wouldn't have worked."
Asked about his back: "I've
had trouble with my back since
19.vt. A specialist told me rest
was the best thing for it but
it was trover this bad before.
There is a very strong possibil
ity 1 may quit."

After the fiasco in Lewiston,
Maine, last May 2"i when Sonny
Liston went out quickly from a
still debated Clay punch, the
crowd rcacted favorably to Pat
terson's game stand. 11" must
have won him friends from
coast lo coast and in the Brit
ish Isles where the Early Bird
satellite beamed the show into
the wee morning hours.
The man Clay had derided as
"the rabbit"* turned out to be
a battler with tho heart of a
lion.
