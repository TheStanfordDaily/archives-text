# Namath's Attire Poor; But Play Pleases Coach
## 
### 
Joe Namath. who wears his
$400,000 price lag immaculately,
apparently doesn't do as well by
a tie.
He has boon seen around town
at various discotheques, some of
the swankier hangouts such as
Toot Shor's and at Broadway
shows, even posing for a picture
with Barbra Streisand when ho
visited her backstage at "Funny
Girl."
He also has been seen around
town without a tie.
It was reported that when
Jets' owner Sonny Werblin saw
his $400,000 quarterback at the
Joey GiardellorDick Tiger cham
pionship fight sans cravat he
diplomatically suggested that
Namath get his hands on a four
in-hand.
The subject has remained a
matter of light discussion ever
since and was touched on Sun
day in the Jets' dressing room
after he passed for four touch
downs--tying a club record—in
a 43-14 victory over Houston.
Namath naturally was in a
light, mood and parried ques
tions in that vein.
He pointed out that he had
never before thrown four touch
down passes •— even in high
school and compared his ad

vancement as a pro to failing a
biology or chemistry course be- :
fore finally passing the third j
time around because "you know
the material better."
Eventually the subject turned :
to Namath's personal activities J
and someone asked him what a i
typical day was like.
"Practice, go home, study |
films, sleep, get up. study films. <
practice," he replied. "That's all |
there is."
Greeted by a chorus of j
"C'mon," Namath volunteered:
"Okay. I do go to one dive. But |
it's so bad I won't give you the ;
name."
I)o you have to wear a tie j
1 here ?
Namath shrugged his shoul
ders, and all attention immedi- i
ately focused on the owner of i
the discotheque. What about the 1
tie?
"He has to wear a tie," said
the owner. "But he doesn't." i
