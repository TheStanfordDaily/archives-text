## An Unregistered Cadillac? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Who is I ho Unknown Student
whose dark blue Cadillac sedan
is often found parked, not. in
distant Escondido Village, or
even in one of Stanford's only-a
day's - walk - from - Quad off
eampus student parking lots,
hut right on Quad itself, im
mediately outside the hack door
of Wally's office, sans parking
sticker of any kind, and yet
unmolested hy Chief Davis' tick
eting terrors?
Surely a University on the
Edge of Greatness cannot play
favorites in a matter like this.
1 ask you, brave men of the
Stanford Police Department,
can this Unknown Student be
more able to fight back than
those who have already been so
forcefully taught that Crime
Does Not Pay in your recent
crusade to eradicate one partic
ular form, at least, of crime hi
the streets?
Let us then finish the impor
tant: task that we have under
taken. We shall all sleep better
when this Unknown Student is
brought to the bar of Police De
partment justice to answer for
his criminal acts, along with
others who show their lack of
regard for the Fundamental
Standard by refusal to obtain
parking permits. To do less, my
friends, is a disservice to the

Founding Grant and to the sa
cred memory of Little Leland.

• Exit, Vile Element!)!
Editor, The Daily:
Many of us have become quite
concerned over the decidedly
nasty turn the debate or* U.S.A.
involvement in Vietnam has
taken, I would like to make the
following suggestions:
• Both the pro- and anti-war
groups should disassociate them
selves from any and all profess
ors. The only use most profess
ors have made in this contro
versy of their Ph.D.'s has been
to pass off their nonsense as
great profundity.
• The anti-war movement
should rid itself of all bearded
members. The beards serve the
same function as the Ph.D.,s.
• The pro-war movement
should rid itself of all fraternity
members. Fraternity member
ship serves the same function as
beards and Ph.D.'s.
Anyone doubting propositions
(2.) and (3.) need only attend
a noon rally at White Memorial
Plaza. Anyone doubting propo
sition (1.) need only read in The
Daily the comments of Drek
meir, Possony, Hoisti, Doolin,
and Polhemus.
Not until we have rid our
selves of these unsavory ele
ments may the real issues of

Vietnam be intelligently dis
cussed!

• 'Casa Cares'
Editor, The Daily:
Those who have attended
Stanford-in-Italy will remember
Mr. and Mrs. Robert MeConell
of Casa Cares. The McConells
have sponsored a children's
home for the past 17 years. The
children, mostly from Southern
Italy and 100 in number range
from 6 to 16 years of age. They
are largely clothed, fed and edu
cated by the McConells and their
friends.
For any who vcfauld like to
help, we intend to send a Christ
mas check and any old clothing
that Stanford students wish to
give. Contributions may be sent
to Box 2591, Stanford, or con
tact John Ravanaugh, AKL
House, or Steve Martindale,
Stern Hall, or Jaei Wotila, Bran-
WM'.

• Over The Edge
Editor, The Daily:
Why did Sterling want to paint
the tile roofs purple?
Because Stanford was on the
edge of tfrapeness.
