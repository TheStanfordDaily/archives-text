## Architecture At Stanford-The Bland Lead The Bland 
### Mike Couzens 
Prof. Otis Pease is fond of
reminding us that brownstone is
a building material which comes
soft from the quarry, but hard
ens with time.
Ii is surprising that Stanford,
a university proud of the for
ward sweep of its research,
should adhere to an architectur
al norm distinguished only by
its sterility.
The early buildings were not
sterile, but a real distinction.
Styled in Richardson Roman
eque by Charles A. Coolidge,
they presented a contiguous
theme, influenced by the Cali
fornia Missions, the Moors, and
the ideas of H. 11. Richardson.
Compared to Virginia
Andrew White, President of
Cornell, praised them in 1892 as
surpassing "any others which
had at that time been erected
for university purposes in the
United States." Their continuity
was equaled, he thought, only
by Virginia, which Founder
Thomas Jefferson designed him
self.
The original plan of Frederick
Law Olmstead. the landscape
architect, was for similar quad
rangles to be added at the sides
of the original edifice.
But 75 years, and Hoover Tow
er, intervened to force the
hodge-podge effect which Dr.
White had deplored at other
universities.
Brownstone and red tile, the
ingredients of the quad, have
been transferred to grim con
crete facades and red tile. The
ugliness of Stern Hall, naked
without tile, has apparently pre
cipitated a grim resolve that
never again will Stanford fall
victim to roofing innovation.
Stern Begat Wilbur
The massiveness of the quad
lingers, too, but in shoebox imi
tations which Coolidge and Olm
stead might well deplore. Stern
begat Wilbur, so that in a saner
day, the long halls and bunker
like exteriors linger.
Only the euphemism "housing
unit" seems to save these build
ings from the coldness which
the old monicker, "dormitory,"
calls to mind.
There have been successes.
The Storke Student Publications

Building, with its skylight, tall
windows, and attractive outside
fixtures, has captured the spirit
of the quad, or of "The Farm"
if you prefer, without submit
ting to the oppressive norm.
The new student health center
portends well. And Tresidder, de
signed bv the same architect as
Stern, does no violence to unity
because of an appearance all its
own.
But in academic buildings,
form, far from following func
tion, surrenders to it. McCol
lough and Varian Physics retain
the tile. They also retain a rec
tangular squat effect which, in
MeCollough. is worsened by po
sitioning windows just below
the eaves.
A Massive Future
Prospects for the future ap
pear not better. The Chemical
Engineering buildings, from the
architect's renderings, are no
different from their extant cou
sins. And the Undergraduate Li
brary, judging from the plans,
the scale model, and the skele
ton, is a mass of concrete which
dwarfs adjacent buildings to its
crowded lot.
In sum, an attempt at unity
has instead resulted in buildings
with the uniformity of criminal
retention facilities. Is it not pos
sible that diverse buildings could I
create their own units—one of'
quality—as distinguished from j
variations on a rigid pattern?
Frank Lloyd Wright, in 1954
and long before the current orgy
of construction, complained that j
"Stanford's buildings not only!
are eye-sores, they are soul-1
sores . . . The whole campus is
a confused mass of disassociated 1
buildings set up in a bastard I
style."
Could it be that Wright's com
ments were not out of bitter
ness, but out of hope for some
thing better?

The Daily is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
over, letters should not exceed
300 words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on 65-space
lines and double-spaced.
