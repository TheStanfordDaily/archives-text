## Vietnam And The Sino-Soviet Split 
### 
Vietnam is more than a "test
case of the new Communist
strategy" as Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara termed
the conflict on March 16. 196-1;
if is, rather, a test case of the
militant Chinese variation of
classical Marxist-Leninist strat
egy, and thus lias profound ram
ifications on the complex inter
relations between China, the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.
In reality, both the Russians
and the Chinese have modified
Marxist-Leninist strategy to
suit their own needs.
The Chinese, as was discussed
in yesterday's column, have op
ted for a strategy of violent,
continuous assault in all under
developed areas. According to a
major ideological pronounce

ment of September 3, 1965, made
by Chinese Defense Minister Lin
Piao, the communists plan to
envelop the rural areas of the
world first -roughly, the South
ern Hemisphere—then the ur
ban areas—the Northern Hemi
sphere. Th is represents a
complete reversal of Marxist
teaching, which held that the ur
ban proletariat would be the
backbone of the revolution.
The Russians on the other
hand no longer hold that war
is "inevitable" between commu
nists and capitalists since even
local wars could easily escalate
into a nuclear holocaust. "Peace
ful coexistence" is now the strat
egy of the Soviet bloc: the U.S.
is to be outproduced, out-Sput
niked and generally outdone in

its dealings with the underdevel
oped non-communist third of the
globe. The Russians, thus, toler
ate leftist neutralism abroad
while embarking on "goulash
communism" at home. Even for
mer Premier Kruschchev's much
quoted support of "national wars
of liberation" has been widely
misinterpreted in the West.
Kruschchev claimed in his Janu
ary 6, 1961 speech extolling
national-liberation wars that the
U.S. did not intervene on the
French side in the Indo-ehinese
war because we feared that the
Chinese and Russians would in
turn aid the rebels, "which could
have led to a world war." lie
concluded that the "outcome of
the war is known. North Viet
nam won." Note that Khrusch

chev said nothing of the Pathet
Lao or the Viet Cong and their
renewed efforts to bring the rest
of Indochina under communist
control.
Indeed, throughout the esca
lating conflict in Vietnam, the
Soviet Union has said little . . .
and done even less. As one high
ranking State Department offi
cial said of his recent talks with
Premier Kosygin; although it is
apparent that Vietnam itself is
not a prime concern of the So
viet Union, the Soviets are ex
tremely embarrassed by the fact
that they cannot stop the U.S.
from bombing North Vietnam.
Yet there is a much more se
rious side to the Russian dilem
ma. As two high-ranking offi
cials acknowledged, Soviet-U.S.
negotiations on disarmament
and other issues are at a "stand
still," partially because of the
collective leadership problems in
the new Soviet set-up, but most
ly because of the continuing
Sino-Soviet dispute and the
"cloud" of the Vietnam conflict.
Moscow, another high official
said, will not say anything pub
licly about negotiating a settle
ment in Vietnam because the
Soviets are now preoccupied
with Peiping and the struggle
for control of the communist in
ternational movement. They arc
too conscious of being called "re
visionists" by the Chinese. Thus,
he concluded, although Moscow
would prefer to see the problem
returned to the conference table,
it will not publicly urge negotia
tions— even in the U.N.- nor

continue its own bilateral nego- j
tiations with the U.S.
If the U.S. cannot thus depend
on Russian aid in finding a way
out of the Vietnam dilemma
with honor, it certainly cannot
hope to make a reasonable set
tlement. with the Chinese. As
one high official put it, the prob
lem with U.S.-Chinese relations
is not lack of contact; rather,
the U.S. just does not. like what
it finds. Two recent statements
by Chinese leaders are consid
ered proof of continued—if not
increased — Chinese intransi
gence.
Defense Minister Lin Piao's
revolutionary document men
tioned above, in which the U.S.
is labelled, among other things,
"the most rabid aggressor in hu
man history and the most fero
cious common enemy of the peo
ple of the world."
Foreign Minister Chen Yi's re
cent pronouncement concerning
Red China's "terms" for accept
ing U.N. membership. The U.N.
must "correct" its resolution of,
1950 calling China and North'
Korea the aggressors in South
Korea and draft a new resolu
tion calling the U.S. the aggres
sor. Moreover, "all imperialist
puppets" must he kicked out of
the international organization.
Vietnam, then, is more than a
challenge to U.S. policy; it is a
source of conflict within the
formerly monolithic communist
bloc as well.

Vietnam is more than a "test
case of the new Communist
strategy" as Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara termed
the conflict on March 16. 196-1;
if is, rather, a test case of the
militant Chinese variation of
classical Marxist-Leninist strat
egy, and thus lias profound ram
ifications on the complex inter
relations between China, the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.
In reality, both the Russians
and the Chinese have modified
Marxist-Leninist strategy to
suit their own needs.
The Chinese, as was discussed
in yesterday's column, have op
ted for a strategy of violent,
continuous assault in all under
developed areas. According to a
major ideological pronounce

ment of September 3, 1965, made
by Chinese Defense Minister Lin
Piao, the communists plan to
envelop the rural areas of the
world first -roughly, the South
ern Hemisphere—then the ur
ban areas—the Northern Hemi
sphere. Th is represents a
complete reversal of Marxist
teaching, which held that the ur
ban proletariat would be the
backbone of the revolution.
The Russians on the other
hand no longer hold that war
is "inevitable" between commu
nists and capitalists since even
local wars could easily escalate
into a nuclear holocaust. "Peace
ful coexistence" is now the strat
egy of the Soviet bloc: the U.S.
is to be outproduced, out-Sput
niked and generally outdone in

its dealings with the underdevel
oped non-communist third of the
globe. The Russians, thus, toler
ate leftist neutralism abroad
while embarking on "goulash
communism" at home. Even for
mer Premier Kruschchev's much
quoted support of "national wars
of liberation" has been widely
misinterpreted in the West.
Kruschchev claimed in his Janu
ary 6, 1961 speech extolling
national-liberation wars that the
U.S. did not intervene on the
French side in the Indo-ehinese
war because we feared that the
Chinese and Russians would in
turn aid the rebels, "which could
have led to a world war." lie
concluded that the "outcome of
the war is known. North Viet
nam won." Note that Khrusch

chev said nothing of the Pathet
Lao or the Viet Cong and their
renewed efforts to bring the rest
of Indochina under communist
control.
Indeed, throughout the esca
lating conflict in Vietnam, the
Soviet Union has said little . . .
and done even less. As one high
ranking State Department offi
cial said of his recent talks with
Premier Kosygin; although it is
apparent that Vietnam itself is
not a prime concern of the So
viet Union, the Soviets are ex
tremely embarrassed by the fact
that they cannot stop the U.S.
from bombing North Vietnam.
Yet there is a much more se
rious side to the Russian dilem
ma. As two high-ranking offi
cials acknowledged, Soviet-U.S.
negotiations on disarmament
and other issues are at a "stand
still," partially because of the
collective leadership problems in
the new Soviet set-up, but most
ly because of the continuing
Sino-Soviet dispute and the
"cloud" of the Vietnam conflict.
Moscow, another high official
said, will not say anything pub
licly about negotiating a settle
ment in Vietnam because the
Soviets are now preoccupied
with Peiping and the struggle
for control of the communist in
ternational movement. They arc
too conscious of being called "re
visionists" by the Chinese. Thus,
he concluded, although Moscow
would prefer to see the problem
returned to the conference table,
it will not publicly urge negotia
tions— even in the U.N.- nor

continue its own bilateral nego- j
tiations with the U.S.
If the U.S. cannot thus depend
on Russian aid in finding a way
out of the Vietnam dilemma
with honor, it certainly cannot
hope to make a reasonable set
tlement. with the Chinese. As
one high official put it, the prob
lem with U.S.-Chinese relations
is not lack of contact; rather,
the U.S. just does not. like what
it finds. Two recent statements
by Chinese leaders are consid
ered proof of continued—if not
increased — Chinese intransi
gence.
Defense Minister Lin Piao's
revolutionary document men
tioned above, in which the U.S.
is labelled, among other things,
"the most rabid aggressor in hu
man history and the most fero
cious common enemy of the peo
ple of the world."
Foreign Minister Chen Yi's re
cent pronouncement concerning
Red China's "terms" for accept
ing U.N. membership. The U.N.
must "correct" its resolution of,
1950 calling China and North'
Korea the aggressors in South
Korea and draft a new resolu
tion calling the U.S. the aggres
sor. Moreover, "all imperialist
puppets" must he kicked out of
the international organization.
Vietnam, then, is more than a
challenge to U.S. policy; it is a
source of conflict within the
formerly monolithic communist
bloc as well.

case of the new Communist
strategy" as Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara termed
the conflict on March 16. 196-1;
if is, rather, a test case of the
militant Chinese variation of
classical Marxist-Leninist strat
egy, and thus lias profound ram
ifications on the complex inter
relations between China, the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.
In reality, both the Russians
and the Chinese have modified
Marxist-Leninist strategy to
suit their own needs.
The Chinese, as was discussed
in yesterday's column, have op
ted for a strategy of violent,
continuous assault in all under
developed areas. According to a
major ideological pronounce

ment of September 3, 1965, made
by Chinese Defense Minister Lin
Piao, the communists plan to
envelop the rural areas of the
world first -roughly, the South
ern Hemisphere—then the ur
ban areas—the Northern Hemi
sphere. Th is represents a
complete reversal of Marxist
teaching, which held that the ur
ban proletariat would be the
backbone of the revolution.
The Russians on the other
hand no longer hold that war
is "inevitable" between commu
nists and capitalists since even
local wars could easily escalate
into a nuclear holocaust. "Peace
ful coexistence" is now the strat
egy of the Soviet bloc: the U.S.
is to be outproduced, out-Sput
niked and generally outdone in

its dealings with the underdevel
oped non-communist third of the
globe. The Russians, thus, toler
ate leftist neutralism abroad
while embarking on "goulash
communism" at home. Even for
mer Premier Kruschchev's much
quoted support of "national wars
of liberation" has been widely
misinterpreted in the West.
Kruschchev claimed in his Janu
ary 6, 1961 speech extolling
national-liberation wars that the
U.S. did not intervene on the
French side in the Indo-ehinese
war because we feared that the
Chinese and Russians would in
turn aid the rebels, "which could
have led to a world war." lie
concluded that the "outcome of
the war is known. North Viet
nam won." Note that Khrusch

chev said nothing of the Pathet
Lao or the Viet Cong and their
renewed efforts to bring the rest
of Indochina under communist
control.
Indeed, throughout the esca
lating conflict in Vietnam, the
Soviet Union has said little . . .
and done even less. As one high
ranking State Department offi
cial said of his recent talks with
Premier Kosygin; although it is
apparent that Vietnam itself is
not a prime concern of the So
viet Union, the Soviets are ex
tremely embarrassed by the fact
that they cannot stop the U.S.
from bombing North Vietnam.
Yet there is a much more se
rious side to the Russian dilem
ma. As two high-ranking offi
cials acknowledged, Soviet-U.S.
negotiations on disarmament
and other issues are at a "stand
still," partially because of the
collective leadership problems in
the new Soviet set-up, but most
ly because of the continuing
Sino-Soviet dispute and the
"cloud" of the Vietnam conflict.
Moscow, another high official
said, will not say anything pub
licly about negotiating a settle
ment in Vietnam because the
Soviets are now preoccupied
with Peiping and the struggle
for control of the communist in
ternational movement. They arc
too conscious of being called "re
visionists" by the Chinese. Thus,
he concluded, although Moscow
would prefer to see the problem
returned to the conference table,
it will not publicly urge negotia
tions— even in the U.N.- nor

continue its own bilateral nego- j
tiations with the U.S.
If the U.S. cannot thus depend
on Russian aid in finding a way
out of the Vietnam dilemma
with honor, it certainly cannot
hope to make a reasonable set
tlement. with the Chinese. As
one high official put it, the prob
lem with U.S.-Chinese relations
is not lack of contact; rather,
the U.S. just does not. like what
it finds. Two recent statements
by Chinese leaders are consid
ered proof of continued—if not
increased — Chinese intransi
gence.
Defense Minister Lin Piao's
revolutionary document men
tioned above, in which the U.S.
is labelled, among other things,
"the most rabid aggressor in hu
man history and the most fero
cious common enemy of the peo
ple of the world."
Foreign Minister Chen Yi's re
cent pronouncement concerning
Red China's "terms" for accept
ing U.N. membership. The U.N.
must "correct" its resolution of,
1950 calling China and North'
Korea the aggressors in South
Korea and draft a new resolu
tion calling the U.S. the aggres
sor. Moreover, "all imperialist
puppets" must he kicked out of
the international organization.
Vietnam, then, is more than a
challenge to U.S. policy; it is a
source of conflict within the
formerly monolithic communist
bloc as well.
