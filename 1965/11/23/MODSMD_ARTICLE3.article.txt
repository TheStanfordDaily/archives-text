# With 5,000 Acres-No Place To Park

### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor First in a Series 
- Amidst 5,000 acres of open farm
land, Stanford faces an ironic short
age of land—at least for parking
automobiles.
Put in straight figures, however,
the reason for the problem becomes
apparent. Each day some 16,000 per
sons attempt to aprk 13,000 cars in a
land area measuring a square mile
and already filled with vital academic
buildings and other facilities.
The parking problem is thus one
that involves a complex interplay of
planning and development. And it also
involves finances.
Stanford Business Manager Dwight
Adams has the job of seeing that the
University somehow balances its ex
penses with its income. According to
Adams, a $10 student registration fee
for cars was set four or five years
ago. The amount, he said, was estab
lished almost arbitaraily, but the reas
on for its being levied was not.
