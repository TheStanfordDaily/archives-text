# Dauterman Aids Blind
## 
### 
"A soft glove on a strong hand,"
describes, in the words of a colleague.
William L. Dauterman's humanitarian
career. Blinded since the age of 12,
Dauterman devotes his life to helping
the blind and the disabled.
Most recently he has developed a
new and simple intelligence test which
may help blind persons discover their
talents for new careers.
As chief of vactional services of the
Division of Rehabilitation Medicine at
Stanford University School of Medi
cine, Dauterman's task is to guide dis
abled persons toward an occupational
adjustment.
In working with the blind, he had
to rely mainly on verbal tests to de
termine their ability for re-training
and employment. However, verbal
tests did not give an objective over-all
picture of learning skills. A new test,
based on tactile sense, was needed to
give precise information on the per
son.
Dauterman himself recalls an expe
rience he had as a boy after his acci
dent. "I really got my hands involved
when I lost my sight and had all that
lime to kill." As a result he developed
hobbies and an unusual interest for
manual arts.
I'semln vi-rbal Facility
"Verbal measurements," Dauterman
says, "aiv entirely out of place for
some blind persons, particularly the
educationally deprived, those from so
cially impoverished backgrounds, and
those with language barriers, fur
thermore, some persons develop a
pseudo-verbal facility which leads to
questionably high scores on verbal
tests while educational deprivation in
others causes low scores."
Aided by research psychologist
Richard M. Suinn, and research assist
ants Bernice Shapiro and Emily Gar
field, 'Daulerman worked 1o find a
test that could be especially adapted
for adult blind persons.
IN' studied available intelligence
tests and found one particularly suit
ed for his purpose, the Kohs Block
Design Test developed at Stanford
nearly 10 years ago by Samuel C.
Kohs as a thesis for a doctorate in
psychology. The test was subsequent
ly published and has been widely used
for measuring intelligence in non-dis
abled children. The test consists of
colored cubes which have to be as
sembled to make a given design. It
scores a person's mental level by test
ing his ability al problem-solving.

"Because Stanford is a private in
stitution." Adams said, "our income
is from tuition, fees, research pro
grams, gifts, and other sources. We
have no tax monies to help support
the physical operations of the Uni
versity.
*.*>(>,ooo In Fees
The student fees, however, hardly
pay the entire costs of providing roads
and other traffic facilities. Each year,
the University collects about $56,000
in auto fees. But it spends at least
$20,000 on road and parking lot main
tenance and $50,000 for police sur
veillance and enforcement. In addi
tion to these expenses, more than
$200,000 was spent last year on new
streets, permanent parking lots, and
temporary pa; king lots.
Assistant Business Manager Dynnie
Post noted that not just one but three
spaces are often needed for each per
son. One is for his residence, another
for his place of work or study, and
a third for meals and services. This
further complicates the traffic situ
ation.
Cars Banned
Post compared registration fees at
Stanford with other colleges although
he emphasized that services vary
widely with each campus. Fees run as
high as $150 a year, he said, and many
campuses have banned student cars
completely. Post admitted that facul
ty members at other colleges often
pay fees as well, although there is no
such fee here.
Streets in and around the Stanford
campus receive heavy use by persons
not associated with the University.
For example, Post cited a county sur
vey made last year which showed that
11,000 cars travel on Foothill road
each day. Many of these cars, he said,
were only passing through the Stan
ford property.
