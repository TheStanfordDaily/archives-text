## 
### 
A meeting for students interested
in forming an anti-draft union will be
held tonight at S:3O in Room 271 of
Tresidder Union.
"The group wiii give an alternative
lo the conscientious objectors," stated
Alan Traister, a supporter of the
group. "Those with political and mor
al objections to the draft are not al
ways qualified to become a consci
entious objector."
The people who attend the meeting
will form the policy for the group,
Traister- said.
The questions to be discussed will
include "What Is the Role of the Uni
versity in War?'', "Should the Univer
sity Cooperate with Selective Service
in Giving Out Grades?", and "How
Can Students Oppose the Draft?".
"Most of tlie anti-draft union ac
tivities will probably be action-orient
ed." Traister said. "They will be clear
demonstrations of opposition to the
war and may include civil disobedi
ence."
