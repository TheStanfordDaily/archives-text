# Student Commission On Housing Formed
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
Assistant Dean of Students Dan
Nowak has announced the formation
of a residential education commis
sion to develop more student involve
ment in the Stanford house plan.
Six committees comprise the pro
gram so far. Nowak said. Eventually
a representative from each Univer
sity residence will sit on the various
committees, and committee chairmen
will form a supervisory commission.
Advisory opinions from the commis
sion will be considered in formulating
undergraduate and graduate housing
policy, Nowak said.
Faculty Associate Programs
Two committees which have been
organized within the last two weeks
are tho faculty associate and guest-in
residence committees. Bill Epmeier,
chairman of the faculty associate pro
gram, said his committee has met
once already and plans to "foster fac

ulty associate programs throughout
t he residences."
A non-resident student associate
program will attempt to bring off
campus, graduate and foreign stu
dents into student living groups for
meals. A coed meal exchange program
will organize meal exchanges among
University operated facilities and may
bo extended to other groups such as
fraternities. Other committees include
career-orientation and special proj
ects.
To Explore New Programs
The commission is being organized
by Nowak and Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Shirley Bushnell. They describe
thte commission's purpose as "coordi
nating pre-defined student resident
programs, exploring new program
areas and activities, and functioning
as an information vehicle for student
residence units."
Each committee is advised by a
residence director and a faculty mem
ber. Student living group officers
were asked late last month to submit
nominees for tUc various committees.
Some groups appointed their mem
bers and others held elections.
Grad Students, Too
Originally the program was direct
ed primarily at undergraduates, No
wak said, but graduate students at
Crothers and Crothers Memorial halls
have expressed interest in developing
graduate residence projects.
"The commission and committees
are being instituted in a trial explora
tory program in student groups,"
Nowak said. Other committees will be
added as the needs arise, he said.
