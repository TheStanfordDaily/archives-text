# 'Cliffies Try Off-Campus Experiment
## 
### 
Radcliffe College will begin an ex
periment next term to allow 20 senior
women to live in apartments off
campus, a Harvard Crimson editorial
states.
The program is especially designed
for those women who have unusual
hours, spend a great deal of time
away from Radcliffe, or find it diffi
cult to adjust to dormitory living.
Radcliffe maintains an extensive
House System, offering dinners, sem
inars, and a concert series to all wom
en residents. So that its students do
not lose contact with other age
groups, Radcliffe has also selected a
number of young couples to live in
its dorms as senior residents.
Positive Advantages
However, many seniors find it im
possible to take advantage of the
House System. For them, living off
campus may have positive advantages
as well. For instance, having her own
apartment would give a senior an
even better opportunity to live 1 among
people of different ages and different
backgrounds.
The Crimson believes that the only
flaw in the otherwise excellent plan
is the decision that the seniors who
live off-campus must be twenty-one.
If the seniors were required to obtain
parental permission, however, the col
lege's in loco parentis responsibility
would be fulfilled.
