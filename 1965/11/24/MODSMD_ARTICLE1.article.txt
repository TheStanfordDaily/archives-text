# God's Work Requires Expanded Facilities

"We have a magnificent grant lor expanding
religious programs but no building out of
which to work," Chaplain Ft. M. Minto told
The Daily last week.
The Chaplain is head of a sub-committee on
office space of the President's Advisory Com
mittee on Religious Activities. "We may be
able to obtain some limited facilities in the
Women's Clubhouse as a temporary solution,"
he reported, "but we are obviously faced with
the need to plan for the construction of a
church house."
"The closer cooperation among the ministers
and the expansion of the program provided by
the Berry money makes this question of office
space an acute one," he stated. The Berry
money is the approximately $30,000 a year in

come earned from a gilt ol $1.3 million from
Alumnus Lowell Berry, given "to encourage
Memorial Church and related activities."
"Wo arc the only department in the Uni
versity with less space than in the past.
Around the time Memorial Church was built,
the present Dean's office was used as a relig
ious activities center and the YWCA had use
of half of the building which is now the West
ern Civ library. All we have now is the vestry,
now used for purposes far beyond its original
design. The need for office space is obvious
to all those connected with the religious pro
gram; expansion is a necessity for the chap
lain's staff alone."
Minto would like to see built behind Memor
ial Church a religious activities center, possi
bly naming it in memory of D. Charles Gard
ner. the University's first chaplain, who served
from 1904-36.
The building would include offices for an

expanded chaplain's staff as well as for all
the denominational ministers. (The campus
ministers requested office space last spring,
asking for eight office rooms, five for full
time offices for campus ministers, two for
secretaries, and one to be shared by two per
sons as a part-time office. Minto looks for addi
tional persons to be added to the chaplain's
staff, one as a coordinator of religious pro
grams, another "to develop the graduate stu
dent field.")
Other facilities would include lounges, "one
for meetings, another just for lounging;" a
"good" library; meeting rooms for discussion
groups; choir practice facilities; a kitchen and
facilities similar to the present ones in the
Women's Clubhouse used for luncheons, etc.
In addition, one great advantage of building
a church house would be that the vestry could
then be used as a small chapel, and meet a
long-time crying need for such a facility.

"Our expanding program needs a building
out of which to work, but we want to be care
ful not to construct a 'religious union,' serving
coffee to pious people," he explained. "We hope
to achieve an optimum size, large enough to
house adequately the staff and its program,
but small enough to keep it in the life of the
University."
By attaching a cantileverod building to the
back of Memorial Church and having it face
a terraced mall where the clock tower is now
located, the University could build the church
house as "a bridge between quad and the stu
dent activities center. The architecture could
blend the classical buildings on the quad with
the modern ones in the Union area. I could
even envisage the building's facade with a
modern abstract mosaic to complement the
mosaic on the Church."
"The important thing is to have a religious
center, a building which would transform the

student sense toward religion into one of be
longing lo a religious community. We want a
eenter where students can make easy contact
with their ministers ;md can meet with one
another," he said.
Minto's plans, first formulated over a decade
ago, fit into the University's long-range mas
ter plan, developed by landscape architect
Thomas Church. The plan, according to Plan
ning Director Harry Sanders, calls for mov
ing the clock tower and removing the wall
between the back of quad and the engineering
buildings to create u terraced mall area.
From funding to dedication takes about
three years, Sanders reported, eight months
to "develop a program," a year and a half
for architectural drawings and bidding, and
about a year for construction.
Sanders will be meeting next week with the
chaplains for preliminary discussions on the
building.
