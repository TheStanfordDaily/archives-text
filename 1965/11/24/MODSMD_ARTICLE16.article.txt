# Staff Deserts Paper In Eastern College
## 
### 
Reprinted from The New York Times

Six staff members of Man
hattan College's weekly news
paper have resigned in protest
against the faculty seizure of
2,000 copies of the current

issue containing an article
critical of Cardinal Spellman.
The article printed in The
Manhattan Quadrangle, was
written by Jim Anderson, a 20-
year-old senior English major.
It stated that Cardinal Spellman
had banned fraternity houses on
Catholic college campuses and
also had forbidden the saying of
'"the Folk Mass in your Arch
bishropic."
A folk mass was described
as a Roman Catholic mass in
which folk singers participate. '
In an editorial announcing
their resignation the student,
staff members conceded that
the article, entitled "Hail to the
Chief," was "in poor taste" and
was factually "inaccurate." They
said that no folk mass had ever
been banned and that banning
of fraternity houses was a col
lege and not an ecclesiastical
regulation.
The editors contended, how
ever, that they were submit
ting their resignations because
they were convinced their con
cept of the freedom of the press
had been violated by college
authorities.
Brother Gregory, the presi
dent of Manhattan College, said
he had conferred for two hours
with three of the newspaper's
editors. He said later that he had
refused to reverse the decision
of Brother Cosmos Gregory, fac
ulty adviser to the student
paper, who had impounded al
most half of the edition of 4.500
copies. In a statement, Brother
Gregory said:
"I was informed that it was
their intention to resign from
the staff unless I reversed their
moderator's decision and accept
ed their definition of the rela
tionship that must exist between
moderator and student.
"I believe it is obvious that
the campus community would
become chaotic were a president
to yield to pressures of this
kind."
