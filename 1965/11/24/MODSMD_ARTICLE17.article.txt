# Columbia President Hits Noisy Minority
## 
### 
HARTFORD.—A student who
rates political activity above edu
cation should surrender his
place "to someone who regards
the university as something
more than an opportunity to
mount an ivy-festooned soap
box," Dr. Grayson Kirk, presi
dent of Columbia University,
said here today.
In a speech on student free
doms and responsibilities pre
pared for delivery at the Great
er Hartford Forum, Dr. Kirk
asserted that "these young ac
tivists represent numerically
a small percentage of the stu
dent body in any institution of
higher learning."
"The minority is noisy and
some if its members are con
spicuous by a studied eccen
tricity in dress and — one sus
pects — in personal hygiene,"
he declared.
"But, taken as a whole, stu
dents today are brighter, more
hardworking, more intellectual
ly mature and clearer in their
career goals than at any time
in the history of American
higher education," he said.
Dr. Kirk discussed several
controversies current in Ameri
can education.
Touching on student com
plaints that American univer
sities had become impersonal
and computerized, ho said rapid
expansion had made it "human
ly impossible for them to de-J
velop smooth and efficient ad-l
ministrative pi o<-eelures.''

On the conflict of research
vs. teaching, Dr. Kirk said some
faculty members "understand
ably are more excited about
their research thatt about their
teaching, particularly when the
teaching is at the undergrad
uate level."
Concerning "the political
rights of student on the cam
pus." the Columbia president
said he believed that recognized
student organizations should be
free to invite any speaker they
choose.
"Similarly," he added, "I be
lieve that students should have
a right to hold meetings to dis
cuss any subject, however con
troversial, provided these meet
ings do not in any way disrupt
normal university activities and
functions," he said.
He affirmed the right of stu
dents to participate in any off
campus activities they desired,
but said that if they got into
trouble they had "no right to
seek special treatment."
"A responsible student," he
declared, "will not resort to or
incite violence." He added that
that was not a position "ac
ceptable to ail activist student
leaders." A university, he said,
"would suffer irremediable dam
age if it allowed itself to become
embroiled institutionally in a
partisan fashion in any subject
of current controversy."
"The point is," he said, "that
if any university becomes politi
cal ized in this fashion, it will
have lost its soul."
