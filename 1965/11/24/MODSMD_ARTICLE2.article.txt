## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
The Social Regulations Committee
in the wake of LASSU hearings last
week to abolish it mot in Roble last
night to discuss three proposed
ehangcs in women's regulations.
The proposals are:
• That the 1:30-2:30 distinction in
late leaves be abolished, and that
freshmen be given 25 2:30 late leaves
per quarter;
• That the Honor Code be extended
so that women would he responsible
for reporting their own social regu
lations violations, instead of having
the house judicial committee members
do it. as is done now; and
• That instead of a late leave quota,
freshmen women he given a certain
quota of late hours to he used between
midnight and G a.m., and distributed
as desired.
Social 'Crutch'
In regard to the first proposal,
Ellen Cook. Committee chairman,
said that the distinction in late hours
was not changed during last spring's
liberalization of regulations "at the
request of the sponsors, who saw
value in having this different ion."
She explained that the distinction
serves "mainly as a crutch" for girls
who want to come in early.
Margaret Speetor, a Roble fresh
man, argued that the distinction is
"artificial." "I think that people at
Stanford are mature enough to know
when they want to come in." she said.
On the third proposal, Sue Evans,
a Committee member, noted, "If we
give freshmen the right to take six
o'cloeks, we are assuming that fresh
men have the same maturity that up
pcrclassmen do. The upperclassmen
would resent that."
Miss Speetor retorted, "I don't think
it's fair to say that freshmen, just be
cause they are freshmen, are not ma
ture."
Molly Fish'
Judy Ansel of Union Residence, an
other Committee member, agreed. "A
girl isn't a jelly fish. She can be re
sponsible," she emphasized.
The freshmen attending the meet
ing were split on the proposal. Two
women from Branner presented a
statement supporting and detailing it.
and suggested that the hours quota
be set at 75.
A Roble freshman argued against
the proposal saying that it would in
volve to much red tape in the addition
and subtraction of hours. "It would be
like balancing your checkbook." she
moaned.
Miss Cook said that the Honor Code
proposal would have to l)e discussed
with Women's Council before any ac
tion could be taken on it, and that the
Committee would prepare and distrib
ute a questionnaire on all three pro
posed changes.

• That the 1:30-2:30 distinction in
late leaves be abolished, and that
freshmen be given 25 2:30 late leaves
per quarter;
• That the Honor Code be extended
so that women would he responsible
for reporting their own social regu
lations violations, instead of having
the house judicial committee members
do it. as is done now; and
• That instead of a late leave quota,
freshmen women he given a certain
quota of late hours to he used between
midnight and G a.m., and distributed
as desired.
Social 'Crutch'
In regard to the first proposal,
Ellen Cook. Committee chairman,
said that the distinction in late hours
was not changed during last spring's
liberalization of regulations "at the
request of the sponsors, who saw
value in having this different ion."
She explained that the distinction
serves "mainly as a crutch" for girls
who want to come in early.
Margaret Speetor, a Roble fresh
man, argued that the distinction is
"artificial." "I think that people at
Stanford are mature enough to know
when they want to come in." she said.
On the third proposal, Sue Evans,
a Committee member, noted, "If we
give freshmen the right to take six
o'cloeks, we are assuming that fresh
men have the same maturity that up
pcrclassmen do. The upperclassmen
would resent that."
Miss Speetor retorted, "I don't think
it's fair to say that freshmen, just be
cause they are freshmen, are not ma
ture."
Molly Fish'
Judy Ansel of Union Residence, an
other Committee member, agreed. "A
girl isn't a jelly fish. She can be re
sponsible," she emphasized.
The freshmen attending the meet
ing were split on the proposal. Two
women from Branner presented a
statement supporting and detailing it.
and suggested that the hours quota
be set at 75.
A Roble freshman argued against
the proposal saying that it would in
volve to much red tape in the addition
and subtraction of hours. "It would be
like balancing your checkbook." she
moaned.
Miss Cook said that the Honor Code
proposal would have to l)e discussed
with Women's Council before any ac
tion could be taken on it, and that the
Committee would prepare and distrib
ute a questionnaire on all three pro
posed changes.
