# Dekes Ship 5000 Books
## 
### 
Over 5,000 booksâ€”about a ton
- have been delivered to the
army and shipped to South Viet
nam as a result of the DKE
book drive last week.
McAllister added that besides
providing "Christmas diversion
for U.S. troops in Vietnam, the
Dekes were gratified in "getting
response from people who felt
the same way we did" about
U. S. commitment in Vietnam
and in getting them "to do some
thing, no matter how little."
