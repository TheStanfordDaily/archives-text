## New Pavilion Approaches Reality 
### HUGH WEST 
Last month, the Stanford Aih
letic department, still in need of
one million dollars to complete
a full-size X, ()()() indoor ath
letie pavilion, received the fol
lowing communique from Mrs.
Robert Mercer (Cynthis Kick
lels, *50):
"Dear Sirs: Forty-thousand
times $2.1 equals a million dol
lars, so here is one forty
thousandth of what was, in July,
needed to build the 8,000 seat
pavilion ... I hope there are
39,999 others."
Yesterday, in an announce
ment made ;it a press confer
ence at the AAYVIJ headquarters
at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel
in San Francisco, David Pack
ard '39. Stanford Trustee and
former basketball and football
letterman, agreed to take the
role of 20,000 of those people in
an effort to urge on another
20,000. Packard and his wife
have pledged to the University
a $500,000, dollar • for - dollar
matching grant for ihe con
struction of the Pavilion.

Department of Athletics Di
rector Chuck Taylor, in accept
ing the gift, says he is now
hopeful that construction on the
$3.3 million structure can begin
next fall with its full comple
ment of 8.000 seats. Tentative
plans were to build a 6,000 seat
building as a beginning and the
additional 2,000 seats to be ad
der! as funds became available.
Building the complete structure
at once will result in a substan
tial savings.
Taylor estimates that con
struction will take approximate
ly twenty months. Site of the
building will be on Campus
Drive, east, of Encina Gymna
sium.
Cultural Facility
He feels that the new facility
will attract nationwide basket
hall powers, because transporta
tion costs yvill be absorbed by

considerably larger gate receipts
than the present 11-year-old!
building now accrues.
lo addition to housing indoor®
athletic events, the new Pavilion™
will also serve as an auditorium
lor various culutral events on
the campus. The largest indoor
facility at present on campus
for that purpose, Mem And.
holds 1.700.
Packard, co-owner of Hewlett-
Packard, local electronics firm,
stated that in his undergraduate
years at Stanford, he learned
"as much from athletics as from
classroom teaching." lie added
that athletics deserved a perma
nent place in the Stanford edu
cational scene, contributing to
the total of "clean-cut young
sters" which Stanford graduates.
