## Daily Sports 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity water polo
ists subdued the first two of four
leams in the round robin Nor-
Cal Open Tournament Monday
night. The Indians topped Cal,
Jl-5, then proceeded to deal the
San Francisco Olympic Club a
12-6 defeat.
Last night, the Tribe met
Fooihill for ihe Nor Cal cham
pionship, then locked horns with
San Jose Slate. While Stanford
has the NCAA second place posi
tion in hand, a win over Foot
hill would asure an overall sec
ond ranking for the Indians.
UCLA, undefeated in 1965, has
the top position.
Stanford beat Foothill, 6-4, in
an early-season contest but lost
6-2 in the Owl's pool later in the
year. Since that lime, Stanford
has improved markedly, and
with injuries out of the way, ihe
Tribe should have pushed the
Owls off their roost.
Beat Cal Third Time
Stanford spread its scoring
among seven players in dealing

Cal its third defeat al the hands
of the Indians this season.
Mike Eshleman and Bill Meyer
took set-up passes from each
other to score two goals in the
opening period, while the Tribe
ball control kept the Bears score
less.
The Indians wailed to a 6-1
lead in the second period as
Meyer, Eshleman, Mark Parm
ely and Bill Derrig found the
back of the net.
Cal rebounded in the third
period, and on the strength of
Barry Weitzenberg's three goals,
eul tiie Stanford lead al one
point to 6-4. Pete Ready scored
two for Stanford to put the
game back in its proper perspec
tive.
Leading 8-5 going into ihe
final quarter, Stanford padded
its lead while holding Ihe Bears
at bay. Ready opened the quar
ter with his third goal of the
game, and Doug Mac Lean and
Charlie Burbach added the fin
ishing touches.
Cards Throttle 'O' Club
The Indians took hold of the
game with the Olympic Club at
the very start and never lei go. It

was the Olympic Club that beat
ihe Tribe, 8-4. when Stanford
was playing without its top two
scorers, Pete Ready and Gary
Sheerer.
Monday night, Ihe Olympic
Club was missing several of its
big guns, and the difference was
readily apparent. Stanford out-

swam Ihe O Club and effectively
penetrated their zone defense as
eight Indians got into the scor
ing.
Mark Parmely and Bill Meyer
scored early in the opening pe
riod while the Olympic Club got
off only one good shot and
goalie Mike Sorem blocked that
one.
Meyer, Eshleman, Ready and
Jeff Beck blasted in goals in ihe
second period to move to a 6-1

ha If time advantage. The O
Club's goal canip at the hands
ol Brian Beck, a member of the
196-1 Stanford varsitv.
Itct'k, Dwrig Scon*
Jeff Beck and Bill Derrig tal
lied once each in the third quar
ter. For Beck, a senior, his two
goal performance doubled his
season's goal total. His other
two goals were Stanford's open
ing scores in contests with USC
and Foothill.
Beck is often the Tribe's high
man on assists; he has missed
only four shots this season.
During the final period. Stan
ford varsity coach Jim Gaugh
ran's brother Bob scored his
fourth goal for the Olympic
Club. All of Gaughran's at
tempts came from the hole.
Goalie Vance Simonds managed
to block five of ihe powerful
sweeps.
Eshleman and Derrig scored
their second goals of the game
and Doug Mac Lean and Walt i
Poterbin shoveled in two more '
to make the final score, 12-6.
Stanford's two games last 1
night climaxed the season fori
the I06;i poloists.
