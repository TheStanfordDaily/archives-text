# Murals Tourney Finals Ignited In Spite Of Dampening Storms
## 
### JOHN O. CALMORE 
Wet weather has failed to
dampen intramural grid action
this past week as the playoff
competition got off to a fast and
furious start. In opening play,
ihe once-beaten KA's made Stern
Champion Muir the same, knock
ing them out of contention 19-2.
Neither team's offensive ma
chine generated enough power

to carry the ball across the goal
in the first half, but the KA's
Ken Smith came out in the sec
ond half with a hot throwing
arm which burned Muir with
three touchdown passes. His
three strikes were pitched 10
yards to Bill Hayes, 30 to Glen
Nolte, and 30 to Dick Knudtsen.
And Muir was out.
The KA defense was strong
as usual, holding Joe Muelleur's
quarterbacking heroics to prac
tically nil. This defense had four
straight shut-outs to its credit
before ihe Sigma Chis broke the
silence with a barrage of 26
points in the last game of reg
ular league play. The KA's ap
pear back in form, though.
Fits for Fhi Delt*
The upset-minded Holt IT's
gave the Phi Delts a few fits
before falling 15-0. With the
teams fighting to a 0-0 stand
still in the first half, the Phi
Dolt's Pat Concannon opened the
second half scoring with a 15-
yard aerial to Larry Lomax.
Adding a hit of variety to the
attack, Jim Korener scored two
points with a safety. A six-yard
Concannon pass to John Rait hoi
capped the final drive, thus set
ting the stage for the battle
with the KA's next Monday.
In a clash of the undefeated,
the Theta Delts came out on
top of the Phi Sigs 6-0. The
passing combination of Fred
Moseley to Mike Walsh clicked
for six points on 12-yard hook
pass early in the game. The
Theta Delts then called on its
defense to stiffen enough to pre
serve the victory.
Theta Delt Monopoly
The Theta Delts had enter
tained the notion of monopoliz
ing the playoffs as the II team
boat Eating Club Champion El
Cuadro with a Dodger victory
2-0. But in its next game, the
Theta Delt ll's fell to Fremont
13-6. The Stern team opened the
scoring with a short pass from
Stan Smith to Mick Alexander.
Tim McCarthy's running
brought the Theta Delt ll's back
to within a point, 7-6.
Fremont's Smith hit John
St it t with an insurance touch
down in tiie last half, and relied
on a tough defense to hold. Rog
er Kitching, Pat Brady, and
David Morin led the defensive
maneuvers for Fremont.
At the risk of redundancy, the
Sigma Chis won again. This
time they beat theh Phi Kap
ll's 18-6. The Chis rode to vic
tory on the pass receiving of
Walt Stam, Ken Jernstedt, and

Frank Ohh'ich. Paul Hazelrig;
did the throwing, all three
touchdowns being made in the
first half. Playoff action will
continue to thin out next week, |
the final game scheduled for j
Friday, December 3.
