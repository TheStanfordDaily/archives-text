# Letters To The Editor
## Fun And Games As Played By Planning Office Types 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The other night I was walking
by the Planning Office when I
noticed the light on and the door
open a bit. 1 stuck my head in
and saw, to my surprise, two
little men one bald, one with
enough hair for the both of
them. They were munching ani
mal crackers as they bent over
a table which held a scale model
of, my god, the Quad.
"Your move," said the Plan
ner With Hair.
"Thank you," said the Plan
ner Without. "My Dean's Office
for your Dormitory," and he
plucked up Union Residence and
tossed it over his shoulder.
"Shrewd," said the Planner
With Hair. "My Rat Labs for
your Row Houses," and he
snatched up the Houses and
flipped them one by one into the
back corner.
"Touche," said the Planner
Without. "But what to do with
the roomers?"
"Put them . . . here," said the
Planner With Hair, as he stood
on end his now empty cracker
box.
I turned green.
"Shall we name it ?" asked the
Planner Without.
"Oh, no," I shuddered.
"That's it," cried the Planner
With Hair—"O No Hall."
"It even rhymes," said the
Planner Without.

Kditor, The Daily:
As the Letters column of The
Daily has become the wailing
wall for Stanford University, T
would like to emit a few wails
here concerning the incredible
way in which the Planning Com
mission is attempting to expand
the University plant within the
architectural precepts described
by the Quadrangle.
Whether the Quad is in fact
worthy of such slavish attach
ment and reproduction is beside
the point. Nor do I desire to pass
judgment on all the red tile
and-sandstone structures which
have been raised in recent years
in tho vain and unimaginative
attempt to recreate or reflect
whatever aesthetic personality
the Quad does possess. The
Physics Lab, the Health Center,
the Business School, the Civ Li
brary and the future Pavilion
all seem to be carrying on the
tradition.
You may point to Stern Hall

as an exception, but I suggest
with a minimum of sarcasm
that Stein Hall may well have
been allowed to escape from the
planning stage just to prove
that red tile roofs aren't so bad
after all. The only other conclu
sion is that the Planning Com
mission thinks no roof at all is
preferable to one built without
red tile!
At best, the new buildings at
Stanford are variations on a ro
coco theme. Like copies of Mich
elangelo's David, they misuse
and exaggerate the aesthetics
which bind the original model.
More often than not, the results
have been ineffectual, uninspired
and annoying; and the discon
certing indication is that the
Commission does not think it
has fully exhausted the possi
bilities of tile and sandstone. In
fact, I do not consider it alto
gether unlikely that a red tile
roof will soon be put on Stern
Hall!
II may surprise some that
there is nothing in the Stanford
legacy which prescribes that all
new buildings be built with the
Quad as a model. But that is
true. Unlike the liquor problem,
there is no legal excuse for the
situation. Yale has given up neo-
Gothic; why can not Stanford
move on from Richardsonian
Romanesque 'as the Quad is
properly described)?
"Unified planning" is a power
ful phrase these days; probably
more powerful than it is bene
ficial. In many areas it is a
quite helpful and economic con
cept. However, I would be hesi
tant to sacrifice the sympathetic
consideration of aesthetics to the
ham fisted experts in unified
planning. The new architecture
of Stanford indicates this has
happened.
The aesthetic dimension of a
building is, of course, difficult
to define, but it is not so diffi
cult to notice where it is lack
ing. Just look around. If the
present values of the Planning
Commission remain unaltered, I
suspect Stanford will come to
have one of the subtlest archi
tectural hodgepodges ever built.

• Ke: Off-Campus
Issues
Editor, The Daily:
While we disagree on whether
or not the selective service reso
lution was an off-cam pus issue,
we do agree that critics of its

passage have missed the point.
Richard Gorin (Daily, Nov. 16)
views with alarm the colum
nist's back-tracking on his posi
tion in Legislature last spring
that there are "off-campus" is
sues on which Legislature
should deliberate. But the point
was only reiterated in the col
umn: "There are issues outside
'the wall' which command Leg
islature's attention."
John Bonine, intermittent con
servative polemicist, is also
shocked (Daily, Nov. 17) by Leg
islature reaching for tbo off
campus cookie jar. He points
the finger at a "surreptitious
campaign" to undermine the ban
of last spring. So surreptitious,
in fact, thai the column he criti
cizes tolls the story to anyone
hardy enough to read The Daily.
In spite of himself, Bonine ad
mits that the distinction between
on-campus and never-never-land
is not a valid one. His example
of a legitimate issue is draft
policy as it affects foreign cam
puses. Because such a resolu
tion could only be directed to
the national (off campus) draft
board, it fits neatly into his own
category of forbidden fruit.
Most surprising is Bonine's
argument that the whole plot
originated with the GCC "and
their friends." Ignoring the
GCC's almost complete inactiv
ity this year, we would point
to the sponsors of "off campus"
items: with ARFEP, ii was an
undergraduate, and for thai
matter a Texan. With draft pol
icy, it was another undergrad,
unrenowned for trafficking with
the GCC.
.Regarding the draft policy
resolution, Gorin asserts that
the executive should have vetoed
it. Since the executive intro
duced the legislation, that would
be self-effacement carried to an
extreme.
Bonine is disabused that the
columnist, by not speaking out
at the meeting when the resolu
tion was passed, wilfully violat
ed the Fundamental Standard.
Overlooking the fact that the
off campus issue objection did
not occur to the legislator until
Saturday; omitting, too, any
comments of'the "worthy is the
lamb that has gone astray" va
riety, we would remind Mr.
Bonine that, by not reporting
this violation to Men's Council,
he too was violating the Funda
mental Standard. Tit for tat.
