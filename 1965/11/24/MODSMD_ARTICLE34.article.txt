## Rhodesia's Succession-Crisis in Mack And White 
### Walter Lippmann 
The conflict in Rhodesia be
(ween the native Africans and
the European settlers is a per
fect example of a problem to
which there can be no final solu
tion during the lifetime of the
men who are involved.
The white prime minister, lan
Douglas Smith, who has been
pushed over the brink by the
right wing of his own party, can
not guarantee that white su
premacy will be maintained in
Rhodesia. It is a virtual ccrtain
tv that in Africa 220.000 whites
can do no more than fight a rear
guard action for their own su
premacy against 1 million
blacks.
Unless there is a racial holo
caust in which the whites or
blacks exterminate one another,
Rhodesia is destined in one way
or another to become a multi
racial state. The controlling fact
is that a multi-racial state can
not be developed in one genera
tion, ;;nd <he crucial question is,
therefore how such a long, diffi
cult transition can be managed
without intolerable disorder.
WVite Supremacy Doubt t ill
It is conceivable, to be sure,
that the white Rhodesians, or
ganized as a police state, could
for some years and with enough
ruthlessness exercise white su
premacy. But it can do this only
by being at war with the mass
of its own Africans and with the
great masses of the African con
tinent.
It is conceivable also, though
highly improbable, that the Afri
can majority in Rhodesia might,
obtain command of the govern
ment. It can do that only at the
risk of anarchy in the public life
of Rhodesia, at the risk, also, of
a cruel war with the die-hard
whites, at the risk, also, of the
renewal of African tribal war
fare which was subdued by the
British occupation.
While no one can speak con
fidently about how to overcome
the absolutes of the white su
premacists and the absolutes of
the Africans demanding immed
iate majority rule, we do know
what ought to be done. We
ought to win time for a peace
able evolution. A way must be
found in which whites and
blacks accept the fact that it will
require at the least a generation
of lime for the evolution of
Rhodesia into a multi-racial
state.
This may be asking for more
patience and common sense than

the human race is currently dis
playing. Rut for Americans
there is no other assumption on
which we can base our policy.
Rhodesia, as such, is not within j
the sphere of American interest j
and responsibility. Yet, we must j
be very much concerned that :
Rhodesia should not set off a i
racial war in southern Africa, j
For that would be a war into j
which the preat r>nwpr< would in
one way or another be sucked.
It would be a war, moreover,
which would cause serious re
verberations within the United j
States.
U.S. â€”A Secondary Role
The administration has. I j
think, done the right thing in j
adopting a supporting and sec
ondary role, not an initiating
and primary one. This has been }
challenged by Americans who |
argue that our position of)
"world leadership" demands that
we take the lead in African af- S
fairs. :
It would be a mistake to do |
this. Moreover, once a European j
power has liquidated its own
colonial empire, as have Britian. j
France and Belgium, it is left
with a pool of technicians and
administrators who know the
country, who have personal
roots in the country, who know
the ways of the country which
no one can acquire quickly.
These people are bet ter equipped
than Americans could ever make
themselves to be the guides,
counselors and tutors of tho
young nations.
No one, I think, should ignore
or underestimate the need in a
new nation for guides, counsel
ors and tutors. No one, more
over, should refuse to face the
facts of life, such as the fact
that it takes time to educate a
people and to train the technic
ians and experts who are indis
pensable to a self-governing na
tion.
Our real quarrel with the
white Rhodesians is not that
they want time, as they say in
their propaganda, to "bridge the
gulf between the Stone Age and
the 20th century." It is that lan
Douglas Smith is under the con
trol of white supremacists who
are determined not to bridge the
gulf.
As soon the government in
Rhodesia is taken over by men
who flr> mean to bridge the gulf,
the way will be open to a modus
vivendi between white Rhodesia
and the rest of mankind.
