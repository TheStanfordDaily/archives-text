# Class Opinion 'Sheet' Expands Evaluation
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
The Scratch Sheet, criticized in past
years alternately for its scathing com
ments about professors and for its
lack of depth in commenting upon the
curriculum, has modified its approach
to provide an evaluation of courses
which will be "pertinent to the major
ity of Stanford students."
Rill fisher, editor of the undergrad
uate publication, told The Daily that'
he hoped the outcome would provide
a guide to students as well as profes
sors. The Scratch Sheet is presently
being compiled and will be on sale
next quarter prior to pre-registration.
A staff member has been assigned
to each academic department to ob
tain a picture of (lie goals and re
quirements.
In the past the publication has limit
ed its review to General Studies
courses and other required courses.
Fisher believes that the expanded ap
proach of the Scratch Sheet will pro
vide students with a greater perspec
tive of the courses within each depart
ment.
Professors' Statement
Questionnaires have been distrib
uted to the various living groups to
compile student reactions to courses.
However the results <>112 student opin
ion will be supplemented with state
ments from professors about the pur
pose and content of their courses.
The Scratch Sheet is also soliciting
statements from the head of each de
partment to provide prospective ma
jors with an idea of the philosophy
and goals of the department as well
as an idea of the activities of past
graduates from the department.
Fisher said that this section would be
of most value to the freshmen and
particularly to sophomores who must
declare their major before the end of
the year.
However, he pointed out, these pol
icy statements would also aid upper
classmen taking courses in fields
which they had not previously studied.
Ket'lection
"The Scratch Sheet will reflect the
academic community as a whole."
Fish re said. As a measure of the aca
demic interests of the students them

solves, ho observed, the publication
might provide a criticism for student
values.
In covering course and departments
that have not been included previous
ly, the publication is intended to be
of greater aid to students in choosing
courses within their own majors.
