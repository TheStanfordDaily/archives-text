# Land Priority Puts Parking Lots On Stanford's 'Outer Fringe'
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
(Second in a Series)
A description <> 1 Stanford's master
plan for development reads like a
first-year Latin book: All the campus
is divided into three concentric cir
cles.
At the center, of course, are the
academic and service buildings. Next
come the residences and finally
there's that outer fringe called stu
dent and staff parking.
"It's all a matter of priorities and
best utilization of vital land areas,"
according to Oscar Nelson of the Uni
versity planning office. "Our approach
is to try and provide as much parking
as is reasonable and which we can
pay for.
"But our primary concern.'' he said,
"is that the facilities be placed so as
not to interfere with the basic aca
demic functions." From Nelson's de
scription of planning methods, the
whole process appeared to be one of
balancing balancing cost with need
with function.
That there is a need for careful
planning is obvious. Surveys by the
planning office showed that 13.000
cars are registered this year, and the
number of cars using Stanford road
and parking facilities has increased
by about 1,000 each year since 1937.
The number of registered cars is
split evenly between students and
staff members, although statistics
show an unusual fact that there are

more staff ears registered than there
are staff members. More than 60 per
cent of Stanford students operate cars
on campus.
But for the 13.000 cars there are
only 8.600 spaces, 1,500 of which are
at the medical center and Escondido
village.
To accommodate these cars. Nelson
said, two types of lots are being
built. Permanent lots, with good
drainage, lighting, landscaping and
access walks, are now being located
in areas "where no buildings are
slated in long-range plans." These lots,
Nelson noted, cost $300 per car.
Temporary iots. such as those near
the women's gym, are designed to
serve the campus for about five years.
Nelson said the University had con
sidered providing parking in new
buildings, such as the undergraduate
library, but the costs were as high
as $,'l,lOO per car. Subterranean lots
would be at least $1,000 per space.
"It we built special parking struc
tures and charged rental fees." Nel
son said, "we would have to close
down free areas in order to fill the
other lots."
Future plans for the campus will
remove all general traffic from a half
mile radius of inner Quad. This is
why new parking lots are being built
on what seems to be the remotest
sections of campus. Evenlually Cam
pus Drive will circle the entire aca
demic area, with permanent lots
branching from it.

Additional roads out of campus are
planned, Nelson added. For example,
the University is now considering a
road to El Camino in the Medical
Center area.
Nelson said the idea of pedestrian
malls in central academic areas is one
being applied at most colleges and
universities. While many of these
schools also ban student ears. Nelson
called this a "negative approach."
"We are in a geographic area where
;i car is desirable for students," he
said. Students should be able to at
tend the opera and other Bay area
events that "complement the academ
ic experience."
For this reason, the planning of
fice is attempting to provide student
parking whenever and wherever feasi
ble. "I think things are in fairly good
shape," Nelson said, "although I'll be
the first to say it's not perfect.
Nelson commented that Stanford
has no "frozen plan - ' for road and
parking design. "We have to remain
flexible in order to adjust to specific
needs as they arise," he said. "We
watch patterns and trends, weigh all
the factors carefully, and then pro
ceed with planning."
Often a parking lot or traffic pat
tern is changed after it. is tried. For
example. Nelson cited the Tresidder
parking l<»t as an area which showed
a need for additional 40-minute
"quick-stop" parking space. The lot
was thus changed, and even more
space may be devoted to ID-minute
/one* in the future, he said.

in areas "where no buildings are
slated in long-range plans." These lots,
Nelson noted, cost $300 per car.
Temporary iots. such as those near
the women's gym, are designed to
serve the campus for about five years.
Nelson said the University had con
sidered providing parking in new
buildings, such as the undergraduate
library, but the costs were as high
as $,'l,lOO per car. Subterranean lots
would be at least $1,000 per space.
"It we built special parking struc
tures and charged rental fees." Nel
son said, "we would have to close
down free areas in order to fill the
other lots."
Future plans for the campus will
remove all general traffic from a half
mile radius of inner Quad. This is
why new parking lots are being built
on what seems to be the remotest
sections of campus. Evenlually Cam
pus Drive will circle the entire aca
demic area, with permanent lots
branching from it.

Additional roads out of campus are
planned, Nelson added. For example,
the University is now considering a
road to El Camino in the Medical
Center area.
Nelson said the idea of pedestrian
malls in central academic areas is one
being applied at most colleges and
universities. While many of these
schools also ban student ears. Nelson
called this a "negative approach."
"We are in a geographic area where
;i car is desirable for students," he
said. Students should be able to at
tend the opera and other Bay area
events that "complement the academ
ic experience."
For this reason, the planning of
fice is attempting to provide student
parking whenever and wherever feasi
ble. "I think things are in fairly good
shape," Nelson said, "although I'll be
the first to say it's not perfect.
Nelson commented that Stanford
has no "frozen plan - ' for road and
parking design. "We have to remain
flexible in order to adjust to specific
needs as they arise," he said. "We
watch patterns and trends, weigh all
the factors carefully, and then pro
ceed with planning."
Often a parking lot or traffic pat
tern is changed after it. is tried. For
example. Nelson cited the Tresidder
parking l<»t as an area which showed
a need for additional 40-minute
"quick-stop" parking space. The lot
was thus changed, and even more
space may be devoted to ID-minute
/one* in the future, he said.

A description <> 1 Stanford's master
plan for development reads like a
first-year Latin book: All the campus
is divided into three concentric cir
cles.
At the center, of course, are the
academic and service buildings. Next
come the residences and finally
there's that outer fringe called stu
dent and staff parking.
"It's all a matter of priorities and
best utilization of vital land areas,"
according to Oscar Nelson of the Uni
versity planning office. "Our approach
is to try and provide as much parking
as is reasonable and which we can
pay for.
"But our primary concern.'' he said,
"is that the facilities be placed so as
not to interfere with the basic aca
demic functions." From Nelson's de
scription of planning methods, the
whole process appeared to be one of
balancing balancing cost with need
with function.
That there is a need for careful
planning is obvious. Surveys by the
planning office showed that 13.000
cars are registered this year, and the
number of cars using Stanford road
and parking facilities has increased
by about 1,000 each year since 1937.
The number of registered cars is
split evenly between students and
staff members, although statistics
show an unusual fact that there are

more staff ears registered than there
are staff members. More than 60 per
cent of Stanford students operate cars
on campus.
But for the 13.000 cars there are
only 8.600 spaces, 1,500 of which are
at the medical center and Escondido
village.
To accommodate these cars. Nelson
said, two types of lots are being
built. Permanent lots, with good
drainage, lighting, landscaping and
access walks, are now being located
in areas "where no buildings are
slated in long-range plans." These lots,
Nelson noted, cost $300 per car.
Temporary iots. such as those near
