# Taft Proposes GOP Reform In Congress
## 
### PAMLLA LANG 
Former Congressman Robert Taft,
Jr., proposed a strong new legisla
tive program as his answer to the
problem of "Improving the Republi
can Image," in a brief speech spon
sored by the Young Republicans yes
terday afternoon in Tresidder.
Addressing himself to "fellow Re
publicans and discerning Democrats,"
Taft cited six problems which "the
Democrats have not tackled, probably
because they are too tough for them."
These include deficit financing, re
turns of Federally-collected revenues
to state and local governments, the
draft, labor regulation, anti-trust
legislation and Congressional reform.
Needed Reform
The reform most urgently needed
is in "the rubber-stamp treadmill" of
the Congress itself. Action is needed,
he said, "to make Congress an effect
ive legislative body, to put it back
in a position where it can and will
act."
Taft criticized the administration of
three recent Democratic programs
Federal aid to education, Medicare,
and the War on Poverty. "Certainly
they are responsible programs," he
said, but they are against the Repub
lican principles of a "society where the
primary concern is the individual."
Party Unity
On party unity, Taft said, "I don't
view with any alarm differences of

opinion in the party. We need only
look to the Democratic party to see
a party that is truly divided."
He prophesied that the Republican
party will regain 30 seats in the next
election. "The year 1966 is a very key
year." he said. "Our image in this
year must be one of a do-something
party."
To offset the disunifying forces
usual in a party out of office. Republi
cans under Ray Bliss have formed a
Republican Coordinating Committee
as a liason between party leaders and
the people.
Personal Plans
Taft invited questions from his aud
ience of about 100 after his half-hour
speech. Asked about his personal
plans for 1966, Taft, who last year
narrowly lost an election for U.S. Sen
ator from Ohio, reported that he can
not run for Governor or Senator next
year. There is, though, he added, a
freshman Democrat in his Congres
sional district and "somebody ought
to take him on."
Taft drew applause only once dur
ing his speech, in answer to a question
comparing Charles Percy's chances in
Chicago to John Lindsay's victory in
New York City. "The local political
situation is very different," he said.
"In Chicago you have a pretty darn
strong Democratic machine, and a lot
of trouble getting your votes
counted."
