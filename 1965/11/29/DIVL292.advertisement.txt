Here's looking at you with Hamm's
"See thru"
Tankards
At the Pub in olden days, the cavalier had
to keep a sharp lookout lor an enemy who,
under the guise of a friendly drink, might
surprise him. The transparent bottom en
abled him to be ever ready to unsheath his
sword and jump to action.
Or to wink a message to a beamish bar
maid on whom he had an eye.
Here are 4 such tankards in silvertone
finish. Each one 20 oz., and decorated with
one of the fun-loving Hamm s designs below.
Use order form for one or more sets.
