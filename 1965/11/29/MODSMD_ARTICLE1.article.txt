# Mackenzie Seeks Greater Student Representation
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
"The efforts of my administration this year
are being directed mainly toward increasing
student representation on the decision-making
bodies of the University." ASSU President
William "Sandy" Mackenzie said in an inter
view with The Daily recently. "So far we have
been fairly successful."
Mackenzie feels that his administration has
made excellent progress in initiating stu
dent involvement with the faculty on academic
matters.
St udeiit Representation
The Executive Committee of the Academic
council Stanford's top faculty group—has ap
proved a LASSU resolution requesting student
representation on the Council's eight commit
tees. The individual committees, however, are
reserved the final say on whether they want
students, and to date only three have given
the go-ahead.
On one of the committees, Admissions, fric
tion has developed over the sealing of one
student. Mackenzie nominated Tom Sherman,

Turn Heeht, and Kick Sterns to the committee;
however, Professor Gertrude Schuelke, the
chairman, objected to Sherman because he is
a graduate student. "We justify our appoint
ments on the basis of merit, and not on the
graduate-undergraduate formula," said Mac
kenzie, pointing out that Sherman—an English
Teaching Assistant and a strong force behind
the current cultural revitalization of the
freshman dorms -has an intimate knowledge
of the undergraduate student body.
Housing Subcoiiunittee
The Housing Subcommittee of Dean Robert
J. Wert's Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation has decided to include students in its
membership; Mackenzie has appointed Sheila
McCarthy, Jon Reider, Bany Ramsey, Michael
Cohen, and Jane Sokolow as representatives.
The committee has been charged to develop a
master plan for undergraduate housing.
In other areas, Mackenzie has helped insti
tute student-faculty committees in the history
department and with the library. Three stu
dents John Kavanaugh, Fred Johnson, and
J. R. Bartholomew have been appointed to

the history committee, which is reviewing
curriculum and working to expand the history
seminar program.
Library Policies
Mackenzie has appointed Barbara Dudley,
Neil Enkema and Dick Anderman to work
with the committee formulating policies for
the new undergraduate library, scheduled to
open next September.
Mackenzie is also making plans with Ander
man to involve students in fund-raising for the
new library. Students would ask alumni to en
dow subscriptions to journals or to pledge a
book per quarter or per month to the collec
tion. Mackenzie believes that such a project
would "demonstrate real student concern"
over the new library.
He also has students working with the Hu
manities and Religious Studies Departments.
The effort has been partly responsible for the
recent establishment of a joint major in the
two fields.
On the non-academic side of religion, Mac
kenzie has nominated Bruce Campbell, Mar
garet Geid, Norma Graham, George Hunsing

er, Dennis Kothhaar, and Irving Shapiro to
the President's Advisory Committee on Relig
ious Activities, chaired by Richard Lyman,
Associate Dean of the Humanities and Sci
ences. ASSU Vice President Clark Brown was
responsible for the recent LASSU resolution
requesting student representation on the com
mittee.
Committee Of Fifteen
Mackenzie reported that the Committee of
Fifteen, "has spent most of its time trying
to work out procedural matters." Consequent
ly, "It hasn't accomplished anything yet." He
noted that the only issue the committee has
considered the fate of the Union Residence
resulted in a decision that the committee
could not make a decision.
However, Mackenzie feels that the commit -
te will prove very beneficial in the future.
"I anticipate its being a very useful structure
for the University. It provides us with a
method for avoiding conflict without having
people go out into the streets."
In response to recent complaints over auto
mobile registration foes, traffic fines, and the

oit-cumpus parking situation, Mackenzie has,
at the request of LASSU, appointed Pete Han
sen to represent the studentry on the Traffic
Committee. Informed sources have reported
that the committee has reacted favorably to
the possibility of reducing fees.
Future In .Hind
The ASSU administration, with the future
in mind, is looking into several other areas
of involvement.
Among them are the following:
• Mackenzie and Rick Sterns are investi
gating the possibility of setting up an econom
ic union of the 80,000 Bay Area collegians to
provide student discounts at local restaurants,
entertainment spots, hotels and motels, and
retail stores. Mackenzie hopes to have a stu
dent from the School of Business research
the feasibility of this plan.
• Vice President Brown is working on set
ting up a Spring Quarter campus conference
on "Problems in California." With the June
primary election in mind, the conference
would provide a forum for California politic
ians.

provide student discounts at local restaurants,
entertainment spots, hotels and motels, and

dent from the School of Business research
the feasibility of this plan.
• Vice President Brown is working on set
ting up a Spring Quarter campus conference
on "Problems in California." With the June
primary election in mind, the conference
would provide a forum for California politic
ians.
"The efforts of my administration this year
are being directed mainly toward increasing
student representation on the decision-making
bodies of the University." ASSU President
William "Sandy" Mackenzie said in an inter
view with The Daily recently. "So far we have
been fairly successful."
Mackenzie feels that his administration has
made excellent progress in initiating stu
dent involvement with the faculty on academic
matters.
St udeiit Representation
The Executive Committee of the Academic
council Stanford's top faculty group—has ap
proved a LASSU resolution requesting student
representation on the Council's eight commit
tees. The individual committees, however, are
reserved the final say on whether they want
students, and to date only three have given
the go-ahead.
On one of the committees, Admissions, fric
tion has developed over the sealing of one
student. Mackenzie nominated Tom Sherman,

Turn Heeht, and Kick Sterns to the committee;
however, Professor Gertrude Schuelke, the
chairman, objected to Sherman because he is
a graduate student. "We justify our appoint
ments on the basis of merit, and not on the
graduate-undergraduate formula," said Mac
kenzie, pointing out that Sherman—an English
Teaching Assistant and a strong force behind
the current cultural revitalization of the
freshman dorms -has an intimate knowledge
of the undergraduate student body.
Housing Subcoiiunittee
The Housing Subcommittee of Dean Robert
J. Wert's Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation has decided to include students in its
membership; Mackenzie has appointed Sheila
McCarthy, Jon Reider, Bany Ramsey, Michael
Cohen, and Jane Sokolow as representatives.
The committee has been charged to develop a
master plan for undergraduate housing.
In other areas, Mackenzie has helped insti
tute student-faculty committees in the history
department and with the library. Three stu
dents John Kavanaugh, Fred Johnson, and
J. R. Bartholomew have been appointed to

the history committee, which is reviewing
curriculum and working to expand the history
seminar program.
Library Policies
Mackenzie has appointed Barbara Dudley,
Neil Enkema and Dick Anderman to work
with the committee formulating policies for
the new undergraduate library, scheduled to
open next September.
Mackenzie is also making plans with Ander
man to involve students in fund-raising for the
new library. Students would ask alumni to en
dow subscriptions to journals or to pledge a
book per quarter or per month to the collec
tion. Mackenzie believes that such a project
would "demonstrate real student concern"
over the new library.
He also has students working with the Hu
manities and Religious Studies Departments.
The effort has been partly responsible for the
recent establishment of a joint major in the
two fields.
On the non-academic side of religion, Mac
kenzie has nominated Bruce Campbell, Mar
garet Geid, Norma Graham, George Hunsing

er, Dennis Kothhaar, and Irving Shapiro to
the President's Advisory Committee on Relig
ious Activities, chaired by Richard Lyman,
Associate Dean of the Humanities and Sci
ences. ASSU Vice President Clark Brown was
responsible for the recent LASSU resolution
requesting student representation on the com
mittee.
Committee Of Fifteen
Mackenzie reported that the Committee of
Fifteen, "has spent most of its time trying
to work out procedural matters." Consequent
ly, "It hasn't accomplished anything yet." He
noted that the only issue the committee has
considered the fate of the Union Residence
resulted in a decision that the committee
could not make a decision.
However, Mackenzie feels that the commit -
te will prove very beneficial in the future.
"I anticipate its being a very useful structure
for the University. It provides us with a
method for avoiding conflict without having
people go out into the streets."
In response to recent complaints over auto
mobile registration foes, traffic fines, and the

oit-cumpus parking situation, Mackenzie has,
at the request of LASSU, appointed Pete Han
sen to represent the studentry on the Traffic
Committee. Informed sources have reported
that the committee has reacted favorably to
the possibility of reducing fees.
Future In .Hind
The ASSU administration, with the future
in mind, is looking into several other areas
of involvement.
Among them are the following:
• Mackenzie and Rick Sterns are investi
gating the possibility of setting up an econom

oit-cumpus parking situation, Mackenzie has,
at the request of LASSU, appointed Pete Han
sen to represent the studentry on the Traffic
Committee. Informed sources have reported
that the committee has reacted favorably to
the possibility of reducing fees.
Future In .Hind
The ASSU administration, with the future
in mind, is looking into several other areas
of involvement.
Among them are the following:
• Mackenzie and Rick Sterns are investi
gating the possibility of setting up an econom
ic union of the 80,000 Bay Area collegians to
provide student discounts at local restaurants,
entertainment spots, hotels and motels, and
retail stores. Mackenzie hopes to have a stu
dent from the School of Business research
the feasibility of this plan.
• Vice President Brown is working on set
ting up a Spring Quarter campus conference
on "Problems in California." With the June
primary election in mind, the conference
would provide a forum for California politic
ians.
"The efforts of my administration this year
are being directed mainly toward increasing
student representation on the decision-making
bodies of the University." ASSU President
William "Sandy" Mackenzie said in an inter
view with The Daily recently. "So far we have
been fairly successful."
Mackenzie feels that his administration has
made excellent progress in initiating stu
dent involvement with the faculty on academic
matters.
St udeiit Representation
The Executive Committee of the Academic
council Stanford's top faculty group—has ap
proved a LASSU resolution requesting student
representation on the Council's eight commit
tees. The individual committees, however, are
reserved the final say on whether they want
students, and to date only three have given
the go-ahead.
On one of the committees, Admissions, fric
tion has developed over the sealing of one
student. Mackenzie nominated Tom Sherman,

Turn Heeht, and Kick Sterns to the committee;
however, Professor Gertrude Schuelke, the
chairman, objected to Sherman because he is
a graduate student. "We justify our appoint
ments on the basis of merit, and not on the
graduate-undergraduate formula," said Mac
kenzie, pointing out that Sherman—an English
Teaching Assistant and a strong force behind
the current cultural revitalization of the
freshman dorms -has an intimate knowledge
of the undergraduate student body.
Housing Subcoiiunittee
The Housing Subcommittee of Dean Robert
J. Wert's Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation has decided to include students in its
membership; Mackenzie has appointed Sheila
McCarthy, Jon Reider, Bany Ramsey, Michael
Cohen, and Jane Sokolow as representatives.
The committee has been charged to develop a
master plan for undergraduate housing.
In other areas, Mackenzie has helped insti
tute student-faculty committees in the history
department and with the library. Three stu
dents John Kavanaugh, Fred Johnson, and
J. R. Bartholomew have been appointed to

the history committee, which is reviewing
curriculum and working to expand the history
seminar program.
Library Policies
Mackenzie has appointed Barbara Dudley,
Neil Enkema and Dick Anderman to work
with the committee formulating policies for
the new undergraduate library, scheduled to
open next September.
Mackenzie is also making plans with Ander
man to involve students in fund-raising for the
new library. Students would ask alumni to en
dow subscriptions to journals or to pledge a
book per quarter or per month to the collec
tion. Mackenzie believes that such a project
would "demonstrate real student concern"
over the new library.
He also has students working with the Hu
manities and Religious Studies Departments.
The effort has been partly responsible for the
recent establishment of a joint major in the
two fields.
On the non-academic side of religion, Mac
kenzie has nominated Bruce Campbell, Mar
garet Geid, Norma Graham, George Hunsing

er, Dennis Kothhaar, and Irving Shapiro to
the President's Advisory Committee on Relig
ious Activities, chaired by Richard Lyman,
Associate Dean of the Humanities and Sci
ences. ASSU Vice President Clark Brown was
responsible for the recent LASSU resolution
requesting student representation on the com
mittee.
Committee Of Fifteen
Mackenzie reported that the Committee of
Fifteen, "has spent most of its time trying
to work out procedural matters." Consequent
ly, "It hasn't accomplished anything yet." He
noted that the only issue the committee has
considered the fate of the Union Residence
resulted in a decision that the committee
could not make a decision.
However, Mackenzie feels that the commit -
te will prove very beneficial in the future.
"I anticipate its being a very useful structure
for the University. It provides us with a
method for avoiding conflict without having
people go out into the streets."
In response to recent complaints over auto
mobile registration foes, traffic fines, and the
