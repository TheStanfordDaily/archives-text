The final statistics for Stan
ford's best-ever freshman foot
ball squad underscore the threat
posed by the potent Papooses.
The frosh started on the way
to their 4-0 season with a 24-13
hashing of USC's frosh.
Next on the Indian block was
San Jose State. No Pocahontas
intervened as the powerful Pow
hatans severed the Spartan cer
vix, 50-0. Cal's traditionally
tough first year men could fare
no better, as Stanford carted off
a 28-15 win.
The final game of the season
was a fitting climax to the
flashy freshman parade. The
Papooses crushed visiting DC
LA 49-13.
Gene Washington held the
starting quarterback's job. pos
ing an awesome dual threat to
the opposition. Washington
passed for 256 yards and ran
for another 214 to lead the Pa
poses in total offense. Washing
ton also led the Papoose conting
ent in punt and kickoff returns.
Potent Backfielri
Coach Dick Vermeil had an
impressive set of backs to throw
against his opponents. Aside
from Washington, Gene Brough
ton, Nate Kirtman, and Bill
Shoemaker wailed through for
eign defensive lines.
Broughton topped the Pa
pooses in rushing with 365
yards. Second was Kirtman with
300 yards—Kirtman also caught
one pass good for 82 yards.
Shoemaker, who handled the
kicking chores, scrambled for
133 yajds, including 3 touch
downs.
Vermeil had an exceptionally
deep squad to work with, and
especially in the lopsided wins
over San Jose and UCLA, was
able to use his bench for a
major part of the contest.
Overall, the Papooses threw
for 332 yards and rushed for

1316 for a total of 1600 yards
against their opponents' 914.
