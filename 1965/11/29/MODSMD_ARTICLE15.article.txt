# Poloists Gain National Second Rating
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Polo Gods smiled upon
the Indians last Tuesday night,
as Stanford knocked off Foot
hill, 7-6, to nail down the na
tion's second ranking. The Cards
beat San Jose, 7-4, to complete
the Tribe's sweep of the Nor
Cal Open Tournament, held at
Treasure Island.
"It was beautiful. We just
oontinued to play the way we
did since losing to UCLA."
These were the words of Stan
ford coach Jim Gaughran de
scribing the steady improve
ment in team play and overall
performance over the last third
of the season.
Stanford finished the year
with a 17-4 record. Two of the
losses (7-6, and 5-3) came at the
hands of undefeated, top-ranked
UCLA. The other two losses
were to the San Francisco Olym
pic Club and Foothill, both of
which fell to the Tribe in the
Nor Cal Tournament last week.
Parmely Named MVP
Mark Parmely, an ambidex
trous sophomore, was selected
by the five coaches involved in
the or Cal Tournament as the

tournament's most valuable
player.
Parmely, who had never play
ed water polo until his freshman
year at Stanford, progressed un
der the direction of frosh coach
Joe Iliggins, varsity coach Jim
Gaughran, and a number of his
teammates— most notably Gary
Sheerer— to the top of North
ern California.
Parmely scored a total of six
goals in the tournament, three
of which came in the crucial
game against Foothill Tuesday
evening.
Six Indians AU-Nor Cid
Six Stanford players in all
were named All-Northern Cali
fornia.

Mike Eshleman, varsity cap
tain, earned the honor for his
third time. Pete Ready, Gary
Sheerer, and Mark Parmely, all
sophomores, were also named
first team for All Nor Cal, Bill
Meyer, another sophomore, and
goalie Mike Sorem, a junior,
were named second team All
Nor Cal.
Ready led the Indian scorers
with a 33 goal season total. Mey
er, with 27, was second. With 26
goals were Eshleman, Sheerer,
and Parmely. Sheerer missed a
third of the season because of
a broken hand.
The even scoring distribution
points to the success of Stan
fords fast-breaking, hard-press
ing style of play. The constantly
moving Stanford offense did nofr
emphasize the shooting of any
one player, but put the burden
of an übiquitous scoring threat
on the opposing defense.
Gaughran Cites Poloists
Coach Jim Gaughran cited
Mark Parmely, Bill Meyer, Bill
Derrig, and Doug Jensen (in
jured before the tournament) as
the players whose vast improve
ment over the season made the
difference in the won-lost col
umn.
Gaughran praised Mike Eshle
man, Jeff Beck, Gary Sheerer,
and Pete Ready for maintaining
and developing the high caliber
of play they have demonstrated
in the past.
The varsity mentor also noted
Mike Sorem, a junior, and
Vance Simonds, a sophomore,
for throwing up the hard-to
penetrate screen about Stan
ford's goal throughout the sea
son.
Foothill 'Must' Game
Stanford played Foothill in
the first of two games last Tues
day night. The Indians had split
with the Owls earlier in the sea
son, and needed a win to gain
the nation's overall second rank
ing. Also resting upon the out
come was the Nor Cal champion
ship.
Stanford opened the scoring.
Pete Ready, usually a power
merchant, used the soft touch
to pass the Foothill goalie with a
lob.
Foothill soon got on the score
board. The Owls were given a
goal on a shot that, to a candid
observer sitting directly above
the goal, appeared to miss by a
foot. Foothill shot in one more
to put the Cards on the short
end of a 2-1 quarter score.
Stanford rebounded in the sec
ond period with a three goal at
tack. Eshleman slipped in a shot
from the hole, and Parmely
scored the first of his three
goals. Gary Sheerer took a shot
that caromed off the top of the
goal, then put it in on the fol
low-up.
Stanford's 4-2 half time lead
was cut to one goal in the third
stanza. Stanford's only tally
came as Sheerer tossed a cross
court pass to Parmely, who
slammed it in for the score.
Meanwhile Foothill scored twice.
Cards Hang On
Stanford kept one jump ahead
of the Owls through the last
quarter to hang onto the win.
Sheerer stole the ball from an
Owl in front of the Foothill goal
and scored. Parmely scored the
final and decisive goal on a pic
ture-perfect pass from Jeff Beck
and subsequent tally.
Mike Sorem stopped nine
Foothill shots, any two of which
would have turned the game the
other way.
Eshleman and Ready dug in
early in the first quarter of the
San Jose game to give Stanford
a 2-0 lead. If by some chance
Stanford lost the San Jose game,
Foothill would have won the
tournament on the basis of goal
percentage.
Bill Derrig scored the Tribe's
only goal of the second quarter
on a shot from 10 yards out.
Ready slammed in a backhand
shot in the third period to keep
the Indians ahead of the creep
ing Spartans. San Jose was be
hind by the slim margin of 4-3
wilh a quarter left.
Indians Sew It Up
Basically opposed to close
games with San Jose, Stanford
proceeded to widen the margin
in the final period. Parmely
plastered the back of the net
with a shot from the hole.
Meyer made good on a penalty
shot to give the Cards a 6-4 lead.
The final goal of the season
was scored appropriately en
ough on a pass from Jeff Beck
to Mike Eshleman, the team's
two seniors. Beck moved into
scoring position with the ball
high, and when the goalie ex
pected the shot, Beck tossed off
to Eshleman in the wing who
promptly converted for the sur
prise goal.


JIM GAUGHRAN, Stan for d
water polo coach, took the In
dians to a 17-4 1965 record and a
berth in the nation's second
spot. Gaughran lias high hopes
for Stanford water polo futures,
as ho loses only two players to
graduation this year.
