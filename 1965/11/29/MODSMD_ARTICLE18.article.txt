# Recalcitrant Breeze, Tide End 'Big Sail'
## 
### 
Stanford's annual Big Sail '
with Cal was held Sunday a
week ago, but was plagued with
bad luck.
During the first (and last)
race, as the lead Stanford boats
were within five yards of the
line, the combined effects of a
growing tidal current and an in
finitessimally small breeze made i
further progress impossible.
When the race committee saw
that the boats were drifting!
slowly out to sea, it decided to !
call the race. Later, Cal agreed j
to postpone the regatta until i
February, when the honey wind ;
blows.
