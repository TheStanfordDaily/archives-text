TOKYO The president of the Viet
Cong's National Liberation Front has
sent a message to the National Co
ordinating Committee to End the War
in Vietnam wishing it success with
antiwar demonstrations in Washing
ton, the N'ew China News Agency said
Sunday.
The Peking agency said front leader
Nguyen Huu Tho sent the message
from "somewhere in South Vietnam"
Thursday to Frank Emspak, whom it
identified as the president of the co
ordinating committee.
The message said the Viet Cong
expressed hope the demonstrations
and the march on Washington staged
Saturday would contribute "to the
common struggle of our two peoples
who are victims of the inhuman war
carried out by the U.S. government
in Vietnam.
The Viet Cong message said: "The
South Vietnamese people's struggle
will continue until the U.S. govern
ment stops its aggressive war on Viet
nam soil, withdraws all U.S. troops
from South Vietnam, stops strafing
and bombing North Vietnam and lets
our people settle their own affairs by
themselves."

• Abortion Laws Hit
PHILADELPHIA The American
Medical Association was urged Sun
day to endorse abortion and steriliza
tion under certain conditions—and to
call for uniform state laws regarding
these two subjects and the allowance
of contraceptive information.
A report asking that the AMA go
on record as recommending amend
ments to state laws concerning contra
ception, abortion and sterilization "so
as to reflect medical conscience and
public opinion" was submitted to the
organization's policymaking House of
Delegates at the opening of the AMA's
19th clinical convention.
