# REVIEW
## Britain Today-New Deal For A Tired Aristocrat 
### 
Anthony Sampson's "Anatomy
of Britain Today." New York,
Harper <V Row, 1965. pp. 720.
By KI('HAKI) NF I.SON-lON ES
Anthony Sampson went to a
prominent "public" school (West
minster), then to one of the
"right" colleges (Christ Church
has produced thirteen out of
forty-six British prime minis
ters) at one of the "right" uni
versities (eleven out of Harold
Wilson's twenty-three cabinet
ministers are Oxford men). Soon
after leaving Oxford, he joined
the staff of the African maga
zine, Drum. He is the author of
three books on Africa: Drum,
The Treason ('age, and Common
Sense about Africa. His back
ground, therefore, encompasses
much exposure to traditional
a n d emergent influences, a
theme which occurs continuous
ly in his fascinating analysis of
the power structure in contem
porary Britain.
Sampson's book is a guide to
Britain's instiutions and how
they function. It focuses on the
managers in government, in
dustry, science, and communica
tion. The author has intention
ally omitted broad fields such as
provincial culture and the life
of ordinary people.
Traditional Vs. New
The traditional institutions in
Britain include the aristocracy,
Parliament, the civil service, the
merchant, banks, the public
schools, the older universities,
the law, the church, and the
armed forces. The newer ele
ments include the grammar
school meritocrats, the insur
ance companies, the actuaries,
the accountants, the large corpo
rations, the scientists, and the
admen.
Sampson likens Britain to Ob
lomov - a tired impoverished
aristocrat, lying in bed, getting
out of bed. The- only sure remedy
is to be tipped out. The author's
analysis of the situation sug
gests that many of the precon
ditions are at hand for salutary
change.
An example of the contrast
between old and new may be
gleaned from Sampson's inter
views with the two Harold's,
Maemillan and Wilson. Macmil-

Lan talked slowly and theatrical
ly, relishing the history and ac
coutrements oi' his .job. Wilson
talked quickly and drily, con
stantly returning to technicali
ties. Sampson considered Wilson
a man of determined profession
alism and quotes him as saying,
"1 want this place to he a power
house, not a monastery,"
Much work still remains to be
done in turning Britain into a
country fully competitive in the
commercial marketplaces of the
world. At tlie heart of Britain's
problems lies the massive failure
of her educational system to be
sensitive to societal and interna
tional pressures. The days of the
dilletante gentleman amateur
are over. Britain is tardily recog
nizing the importance of really
democratizing her school system,
investing a much larger propor
tion of her gross national prod
uct in people, and encouraging
rather than disdaining the tech
nocrats and professional man
agers.
Preserving The Best
Like many Britons, Sampson
wishes to preserve the best of
the old system while adjusting
to the necessities of the new.
He writes with feeling about a
country which can offer peace,
humanity, freedom, and leisure,
in a way for which one looks in
vain elsewhere.
In summary, Anatomy of Brit
ain Today is. undoubtedly the
best book I have read about an
island with which I have been
closely associated for much of
my life. Anthony Sampson, in an
interesting and amusing way,
succeeds in illuminating much of
the murkiness of Britain's cor
ridors of power. The author's
style resembles that of Theodore
White, with an emphasis on
journalistic reporting and read
able vignettes of central char
acters.
Though the book does not pur
port to be a major work of
academic scholarship, it could
with profit be read by all those
interested in Britain, her insti
tutions, and in the intricacies of
power. To the best of my knowl
edge there exists an obvious
vacuum for a similar work on
the American scene.

nizing the importance of really
democratizing her school system,
investing a much larger propor

rather than disdaining the tech
nocrats and professional man
agers.
Preserving The Best
Like many Britons, Sampson
wishes to preserve the best of
the old system while adjusting
to the necessities of the new.
He writes with feeling about a
country which can offer peace,
humanity, freedom, and leisure,
in a way for which one looks in
vain elsewhere.
In summary, Anatomy of Brit
ain Today is. undoubtedly the
best book I have read about an
island with which I have been
closely associated for much of
my life. Anthony Sampson, in an
interesting and amusing way,
succeeds in illuminating much of
the murkiness of Britain's cor
ridors of power. The author's
style resembles that of Theodore
White, with an emphasis on
journalistic reporting and read
able vignettes of central char
acters.
Though the book does not pur
port to be a major work of
academic scholarship, it could
with profit be read by all those
interested in Britain, her insti
tutions, and in the intricacies of
power. To the best of my knowl
edge there exists an obvious
vacuum for a similar work on
the American scene.

Anthony Sampson went to a
prominent "public" school (West
minster), then to one of the
"right" colleges (Christ Church
has produced thirteen out of
forty-six British prime minis
ters) at one of the "right" uni
versities (eleven out of Harold
Wilson's twenty-three cabinet
ministers are Oxford men). Soon
after leaving Oxford, he joined
the staff of the African maga
zine, Drum. He is the author of
three books on Africa: Drum,
The Treason ('age, and Common
Sense about Africa. His back
ground, therefore, encompasses
much exposure to traditional
a n d emergent influences, a
theme which occurs continuous
ly in his fascinating analysis of
the power structure in contem
porary Britain.
Sampson's book is a guide to
Britain's instiutions and how
they function. It focuses on the
managers in government, in
dustry, science, and communica
tion. The author has intention
ally omitted broad fields such as
provincial culture and the life
of ordinary people.
Traditional Vs. New
The traditional institutions in
Britain include the aristocracy,
Parliament, the civil service, the
merchant, banks, the public
schools, the older universities,
the law, the church, and the
armed forces. The newer ele
ments include the grammar
school meritocrats, the insur
ance companies, the actuaries,
the accountants, the large corpo
rations, the scientists, and the
admen.
Sampson likens Britain to Ob
lomov - a tired impoverished
aristocrat, lying in bed, getting
out of bed. The- only sure remedy
is to be tipped out. The author's
analysis of the situation sug
gests that many of the precon
ditions are at hand for salutary
change.
An example of the contrast
between old and new may be
gleaned from Sampson's inter
views with the two Harold's,
Maemillan and Wilson. Macmil-

Lan talked slowly and theatrical
ly, relishing the history and ac
coutrements oi' his .job. Wilson
talked quickly and drily, con
stantly returning to technicali
ties. Sampson considered Wilson
a man of determined profession
alism and quotes him as saying,
"1 want this place to he a power
house, not a monastery,"
Much work still remains to be
done in turning Britain into a
country fully competitive in the
commercial marketplaces of the
world. At tlie heart of Britain's
problems lies the massive failure
of her educational system to be
sensitive to societal and interna
tional pressures. The days of the
dilletante gentleman amateur
are over. Britain is tardily recog
nizing the importance of really
democratizing her school system,
