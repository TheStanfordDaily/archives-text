# VIETNAM 'PEACE FEELERS'
## America's Right To Know 
### TOM SHERMAN 
On July 13, 1965, at a press
conference. President Johnson
said "candor compels me to tell
you that there has not been the
slightest indication that the
other side is interested in nego
tiation or in unconditional dis
cussions, although the United
States has made some dozen at
tempts to hring that about."
(quoted by James Reston, San
Franeslco Chronicle Nov. IHi
President Johnson lied.
In August, 1964, UN Secretary
General U Thant lold Johnson,
Husk, and Stevenson of an offer
by Hanoi to negotiate in Ran
goon. That offer, according to
Eric Sevareid in the Nov. 30
issue of Look, remained in effect
after the elections in November;
U Thant even offered the U.S.
the opportunity of deciding the
terms of a cease-fire.
•Procedural' vs. 'Substantive'
The State Department has
confirmed its rejection of
Hanoi's offer. The White House
denied that IJ Thant had offered
any "proposal" because (I quote
Reston) "the peace feeler was
'procedural' and not 'substan
tive' and therefore was not re
garded by the Administration as
a 'proposal.' "
This abuse of language which
permits our government to lie
about its rejection (wrong, I
think) of Hanoi's offer to negoti
ate is disgusting. The apparent
assumption by our representa
tives that they have the right to
lie to us is terrifying.
Of course, we have been lied
to before, by Johnson and others
—about the U2, about U.S. in
volvement in the Bay of Pigs
debacle, about the success of
our advisors and the Diem re
gime in Vietnam, about the
money sent by the Office of Ed
ucation to Chicago's segregated
schools, about the recent effort
of the administration to reduce
aluminum prices. We are get
ting used to being lied to.
We are coming to accept lying
as normal, even as justifiable.
(For example, we accept cam
paign promises of the imposs
ible as legitimate; when the suc
cessful campaigner forgets, we
forget.) We should, I think, be
morally outraged by political
lies.
Politicians can lie with im
punity because the public, faced
with the enormity and complex
ity of making political decisions,
has resigned iis power to con
trol those who make such de
cisions. The lies, distortions, and
concealments which result from j
our resignation of control re- ,
move us further from the de- 1
eison-making process and make i
our resignation more complete. ;
'As Orwell Says ..
As Orwell says in another con- :
text, we are like the man whose
problems make him turn to
drink and whose drinking then ,
makes his problems worse.
As students at Stanford, we :

face a similar situation. We are
told by those who make policy
decisions that we cannot pos
sibly understand the legal, polit
ical, and financial complexities
involved in directing the Uni
versity. And often, when we
acquiesce, we find ii impossible
to change decisions, involving
our courses and our teachers
and our dormitories, of which
we do not approve.
Unless we become university
administrators, we will not he
experts in running a university.
But we will be competent to
help make policy decisions when
we are permitted to participate
in the committees and boards
which make those decisions.
How can we he expected to
understand the complexities of
making university policy when
we are excluded from policy
making? How can we be ex
pected to make the political de
cisions required of responsible
citizens when our elected repre
sentatives deny us access to the
facts?
Students at. Stanford have
demonstrated, I think, that they
are entitled to a stronger voice
in managing the University
than they have had in the past.
The faculty and administration
are now admitting a few more
students to some of the commit
tees which help to decide Uni
versity policies.
Right of Citizens
But President Johnson, his ad
ministration, and some of his
supporters seem not to recog
nize the right of citizens to
know the facts, to participate
in policy-making.
Last Monday night, at the
CONSCIENCE lecture-in, Guy
Pauker asked "What are we do
ing in Southeast Asia?" "It
seems to me," he said, that this
is a perfectly legitimate ques
tion which should always be
asked, and only the other day, I
spent several hours discussing
it with high government offic
ials in a private, social con
text."
"We reached the conclusion
and we were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery that we are in
Southeast Asia because we can
not afford to do otherwise, and
not for the sake of the people
of Vietnam, important as this
may lie, or for the neighboring
people, but for the stake of our
own way of life and of the fu
ture that we want to shape."
1 agree with Mr. Puaker's an
alysis of the reasons for our in

tervention in Vietnam: what
President Johnson takes to be
our national interest, not for the
interest uf the Vietnamese peo
ple as determined by them. We
are permitting the Vietnamese
people no choice, only submis
sion.
But whether or not you agree
tha l . we are trying to force or
should try to force our ideas on
the Vietnamese people, you must
agree that Mr. Pauker's distinc
tion between the public and priv
ate conclusions of "high govern
ment officials" is horrifying.
"We were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery," he said. Why
did Mr. Pauker need to empha
size the "private, social con
text" in which the group reach
ed it conclusions? In order to
assure his audience that the
members of the group were be
ing honest". The public state
ments oi government officials
are suspect, even to government
supporters like Mr. Pauker.
Guarantee For Truth
If we want to guarantee that
public officials tell us ihe truth,
we must protest when they lie
to us. We must make clear that
we are no longer willing to re
sign our control over our rep
resentatives.
As individuals and as mem
bers of political organizations,
we cannot change everything
which offends us. In order to

preserve our sanity, wo daro not
look too closely at the poverty
and suffering of which our in
action makes us guilty. We try
to preserve our personal happi
ness by ignoring the misery of
others not just the misery of
those in Vietnam, Selma, and the
valleys of California, but the
misery of our classmates awl
friends.
Stanford, I think, in many
ways encourages our ignorance.
We take courses which never
demonstrate the relationship be
tween ihe subject matter and
our real, personal lives. Often
excluded from the direction of
the University, we allow the ad
ministration to override the de
cisons made in our student gov
eminent; thus we contribute to
our political impotence.
Unless we learn to strive for
an education instead of good
grades, to see the relationship
between our classes and our
lives, and to act on some of our
objections to the way the Uni
versity and the country are run,
we accept the judgment of Dos
toyevsky's Grand Inquisitor:
"Man has not more agonizing
anxiety than to find someone to
whom he can hand over with all
speed the gift of freedom with
which the unhappy creature is
born ... A tranquil mind and
even death is dearer to man
than ihe free choice in the
knowledge of good and evil."

•Procedural' vs. 'Substantive'
The State Department has
confirmed its rejection of
Hanoi's offer. The White House
denied that IJ Thant had offered
any "proposal" because (I quote
Reston) "the peace feeler was
'procedural' and not 'substan
tive' and therefore was not re
garded by the Administration as
a 'proposal.' "
This abuse of language which
permits our government to lie
about its rejection (wrong, I
think) of Hanoi's offer to negoti
ate is disgusting. The apparent
assumption by our representa
tives that they have the right to
lie to us is terrifying.
Of course, we have been lied
to before, by Johnson and others
—about the U2, about U.S. in
volvement in the Bay of Pigs
debacle, about the success of
our advisors and the Diem re
gime in Vietnam, about the
money sent by the Office of Ed
ucation to Chicago's segregated
schools, about the recent effort
of the administration to reduce
aluminum prices. We are get
ting used to being lied to.
We are coming to accept lying
as normal, even as justifiable.
(For example, we accept cam
paign promises of the imposs
ible as legitimate; when the suc
cessful campaigner forgets, we
forget.) We should, I think, be
morally outraged by political
lies.
Politicians can lie with im
punity because the public, faced
with the enormity and complex
ity of making political decisions,
has resigned iis power to con
trol those who make such de
cisions. The lies, distortions, and
concealments which result from j
our resignation of control re- ,
move us further from the de- 1
eison-making process and make i
our resignation more complete. ;

As Orwell says in another con- :

face a similar situation. We are

Right of Citizens
But President Johnson, his ad

nize the right of citizens to
know the facts, to participate
in policy-making.
Last Monday night, at the
CONSCIENCE lecture-in, Guy
Pauker asked "What are we do
ing in Southeast Asia?" "It
seems to me," he said, that this
is a perfectly legitimate ques
tion which should always be
asked, and only the other day, I
spent several hours discussing
it with high government offic
ials in a private, social con
text."
"We reached the conclusion
and we were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery that we are in
Southeast Asia because we can
not afford to do otherwise, and
not for the sake of the people
of Vietnam, important as this
may lie, or for the neighboring
people, but for the stake of our
own way of life and of the fu
ture that we want to shape."
1 agree with Mr. Puaker's an
alysis of the reasons for our in

tervention in Vietnam: what
President Johnson takes to be
our national interest, not for the
interest uf the Vietnamese peo
ple as determined by them. We
are permitting the Vietnamese
people no choice, only submis
sion.
But whether or not you agree
tha l . we are trying to force or
should try to force our ideas on
the Vietnamese people, you must
agree that Mr. Pauker's distinc
tion between the public and priv
ate conclusions of "high govern
ment officials" is horrifying.
"We were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery," he said. Why
did Mr. Pauker need to empha
size the "private, social con
text" in which the group reach
ed it conclusions? In order to
assure his audience that the
members of the group were be
ing honest". The public state
ments oi government officials
are suspect, even to government
supporters like Mr. Pauker.
Guarantee For Truth
If we want to guarantee that
public officials tell us ihe truth,
we must protest when they lie
to us. We must make clear that
we are no longer willing to re
sign our control over our rep
resentatives.
As individuals and as mem
bers of political organizations,
we cannot change everything
which offends us. In order to

preserve our sanity, wo daro not
look too closely at the poverty
and suffering of which our in
action makes us guilty. We try
to preserve our personal happi
ness by ignoring the misery of
others not just the misery of
those in Vietnam, Selma, and the
valleys of California, but the
misery of our classmates awl
friends.
Stanford, I think, in many
ways encourages our ignorance.
We take courses which never
demonstrate the relationship be
tween ihe subject matter and
our real, personal lives. Often
excluded from the direction of
the University, we allow the ad
ministration to override the de
cisons made in our student gov
eminent; thus we contribute to
our political impotence.
Unless we learn to strive for
an education instead of good
grades, to see the relationship
between our classes and our
lives, and to act on some of our
objections to the way the Uni
versity and the country are run,
we accept the judgment of Dos
toyevsky's Grand Inquisitor:
"Man has not more agonizing
anxiety than to find someone to
whom he can hand over with all
speed the gift of freedom with
which the unhappy creature is
born ... A tranquil mind and
even death is dearer to man
than ihe free choice in the
knowledge of good and evil."

Of course, we have been lied
to before, by Johnson and others
—about the U2, about U.S. in
volvement in the Bay of Pigs
debacle, about the success of
our advisors and the Diem re
gime in Vietnam, about the
money sent by the Office of Ed
ucation to Chicago's segregated
schools, about the recent effort
of the administration to reduce
aluminum prices. We are get
ting used to being lied to.
We are coming to accept lying
as normal, even as justifiable.
(For example, we accept cam
paign promises of the imposs
ible as legitimate; when the suc
cessful campaigner forgets, we
forget.) We should, I think, be
morally outraged by political
lies.
Politicians can lie with im
punity because the public, faced
with the enormity and complex
ity of making political decisions,
has resigned iis power to con
trol those who make such de
cisions. The lies, distortions, and
concealments which result from j
our resignation of control re- ,
move us further from the de- 1
eison-making process and make i
our resignation more complete. ;

As Orwell says in another con- :

face a similar situation. We are

Right of Citizens
But President Johnson, his ad

supporters seem not to recog
nize the right of citizens to
know the facts, to participate
in policy-making.
Last Monday night, at the
CONSCIENCE lecture-in, Guy
Pauker asked "What are we do
ing in Southeast Asia?" "It
seems to me," he said, that this
is a perfectly legitimate ques
tion which should always be
asked, and only the other day, I
spent several hours discussing
it with high government offic
ials in a private, social con
text."
"We reached the conclusion
and we were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery that we are in
Southeast Asia because we can
not afford to do otherwise, and
not for the sake of the people
of Vietnam, important as this
may lie, or for the neighboring
people, but for the stake of our
own way of life and of the fu
ture that we want to shape."
1 agree with Mr. Puaker's an
alysis of the reasons for our in

tervention in Vietnam: what
President Johnson takes to be
our national interest, not for the
interest uf the Vietnamese peo
ple as determined by them. We
are permitting the Vietnamese
people no choice, only submis
sion.
But whether or not you agree
tha l . we are trying to force or
should try to force our ideas on
the Vietnamese people, you must
agree that Mr. Pauker's distinc
tion between the public and priv
ate conclusions of "high govern
ment officials" is horrifying.
"We were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery," he said. Why
did Mr. Pauker need to empha
size the "private, social con
text" in which the group reach
ed it conclusions? In order to
assure his audience that the
members of the group were be
ing honest". The public state
ments oi government officials
are suspect, even to government
supporters like Mr. Pauker.
Guarantee For Truth
If we want to guarantee that
public officials tell us ihe truth,
we must protest when they lie
to us. We must make clear that
we are no longer willing to re
sign our control over our rep
resentatives.
As individuals and as mem
bers of political organizations,
we cannot change everything
which offends us. In order to

preserve our sanity, wo daro not
look too closely at the poverty
and suffering of which our in
action makes us guilty. We try
to preserve our personal happi
ness by ignoring the misery of
others not just the misery of
those in Vietnam, Selma, and the
valleys of California, but the
misery of our classmates awl
friends.
Stanford, I think, in many
ways encourages our ignorance.
We take courses which never
demonstrate the relationship be
tween ihe subject matter and
our real, personal lives. Often
excluded from the direction of
the University, we allow the ad
ministration to override the de
cisons made in our student gov
eminent; thus we contribute to
our political impotence.
Unless we learn to strive for
an education instead of good
grades, to see the relationship
between our classes and our
lives, and to act on some of our
objections to the way the Uni
versity and the country are run,
we accept the judgment of Dos
toyevsky's Grand Inquisitor:
"Man has not more agonizing
anxiety than to find someone to
whom he can hand over with all
speed the gift of freedom with
which the unhappy creature is
born ... A tranquil mind and
even death is dearer to man
than ihe free choice in the
knowledge of good and evil."
On July 13, 1965, at a press
conference. President Johnson
said "candor compels me to tell
you that there has not been the
slightest indication that the
other side is interested in nego
tiation or in unconditional dis
cussions, although the United
States has made some dozen at

President Johnson lied.
In August, 1964, UN Secretary
General U Thant lold Johnson,
Husk, and Stevenson of an offer
by Hanoi to negotiate in Ran
goon. That offer, according to
Eric Sevareid in the Nov. 30

the opportunity of deciding the

punity because the public, faced
with the enormity and complex
ity of making political decisions,
has resigned iis power to con
trol those who make such de
cisions. The lies, distortions, and
concealments which result from j
our resignation of control re- ,
move us further from the de- 1
eison-making process and make i
our resignation more complete. ;
'As Orwell Says ..
As Orwell says in another con- :
text, we are like the man whose
problems make him turn to
drink and whose drinking then ,
makes his problems worse.
As students at Stanford, we :

face a similar situation. We are
told by those who make policy
decisions that we cannot pos
sibly understand the legal, polit
ical, and financial complexities
involved in directing the Uni
versity. And often, when we
acquiesce, we find ii impossible
to change decisions, involving
our courses and our teachers
and our dormitories, of which
we do not approve.
Unless we become university
administrators, we will not he
experts in running a university.
But we will be competent to
help make policy decisions when
we are permitted to participate
in the committees and boards
which make those decisions.
How can we he expected to
understand the complexities of
making university policy when
we are excluded from policy
making? How can we be ex
pected to make the political de
cisions required of responsible
citizens when our elected repre
sentatives deny us access to the
facts?
Students at. Stanford have
demonstrated, I think, that they
are entitled to a stronger voice
in managing the University
than they have had in the past.
The faculty and administration
are now admitting a few more
students to some of the commit
tees which help to decide Uni
versity policies.
Right of Citizens
But President Johnson, his ad
ministration, and some of his
supporters seem not to recog
nize the right of citizens to
know the facts, to participate
in policy-making.
Last Monday night, at the
CONSCIENCE lecture-in, Guy
Pauker asked "What are we do
ing in Southeast Asia?" "It
seems to me," he said, that this
is a perfectly legitimate ques
tion which should always be
asked, and only the other day, I
spent several hours discussing
it with high government offic
ials in a private, social con
text."
"We reached the conclusion
and we were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery that we are in
Southeast Asia because we can
not afford to do otherwise, and
not for the sake of the people
of Vietnam, important as this
may lie, or for the neighboring
people, but for the stake of our
own way of life and of the fu
ture that we want to shape."
1 agree with Mr. Puaker's an
alysis of the reasons for our in

tervention in Vietnam: what
President Johnson takes to be
our national interest, not for the
interest uf the Vietnamese peo
ple as determined by them. We
are permitting the Vietnamese
people no choice, only submis
sion.
But whether or not you agree
tha l . we are trying to force or
should try to force our ideas on
the Vietnamese people, you must
agree that Mr. Pauker's distinc
tion between the public and priv
ate conclusions of "high govern
ment officials" is horrifying.
"We were not speaking for
any public; we were not playing
to any gallery," he said. Why
did Mr. Pauker need to empha
size the "private, social con
text" in which the group reach
ed it conclusions? In order to
assure his audience that the
members of the group were be
ing honest". The public state
ments oi government officials
are suspect, even to government
supporters like Mr. Pauker.
Guarantee For Truth
If we want to guarantee that
public officials tell us ihe truth,
we must protest when they lie
to us. We must make clear that
we are no longer willing to re
sign our control over our rep
resentatives.
As individuals and as mem
bers of political organizations,
we cannot change everything
which offends us. In order to

preserve our sanity, wo daro not
look too closely at the poverty
and suffering of which our in
action makes us guilty. We try
to preserve our personal happi
ness by ignoring the misery of
others not just the misery of
those in Vietnam, Selma, and the
valleys of California, but the
misery of our classmates awl
friends.
Stanford, I think, in many
ways encourages our ignorance.
We take courses which never
demonstrate the relationship be
tween ihe subject matter and
our real, personal lives. Often
excluded from the direction of
the University, we allow the ad
ministration to override the de
cisons made in our student gov
eminent; thus we contribute to
our political impotence.
Unless we learn to strive for
an education instead of good
grades, to see the relationship
between our classes and our
lives, and to act on some of our
objections to the way the Uni
versity and the country are run,
we accept the judgment of Dos
toyevsky's Grand Inquisitor:
"Man has not more agonizing
anxiety than to find someone to
whom he can hand over with all
speed the gift of freedom with
which the unhappy creature is
born ... A tranquil mind and
even death is dearer to man
than ihe free choice in the
knowledge of good and evil."
On July 13, 1965, at a press
conference. President Johnson
said "candor compels me to tell
you that there has not been the
slightest indication that the
other side is interested in nego
tiation or in unconditional dis
cussions, although the United
States has made some dozen at
tempts to hring that about."
(quoted by James Reston, San
Franeslco Chronicle Nov. IHi
President Johnson lied.
In August, 1964, UN Secretary
General U Thant lold Johnson,
Husk, and Stevenson of an offer
by Hanoi to negotiate in Ran
goon. That offer, according to
Eric Sevareid in the Nov. 30
issue of Look, remained in effect
after the elections in November;
U Thant even offered the U.S.
the opportunity of deciding the
terms of a cease-fire.
•Procedural' vs. 'Substantive'
The State Department has
confirmed its rejection of
Hanoi's offer. The White House
denied that IJ Thant had offered
any "proposal" because (I quote
Reston) "the peace feeler was
'procedural' and not 'substan
tive' and therefore was not re
garded by the Administration as
a 'proposal.' "
This abuse of language which
permits our government to lie
about its rejection (wrong, I
think) of Hanoi's offer to negoti
ate is disgusting. The apparent
assumption by our representa
tives that they have the right to
lie to us is terrifying.
Of course, we have been lied
to before, by Johnson and others
—about the U2, about U.S. in
volvement in the Bay of Pigs
debacle, about the success of
our advisors and the Diem re
gime in Vietnam, about the
money sent by the Office of Ed
ucation to Chicago's segregated
schools, about the recent effort
of the administration to reduce
aluminum prices. We are get
ting used to being lied to.
We are coming to accept lying
as normal, even as justifiable.
(For example, we accept cam
paign promises of the imposs
ible as legitimate; when the suc
cessful campaigner forgets, we
forget.) We should, I think, be
morally outraged by political
lies.
Politicians can lie with im
punity because the public, faced
