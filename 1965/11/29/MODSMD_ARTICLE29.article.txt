# Evaluating The Evaluators Of The Wilbur Hall System
## 
### 
The Faculty-Master at Wilbur will have the
freedom to experiment with TA's, liA's or any
body else to make the system work."
Dean Robert J. \\ ert
Hecently, Wilbur Faculty-Master line Hutch
inson utilized the above-quoted prerogative and
named an eight-man faculty-administration
committee to evaluate the entire Wilbur system
—from sponsors to Faculty-Master—and recom
mend needed changes.
We most strongly question Prof. Hutchinson's
action on two grounds.
First, and most obviously, we find it quite re
markable that the Faculty-Master would include
himself on such a committee and, moreover,
would grant himself the chairman's seat; that
is, if he really wants the committee to under
take a critical study of the system and its pres
ent operations. It seems equally remarkable that
the Faculty-Master would allow himself a major
voice in the committee's deliberations while re
fusing to grant any of the present sponsors that
same privilege, since this latter group has as
much interest in and knowledge of the system
as the Faculty-Master himself does.
Our second question is much more fundamen
tal. Should the Faculty-Master have the right to
namo such a committee in the first place? In
other words, is Wilbur Hall to be the autonom
ous enclave of one person? We would hope not,
especially since both the position and the man
were instituted in June without any student
consultation.
As Dean Wert told The Daily last Spring, the
Committee on Undergraduate Education of the
Academic Council agreed to inaugurate the pro
gram at Wilbur since the then director, Doug

Davis, would not be returning to the post. How
ever, the Dean did not consult with the commit
tee on his choice for the position "since Prof.
Hutchinson was a member of that same commit
tee."
At no time were students, particularly those
most knowledgeable about the Wilbur system
and its effect on freshmen—the sponsors, allow
ed any formal role in the policy-making process.
It was, essentially, an Administrative decision.
We think Wilbur Hall—its environs, its pro
grams and its regulations—is a community con
cern.
Legitimate questions have been raised about
the sponsor system, especially the method by
which sponsors are chosen. On the whole,
though, we believe—as, we think, the sponsors
do—that the effiacy and value of this system
will successfully withstand the objective scrut
iny of any man or any committee.
However, we think the Faculty-Master sys
tem deserves the same objective scrutiny. How
much time should a man give to the job, what
personal responsibility does he have to meet and
consult with freshmen anr sponsors? Should he
have autonomous power in making policy, in
choosing faculty residents .. . and sponsors?
We reiterate, the Wilbur Hall system is a com
munity concern, and it should be evaluated by
a committee selected by and responsible to the
entire community, not just one man. For this
purpose, we suggest that the Committee of 15
select either a subcommittee from its ranks or
a committee from the community as a whole to
undertake this important study. The sponsors,
the faculty residents and the Faculty-Master
should advise, but not necessarily sit on this
committee.

freedom to experiment with TA's, liA's or any
body else to make the system work."

same privilege, since this latter group has as
much interest in and knowledge of the system
as the Faculty-Master himself does.
Our second question is much more fundamen
tal. Should the Faculty-Master have the right to
namo such a committee in the first place? In
other words, is Wilbur Hall to be the autonom
ous enclave of one person? We would hope not,
especially since both the position and the man
were instituted in June without any student
consultation.
As Dean Wert told The Daily last Spring, the
Committee on Undergraduate Education of the
Academic Council agreed to inaugurate the pro
gram at Wilbur since the then director, Doug

Davis, would not be returning to the post. How
ever, the Dean did not consult with the commit
tee on his choice for the position "since Prof.
Hutchinson was a member of that same commit
tee."
At no time were students, particularly those
most knowledgeable about the Wilbur system
and its effect on freshmen—the sponsors, allow
ed any formal role in the policy-making process.
It was, essentially, an Administrative decision.
We think Wilbur Hall—its environs, its pro
grams and its regulations—is a community con
cern.
Legitimate questions have been raised about
the sponsor system, especially the method by
which sponsors are chosen. On the whole,
though, we believe—as, we think, the sponsors
do—that the effiacy and value of this system
will successfully withstand the objective scrut
iny of any man or any committee.
However, we think the Faculty-Master sys
tem deserves the same objective scrutiny. How
much time should a man give to the job, what
personal responsibility does he have to meet and
consult with freshmen anr sponsors? Should he
have autonomous power in making policy, in
choosing faculty residents .. . and sponsors?
We reiterate, the Wilbur Hall system is a com
munity concern, and it should be evaluated by
a committee selected by and responsible to the
entire community, not just one man. For this
purpose, we suggest that the Committee of 15
select either a subcommittee from its ranks or
a committee from the community as a whole to
undertake this important study. The sponsors,
the faculty residents and the Faculty-Master
should advise, but not necessarily sit on this
committee.
The Faculty-Master at Wilbur will have the
freedom to experiment with TA's, liA's or any
body else to make the system work."
Dean Robert J. \\ ert
Hecently, Wilbur Faculty-Master line Hutch
inson utilized the above-quoted prerogative and
named an eight-man faculty-administration
committee to evaluate the entire Wilbur system
—from sponsors to Faculty-Master—and recom
mend needed changes.
We most strongly question Prof. Hutchinson's
action on two grounds.
First, and most obviously, we find it quite re
markable that the Faculty-Master would include
himself on such a committee and, moreover,
would grant himself the chairman's seat; that
is, if he really wants the committee to under
take a critical study of the system and its pres
ent operations. It seems equally remarkable that
the Faculty-Master would allow himself a major
voice in the committee's deliberations while re
fusing to grant any of the present sponsors that
same privilege, since this latter group has as
much interest in and knowledge of the system
as the Faculty-Master himself does.
