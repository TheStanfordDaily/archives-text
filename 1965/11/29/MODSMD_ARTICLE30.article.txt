## Publish Or Perish Syndrome—Those Who Cannot Teach Should Not Lecture 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In order to analyze the "pub
lish or perish" syndrome it will
bo necessary to understand and
define the professor's role in the
general educational scheme, Pro
fessorship is a demanding re
sponsibility. The position re
quires that the professor be on
the "frontier of knowledge," i.e.
cognizant of the latest develop
ments in his field, and he must,
also be able to effectively trans
mit that knowledge to his stu
dents. The value to society of
men actively engaged in the in
crease of knowledge goes un
questioned, but we must never
forget that the primary role of
the university is the education
of its students. A man who can
not teach well is not qualified
to lecture, regardless of his pro
fess ional capability.
If these two functions to
gether burden a professor be
yond reasonable expectation,
then the University should make
a formal distinction between re
search scholars and lecturers.
Poor teachers should be barred
from the lecture hall; good
teachers should receive rewards

commensurate with the import
ance of their ability to the Uni
ity to the University and not in
proportion to the prestige their
residence adds to Stanford.

• liliotlesiaii Threat
Editor, The Daily:
As students of the United
Campus Christian Ministry and
Canterbury Foundation at Stan
ford University, we are concern
ed about the threat to the free
doms and general welfare of tlie
people of Rhodesia posed by the
recent actions of the govern
ment of Mr. Lan Smith:
1. the illegal rebellion against
the authority of the United
Kingdom in disregard of the pre
requisites set for Rhodesian in
dependence by the British gov
ernment :
a. "unimpeded progress to
ward majority rule"
b. assurance against further
u ndemocra tie amendment s
to t he Const it ut ion
c. "progress toward ending
racial discrimination"
d. "immediate improvement

in the political status of the
four million Africans"
e. guarantee of a plebiscite
open to all citizens on the
question of national inde
pendence
2. the alteration of the amend
ment provisions of the 1961 Con
stitution so as to give the white
dominated Rhodesian Parlia
ment absolute control over all
future constitutional changes.
3. the suppression of indigen
ous political parties, as shown
by the jailing of Mr. Joshua
Nkomo and Mr. Ndabaningi Sit*
hole, the leaders of the two
largest African political parties.
We admire the denunciation
of these acts by members of the
Rhodesian Christian community
as a clear demonstration of the
responsibilities the Christian
Church must properly assume
in acordance with its theological
affirmations. We commend the
first public call for resistance
against the Smith government
from within Rhodesia, the 14
November sermon of the Right
Reverend Cecil Alderson, Angli
can Bishop of Mashonaland:
"It cannot be required of a

Christian, as a moral duly, to
oboy laws unlawfully enatced,
but clearly their authors will
exact penalties for breach of
law . . .
"Submission under protest
may not be enough . . . There is
a Christian right, and may be
a Christian duty, to disobey; na
turally, we do not expect to
escapc the penalties of disobed
ience."
The Canterbuiy Foundation
and United Campus Christian
Ministry intend to send copies
of this letter to representatives
of the Church in Rhodesia, the
British Foreign Office, the Brit
ish Embassy in Washington, the
United States State Department,
and to former Prime Minister
Tan Smith in Salisbury. We hope
(hat others will endorse this let
ter when it is circulated on cam
pus within the next week.
