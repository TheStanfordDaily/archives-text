# THE 						CAPITOL SCENE
## Dean Rusk's Miraculous 'Peace-Feeler' Evaluator 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
One of the trickiest things to
recogni/.e in Washngton are le
gitimate "peace feelers" from
the enemy. In a Look magazine
article Eric Sevareid wrote that
Adlai Stevenson had told him
the United States rejected a
"peace feeler" 112 r o m Hanoi
through UN Secretary General
U Thant in August of 196 L The
Â£tate Department confirmed that
the offer had been made, but.
thanks to Dean .Rusk's antenna,
which is very sensitive to peace
foolers, the U. S. had turned it.
down.
The Assistant Secretary for
Peace Feelers in the State De
partment told me the other day,
"I don't know what all the fuss
is about. We've had a lot of
peace feelers from the Commies,
but not one of them has shown
up on Dean Rusk's feeler set as
being legitimate."
Which Is Legitimate?
"How do you know when a
peace feeler is legitimate or
not?" I asked.
"Wo have a peace-feeler evalu
ator here." ho said, taking me
over to what looked like a very
complicate ! radio sot. "When a
peace feeler comes in, we broad
cast to Dean Rusk, who picks it
up on his counter-peace feeler.
This feeler, attached to the Sec

retary's head, is so sensitive that j
il can tell within seconds wheth-,
er it is a sincere feeler or just |
another lousy Communist trick." !
"Could you demonstrate for
me?"
"Well, I don't know if the Sec-1
rotary has his counter-feeler on !
his head now or not. Let's try |
it." He spoke into the machine.!
"Hanoi told Bulgaria it will meet'
with American representatives I
in Geneva."
There was crackling static and
finally a weak voice came over
which said, "Turn the offer 1
down."
The Assistant Secretary]
switched the machine off.
"That's marvelous," I said. |
"It's almost like extra-sensory
perception."
"It's the greatest breakthrough
we've hafl since radar," he said
proudly.
"Would it work for any See ;
retary of State," I asked.
"We don't know. Dean Rusk's :
feeler is his own. We just built j
the machinery to fit it."
"Is this the only way you peo
ple handle peace feelers?" I
asked.
"Oh, no. For the time being
it's the most foolproof, but we
have other methods as well. Tim
ing is very important when it
comes to peace feelers. For ex
ample, when you're losing a war,
you've got. to ignore them or the j
other side will get you in a box. j
The peace feeler from them may |
be legitimate, but you certainly
don't want to take it up with
people committing naked ag- j
gression."
When You're Winning
"Then you would only take up |
a peace feeler when you're win- ;
ning?" I said.
"No, not necessarily. When
you're winning there is no rea
son to sit down and talk peace
because then you might have to
work out a compromise with the
naked aggressors."
"But if you can't accept a
peace feeler when you're losing
and you can't accept one when
you're winning, when can you
accept one?"
"If I told you that I'd be giv
ing aid and comfort to the
enemy."
"Do you ever send out peace
feelers of your own?"
"All the time. The President
has said he will talk peace any
where, anytime, with no condi
tions attached."
"Have they ever picked up
your feelers?"
"As far as we know they
haven't."
"Why not?"
"Wo don't know, unless it's be
cause they've got one of these
damn feeler machines of their
own."
