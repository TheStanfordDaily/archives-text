# Russian Students Compare Countries
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
The Soviet. Union isn't perfect. This
disclosure surprisingly comes from
two Russian exchange students at
Stanford: Vadim Golovanov and Vic
tor Serdyuk. Both 31. they are mem
bers of a group of 29 students in
America this year.
Serdyuk is an associate professor of
physics at the University of Odessa.
Explaining his serious-minded atti
tude, he said, "Vadim likes people. I
like only scientific instruments."
At Stanford. Serdyuk is working
wtih Dr. Richard Bube of the Depart
ment of Materials Science. Ironically,
Dr. Bube is the faculty adviser for the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.
Russian Fringe Benefits
Working for Radio Moscow, Golov
anov earns 160 rubles a month (about
$145). "But I do very good," he said.
"We have free medical, free education,
our transportation is cheaper, and our
living costs are much lower than
yours."
"Many of our radio and television
producers, must be convinced that ad
vertising should be accepted. The mer
chants must be convinced that adver
tising would allow them to enjoy a
wider sale of their products. And then
we'll have to train people so that they
can write advertising copy," Golov
anov, a reporter for the state-owned
radio station, said.
I/ong Way To Go
"The newspapers accept some ad
vertising. but insofar as Radio Mos
cow is concerned, we've got a long way
to go," Golovanov admitted. "It's
merely a matter of over production.
You know we've spurted ahead in the
last 20 years. But we've had several
problems."
Golovanov is studying with Prof.
Wilbur Schramm, director of the In
stitute for Communication Research.
"He is an immensely popular person
in Russia," Golovanov said.
Asked about the United States posi

turn in Vietnam. Golovanov answered
for the pair. "I don't think your State
Department would like our response.
We were told before we left our coun
try we were not to meddle in Amer
ica's internal affairs."
The two were questioned about
demonstrations against U.S. policies in
southeast Asia. Golovanov laughed
and said. "Woll, on one television com
mentary we heard mentioned that
Communists were supposed to be in
volved. But 1 here's no mention of the
homosexuals and drunkards involved."
Country of Cars
The Russian students, who live in
Crolhcrs Hall, find Americans "very
polite, very helpful," but that the
country is more or less "made up of
cars, rather than people."
They compare the Bay Area to vari
ous parts of the Soviet Union "Your
soa coast is like our resort a.tca,"
Golovanov said. "Your hills like our
Baltic Republic."
