# RULES AND STATE LAW:
## Drinking Free-For-All? 
### CHRIS HARTE 
If Stanford changed its liquor pol
icy to conform to California law, it
would be legal for any student to
drink on campus, regardless of age.
But, almost without exception, the
way in which a minor obtained liquor
would be illegal.
This is the interpretation of state
law given to the Daily by officials of
the State Alcoholic Beverages Control
Commission, the California Law Re
vision Commission, and the Stanford
Police Department.
California law discourages drink
ing by minors by making it almost
impossible for them to get liquor
legally, but makes drinking itself
illegal in only a few cases.
The law prohibits any person from
selling, giving or furnishing, or caus
ing lo be sold, given or furnished, any
alcoholic beverage to a minor.
A liquor dealer must establish both
the identity and the age of his cus
tomers by means of bona fide evi

dence. There arc stii'l' penalties for t ho
use of falsified identification, espec
ially draft cards.
Restrictions on Minor
In addition, under California law it
is a misdemeanor for a minor to pur
chase alcoholic beverages, consume
them in any place where they are sold
for consumption on the premises, or
possess them on any street or high
way or "in any place open to the
public.''
A misdemeanor in this state is pun
ishable by a fine of up to $5000, or
six months imprisonment, or both. It
becomes a permanent part of a per
son's record.
The law docs not define explicitly
what is meant by a "place open to the
public."
Dorm Kooms Private
Until 1963 this clause read simply
"public place." It was amended, ac
cording to Joseph Harvey, of the Cali
fornia Law Commission, to clarify the
rase against a minor who brought his
own liquor into a bar.
Ronald Lockyer. district administra
tor of the Alcoholic Beverages Con
trols Commission for the San Fran
cisco area, said that a place open to
the public is "any place a person can
freely gel into with out trespassing."
"A dorm room would definitely not
be a place open to the public, and I
guess that a dorm corridor would be
public," said Lockyer.
Stanford Police Chief Cordon Davis
said he believes the only public places
in the dorms are the lobbies, and that
corridors and rooms arc considered
private.
Davis commented that liquor "is
not much of a problem on the cam
pus. Mostly we run across liquor vio
lations under normal circumstances.
No one calls lo sav thai I here's a wild

liquor party going on in the next
room—it may happen, but. students
just don't call in about it.''
If present policy were changed, the
rathskeller proposed by Tresidder
Memorial Union director Charles
Berry and student leaders would also
be legal.
State law prohibits trie sale of alco
holic beverages within a mile and a
half of a college campus, with two
major exceptions. Any beer or wine
with not more than 3.2 per cent alco
hol by weight may be sold within the
limit, and any bona fide restaurant
holding a permit may serve liquor.
The first exception makes a rath
skeller legal, and under the second the
Union cafeteria or the New cellar
could, with a permit, sell liquor.
This would nol necessarily mean
that minors could no longer eat in
these places, because a minor is not
prohibited by law from being on the
premises where liquor is sold or
served.

A liquor dealer must establish both
the identity and the age of his cus
tomers by means of bona fide evi

dence. There arc stii'l' penalties for t ho
use of falsified identification, espec

Restrictions on Minor
In addition, under California law it
is a misdemeanor for a minor to pur
chase alcoholic beverages, consume
them in any place where they are sold
for consumption on the premises, or
possess them on any street or high
way or "in any place open to the
public.''
A misdemeanor in this state is pun
ishable by a fine of up to $5000, or
six months imprisonment, or both. It
becomes a permanent part of a per
son's record.
The law docs not define explicitly
what is meant by a "place open to the
public."
Dorm Kooms Private
Until 1963 this clause read simply
"public place." It was amended, ac
cording to Joseph Harvey, of the Cali
fornia Law Commission, to clarify the
rase against a minor who brought his
own liquor into a bar.
Ronald Lockyer. district administra
tor of the Alcoholic Beverages Con
trols Commission for the San Fran
cisco area, said that a place open to
the public is "any place a person can
freely gel into with out trespassing."
"A dorm room would definitely not
be a place open to the public, and I
guess that a dorm corridor would be
public," said Lockyer.
Stanford Police Chief Cordon Davis
said he believes the only public places
in the dorms are the lobbies, and that
corridors and rooms arc considered
private.
Davis commented that liquor "is
not much of a problem on the cam
pus. Mostly we run across liquor vio
lations under normal circumstances.
No one calls lo sav thai I here's a wild

liquor party going on in the next
room—it may happen, but. students
just don't call in about it.''
If present policy were changed, the
rathskeller proposed by Tresidder
Memorial Union director Charles
Berry and student leaders would also
be legal.
State law prohibits trie sale of alco
holic beverages within a mile and a
half of a college campus, with two
major exceptions. Any beer or wine
with not more than 3.2 per cent alco
hol by weight may be sold within the
limit, and any bona fide restaurant
holding a permit may serve liquor.
The first exception makes a rath
skeller legal, and under the second the
Union cafeteria or the New cellar
could, with a permit, sell liquor.
This would nol necessarily mean
that minors could no longer eat in
these places, because a minor is not
prohibited by law from being on the
premises where liquor is sold or
served.
If Stanford changed its liquor pol
icy to conform to California law, it
would be legal for any student to
drink on campus, regardless of age.
But, almost without exception, the
way in which a minor obtained liquor
would be illegal.
This is the interpretation of state
law given to the Daily by officials of
the State Alcoholic Beverages Control
Commission, the California Law Re
vision Commission, and the Stanford
Police Department.
California law discourages drink
ing by minors by making it almost
impossible for them to get liquor
legally, but makes drinking itself
illegal in only a few cases.
The law prohibits any person from
selling, giving or furnishing, or caus
ing lo be sold, given or furnished, any
alcoholic beverage to a minor.
