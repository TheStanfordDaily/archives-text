THE BLUEBIRD OF HAPPINESS
HAS FLOWN THE COOP
Can education bring happiness?
This is a question that in recent years has caused much
lively debate and several hundred stabbings among Ameri
can college professors. Some contend that if a student's in
tellect is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically
follow. Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and
ignore the rest of the personality can only lead to misery.
I myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence
the well-known case of Knut Fusco.
Knut, a forestry major, never got anything less than a
straight "A," was awarded his B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in
only two years, his M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in
only three, and his D.B.C. (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms)
in only four.
Academic glory was his. His intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was he happy? The an
swer, alas, was no. Knut—he knew not why—was miser
able; so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking
across campus, he was suddenly so overcome with melan
choly that he flung himself, weeping, upon the statue of the
Founder.
By and by, a liberal arts coed named Nikki Sigafoos came
by with her Barby doll. She noted Knut's condition. "How
come you're so unhappy, hey?" said Nikki.
"Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,"
replied Knut peevishly.
"All right, 1 will," said Nikki. "You are unhappy for two
reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing your
intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche.

Blade?"
Knut shook his head.
"Well, we'll fix that right now," said Nikki, and gave him
a razor, a Personna Stainless Steel Blade, and a can of
Burma Shave.
Knut lathered with the Burma Shave and shaved with
the Personna and for the first time in many long years he
smiled. He smiled and then he laughed—peal after peal of
reverberating joy. "Wow-dow!" he cried. "What a shave!
Does Personna come in injcctor style, too?"
"It does," said Nikki.
"Gloriosky!" cried Knut. "And does Burma Shave come
in menthol, too?"
"It does," said Nikki.
"Huzzah!" cried Knut. "Now that I have found Personna
and Burma Shave I will never have another unhappy day."
"Hold!" said Nikki. "Personna and Burma Shave alone
will not solve your problem—only half of it. Remember I
said there were two things making you unhappy?"
"Oh, yeah," said Knut. "What's the other one?"
"How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?"
said Nikki.
"I stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,"
said Knut. "I keep meaning to have it taken off."
"Allow me," said Nikki and removed it.
"Land's sakes, what a relief!" said Knut, now totally
happy, and took Nikki's hand and led her to a Personna
vendor and then to a justice of the peace.
Today Knut is a perfectly fulfilled man, both intellect
wise and personality wise. He lives in a charming split-level
house with Nikki and their 17 children and he rises steadily
in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, he became
Consultant on Sawdust to the American Butchers Guild,
he was named an Honorary Sequoia by the park commis
sioner of Las Vegas, and he published a best-selling book
called I Wan a Slippery Elm for Uic FBI,

follow. Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and
ignore the rest of the personality can only lead to misery.
I myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence
the well-known case of Knut Fusco.
Knut, a forestry major, never got anything less than a
straight "A," was awarded his B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in
only two years, his M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in
only three, and his D.B.C. (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms)
in only four.
Academic glory was his. His intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was he happy? The an
swer, alas, was no. Knut—he knew not why—was miser
able; so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking
across campus, he was suddenly so overcome with melan
choly that he flung himself, weeping, upon the statue of the
Founder.
By and by, a liberal arts coed named Nikki Sigafoos came
by with her Barby doll. She noted Knut's condition. "How
come you're so unhappy, hey?" said Nikki.
"Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,"
replied Knut peevishly.
"All right, 1 will," said Nikki. "You are unhappy for two
reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing your
intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche.

Blade?"
Knut shook his head.
"Well, we'll fix that right now," said Nikki, and gave him
a razor, a Personna Stainless Steel Blade, and a can of
Burma Shave.
Knut lathered with the Burma Shave and shaved with
the Personna and for the first time in many long years he
smiled. He smiled and then he laughed—peal after peal of
reverberating joy. "Wow-dow!" he cried. "What a shave!
Does Personna come in injcctor style, too?"
"It does," said Nikki.
"Gloriosky!" cried Knut. "And does Burma Shave come
in menthol, too?"
"It does," said Nikki.
"Huzzah!" cried Knut. "Now that I have found Personna
and Burma Shave I will never have another unhappy day."
"Hold!" said Nikki. "Personna and Burma Shave alone
will not solve your problem—only half of it. Remember I
said there were two things making you unhappy?"
"Oh, yeah," said Knut. "What's the other one?"
"How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?"
said Nikki.
"I stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,"
said Knut. "I keep meaning to have it taken off."
"Allow me," said Nikki and removed it.
"Land's sakes, what a relief!" said Knut, now totally
happy, and took Nikki's hand and led her to a Personna
vendor and then to a justice of the peace.
Today Knut is a perfectly fulfilled man, both intellect
wise and personality wise. He lives in a charming split-level
house with Nikki and their 17 children and he rises steadily
in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, he became
Consultant on Sawdust to the American Butchers Guild,
he was named an Honorary Sequoia by the park commis

called I Wan a Slippery Elm for Uic FBI,

Academic glory was his. His intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was he happy? The an
swer, alas, was no. Knut—he knew not why—was miser
able; so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking
across campus, he was suddenly so overcome with melan
choly that he flung himself, weeping, upon the statue of the
Founder.
By and by, a liberal arts coed named Nikki Sigafoos came
by with her Barby doll. She noted Knut's condition. "How
come you're so unhappy, hey?" said Nikki.
"Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,"
replied Knut peevishly.
"All right, 1 will," said Nikki. "You are unhappy for two
reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing your
intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche.

watched a sunset?
Written a poem? Shaved with a Persorma Stainless Steel
Blade?"
Knut shook his head.
"Well, we'll fix that right now," said Nikki, and gave him
a razor, a Personna Stainless Steel Blade, and a can of
Burma Shave.
Knut lathered with the Burma Shave and shaved with
the Personna and for the first time in many long years he
smiled. He smiled and then he laughed—peal after peal of
reverberating joy. "Wow-dow!" he cried. "What a shave!
Does Personna come in injcctor style, too?"
"It does," said Nikki.
"Gloriosky!" cried Knut. "And does Burma Shave come
in menthol, too?"
"It does," said Nikki.
"Huzzah!" cried Knut. "Now that I have found Personna
and Burma Shave I will never have another unhappy day."
"Hold!" said Nikki. "Personna and Burma Shave alone
will not solve your problem—only half of it. Remember I
said there were two things making you unhappy?"
"Oh, yeah," said Knut. "What's the other one?"
"How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?"
said Nikki.
"I stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,"
said Knut. "I keep meaning to have it taken off."
"Allow me," said Nikki and removed it.
"Land's sakes, what a relief!" said Knut, now totally
happy, and took Nikki's hand and led her to a Personna
vendor and then to a justice of the peace.
Today Knut is a perfectly fulfilled man, both intellect
wise and personality wise. He lives in a charming split-level
house with Nikki and their 17 children and he rises steadily
in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, he became
Consultant on Sawdust to the American Butchers Guild,
he was named an Honorary Sequoia by the park commis
sioner of Las Vegas, and he published a best-selling book
called I Wan a Slippery Elm for Uic FBI,
