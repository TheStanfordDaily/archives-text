A Vote "No" for God
Jesus Christ said, He who is not with me, is against me, and he who does
not gather with me, scatters' (Matthew 12:30). That is, a neutral or uncom
mitted attitude towards Jesus Christ is a "no" vote for God.
Jesus Christ said, No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate
the one, and love the other,- or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
other. You cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24). Serving God and
living for self is not |ust unfeasible, but totally impossible, Jesus said.
Jesus Christ said, "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in
me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can
do nothing" (John 15:5). All activity which does not spring from trust and
dependence in Him is worthless and of no value in God s sight, Jesus said.
Failure to make a positive "yes, I will response to Jesus Christ is an automatic
"no" vote for God.
These claims of Jesus Christ have been verified by countless millions through
the ages who have discovered new life with meaning and purpose as a result
of their response to the Lord Jesus. Released from their futile ways and frus
trated search for peace in a dying world, those who know and obey Jesus Christ
find full, fruitful lifeâ€”life as God intended it to be. But cut off from God, the
man of the world by his conduct and actions is voting no" for God, storing
up for himself the pain and anguish of eternity in total separation from Him
who is Life and Truth and Love.
You alone can decide whether to accept or reject Jesus Christ, but He has
not left us the choice of remaining neutral. Your ' yes" in response to His offer
will bring you forever into His family. Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye that
labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,
and team of me,- for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest for
your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light" (Matthew 1 1:28-30).
