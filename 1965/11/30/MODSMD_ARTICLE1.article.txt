# New U.C. Program Attacks Impersonal Education
## 
### JOHN BROADWIN 
The faculty of the College of Let
ters and Science at the University of
California at Berkeley recently adopt
ed a plan to ensure that the creative
and critical discussion of ideas re
mains the very life of the university.
The principal inspiration for the
plan, called the "Tussman Proposal,"
was a paragraph once written by
former Chancellor Edward VV. Strong,
lie wrote,
An institution dedicated to inquiry
will create a tension between itself
and the larger community by the
new ideas it advances and by its
critical examination of ideas inher
ited. Ideas live in their dissemina
tion from mind to mind; ideas die
when this vital transmission ceases.

The Proposal, introduced by Pro
fessor of Philosophy, Joseph Tussman,
on March 4, 1965, was for a special
college program to he offered under
the authority of the College of Letters
and Science, Berkeley.
Proposed Two-Year Program
The basis of this program is the
belief that the "course," which is gen
erally the standard unit of educational
organization, is not the only unit out
of which a coherent educational pro
gram can be developed. What was
proposed was a two-year program,
each semester organized around a
central theme. For the first, or pilot
group, each semester is to be devoted
to the study of a significant crisis of
Western culture: First, Greece in
volved in the Peloponnesian Wars;

second, England during the Puritan
revolution (through Cromwell); third,
America's adopting the Federal Con
stitution; fourth, contemporary Amer
ica grappling with a major problem
(i.e., race).
Each period presents problems of
significance and contemporary rele
vance and is rich in a wide variety
of material. While the staff will be
drawn from a variety of "disciplines"
its approach will be "non disciplinary"
rather than "inter-disciplinary."
Designed For Frosh
The program is designed for a lim
ited number of students, entering
freshmen, for whom it. constitutes,
except for one additional course each
semester, a full prognun. A student
is expected to take the two year pro

gram and to gain upper division stand
ing upon its completion. The staff
consists generally of regular members
of the faculty on leave from their
departments for one or two years, and
participation in this program consti
tutes ;i full load. The proposal's aim
was five faculty and 150 students for
the pilot program, which began Sep
tember 1965.
The program combines private tu
torial, small-group tutorial, seminar
and lecture. Students submit papers
at least once every two weeks. Ac
cording to Tussman's plan, formal
"contact" with the tutorial staff in
seminars, tutorials and lectures should
approximate eight to 10 hours each
week. The reading, writing and dis
cussion involved is believed to justify

12 units of academic credit each
semester.
Satisfies Requirements
It was requested that the program
be regarded as satisfying: (1) the
reading and composition requirement.
(2) the humanities breadth require
ment, (3) the social science breadth
requirement, and (4) (in this particu
lar case), the American history and
institutions requirement.
It is expected that the student would
take foreign language as his outside
course until he has satisfied the lan
guage requirement. And it is also ex
pected that the science requirement
would be satisfied in his junior or
senior year.
Not Honors Program
Tussman emphasized that this is

nut an honors program. It is to be a
coeducational and fairly representa
tive experiment. Students who have
been admitted to Berkeley as fresh
men will be invited to apply for ad
mission to the program and the selec
tion will be made by mid-August of
each year.
Members of the tutorial staff, ac
cording to the proposal, should be
placed on an 11-month basis to enable
them during each summer to study
and organize the program for the
following year. Apart from salaries of
the instructional staff, a building
would be needed to provide a con
genial common room, faculty offices,
conference and seminar rooms, a li
brary room and student studies or
cubicles.

at least once every two weeks. Ac
cording to Tussman's plan, formal
"contact" with the tutorial staff in
seminars, tutorials and lectures should
approximate eight to 10 hours each
week. The reading, writing and dis
cussion involved is believed to justify

12 units of academic credit each
semester.
Satisfies Requirements
It was requested that the program
be regarded as satisfying: (1) the
reading and composition requirement.
(2) the humanities breadth require
ment, (3) the social science breadth
requirement, and (4) (in this particu
lar case), the American history and
institutions requirement.
It is expected that the student would
take foreign language as his outside
course until he has satisfied the lan
guage requirement. And it is also ex
pected that the science requirement
would be satisfied in his junior or
senior year.
Not Honors Program
Tussman emphasized that this is

nut an honors program. It is to be a
coeducational and fairly representa
tive experiment. Students who have
been admitted to Berkeley as fresh
men will be invited to apply for ad
mission to the program and the selec
tion will be made by mid-August of
each year.
Members of the tutorial staff, ac
cording to the proposal, should be
placed on an 11-month basis to enable
them during each summer to study
and organize the program for the
following year. Apart from salaries of
the instructional staff, a building
would be needed to provide a con
genial common room, faculty offices,
conference and seminar rooms, a li
brary room and student studies or
cubicles.
The faculty of the College of Let
ters and Science at the University of
California at Berkeley recently adopt
ed a plan to ensure that the creative
and critical discussion of ideas re
mains the very life of the university.
The principal inspiration for the
plan, called the "Tussman Proposal,"
was a paragraph once written by
former Chancellor Edward VV. Strong,
lie wrote,
An institution dedicated to inquiry
will create a tension between itself
and the larger community by the
new ideas it advances and by its
critical examination of ideas inher
ited. Ideas live in their dissemina
tion from mind to mind; ideas die
when this vital transmission ceases.

The Proposal, introduced by Pro
fessor of Philosophy, Joseph Tussman,
on March 4, 1965, was for a special
college program to he offered under
the authority of the College of Letters
and Science, Berkeley.
Proposed Two-Year Program
The basis of this program is the
belief that the "course," which is gen
erally the standard unit of educational
organization, is not the only unit out
of which a coherent educational pro
gram can be developed. What was
proposed was a two-year program,
each semester organized around a
central theme. For the first, or pilot
group, each semester is to be devoted
to the study of a significant crisis of
Western culture: First, Greece in
volved in the Peloponnesian Wars;

second, England during the Puritan
revolution (through Cromwell); third,
America's adopting the Federal Con
stitution; fourth, contemporary Amer
ica grappling with a major problem
(i.e., race).
Each period presents problems of
significance and contemporary rele
vance and is rich in a wide variety
of material. While the staff will be
drawn from a variety of "disciplines"
its approach will be "non disciplinary"
rather than "inter-disciplinary."
Designed For Frosh
The program is designed for a lim
ited number of students, entering
freshmen, for whom it. constitutes,
except for one additional course each
semester, a full prognun. A student
is expected to take the two year pro

gram and to gain upper division stand
ing upon its completion. The staff
consists generally of regular members
of the faculty on leave from their
departments for one or two years, and
participation in this program consti
tutes ;i full load. The proposal's aim
was five faculty and 150 students for
the pilot program, which began Sep
tember 1965.
The program combines private tu
torial, small-group tutorial, seminar
and lecture. Students submit papers
at least once every two weeks. Ac
cording to Tussman's plan, formal
"contact" with the tutorial staff in
seminars, tutorials and lectures should
approximate eight to 10 hours each
week. The reading, writing and dis

12 units of academic credit each
