# WOMEN HIRED
## Negro Men Losing Job Race 
### 
As if their problems weren't
great enough, Negro men are
losing a wage-and-job battle to
Negro women, a survey by a
visiting Stanford sociologist re
veals.
Given the same level of educa
tion, Negro women were obtain
ing employment at a relatively
faster rate than men and sus
tained a more rapid proportion
ate increase in income between
1939 and 1959, Prof. St. Clair
Drake, a faculty member at
Roosevelt University in Chicago,
says in an article published in
a special issue in the magazine,
"Daedalus," devoted to the Ne
gro in America. The situation
has not changed during the past
six years, he adds.
"Both income distribution and
the occupational structure func
tion to reinforce the number of
families without fathers, and to
lower the prestige of Negro
males vis-a-vis their mates, pros
pective mates and children.
Thus a pattern of male insecur
ity which originated under slav

ery persists into the present,"
Prof. Drake comments.
Slow Negro Male.
If conditions remain as they
are, it will take the Negro male
twice as long to catch up to the
white male economically as it
will take female Negroes to
catch up with their white coun
terparts, he notes.
"An impressive body of evi
dence indicates that rather ser
ious personality distortions re
sult from the female dominance
so prevalent in the Negro .sub
culture, since the general norms
of the larger society stress the
opposite pattern as more desir
able."
Though getting an education
"pays off" for Negroes as it
does for all other Americans,
"education has not yet raised
earning power to the level of
whites with equivalent train
ing," Prof. Drake adds.
Socio-Economic SI inly
In his exhaustive study of the
Negro's social and economic
status, Prof. Drake summarizes
the Negro's victimization, and
observes: If anything is ever
done to change the Negro's stat
us as a sort of unassimilable
lump in the midst of the Ameri
can middle class, " it is not like
ly to be the result of any cata
clysmic proletarian upheaval,
but rather through piecemeal
and pragmatic decisions," prob
ably by joint governmental and
private planning agencies.
Prof. Drake emphasizes the
strength of "Black Nationalist"
sentiments in large urban
ghettos by quoting a Chicago

Negno leader who said: "Let all
of the white people flee to the
suburbs. We'll show them that
the black man can run the sec
ond largest city in America bel
ter than the white man ... If
any of them want to come back
and integrate with us, we'll ac
cept them.'
Prof. Drake notes that "the
basic problems of the next de
cade will bo how to change the
'Black Ghettos' into relatively
stable and attractive 'colored
communities,' " for he feels that
these so-called "Black Belts"
will increase in size during the
same period rather than de
crease. Prof. Drake believes that
"even if a race-free market (for

homes) were to appear, Negroes
would remain segregated unless
drastic changes took place in the
job ceiling and income gap.
"Negroes do not depress prop
erty values, but middle-class
white attitudes toward the Ne
gro do," Prof. Drake writes. "As
long as Negroes as a group are
a symbol of lower social status,
proximity to them will be con
sidered undesirable and these
social attitudes will be reflected
in the market place.
"And,"he concedes, "the prob
lem is complicated by the fact
that a very high proportion of
Negro-Americans actually dors
have lower-class attributes and
behavior patterns . . ."

In his exhaustive study of the
Negro's social and economic
status, Prof. Drake summarizes
the Negro's victimization, and
observes: If anything is ever
done to change the Negro's stat
us as a sort of unassimilable
lump in the midst of the Ameri
can middle class, " it is not like
ly to be the result of any cata
clysmic proletarian upheaval,
but rather through piecemeal
and pragmatic decisions," prob
ably by joint governmental and
private planning agencies.
Prof. Drake emphasizes the
strength of "Black Nationalist"
sentiments in large urban
ghettos by quoting a Chicago

Negno leader who said: "Let all
of the white people flee to the
suburbs. We'll show them that
the black man can run the sec
ond largest city in America bel
ter than the white man ... If
any of them want to come back
and integrate with us, we'll ac
cept them.'
Prof. Drake notes that "the
basic problems of the next de
cade will bo how to change the
'Black Ghettos' into relatively
stable and attractive 'colored
communities,' " for he feels that
these so-called "Black Belts"
will increase in size during the
same period rather than de
crease. Prof. Drake believes that
"even if a race-free market (for

homes) were to appear, Negroes
would remain segregated unless
drastic changes took place in the
job ceiling and income gap.
"Negroes do not depress prop
erty values, but middle-class
white attitudes toward the Ne
gro do," Prof. Drake writes. "As
long as Negroes as a group are
a symbol of lower social status,
proximity to them will be con
sidered undesirable and these
social attitudes will be reflected
in the market place.
"And,"he concedes, "the prob
lem is complicated by the fact
that a very high proportion of
Negro-Americans actually dors
have lower-class attributes and
behavior patterns . . ."
As if their problems weren't
great enough, Negro men are
losing a wage-and-job battle to
Negro women, a survey by a
visiting Stanford sociologist re
veals.
Given the same level of educa
tion, Negro women were obtain
ing employment at a relatively
faster rate than men and sus
tained a more rapid proportion
ate increase in income between
1939 and 1959, Prof. St. Clair
Drake, a faculty member at
Roosevelt University in Chicago,
says in an article published in
a special issue in the magazine,
"Daedalus," devoted to the Ne
gro in America. The situation
has not changed during the past
six years, he adds.
"Both income distribution and
the occupational structure func
tion to reinforce the number of
families without fathers, and to
lower the prestige of Negro
males vis-a-vis their mates, pros
pective mates and children.
Thus a pattern of male insecur
ity which originated under slav

ery persists into the present,"
Prof. Drake comments.
Slow Negro Male.
If conditions remain as they
are, it will take the Negro male
twice as long to catch up to the
white male economically as it
will take female Negroes to
catch up with their white coun
terparts, he notes.
"An impressive body of evi
dence indicates that rather ser
ious personality distortions re
sult from the female dominance
so prevalent in the Negro .sub
culture, since the general norms
of the larger society stress the
opposite pattern as more desir
able."
Though getting an education
"pays off" for Negroes as it
does for all other Americans,
"education has not yet raised
earning power to the level of
whites with equivalent train
ing," Prof. Drake adds.
