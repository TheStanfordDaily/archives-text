# Hoover Institution Uses Computer Aid
## 
### 
The Hoover Institution has
called upon the electronic age
for help in cataloguing some of
its oceans of historical informa
tion.
Already tested out successful
ly with the help of Stanford's
computers is material from the
late Herbert Hoover's volumi
nous files of the American Re
lief Administration.
The project is in charge of
the Hoover Archivist, Mrs. Rita
Campbell, wife of Institution Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell.
Economics Doctorate
Holder of a doctorate in eco
nomics from Radcliffe-Harvard

and a degree in library science
from Simmons College in Bos
ton, Mrs. Campbell was aided by
the Stanford Computation Cen
ter and IBM in programming
the computer for the desired
results.
Mrs. Campbell was faced with
the problem of how to organize
a gold mine of material for
scholars and researchers, some
roughly compiled in broad cate
gories. many with no indexing or
any arrangement at all.
It should be explained that
archival material consists of pa
pers, diaries, letters, telegrams,
pamphlets, even office memos
which can't bo classified and in
dexed like a printed volume.
Retrieval Test
Mrs. Campbell ran her first
retrieval test on the files of the
American Relief Administration,
setting, up five different types
of key-word lists for 50 kinds of
material: cablegrams, contracts,
diaries, letters, maps, photo
graphs. press releases, statistical
tables, financial records, and the
like.
The five key-word classifica
tions included computer coding
for (1) form or type of docu
ment, (2) subject — "armistice,
blockade, Bolshevism," etc., (3)
geographical place-names, (4)
corporate and (5) personal
names.
After the lengthy clerical proc
essing, indexing and cross-check
ing of the minutiae of a collec
tion is done, the bibliography is
submitted to the computer's
memory drum via the customary
punch-card method.
Mrs. Campbell envisions the
day, if funds can be obtained,
when the Hoover Institution can
ask the computer a question and
receive a print-out answer by re
mote control, instead of making
a three-quarter mile journey
across the campus with a pile
of material during the odd hours
when the Computer Center has
some free time to spare.

The five key-word classifica
tions included computer coding
for (1) form or type of docu
ment, (2) subject — "armistice,
blockade, Bolshevism," etc., (3)
geographical place-names, (4)
corporate and (5) personal
names.
After the lengthy clerical proc
essing, indexing and cross-check
ing of the minutiae of a collec

submitted to the computer's
memory drum via the customary
punch-card method.
Mrs. Campbell envisions the
day, if funds can be obtained,
when the Hoover Institution can
ask the computer a question and
receive a print-out answer by re
mote control, instead of making
a three-quarter mile journey
across the campus with a pile
of material during the odd hours
when the Computer Center has
some free time to spare.
The Hoover Institution has
called upon the electronic age
for help in cataloguing some of
its oceans of historical informa
tion.
Already tested out successful
ly with the help of Stanford's
computers is material from the
late Herbert Hoover's volumi
nous files of the American Re
lief Administration.
The project is in charge of
the Hoover Archivist, Mrs. Rita
Campbell, wife of Institution Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell.
Economics Doctorate
Holder of a doctorate in eco
nomics from Radcliffe-Harvard

and a degree in library science
from Simmons College in Bos
ton, Mrs. Campbell was aided by
the Stanford Computation Cen
ter and IBM in programming
the computer for the desired
results.
Mrs. Campbell was faced with
the problem of how to organize
a gold mine of material for
scholars and researchers, some
roughly compiled in broad cate
gories. many with no indexing or
any arrangement at all.
It should be explained that
archival material consists of pa
pers, diaries, letters, telegrams,
pamphlets, even office memos
which can't bo classified and in
dexed like a printed volume.
Retrieval Test
Mrs. Campbell ran her first
retrieval test on the files of the
American Relief Administration,
setting, up five different types
of key-word lists for 50 kinds of
material: cablegrams, contracts,
diaries, letters, maps, photo
graphs. press releases, statistical
tables, financial records, and the
like.
