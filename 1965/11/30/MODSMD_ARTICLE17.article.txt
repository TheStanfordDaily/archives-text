# New Stanford Accelerator
## 
### 
A now high-energy accelerator
being developed by a group of
Stanford University physicists
holds promise of becorrting the
most powerful, efficient, and
versatile atom smasher the
world has ever seen.
Successful operation of the
first four-inch, superconducting
linear accelerator section was
announced by Prof. H. Alan
Schwettman at a recent interna
tional accelerator conference in
Italy.
His associates in the research
are Dr. Perry B. Wilson, associ
ate director of Stanford's High
Energy Physics Laboratory, and
Prof. William M. Fairbank. Grad
uate students L. Michael Axford,
John M. Pierce, and John P.
Turneaure assisted in the work.
At the conference their an
nouncement was cited as one of
the most important indicators
for the future of high-energy
physics. It climaxed more than
four years of study and research
sponsored by the U.S. Office of
Naval Research. A short account
of the work appears in the cur
rent Scientific American maga
zine.
The new superconducting ac
celerator is similar in design to
Stanford's well-known "linaes,"
or linear electron accelerators,
largest of which is a two-mile
machine now under construction.
Such accelerators are used to
bombard atomic nuclei in efforts
to learn more about the funda
mental structure and character
istics of matter.
Advantages
If it can be developed to its
theoretical potential, the new ac
celerator would easily out-per
form its Stanford predecessors
as well as many machines else
where. For example:
• The superconducting linear
accelerator's "duty cycle" would
he 1,000 times longer than those
of present linaes. High-energy
electrons would pour out in a
continuous stream instead of in
short spurts as in conventional
linaes. In certain experiments
the chances of seeing particle
collisions or nuclear events
would l)c 1,000 greater.
• It could generate several
times the energy of present lin
aes for a given length. Higher
energy means increased ability
to penetrate the nucleus and to
cause particle reactions.
• These higher-energy elec
trons also would have better
"resolution," or sameness of en
ergy among different electrons
an always sought-after quality
in accelerators, particularly by
scientists trying to make com
parisons of particle reactions.
• The superconducting tech
nique could be applied to a great

variety of high-energy devices,
including a proton linear accel
erator. synchrotrons, particle
separators, and other apparatus.
Future Plans
But these spectacular poten
tialities of the new accelerator
have still to be realized, the Stan
ford scientists emphasized. They
have proved that a supercon
ducting linac is feasible, and now
they hope to build one big enough
to do nuclear research a pilot
machine of a billion or so elec
tion volts.
This may take five years or
more, they added, and many
problems remain to bo worked
out. However, the work may
lead eventually to modifications
and improvements in other large
accelerators throughout the
world.
For years accelerator builders
have pondered how to lake ad
vantage of "superconductivity,"
or the strange disappearance of
electrical resistance in certain
metals cooled to near absolute
zero (-459 <, F). Until now, all at
tempts to harness ii for accel
erating particles had failed.
How It Was Done
The Stanford investigators
fashioned a cylindrical copper
cavity, four inches long and 3 1 .*
inches in diameter, filled with
disks about one inch apart. A
one-inch hole through the center
of each disk allows passage of
electrons through the cavity.
Inside surfaces of the cavity
are coated with lead, normally a
poor conductor, but a supercon
ductor at near-absolute-zero tem
peratures. A practical accelera
tor requires that the lead-coated
cavity have a "Q' value of at
least one billion—"Q" being a
measure of conductivity.
At a temperature of I.B° above
absolute zero, the Stanford
group has achieved a "Q" of five
billion in one cavity. That is 100
times higher than anyone had
ever achieved and about 100,000
times better than the "Q" of
copper at room temperature.
The superconducting cavity al
ready has demonstrated its abil
ity to accelerate electrons at a
rate of 1 Mev (million electron
volts) pei' foot, or about the
maximum obtained in present
linacs. Theoretically, said the
Stanford physicists, the lead
coated cavity should give 10 Mev
per foot.
Since their invention here in
the late 1940'5, the Stanford lin
ear accelerators have made im
portant contributions to our
knowledge of the nucleus. One
such contribution was the pre
cise measurement of the neutron
and proton, which won the 1901
Nobel Prize for Prof. Robert
Hofstadter.

in accelerators, particularly by
scientists trying to make com
parisons of particle reactions.
• The superconducting tech
nique could be applied to a great

variety of high-energy devices,
including a proton linear accel
erator. synchrotrons, particle
separators, and other apparatus.
Future Plans
But these spectacular poten
tialities of the new accelerator
have still to be realized, the Stan
ford scientists emphasized. They
have proved that a supercon
ducting linac is feasible, and now
they hope to build one big enough
to do nuclear research a pilot
machine of a billion or so elec
tion volts.
This may take five years or
more, they added, and many
problems remain to bo worked
out. However, the work may
lead eventually to modifications
and improvements in other large
accelerators throughout the
world.
For years accelerator builders
have pondered how to lake ad
vantage of "superconductivity,"
or the strange disappearance of
electrical resistance in certain
metals cooled to near absolute
zero (-459 <, F). Until now, all at
tempts to harness ii for accel
erating particles had failed.
How It Was Done
The Stanford investigators
fashioned a cylindrical copper
cavity, four inches long and 3 1 .*
inches in diameter, filled with
disks about one inch apart. A
one-inch hole through the center
of each disk allows passage of
electrons through the cavity.
Inside surfaces of the cavity
are coated with lead, normally a
poor conductor, but a supercon
ductor at near-absolute-zero tem
peratures. A practical accelera
tor requires that the lead-coated
cavity have a "Q' value of at
least one billion—"Q" being a
measure of conductivity.
At a temperature of I.B° above
absolute zero, the Stanford
group has achieved a "Q" of five
billion in one cavity. That is 100
times higher than anyone had
ever achieved and about 100,000
times better than the "Q" of
copper at room temperature.
The superconducting cavity al
ready has demonstrated its abil
ity to accelerate electrons at a
rate of 1 Mev (million electron
volts) pei' foot, or about the
maximum obtained in present
linacs. Theoretically, said the
Stanford physicists, the lead
coated cavity should give 10 Mev
per foot.
Since their invention here in
the late 1940'5, the Stanford lin
ear accelerators have made im
portant contributions to our
knowledge of the nucleus. One
such contribution was the pre
cise measurement of the neutron
and proton, which won the 1901
Nobel Prize for Prof. Robert
Hofstadter.
A now high-energy accelerator
being developed by a group of
Stanford University physicists
holds promise of becorrting the
most powerful, efficient, and
versatile atom smasher the
world has ever seen.
Successful operation of the
first four-inch, superconducting
linear accelerator section was
announced by Prof. H. Alan
Schwettman at a recent interna
tional accelerator conference in
Italy.
His associates in the research
are Dr. Perry B. Wilson, associ
ate director of Stanford's High
Energy Physics Laboratory, and
Prof. William M. Fairbank. Grad
uate students L. Michael Axford,
John M. Pierce, and John P.
Turneaure assisted in the work.
At the conference their an
nouncement was cited as one of
the most important indicators
for the future of high-energy
physics. It climaxed more than
four years of study and research
sponsored by the U.S. Office of
Naval Research. A short account
of the work appears in the cur
rent Scientific American maga
zine.
The new superconducting ac
celerator is similar in design to
Stanford's well-known "linaes,"
or linear electron accelerators,
largest of which is a two-mile
machine now under construction.
Such accelerators are used to
bombard atomic nuclei in efforts
to learn more about the funda
mental structure and character
istics of matter.
Advantages
If it can be developed to its
theoretical potential, the new ac
celerator would easily out-per
form its Stanford predecessors
as well as many machines else
where. For example:
• The superconducting linear
accelerator's "duty cycle" would
he 1,000 times longer than those
of present linaes. High-energy
electrons would pour out in a
continuous stream instead of in
short spurts as in conventional
linaes. In certain experiments
the chances of seeing particle
collisions or nuclear events
would l)c 1,000 greater.
• It could generate several
times the energy of present lin
aes for a given length. Higher
energy means increased ability
to penetrate the nucleus and to
cause particle reactions.
• These higher-energy elec
trons also would have better
"resolution," or sameness of en
ergy among different electrons

rate of 1 Mev (million electron
volts) pei' foot, or about the
maximum obtained in present
linacs. Theoretically, said the
Stanford physicists, the lead
coated cavity should give 10 Mev
per foot.
Since their invention here in
the late 1940'5, the Stanford lin
ear accelerators have made im
portant contributions to our
knowledge of the nucleus. One
such contribution was the pre
cise measurement of the neutron
and proton, which won the 1901
Nobel Prize for Prof. Robert
Hofstadter.
A now high-energy accelerator
being developed by a group of
Stanford University physicists
holds promise of becorrting the
most powerful, efficient, and
versatile atom smasher the
world has ever seen.
Successful operation of the
first four-inch, superconducting
linear accelerator section was
announced by Prof. H. Alan
Schwettman at a recent interna
tional accelerator conference in
Italy.
His associates in the research
are Dr. Perry B. Wilson, associ
ate director of Stanford's High
Energy Physics Laboratory, and
Prof. William M. Fairbank. Grad
uate students L. Michael Axford,
John M. Pierce, and John P.
Turneaure assisted in the work.
At the conference their an
nouncement was cited as one of
the most important indicators
for the future of high-energy
physics. It climaxed more than
four years of study and research
sponsored by the U.S. Office of
Naval Research. A short account
of the work appears in the cur
rent Scientific American maga
zine.
The new superconducting ac
celerator is similar in design to
Stanford's well-known "linaes,"
or linear electron accelerators,
largest of which is a two-mile
machine now under construction.
Such accelerators are used to
bombard atomic nuclei in efforts
to learn more about the funda
mental structure and character
istics of matter.
Advantages
If it can be developed to its
theoretical potential, the new ac
celerator would easily out-per
form its Stanford predecessors
as well as many machines else
where. For example:
• The superconducting linear
accelerator's "duty cycle" would
he 1,000 times longer than those
of present linaes. High-energy
electrons would pour out in a
continuous stream instead of in
short spurts as in conventional
linaes. In certain experiments
the chances of seeing particle
collisions or nuclear events
would l)c 1,000 greater.
• It could generate several
times the energy of present lin
aes for a given length. Higher
energy means increased ability
to penetrate the nucleus and to
cause particle reactions.
• These higher-energy elec
trons also would have better
"resolution," or sameness of en
ergy among different electrons
an always sought-after quality
in accelerators, particularly by
scientists trying to make com
parisons of particle reactions.
• The superconducting tech
nique could be applied to a great

variety of high-energy devices,
including a proton linear accel
erator. synchrotrons, particle
separators, and other apparatus.
Future Plans
But these spectacular poten
tialities of the new accelerator
have still to be realized, the Stan
ford scientists emphasized. They
have proved that a supercon
ducting linac is feasible, and now
they hope to build one big enough
to do nuclear research a pilot
machine of a billion or so elec
tion volts.
This may take five years or
more, they added, and many
problems remain to bo worked
out. However, the work may
lead eventually to modifications
and improvements in other large
accelerators throughout the
world.
For years accelerator builders
have pondered how to lake ad
vantage of "superconductivity,"
or the strange disappearance of
electrical resistance in certain
metals cooled to near absolute
zero (-459 <, F). Until now, all at
tempts to harness ii for accel
erating particles had failed.
How It Was Done
The Stanford investigators
fashioned a cylindrical copper
cavity, four inches long and 3 1 .*
inches in diameter, filled with
disks about one inch apart. A
one-inch hole through the center
of each disk allows passage of
electrons through the cavity.
Inside surfaces of the cavity
are coated with lead, normally a
poor conductor, but a supercon
ductor at near-absolute-zero tem
peratures. A practical accelera
tor requires that the lead-coated
cavity have a "Q' value of at
least one billion—"Q" being a
measure of conductivity.
At a temperature of I.B° above
absolute zero, the Stanford
group has achieved a "Q" of five
billion in one cavity. That is 100
times higher than anyone had
ever achieved and about 100,000
times better than the "Q" of
copper at room temperature.

ready has demonstrated its abil
ity to accelerate electrons at a
rate of 1 Mev (million electron

linacs. Theoretically, said the
