# Cockeyed College Editors With Mighty Typewriters
## 
### 
"Being editor of a college
newspaper is like driving down
the highway with one headlight
burned out — everyone knows
you're cockeyed except you. Not.
only does the college editor be
lieve his pen is mightier than
the proverbial sword, he is con
vinced it's more powerful than
the dean of men, more popular
than the captain of the football
team and—above all- more far
seeing than the university presi
dent."
This statement is from the
Dallas Morning News, part of a
column by Mike Engleman, him
self a former college editor, in
which he writes about a forth
coming study of publications at
the University of Texas.
University Regents have au
thorized the study, which will in
clude the campus newspaper, the
Daily Texan. The Daily Texan
does not enjoy editorial freedom.
"The college editor must prod
an unconcerned administration
into getting the chug holes in the
campus streets patched. He must

expose the brutal tactics of the
campus police who insist on tick
eting automobiles parked in fire
lanes.
"He cannot allow any hot
story to escape public attention,
including the one about the pro
fessor who was seen in a night
club with a blonde.
"Not only is ho charged with
the sacred responsibility of pub
licallv advising the school's pres
ident, he must also give public
counsel to the President of the
United States."
And what does he get in re
turn for this spirited public serv
ice? Nothing, according to En
gleman. The president of the
school attacks him for any pro
posals. The student council
threatens to cut off his funds.
He is expected to edit an uiv
wieldly letter concerning the en
tire subject of mankind. And the
chug hole never gets filled.
Another Solution
President Willis Tate of SMU
does and has allowed complete
freedom to his editors. At SMU

student-written editorials and
news stories are not censored by
faculty or administration. From
the student editor's point of view
President Tate would bo an asset
to the newly appointed commit
tee.
Tate thinks the answer to the
problem of the college editor is
to let him be his own boss. "Aft
er spending an exhausting year
advising everybody on every
thing, he usually grows up to
be a newspaperman—at which
time he learns quickly that he
doesn't know very much at all."
