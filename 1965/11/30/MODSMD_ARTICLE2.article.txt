• Council May Be The Last
Roman Catholicism's self-renewal
described by Pope Paul VI as an
"astonishing phenomenon" —is far
from fully accomplished.
A survey of the work done in coun
cil by the Roman Catholic Church's
2,300 bishops points to a long period
of transition, possibly lasting a decade
or more and involving countless re
forms in thinking, organization, wor
ship and practice.
The council's record of accomplish
ment ranks it high among the 21
Church councils held over the past
2,000 years.
Many bishops are convinced that it
is the last ecumenical council the
Roman Catholic Church will ever have,
since it attempted to establish ma
chinery for continual updating in
future years.
