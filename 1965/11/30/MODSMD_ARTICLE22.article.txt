## Glancing Back At Stanford Football 
### John Calmore 
Some will say that Stanford's
6-3-1 football record is a disap
pointing ono considering what
was expected and predicted be
fore the season began. Hut let
us remember that two of the
defeats were at the hands of a
team ranked in the national top
ten. Not too long ago we could
have said any ten.
Let's face it, Stanford's recent
football history is sad. Of course,
in 19.11, we were 9-1, losing only
to Cal. For our efforts Chuck
Taylor was named Coach of the
Year. Also, we had the dubious
honor of playing Illinois in the
Rose Bowl. The score was 40-7.
I'll give you three guesses as to
who won. plus the hint that it
wasn't us.
Since 19.17, however, there has
been little glory produced by our
heroics on the gridiron. With all
the boldness of Mr. Peepers, our
offense often centered around an
attack that was as exciting as
a one-color painting, and as def
inite as a Rorschach ink-blot.
Phone Book More Interest inp
I wouldn't say our play was
dull, but an in-depth study of
page 409 of the Schenectady
phone book would have attract
ed more fans. Or any page for
that matter. Living up to tradi
tion was killing us. No matter
how badly we lost, everyone
knew that the worst was yet to
come—i.e.. the next game.
As true as it is corny, Stan
ford couldn't beat an egg. Our
coaches dreamed of the day
when there wouldn't be any re
turning lettermen. Stanford's
chance for a bowl appearance
was to shoot for the GE College
Bowl. Like on television, every
Indian victory was an upset. We
baffled everyone but our oppo
nents.
An alleged conversation be.
tween a couple of perceptive
freshmen summed up Stanford's
problem thusly: "They lose ev
ery week," said one. "That's be
cause they play every week,"
replied the other.
Not Even Good
Things got so bad that even
the Daily had a few things to
say about the situation. A 1959
Sports Editorial claimed that the
season "could hardly be called
a great one . . . and a 3-7 record
doesn't even offer much justifi
cation for calling it a good ono."
In 1960 our high-powered grid
machine stalled a bit. Still it
managed to chalk up an 0-10
record. This prompted the Daily
editorial page to offer this solu
tion: "Because we can't beat
teams with lower entrance re
quirements— hence fielding fast
er and bigger gridders — we
should de-emphasize football on
the Farm and play teams of San

Francisco State, San Jose State,
etc. calibre." I presume since
Stanford lost to San Jose that
year, 34-20, the theory was
sacked.
After the '62 campaign, for
want of a team the coach was
lost. Jack Curtice said good-by
to Stanford and vice versa. The
Daily of November 29, quoting
a diplomatic Chuck Taylor, stat
ed, "Under different circum
stances, Jack might well have
been a winner at Stanford."
Curtice Ami Custer
I don't want to take anything
away from Coach Curtice, but
under different circumstances
Custer might well have been a
winner at the Little Big Horn.
There is a subtle relevance here.
And 1 don't mean Sitting Bull's
being an Indian.
Curtice has to his credit, how
ever, his initiating a sound pro
gram of recruitment. As this
year's champion freshman team
indicates, John Ralston does a
little recruiting himself. And
that's not all.
In his initial Stanford press
conference in January of 1963,
Ralston declared, "Stanford
strives for the best in all fields
of endeavor. As it is in academ
ics, it should be in athletics."
Perhaps brains and brawn was
to become more than an allitera
tion.
Expected To Win
Following the new coach's
first game, a 29-13 victory over
San Jose State, the Daily report
ed that "the dressing room was
quiet, with nobody yelling hap
pily. It was as though everyone
expected to win, in contrast to
recent seasons."
It is this winning spirit that
marks Ralston's Revolution. This
year's atmosphere has been per
meated by a will to win; some
thing which has been absent
here for too long a time. This
new enthusiasm has naiurally
carried over to the fans, causing
our premature expectations of
a trip to the Rose Bowl.
Granted these expectations
have been disappointed, but it is
significant that we even had
such expectations. It is also sig
nificant that while this year's
smell of roses has faded, many
of us are sensing the aroma of
next year's roses. And rightfully
so. At this point they are just
as much our roses as anyone
else's.
In past years such "prema
ture" sniffing would be frowned
upon. Meanwhile, Washington
and USC would make the Rose
Bowl a principle preoccupation,
thinking about it always and
playing in it about as often. I
hope we've caught the hint. Both
of them.

meated by a will to win; some
thing which has been absent
here for too long a time. This
new enthusiasm has naiurally
carried over to the fans, causing
our premature expectations of
a trip to the Rose Bowl.
Granted these expectations
have been disappointed, but it is
significant that we even had
such expectations. It is also sig
nificant that while this year's
smell of roses has faded, many
of us are sensing the aroma of
next year's roses. And rightfully
so. At this point they are just
as much our roses as anyone
else's.
In past years such "prema
ture" sniffing would be frowned
upon. Meanwhile, Washington
and USC would make the Rose
Bowl a principle preoccupation,
thinking about it always and
playing in it about as often. I
hope we've caught the hint. Both
of them.
Some will say that Stanford's
6-3-1 football record is a disap
pointing ono considering what
was expected and predicted be
fore the season began. Hut let
us remember that two of the
defeats were at the hands of a
team ranked in the national top
ten. Not too long ago we could
have said any ten.
Let's face it, Stanford's recent
football history is sad. Of course,
in 19.11, we were 9-1, losing only
to Cal. For our efforts Chuck
Taylor was named Coach of the
Year. Also, we had the dubious
honor of playing Illinois in the
Rose Bowl. The score was 40-7.
I'll give you three guesses as to
who won. plus the hint that it
wasn't us.
Since 19.17, however, there has
been little glory produced by our
heroics on the gridiron. With all
the boldness of Mr. Peepers, our
offense often centered around an
attack that was as exciting as
a one-color painting, and as def
inite as a Rorschach ink-blot.

I wouldn't say our play was
dull, but an in-depth study of

how badly we lost, everyone

As true as it is corny, Stan

coaches dreamed of the day

freshmen summed up Stanford's
problem thusly: "They lose ev

replied the other.
Not Even Good
Things got so bad that even
the Daily had a few things to
say about the situation. A 1959
Sports Editorial claimed that the
season "could hardly be called
a great one . . . and a 3-7 record
doesn't even offer much justifi
cation for calling it a good ono."
In 1960 our high-powered grid
machine stalled a bit. Still it
managed to chalk up an 0-10
record. This prompted the Daily
editorial page to offer this solu
tion: "Because we can't beat
teams with lower entrance re
quirements— hence fielding fast
er and bigger gridders — we
should de-emphasize football on
the Farm and play teams of San

Francisco State, San Jose State,
etc. calibre." I presume since
Stanford lost to San Jose that
year, 34-20, the theory was
sacked.
After the '62 campaign, for
want of a team the coach was
lost. Jack Curtice said good-by
to Stanford and vice versa. The
Daily of November 29, quoting
a diplomatic Chuck Taylor, stat
ed, "Under different circum
stances, Jack might well have
been a winner at Stanford."
Curtice Ami Custer
I don't want to take anything
away from Coach Curtice, but
under different circumstances
Custer might well have been a
winner at the Little Big Horn.
There is a subtle relevance here.
And 1 don't mean Sitting Bull's
being an Indian.
Curtice has to his credit, how
ever, his initiating a sound pro
gram of recruitment. As this
year's champion freshman team
indicates, John Ralston does a
little recruiting himself. And
that's not all.
In his initial Stanford press
conference in January of 1963,
Ralston declared, "Stanford
strives for the best in all fields
of endeavor. As it is in academ
ics, it should be in athletics."
Perhaps brains and brawn was
to become more than an allitera
tion.
Expected To Win
Following the new coach's
first game, a 29-13 victory over
San Jose State, the Daily report
ed that "the dressing room was
quiet, with nobody yelling hap
pily. It was as though everyone
expected to win, in contrast to
recent seasons."
It is this winning spirit that
marks Ralston's Revolution. This

gram of recruitment. As this
year's champion freshman team
indicates, John Ralston does a
little recruiting himself. And
that's not all.
In his initial Stanford press
conference in January of 1963,
Ralston declared, "Stanford
strives for the best in all fields
of endeavor. As it is in academ
ics, it should be in athletics."
Perhaps brains and brawn was
to become more than an allitera
tion.
Expected To Win
Following the new coach's
first game, a 29-13 victory over
San Jose State, the Daily report
ed that "the dressing room was
quiet, with nobody yelling hap
pily. It was as though everyone
expected to win, in contrast to
recent seasons."
It is this winning spirit that
marks Ralston's Revolution. This
year's atmosphere has been per
meated by a will to win; some
thing which has been absent
here for too long a time. This
new enthusiasm has naiurally
carried over to the fans, causing
our premature expectations of
a trip to the Rose Bowl.
Granted these expectations
have been disappointed, but it is
significant that we even had
such expectations. It is also sig
nificant that while this year's
smell of roses has faded, many
of us are sensing the aroma of
next year's roses. And rightfully
so. At this point they are just
as much our roses as anyone
else's.
In past years such "prema
ture" sniffing would be frowned
upon. Meanwhile, Washington
and USC would make the Rose
Bowl a principle preoccupation,
thinking about it always and
playing in it about as often. I
hope we've caught the hint. Both
of them.
Some will say that Stanford's
6-3-1 football record is a disap
pointing ono considering what
was expected and predicted be
fore the season began. Hut let
us remember that two of the
defeats were at the hands of a
team ranked in the national top
ten. Not too long ago we could
have said any ten.
Let's face it, Stanford's recent
football history is sad. Of course,
in 19.11, we were 9-1, losing only
to Cal. For our efforts Chuck
Taylor was named Coach of the
Year. Also, we had the dubious
honor of playing Illinois in the
Rose Bowl. The score was 40-7.
I'll give you three guesses as to
who won. plus the hint that it
wasn't us.
Since 19.17, however, there has
been little glory produced by our
heroics on the gridiron. With all
the boldness of Mr. Peepers, our
offense often centered around an
attack that was as exciting as
a one-color painting, and as def
inite as a Rorschach ink-blot.
Phone Book More Interest inp
I wouldn't say our play was
dull, but an in-depth study of
page 409 of the Schenectady
phone book would have attract
ed more fans. Or any page for
that matter. Living up to tradi
tion was killing us. No matter
how badly we lost, everyone
knew that the worst was yet to
come—i.e.. the next game.
As true as it is corny, Stan
ford couldn't beat an egg. Our
coaches dreamed of the day
when there wouldn't be any re
turning lettermen. Stanford's
chance for a bowl appearance
was to shoot for the GE College
Bowl. Like on television, every
Indian victory was an upset. We
baffled everyone but our oppo
nents.
An alleged conversation be.
tween a couple of perceptive
freshmen summed up Stanford's
problem thusly: "They lose ev
ery week," said one. "That's be
cause they play every week,"
replied the other.
Not Even Good
Things got so bad that even
the Daily had a few things to
say about the situation. A 1959
Sports Editorial claimed that the
season "could hardly be called
a great one . . . and a 3-7 record
doesn't even offer much justifi
cation for calling it a good ono."
In 1960 our high-powered grid
machine stalled a bit. Still it
managed to chalk up an 0-10
record. This prompted the Daily
editorial page to offer this solu
tion: "Because we can't beat
teams with lower entrance re
quirements— hence fielding fast
er and bigger gridders — we
should de-emphasize football on
the Farm and play teams of San

Francisco State, San Jose State,
etc. calibre." I presume since
Stanford lost to San Jose that
year, 34-20, the theory was
sacked.
After the '62 campaign, for
want of a team the coach was
lost. Jack Curtice said good-by
to Stanford and vice versa. The
Daily of November 29, quoting
a diplomatic Chuck Taylor, stat
ed, "Under different circum
stances, Jack might well have
been a winner at Stanford."
Curtice Ami Custer
I don't want to take anything
away from Coach Curtice, but
under different circumstances
Custer might well have been a
winner at the Little Big Horn.
There is a subtle relevance here.
And 1 don't mean Sitting Bull's
