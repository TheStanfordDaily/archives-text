# CAGE OUTLOOK
## UCLA Tough 
### 
AAWU basketball begins
Wednesday, December 1, with
all the earmarks of another ex
citing season. Stanford will open
its season at San Jose Civic Au
ditorium against the Santa Clara
Broncos. The only other games
to be played this quarter by
Stanford are against USF and
San Jose State.
As the season begins, however,
the team that is drawing the
most attention is UCLA. The
Bruins will bo going for an un
precedented third straight NCAA
championship. With five of last
year's trip seven players return
ing, the Bruins will be tough,
to be sure. They're headed by
Edgar Lacey, an All-American
possibility, Kenny Washington,
guard Freddie Goss, and centers
Mike Lynn and Doug Mcintosh.
In addition to meeting UCLA
twice, Stanford will play all oth
er conference teams once here
and once away. Intersectional
opponents will be Kansas State.
Nebraska, LSU, Arizona, and
Arizona State'.
Stanford has four returning
lettermen: Bob Bedell. All-
America candidate, Ray Kosan
ke, Jack Gilbert, and Mike Preis
ler. Two guards, Art Harris and
Gary Petersmeyer, should add 1
strength to the team after being '
frosh stars last year.
Season's Prospects
In Coach Howie Dallmar's 1
eyes, if the injury-prone Kosan
ke, a center can stay healthy,
Stanford should challenge for
top honors even though it lost
three starters and two other let- j
termon. Forward Bedell and Ko- \
sanke give such fine experienced
scoring potential and rebounding |
strength that they should over
come the inexperience elsewhere. ,
Forward Gilbert showed well
late in the year. Harris should j
be one of the AAWU's outstand-!
ing sophomores, while Peters- !
meyer is a fine playmaker. His !
lack of experience seems the <
only real drawback, plus, per
haps, a general lack of experi-!
once through the total squad. ■
That should be taken care of by
the time conference play gets
under way, and Stanford could
have a stronger team than a
year ago.
Last year Stanford st at-wise |
was third in offense behind
UCLA and USC, second in field
goals behind OSU, third in re-1
bounds behind USC and UCLA, |
and third in defense behind OSU
and UCLA.
Conference Outlook
Looking briefly at other con
ference teams, Oregon lias four j
starters back and a strong frosh

coming up. Sparkplugs for the
Ducks will be guards Nick Jones
and Jim Barnett. Oregon State
lost Jim Jarvis, but has eight
lettermen returning, topped by
two-year men Dave Fox, Scott
Eaton, and Rick Whelan. Wash
ington State could be an im
proved team, despite the loss of
the Conference's leading re
bounder. Ted Werner. Coming
up to the varsity are the players
who won 22 games last year
without a loss for the Cougar
frosh. Washington is rated a con
tender tliis year, largely on the
strength of the increased ma
turity of center Gordon Harris.
In California opponents the
Indians will have to face USC,
which lost just one man from
their third-place team of 196."5,
and Cal, which will be welcom
ing back nearly as many players
from its 19(vl team as from its
1965.
Always looming largo, how
ever, are the Bruins. But Indian
supporters were given a lift by
UCLA's varsity loss last week
end to their frosh team. This can
mean one of two things: either
UCLA is vulnerable this year, or
just forget about the next throe
seasons.

under way, and Stanford could
have a stronger team than a
year ago.
Last year Stanford st at-wise |
was third in offense behind
UCLA and USC, second in field
goals behind OSU, third in re-1
bounds behind USC and UCLA, |
and third in defense behind OSU
and UCLA.
Conference Outlook
Looking briefly at other con
ference teams, Oregon lias four j
starters back and a strong frosh

coming up. Sparkplugs for the
Ducks will be guards Nick Jones
and Jim Barnett. Oregon State
lost Jim Jarvis, but has eight
lettermen returning, topped by
two-year men Dave Fox, Scott
Eaton, and Rick Whelan. Wash
ington State could be an im
proved team, despite the loss of
the Conference's leading re
bounder. Ted Werner. Coming
up to the varsity are the players
who won 22 games last year
without a loss for the Cougar
frosh. Washington is rated a con
tender tliis year, largely on the
strength of the increased ma
turity of center Gordon Harris.
In California opponents the
Indians will have to face USC,
which lost just one man from
their third-place team of 196."5,
and Cal, which will be welcom
ing back nearly as many players
from its 19(vl team as from its
1965.
Always looming largo, how
ever, are the Bruins. But Indian
supporters were given a lift by
UCLA's varsity loss last week
end to their frosh team. This can
mean one of two things: either
UCLA is vulnerable this year, or
just forget about the next throe
seasons.
AAWU basketball begins
Wednesday, December 1, with
all the earmarks of another ex
citing season. Stanford will open
its season at San Jose Civic Au
ditorium against the Santa Clara
Broncos. The only other games
to be played this quarter by
Stanford are against USF and
San Jose State.
As the season begins, however,
the team that is drawing the
most attention is UCLA. The
Bruins will bo going for an un
precedented third straight NCAA
championship. With five of last
year's trip seven players return
ing, the Bruins will be tough,
to be sure. They're headed by
Edgar Lacey, an All-American
possibility, Kenny Washington,
guard Freddie Goss, and centers
Mike Lynn and Doug Mcintosh.
In addition to meeting UCLA
twice, Stanford will play all oth
er conference teams once here
and once away. Intersectional
opponents will be Kansas State.
Nebraska, LSU, Arizona, and
Arizona State'.
Stanford has four returning
lettermen: Bob Bedell. All-
America candidate, Ray Kosan
ke, Jack Gilbert, and Mike Preis
ler. Two guards, Art Harris and
Gary Petersmeyer, should add 1
strength to the team after being '
frosh stars last year.
Season's Prospects
In Coach Howie Dallmar's 1
eyes, if the injury-prone Kosan
ke, a center can stay healthy,
Stanford should challenge for
top honors even though it lost
three starters and two other let- j
termon. Forward Bedell and Ko- \
sanke give such fine experienced
scoring potential and rebounding |
strength that they should over
come the inexperience elsewhere. ,
Forward Gilbert showed well
late in the year. Harris should j
be one of the AAWU's outstand-!
ing sophomores, while Peters- !
meyer is a fine playmaker. His !
lack of experience seems the <
only real drawback, plus, per
haps, a general lack of experi-!
once through the total squad. ■
That should be taken care of by
the time conference play gets
under way, and Stanford could
have a stronger team than a
year ago.
