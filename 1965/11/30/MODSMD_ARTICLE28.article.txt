# Who'll Park Where At What Cost To Whom?
## 
### 
Careful analysis of road and parking prob
lems at Stanford shows a complexity of eco
nomic, development, and planning factors that
offer no easy answer. On the one hand, students
and staff expect convenience in parking facili
ties and well-surfaced roadways. On the other
hand, the University must give priority to fund
and land use for its central academic work.
Authority for studying and recommending
changes in highway programs has been vested
in a student-faculty-staff committee. This com
mittee has done a commendable job in its work
so far, and often students and staff members
have not taken full advantage of the committee
to help solve individual problems.
Two basic areas have been neglected by the
committee, however, and hopefully these issues
will be considered shortly. The first involves
the fact that students pay a -Sio registration fee
while faculty and staff park in choice locations
at no cost. Comparison of income from the stu
dent fees with annual expenses for road main
tenance. and construction demonstrates that tha
student fees are being properly used.
Vet the student fee is justified solely on the
grounds that those w ho benefit most from traf
fic facilities should help pay the costs. If land
and financial resources are at such a premium
now, the privilege of faculty and staff free
parking is too expensive to continue.
More important is the committees policy in
long-range planning. Considerable money is to
be spent in the next ten years on parking and

road facilities surrounding the central academic
area. Plans call for Campus Drive making a
circle around the campus with permanent
parking lots branching oft this drive.
While internal traffic congestion will be
alleviated by the plan, students and staff will
face a walk of a half-mile to a mile from their
car to their classes and offices. The planning
office justifies the obvious inconvenience of the
plan on the theory that people would prefer
this to having to pay for lots closer to the cen
tral Quad area.
But not having made any surveys as to how
much people are willing to pay for more con
venience, the planning office is making a rather
expensive assumption. It is quite possible that
students and staff would pay parking fees con
siderably higher than they pay now to be as
sured reserved space in more preferred areas.
Instead of cheap parking on the fringe of
the campus, it seems an alternative would be
construction of multi-level or underground
parking lots adjacent to the Quad. The perman
ent lots now planned are quite expensive to
construct and maintain. Perhaps a wiser in
vestment in the long run would be better de
signed and better located facilities balancing
service with cost.
At least the planning office and traffic com
mittee might explore this alternative more
carefully before proceeding with their present
program.

changes in highway programs has been vested
in a student-faculty-staff committee. This com
mittee has done a commendable job in its work
so far, and often students and staff members
have not taken full advantage of the committee
to help solve individual problems.
Two basic areas have been neglected by the
committee, however, and hopefully these issues
will be considered shortly. The first involves
the fact that students pay a -Sio registration fee
while faculty and staff park in choice locations
at no cost. Comparison of income from the stu
dent fees with annual expenses for road main
tenance. and construction demonstrates that tha
student fees are being properly used.
Vet the student fee is justified solely on the
grounds that those w ho benefit most from traf
fic facilities should help pay the costs. If land
and financial resources are at such a premium
now, the privilege of faculty and staff free
parking is too expensive to continue.
More important is the committees policy in
long-range planning. Considerable money is to
be spent in the next ten years on parking and

road facilities surrounding the central academic
area. Plans call for Campus Drive making a
circle around the campus with permanent
parking lots branching oft this drive.
While internal traffic congestion will be
alleviated by the plan, students and staff will
face a walk of a half-mile to a mile from their
car to their classes and offices. The planning
office justifies the obvious inconvenience of the
plan on the theory that people would prefer
this to having to pay for lots closer to the cen
tral Quad area.
But not having made any surveys as to how
much people are willing to pay for more con
venience, the planning office is making a rather
expensive assumption. It is quite possible that
students and staff would pay parking fees con
siderably higher than they pay now to be as
sured reserved space in more preferred areas.
Instead of cheap parking on the fringe of
the campus, it seems an alternative would be
construction of multi-level or underground
parking lots adjacent to the Quad. The perman
ent lots now planned are quite expensive to
construct and maintain. Perhaps a wiser in
vestment in the long run would be better de
signed and better located facilities balancing
service with cost.
At least the planning office and traffic com
mittee might explore this alternative more
carefully before proceeding with their present
program.

Careful analysis of road and parking prob
lems at Stanford shows a complexity of eco
nomic, development, and planning factors that
offer no easy answer. On the one hand, students
and staff expect convenience in parking facili
ties and well-surfaced roadways. On the other
hand, the University must give priority to fund
and land use for its central academic work.
