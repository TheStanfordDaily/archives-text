# Letters To The Editor
## CONSCIENCE Has None 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It appears Miss Merryman
has fallen under the spell of the
Committee On National Student
Citizenship In Every National
Case of Emergency. The Stan
ford Young Democrats is hardly
the "only YD club in the nation
wide chain" critical of the Viet
nam situation. YD's are too
localist, too unorganized nation
ally for anyone even with such
a reputation for accuracy as the
Stanford Daily's—to know the
stand of every club.
Among known stands, one
need only consider that of the
statewide California Federation
of Young Democrats to see the
absurdity of her statement.
When CONSCIENCE
in publicizing its delusions of
grandeur, candor compels me to
rattle another skeleton: When
CONSCIENCE was very young
I made it clear that the SYD's
had at that time taken no stand,
that if we did it would probably
be in opposition, and that there
fore I could not serve on their
executive board. Yet in its let
ter sent to California colleges
asking support, CONSCIENCE
claimed in baldest terms that
the president of the SYD's was
a major CONSCIENCE officer.
If this outright inversion of fact
may be projected into CON
SCIENCE'S nationwide claims
of support, the implications are.
to put it kindly, deflating.
It should be noted the na
tional co-chairmen have tried to
remain honest and fair; the sins
are those of intemperate under
lings who value statistics more
highly than (dare I say it?) con
science.

• Watkins Backs DKE
Drive
Editor, The Daily:
The DKEs deserve the thanks
of us all, it seems to me, for
their drive to collect paperbacks
to send to the servicemen in
Vietnam. Those among us who
remember the thumb-worn
"]>ocket-books" that passed from
hand to hand and foxhole to
foxhole until they disintegrated
in the wet and dirt of other
wars will know from grim ex
perience what the 5000 books
collected from us by the DKEs
for forwarding to Saigon will
mean to the men they reach. A
man can be as famished for
books as for bread, and in front
lines and forward areas he of
ten is.
There is a second reason, this
one closer home, for satisfaction
over the DKE drive. Il offered u>

an opportunity regardless of dis
cordant views about peace and
U.S. involvement in Vietnam
and blood for friend or foe to
unite in that best of American
traits, the generous gesture to
wards the less fortunate, in this
case the unknown Gl's. In
books for American 'teen-agers,
as most of there arc. this troub
led and divided comunity, re
fleeting a troubled and divided
country, could come together,
however briefly, in a common
and kindly cause. Thus as a by
product the drive served to pro
mote the larger cause of "good
neighborliness here at home, at
Stanford, where peace, like char
ity, must begin.
Both for tlie impact the paper
backs we sent will have upon our
men who receive them and for
the impact the joint gesture we
made will have upon those who
responded the DKEs have
earned the comunitv's thanks.

meyer's column on the "Death

of Union" in The Daily, Novem
ber 19. I would suggest he find
a copy of it posthaste (the Libe
keeps old Dailys). Mr. Kley
meyer combined the poetic and
the logical to give me a verbal
sock in the nose that is still
smarting. The day before I was
just another campus room
renter feeling sorry for the Un
ion women (but I had a mid
term to . . .). Today I realize
that this arbitrary residence
policy is a matter of great con

this punch lying down. Let's
stand up (in a reasonable and
rational, yet firm and persis
tent manner) and preserve the
