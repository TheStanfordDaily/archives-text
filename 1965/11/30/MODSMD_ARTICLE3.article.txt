# Union Girls Resigned To New Housing
## Disappointed With High-Rise Living 
### BOB EGELKO 
"We are disappointed about the lack
of rent subsidies and the ban on soph
omores at the high-rise, but we've ex
hausted all our resources," the presi
dent of Union Residence told The
Daily yesterday.
But, said senior Sheila McCarthy,
leader of the dispossessed Union girls,
"Considering that we finally have to
move, tlie administration's arrange
ments were about what we expected.
On the whole, we're satisfied."
Miss McCarthy's words came as an
estimated -10 Union juniors and sen
iors were preparing for their winter
quarter move to Hoskins Residence in
Eseondido Village. The remainder of
the Union girls face this Thursday's
housing draw, the results of which
may not be complete until Christmas.
Union Residence became the center
of campus-wide controversy ihis quar
ter following last spring's eviction no
tice from the Housing Office. Arguing
that the action, taken without consult
ing students, was arbitrary and con
trary to ihe concept of a residence
university, Union presidents and their
supporters sought to have it reversed
by direct petition to the administra
tion, and eventually by a LASSU
resolution.
However, the student-faculty-admin
istration Committee of Fifteen, to
which LASSU referred the Union
question, upheld the Housing Office's
decision, at the same time expressing
hopes for a smooth transition to Hos
kins Residenoe.
Renewed Union protests about the
lack of facilities in the high-rise have
led to a recent decision to install
phones and linen service at Hoskins.
However, hopes for an administra
tive subsidy that would reduce the
present rent of $I<SO per quarter (com
pared with $140 at Union) have not
been realized. Also, last year's regula
tion prohibiting sophomores, of which
Union has 24. at Ihe high-rise still
stands.
The 40 girls going to the high-rise
will take part of Union with them.
Miss McCarthy said. Much of Ihc fur
niture in the Union lounge and lobby
will appear in Hoskins next quarter.
