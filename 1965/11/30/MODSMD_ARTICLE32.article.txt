## John Lindsay's Remedies For Modern Megalopolis 
### Walter Lippmann 
As John Lindsay makes ready
to take over the mayoralty of
New York City, there is a gen
eral feeling that he has an im
possible task. New York, it is
said, is ungovernable. Its prob
lems are insoluble. Mr. Lindsay
is alone in a municipal govern
ment dominated by Democrats.
What needs to be done to
overeome congestion and pov
erty and delinquency, to educate
the children, to make medical
care adequate, to clean the pol
luted air and make up the de
pleted water supply will require
vast sums of money and a wide
and deep reconstruction of the
political system.
No matter how good a man
John Lindsay is, he cannot, we
are told, succeed in all this.
The Shallow View
My view is that all that will,
of course, be true if John Lind
say did not know better than
to take a shallow view of his
task. The shallow view would
be to suppose that he can deal
with the problems of the great
city by being somewhat more
energetic and somewhat more
resistant to pressure groups
than vcre his predecessors in
the citv hall. He would most
certainly fail if he were under
the illusion that all New York
needs is an untried mayor.
On the other hand, I do not
think John Lindsay can fail if
he takes a deep view of his task.
By a deep view I mean the con
ception of his task, indeed of
his mission, as an opportunity
to make a four-year demonstra
tion of what it will take to make
a modern urban conglomeration
livable.
He will have succeeded bril
liantly if in the course of four
years he has shown New York
and Albany and Washington
what kind of radical reform and
reconstruction is necessary.
Primarily, and above all, his
task is to find and to sponsor
the best remedies that the most
expert in urban affairs have to
recommend, to experiment with
these remedies and to keep on
explaining them, to conduct, in
effect, a great teach-in and sem
inar in the problems of the mod
ern American city. Nobody can
seriously expect him to solve all
the problems single-handedly
and on his own power. His op
portunity and his duty is to leaf!
a four-year course for urban
Americans in their self-educa
tion for self-government.
From Whence Cometh Change?
We know enough already
about the dimensions of the

problem to realize where some .
of the great changes will have j
to come.
Thus, the legal city of New I
York, which is governed from j
the city hall, is only a pare ofj
the real city. The real city in
fact lies in three states and com
prises many little cities, many
suburbs and myriads of villages, ]
The needs and interests of the j
urban conglomerations of our !
era have outgrown the political i
structures which come down to ;
them from a very different past.
We shall have to call persist- ;
ently for the initiation and crea- i
tion of regional political author
ities -smaller and more local- :
ized than the federal govern
ment, yet transcending state ;
lines and embracing the old
municipalities, counties and vil
lages. For it is proving to be
impossible to govern the great
city with antiquated political
jurisdictions.
It is also quite certain that
we shall have to work out a
fiscal system by which the cities
receive an increasing amount of
the money collected by the fed
eral government. The federal 1
revenue system is far more eff
icient than the local systems
can be. The federal system is so
efficient that it may soon be
producing more revenue than
the federal government on its
traditional activities can use
fully spend. Some of this rev
enue can then be spent in the
localities.
Reform In The Air
The idea for t his reform is i
already in the air. If, as we have
reason to hope, the modern econ 1
omy can be made to expand at
a reasonably stable rate, the
federal government may soon !
find it has a very large surplus. 1
Assuming, as we must nowa-1
days, that we do in fact have ,
the common sense not to escal- '<
ate ourselves into a total war.
the surplus federal revenue will
be very large. Our real problem
will not be how to pay for the
needs of the great cities, but j
how to spend the available'
money wisely.
In an environment of relative
peace and increasing affluence,
there is no reason whatever to
throw up our hands and say
that a city like New York is un
governable. Thus far, the great
cities have not really been gov
erned. They have been too busy
growing to think about being
governed. But now at last in the j
biggest of the great cities the |
way is open to a new beginning.

the city hall, is only a pare ofj
the real city. The real city in
fact lies in three states and com
prises many little cities, many
suburbs and myriads of villages, ]
The needs and interests of the j
urban conglomerations of our !
era have outgrown the political i
structures which come down to ;
them from a very different past.
We shall have to call persist- ;
ently for the initiation and crea- i
tion of regional political author
ities -smaller and more local- :
ized than the federal govern
ment, yet transcending state ;
lines and embracing the old
municipalities, counties and vil
lages. For it is proving to be
impossible to govern the great
city with antiquated political
jurisdictions.
It is also quite certain that
we shall have to work out a
fiscal system by which the cities
receive an increasing amount of
the money collected by the fed
eral government. The federal 1
revenue system is far more eff
icient than the local systems
can be. The federal system is so
efficient that it may soon be
producing more revenue than
the federal government on its
traditional activities can use
fully spend. Some of this rev
enue can then be spent in the
localities.
Reform In The Air
The idea for t his reform is i
already in the air. If, as we have
reason to hope, the modern econ 1
omy can be made to expand at
a reasonably stable rate, the
federal government may soon !
find it has a very large surplus. 1
Assuming, as we must nowa-1
days, that we do in fact have ,
the common sense not to escal- '<
ate ourselves into a total war.
the surplus federal revenue will
be very large. Our real problem
will not be how to pay for the
needs of the great cities, but j
how to spend the available'
money wisely.
In an environment of relative
peace and increasing affluence,
there is no reason whatever to
throw up our hands and say
that a city like New York is un
governable. Thus far, the great
cities have not really been gov
erned. They have been too busy
growing to think about being
governed. But now at last in the j
biggest of the great cities the |
way is open to a new beginning.
As John Lindsay makes ready
to take over the mayoralty of
New York City, there is a gen
eral feeling that he has an im
possible task. New York, it is
said, is ungovernable. Its prob
lems are insoluble. Mr. Lindsay
is alone in a municipal govern
ment dominated by Democrats.
What needs to be done to
overeome congestion and pov
erty and delinquency, to educate
the children, to make medical
care adequate, to clean the pol
luted air and make up the de
pleted water supply will require
vast sums of money and a wide
and deep reconstruction of the
political system.
No matter how good a man
John Lindsay is, he cannot, we
are told, succeed in all this.
The Shallow View
My view is that all that will,
of course, be true if John Lind
say did not know better than
to take a shallow view of his
task. The shallow view would
be to suppose that he can deal
with the problems of the great
city by being somewhat more
energetic and somewhat more
resistant to pressure groups
than vcre his predecessors in
the citv hall. He would most
certainly fail if he were under
the illusion that all New York
needs is an untried mayor.
On the other hand, I do not
think John Lindsay can fail if
he takes a deep view of his task.
By a deep view I mean the con
ception of his task, indeed of
his mission, as an opportunity
to make a four-year demonstra
tion of what it will take to make
a modern urban conglomeration
livable.
He will have succeeded bril
liantly if in the course of four
years he has shown New York
and Albany and Washington
what kind of radical reform and
reconstruction is necessary.
Primarily, and above all, his
task is to find and to sponsor
the best remedies that the most
expert in urban affairs have to
recommend, to experiment with
these remedies and to keep on
explaining them, to conduct, in
effect, a great teach-in and sem
inar in the problems of the mod
ern American city. Nobody can
seriously expect him to solve all
the problems single-handedly
and on his own power. His op
portunity and his duty is to leaf!
a four-year course for urban
Americans in their self-educa
tion for self-government.
From Whence Cometh Change?
We know enough already
about the dimensions of the

problem to realize where some .
of the great changes will have j
to come.

What needs to be done to
overeome congestion and pov
erty and delinquency, to educate
the children, to make medical
care adequate, to clean the pol
luted air and make up the de
pleted water supply will require
vast sums of money and a wide
and deep reconstruction of the
political system.
No matter how good a man
John Lindsay is, he cannot, we
are told, succeed in all this.
The Shallow View
My view is that all that will,
of course, be true if John Lind
say did not know better than
to take a shallow view of his
task. The shallow view would
be to suppose that he can deal
with the problems of the great
city by being somewhat more
energetic and somewhat more
resistant to pressure groups
than vcre his predecessors in
the citv hall. He would most
certainly fail if he were under
the illusion that all New York
needs is an untried mayor.
On the other hand, I do not
think John Lindsay can fail if
he takes a deep view of his task.
By a deep view I mean the con
ception of his task, indeed of
his mission, as an opportunity
to make a four-year demonstra
tion of what it will take to make
a modern urban conglomeration
livable.
He will have succeeded bril
liantly if in the course of four
years he has shown New York
and Albany and Washington
what kind of radical reform and
reconstruction is necessary.
Primarily, and above all, his
task is to find and to sponsor
the best remedies that the most
expert in urban affairs have to
recommend, to experiment with
these remedies and to keep on
explaining them, to conduct, in
effect, a great teach-in and sem
inar in the problems of the mod
ern American city. Nobody can
seriously expect him to solve all
the problems single-handedly
and on his own power. His op
portunity and his duty is to leaf!
a four-year course for urban
Americans in their self-educa
tion for self-government.
From Whence Cometh Change?
We know enough already
about the dimensions of the

problem to realize where some .
of the great changes will have j
to come.
Thus, the legal city of New I
York, which is governed from j
the city hall, is only a pare ofj
the real city. The real city in
fact lies in three states and com
prises many little cities, many
suburbs and myriads of villages, ]
The needs and interests of the j
urban conglomerations of our !
era have outgrown the political i
structures which come down to ;
them from a very different past.
We shall have to call persist- ;
ently for the initiation and crea- i
tion of regional political author
ities -smaller and more local- :
ized than the federal govern
ment, yet transcending state ;
lines and embracing the old
municipalities, counties and vil
lages. For it is proving to be
impossible to govern the great
city with antiquated political
jurisdictions.
It is also quite certain that
we shall have to work out a
fiscal system by which the cities
receive an increasing amount of
the money collected by the fed
eral government. The federal 1
revenue system is far more eff
icient than the local systems
can be. The federal system is so
efficient that it may soon be
producing more revenue than
the federal government on its
traditional activities can use
fully spend. Some of this rev
enue can then be spent in the
localities.
Reform In The Air
The idea for t his reform is i
already in the air. If, as we have
reason to hope, the modern econ 1
omy can be made to expand at
a reasonably stable rate, the
federal government may soon !
find it has a very large surplus. 1
Assuming, as we must nowa-1
days, that we do in fact have ,
the common sense not to escal- '<
ate ourselves into a total war.
the surplus federal revenue will
be very large. Our real problem
will not be how to pay for the
needs of the great cities, but j
how to spend the available'
money wisely.
In an environment of relative
peace and increasing affluence,
there is no reason whatever to
throw up our hands and say
that a city like New York is un
governable. Thus far, the great
cities have not really been gov
erned. They have been too busy
growing to think about being
governed. But now at last in the j
biggest of the great cities the |
way is open to a new beginning.
As John Lindsay makes ready
to take over the mayoralty of
New York City, there is a gen
eral feeling that he has an im
possible task. New York, it is
said, is ungovernable. Its prob
lems are insoluble. Mr. Lindsay
is alone in a municipal govern
ment dominated by Democrats.
What needs to be done to
overeome congestion and pov
erty and delinquency, to educate
the children, to make medical
care adequate, to clean the pol
luted air and make up the de
