# THE 						ORGAN GRINDER
## Legislature's Legal Opposition 
### MIKE COUZENS 
"The law," wrote Justice Cardozo, "is not
a cadaver, but a spirit; not. a clop in the
fullness of life, but an outlet and a means
t hereto."
Whenever Legislature is inclined toward
flights of fancy, it seems that the same
intrepid Law School representative brings
them back flown to earth.
He never tires of contributing vital tech
nical nuances and crucial refinements over
looked by his less-sophisticated colleagues.
His wide experiences as an undergraduate
are augmented by a thorough understand
ing of legalicse, the trade language so
necessary to making telling, but subtle,
points.

This columnist was privileged to inter

deis-Dissenting. A first-year law student,
he did undergraduate work at Stanford in
Hispanic-American and Pseudo-Brazilian
Studies. Following is a transcript of that
interview:
Q: Can you tell me. Holmes, why you
were interested in becoming LASSU
Rep. ?
A: Please, call me ivlr. Brandies-Dissent
ing. There is a certain alure attendant to
that appellation, "LASSU." Those observer'

who give it a pejorative connotation miss,
I believe, the subtlety of the word. Roll it
on your tongue: "LASSU." Does that re
mind you of a rodeo? Of course not. I
think it implies an august deliberative
assemblage, not unlike the Supreme Court.
As Mr. Justice White was fond of remark
ing. . .
Judge Hand On Two Trials
Q: Thank you. What do you feel is the
crucial question on judicial reform?
A: I believe those who talk of "double
jeopardy" are simply pandering an outworn
bastardization of the real issue. It is simply,
whether or not a de novo trial takes place,
as it were. I think of Judge Learned Hand's
vigorous dissent in the case of Jones v.
Tehachepe Cow College, 36(5 F. 2d 954 at
673 (I960). His argument was that a man
should not be tried twice for the same
crime, particularly if the onerous burden
of a d«' novo trial is thrust upon him. in
point of fact. The argument that this was
unimportant since the case was remanded
from the District Court of Appeals to the
Cow College Dean of Students, I submit,
is irrelevant.
Quorum Call: A Visceral Protest
Q: What would you say is the most satis
fying thing about being a Legislature rep.?
A: I'd have to say that, ceteris paribus, it
would be nofinj' the absence ol a quorum.

That thrill was only equaled for me by the
time I addressed the Palo Alto High School
Law Forum on "Malfeasons v. Misfeasons,
No Maen Distinction."
Q: Why do you call the quorum?
A: I take it to be my duty as amicus
curiae to LASSU. And I suspect that by
that hour other members less interested
than I have become bored with the ad
mittedly elongated proceedings.
Q: What is your reaction to one Legis
lator's comment about you, citing Justice.
Frankfurter's reference in the Rocliin case
to "Additional aggravating conduct which
the Court finds repulsive?"
Tempest. In A Tea|x>t
A: As noted in 2 Harper and James. Torts
1101 (1956), "This particular tempest
seems to be one in a teapot."
Q: What is your opinion of the blood
drives?
A: 1 feel their legality should be determ
ined by a committee of competent lav per
sons; twelve might be a good number. Now
that LASSU has abolished the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Commission,
they might reactivate this committee to
survey the blood drives. And 1 would gladly
serve as legal adviser. I would oppose any
form of test case since, if appealed, it
could result in a «1«* novo trial, if you know
what I mean.

This columnist was privileged to inter

deis-Dissenting. A first-year law student,
he did undergraduate work at Stanford in
Hispanic-American and Pseudo-Brazilian
Studies. Following is a transcript of that
interview:
Q: Can you tell me. Holmes, why you
were interested in becoming LASSU
Rep. ?
A: Please, call me ivlr. Brandies-Dissent
ing. There is a certain alure attendant to
that appellation, "LASSU." Those observer'

who give it a pejorative connotation miss,
I believe, the subtlety of the word. Roll it
on your tongue: "LASSU." Does that re

think it implies an august deliberative
assemblage, not unlike the Supreme Court.
As Mr. Justice White was fond of remark
ing. . .
Judge Hand On Two Trials
Q: Thank you. What do you feel is the
crucial question on judicial reform?
A: I believe those who talk of "double
jeopardy" are simply pandering an outworn
bastardization of the real issue. It is simply,
whether or not a de novo trial takes place,
as it were. I think of Judge Learned Hand's
vigorous dissent in the case of Jones v.
Tehachepe Cow College, 36(5 F. 2d 954 at
673 (I960). His argument was that a man
should not be tried twice for the same
crime, particularly if the onerous burden
of a d«' novo trial is thrust upon him. in
point of fact. The argument that this was
unimportant since the case was remanded
from the District Court of Appeals to the
Cow College Dean of Students, I submit,
is irrelevant.
Quorum Call: A Visceral Protest
Q: What would you say is the most satis
fying thing about being a Legislature rep.?
A: I'd have to say that, ceteris paribus, it
would be nofinj' the absence ol a quorum.

That thrill was only equaled for me by the
time I addressed the Palo Alto High School
Law Forum on "Malfeasons v. Misfeasons,
No Maen Distinction."
Q: Why do you call the quorum?
A: I take it to be my duty as amicus
curiae to LASSU. And I suspect that by
that hour other members less interested
than I have become bored with the ad
mittedly elongated proceedings.
Q: What is your reaction to one Legis
lator's comment about you, citing Justice.
Frankfurter's reference in the Rocliin case
to "Additional aggravating conduct which
the Court finds repulsive?"
Tempest. In A Tea|x>t
A: As noted in 2 Harper and James. Torts
1101 (1956), "This particular tempest
seems to be one in a teapot."
Q: What is your opinion of the blood
drives?
A: 1 feel their legality should be determ
ined by a committee of competent lav per
sons; twelve might be a good number. Now
that LASSU has abolished the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Commission,
they might reactivate this committee to
survey the blood drives. And 1 would gladly
serve as legal adviser. I would oppose any
form of test case since, if appealed, it
could result in a «1«* novo trial, if you know
what I mean.
