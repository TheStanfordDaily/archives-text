# DISPUTE OVER GRAD
## Admissions Committee Selection 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
A final announcement of the ap
pointment of three students for a sub
committee of the Academic Council's
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions should be made today by ASSU
Prcsideut Sandy Mackenzie. The selec
tion of these members will end a
controversy concerning the seating of
a graduate on this undergraduate
committee.
The faculty members of the advi
sory group asked that careful consid
eration be made before students were
appointed. They tabled the acceptance
of the three suggested candidates un
lil discussion of two major points
could take place.
Professor Gertrude Sehuelke, chair
man of the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, questioned the selec
tion of <i graduate student for this
sub-group. She also discussed the
committee's concern that no girl had
lK>en named. "It was the feeling of
the committee members that a girl
could best represent the views of the
women students in respect to admis
sion regulations."

Tom Sherman, the graduate student
suggested for membership, stated his
ideas on combining undergraduates
and graduates on all committees. Al
though he could understand the con
cern. he felt that a graduate studeivt
would broaden the outlook of the
group. "Since a graduate is often a
teacher as well as a student, his per
spective of I he composition of the stu
dent body differs from that of under
graduates and faculty."
lie believes that admissions to both
divisions are interrelated because
they create the general character of
flic University. lie would also favor
undergraduates on the graduate ad
mission committee.
However, Professor Virgil W'liita
ker. chairman of the Committee on
the Graduate Division, implied that
such membership would be impossi
ble. Plans for student membership ol
this committee are not final, but stip
ulate that all three students should
be advanced Ph.l >. candidate's repre
senting the three general areas of the
graduate work.
Commenting 011 this situation, Mac
kenzie explained that grucluatc slit

dents were on other undergraduate
oriented committees. He pointed out
that many of these groups did not
have women on them.
Liaison
The subcommittee, once formed,
will serve as a discussion group. Pro
fessor Meyerhof, chairman of this
yet unformed group, believes it "will
serve as a liaison for suggestions be
tween students and the larger Aca
demic Council committee."
One suggestion to solve the prob
lem would be the addition of a fourth
student committee member. This, how
ever. is impossible because the policy
behind the sub-committee stipulates
three students. This plan was estab
lished in the fall of 1962 but has not
been fulfilled until this year.
Faculty members of this committee
are Professors Meyerhof. Schuelke,
and Solomon. The director of admis
sions. Dean Snyder, serves as an ex
officio member of the group.
Professor Schuelke implied late yes
terday that Mackenzie's suggestions
will be accepted. The newly-formed
group should meet sometime next
week.
