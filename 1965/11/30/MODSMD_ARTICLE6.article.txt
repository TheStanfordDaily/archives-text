# Sex Ethics Not Absoluteâ€”Roe
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
"What we need to learn is that
there is an appropriate way to ex
press our sexuality in any given sit
uation," the Rev. Richard Roc told
an overflow audience of almost 200
in the Otero House lounge last night.
In the first of three talks in the
Otero-sponsored Sexual Morality
Symposium, Roe said that he. ap
proaching the matter as a Christian,
believes in contextual ethics and not
an absolute morality.
"A person must not make a decis
ion on sexual morality out of the blue,
but must take the most consistent
action taking into account the cir
cumstances and the basic convictions
that he has," he said.
Misunderstandings
Roe first attacked two "false un
derstandings of sexual morality," the
puritanical religious view and the
Playboy Philosophy.
"The puritan sees sexual morality
as governed by a set of taboos, and
sex is considered basically dirty," Roe
said. "Even talking about sex. as we
are doing tonight, would be wrong."
But, Roe countered, this strict con
struction of morality is contrary to
the Christian's contextual moralitv.

Ho also disagreed with tho philoso
phy expounded by Hugh Hefner.
"You're all aware of his product," he
said.

According to Roe, in this philoso
phy "women are things you enjoy,
things you use, but you avoid en
tangling alliances that will trip you
up."
"But," Roo said, "as a Christian the
one law that I am called to live my
life by is the call to love."
The Christian faith, he continued,
says t hat love is an "outgoing good
will to all other people," and. in con
trast to ihe Playboy Philosophy, that
"all other persons should be treated
as persons, not as things."
Christian Affirmations
"As a Christian," Roe said, "I af
firm tho godness of the body, the
eentrality of love in a personal rela
tionship. the role of sex as one of the
primary parts of the relationship, and
the profound and affecting nature of
the sex act. All of this requires that:
the relationship be as profound at
the act."
"Under almost all circumstances,
t his is an act which should be con
fined to marriage," ho concluded.
Organizer Russ Tweet called tho
standing room only crowd rewarding,
and added that "We may decide to
tear down the walls to make more
room for tonight, when Dr. .Yovitt
Sanford will speak."

Christian Affirmations
"As a Christian," Roe said, "I af
firm tho godness of the body, the
eentrality of love in a personal rela
tionship. the role of sex as one of the
primary parts of the relationship, and
the profound and affecting nature of
the sex act. All of this requires that:
the relationship be as profound at
the act."
"Under almost all circumstances,
t his is an act which should be con
fined to marriage," ho concluded.
Organizer Russ Tweet called tho
standing room only crowd rewarding,
and added that "We may decide to
tear down the walls to make more
room for tonight, when Dr. .Yovitt
Sanford will speak."
"What we need to learn is that
there is an appropriate way to ex
press our sexuality in any given sit
uation," the Rev. Richard Roc told
an overflow audience of almost 200
in the Otero House lounge last night.
In the first of three talks in the
Otero-sponsored Sexual Morality
Symposium, Roe said that he. ap
proaching the matter as a Christian,
believes in contextual ethics and not
an absolute morality.
"A person must not make a decis
ion on sexual morality out of the blue,
but must take the most consistent
action taking into account the cir
cumstances and the basic convictions
that he has," he said.
Misunderstandings
Roe first attacked two "false un
derstandings of sexual morality," the
puritanical religious view and the
Playboy Philosophy.
"The puritan sees sexual morality
as governed by a set of taboos, and
sex is considered basically dirty," Roe
said. "Even talking about sex. as we
are doing tonight, would be wrong."
But, Roe countered, this strict con
struction of morality is contrary to
the Christian's contextual moralitv.

Ho also disagreed with tho philoso
phy expounded by Hugh Hefner.
"You're all aware of his product," he
said.
Untangle moid
According to Roe, in this philoso
phy "women are things you enjoy,
things you use, but you avoid en
tangling alliances that will trip you
up."
"But," Roo said, "as a Christian the
one law that I am called to live my
life by is the call to love."
The Christian faith, he continued,
says t hat love is an "outgoing good
will to all other people," and. in con
trast to ihe Playboy Philosophy, that
"all other persons should be treated
as persons, not as things."
