# Sequoia Turns Over New Leaf; Produces Bold, Brassy Edition
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Until recently, Sequoia, safely shel
tered from the cold, cruel world by
an ASSU subsidy, was doggedly and
very dully "literary." Almost disdain
fully it would issue a slim volume
when the spirit moved it, and each
new one was worse than the last.
Then somebody decided to throw
out the old arty format, get rid of
those ridiculously obscure stories,
scrap the rambling and inconsequen
tial poetry, stop combing the country
for unknown and untalented writers,
devote more space to students' work,
and liven up the pages with some
decent drawings and photographs.
With this new face, the bold and
brassy Sequoia expected not only to
make itself more relevant to Stanford
life but also actually to sell copies
for a change: and this quarter's offer
ing, under Susan Jackson's editor
ship, is certainly the former and will
hopefully achieve the latter.
Harmony Achieved
First of all, Barringer Fifie'Jd has
a chatty article on Italian politics
written somewhat in the style of The

New Yorker. In a series of anecdotes
lie outlines Italy's present political at
mosphere. which he calls normal as
compared with post-war attitudes. By
"normal" he means a sort of happy
schizophrenia, wherein the need for
ideological clarity and the most blat
ant moral opportunism exist side by
side in apparent harmony.
There are moments when the spice
seems pretentious and more than a
little polemical, but Fifield's eye for
strikingly relevant detail and his dry
sense of humor keep it from being
too pompous.
Of the two poems in the issue,
Elizabeth Yount's "The Seduction" is
better by default. Bitter in a gentle
sort of way. it also has some lyrical
moments in lines like "... a red-gold
jungle flower/emerging from the
gray concrete, its velvet petals part
ing while/sweet nectar drew down
sins like flies." Charlotte Low's "To
My Coy Lover," however, though in
tended to be a satire on the Renais
sance "Coy Mistress" theme, is petty,
callous, vulgar, and generally an ugly
excuse for a poem.
But these are minor matters, for

the health of this Sequoia is John
Matthias' long story "By Way Of The
Ruins," about a vacationing archeolo
gist who finds himself being sucked
into the collective neurosis of an
American diplomat's family, and the
particular fixation of the daughter,
Margaret, who has a "thing" about
Turks.
A good deal of it is unmercifully
satiric, justifiably so in dealing with
a family that makes hypocrisy a way
of life; and the underlying sexual
symbolism, as well as the explicitly
sexual episodes, arc well-handled.
Throughout it is beautifully writ
ten, in a lucid, really poetic style; and
it raises this issue of Sequoia from
the wasteland of literary magazines
in general to a high level of writing
and makes it a really impressive
achievement.
