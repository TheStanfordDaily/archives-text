Under review this month is a most provocative
and timely book, The Worried Man's Guide to
World Peace . . . provocative because it is not
everyone's political cup of tea, and timely because
it fits right into the current series of world-wide
peace demonstrations.
Arthur Waskow's book amply achieves its pur
pose as a "guide" into peace politics for the unin
formed. He discusses the current world situation—
and the way Americans, in particular, look at
peace. Mr. Waskow then outlines specific action
levers available to the P.A. (Peace Actionist) like
"Alperovitzing" (grass roots lobbying), and helps
answer such questions as:
• How does one become effective in local political
organizations?
• Are demonstrations an effective means of social
protest and when are they put to their best use?
• llow can I get "Peace" on page one of my local
newspaper ?
• How can I effectively translate my ideas to the
average businessman or civic leader?
In this day and age of the bomb, The Worried
Man's Guide to World Peace ($1.25, A Doubleday
Anchor Original) is a must for the student of
peace ... or war.
In his autobiography, Child of Two Worlds (An
chor, $1.25), R. Mugo Gatheru describes his per
sonal odyssey from tribalism to full citizenship
in the world Mr. Waskow is worried about. Mr.
Gatheru's story is a simple and straightforward
one. He tells of ancient customs in which he par
ticipated as a young Kikuyu tribesman. He tells
how he gradually adopted new values and new
customs, especially as a student at Lincoln Uni
versity in Pennsylvania. In so doing, he reveals
to us what it has meant to one human being to be
a Kikuyu, a Kenyan and an African amid the
complexities of modern civilization.
To understand Mugo Gatheru's story is to under
stand the experience of thousands of other young
Africans. It is to understand an experience that
is a crucial one in a changing, troubled world.
The two books reviewed above are published by
the sponsors of t!;is column, Doubledajt Anchor
Hooks, 277 Park Avenue, New York City, and
Doubleday & Company, Ine., Garden City, New
York. You 11 find them all at one of the best
