The Way to World Peace
Famed and eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee declared recently thot
civilization has reached the point where the very continuity of the human race
depends upon the formation of world government. It is the mutual interest
of the nations to subordinate their national sovereignty to world authorities,
he said, "This is the only condition on which the nations can survive in an atomic
age."
In the light of world developments it is interesting to consider the words of
Jesus Christ. About two thousand years ago the Prince of Peace told His fol
lowers: "You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not
alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and
earthquakes in various places; all this is but the beginning of sufferings . . .
(Matthew 24:1 -8).
According to the Bible, history's darkest hour lies yet ahead, a period of
destruction and death far exceeding the toll and travail of two world wars.
From this holocaust only a few will be saved.
Those who seek to bring about pcace on earth should acquaint themselves
with God's ways and methods, for His great purpose in present times is to
call, out of a lost and dying world, a group of people to Himself (Acts 15:13-18).
The Kingdom of God begins with changed human hearts through personally
receiving Jesus Christ as Lord. Jesus Christ, who came to bring peace to men,
also made it clear He was on earth to divide ancf to separate men (Matthew
10:33-34, 25:31-461.
God's solution to the problem of world ptuce is to silently and invisit.il/
change men's lives by transforming them from within. Those who meet and
receive Jesus Christ have not only the peace of God here and now, but loo)-
expectantly and confidently to the day when His program for woild peace has
fully come.
Theie is only one eective way you can work for woila peace and iiiat is by
accepting God s plans and methods. Commit your life to Jesus Chiist and be
come His instrument of righteousness and His avenue of expression in a war
ring world whose rebellion is basically against God alone.
