VATICAN CITY The Vatican Ecu
menical Council's statement on birth
control was described yesterday as
simultaneously upholding the Roman
Catholic Church ban on contraception
and setting a foundation for a possible
rclaxat ion.
Such a change, if it comes, might
not be limited to the contraceptive
pills that have been at the center of
much of the birth-control discussion
in the Church.
An expert serving on birth-control
commission set up by Pope Paul VI
said the council document had been
revised to make it clear that the en
tire contraception issue was theoreti
cally open to examination.
A council source said the document
more than left the question open
that it presented Church birth con
trol teaching as an evolving process,
with gradual shifts not necessarily
meaning rejection of past instruction.

SAN FRANCISCO A group of San
Francisco women declared war on
war-like toys yesterday.
The Toy Committee of San Fran
cisco Women for Peace said it would
bombard shopping centers Saturday
with leaflets and mailers condemning
"games of maim, murder, hostility
and destruction."
The women are trying toreach those
who advocate celebrating "the birth
of Christ by giving toys of hate to
those they love."
The committee will urge shoppers
to turn to its allies—four shops that
ban war-like toys, a department store
that won't advertise them, and a toy
manufacturer that wont' make them.
• Expert Predicts Quake
WASHINGTON — A government
earthquake expert said yesterday the
millions of people in Los Angeles and
San Francisco "are living with the
certainty that the ground beneath
them will shake again to the hammer
of Vulcan."
"The only uncertainty is when,"
added Dr. William T. Pecora, director
of the U. S. Geological Survey. He
spoke to a science and technology
panel at a White House Conference
on International Cooperation.
Pecora said the bulldozers of hous
ing developers have even smoothed
over all evidence in the San Francisco
area of the San Andreas fault, which
"extends for more than 500 miles and
endangers all the coastal cities of
California."

those they love."
The committee will urge shoppers
to turn to its allies—four shops that
ban war-like toys, a department store
that won't advertise them, and a toy
manufacturer that wont' make them.
• Expert Predicts Quake
WASHINGTON — A government
earthquake expert said yesterday the
millions of people in Los Angeles and
San Francisco "are living with the
certainty that the ground beneath
them will shake again to the hammer
of Vulcan."
"The only uncertainty is when,"
added Dr. William T. Pecora, director
of the U. S. Geological Survey. He
spoke to a science and technology
panel at a White House Conference
on International Cooperation.
Pecora said the bulldozers of hous
ing developers have even smoothed
over all evidence in the San Francisco
area of the San Andreas fault, which
"extends for more than 500 miles and
endangers all the coastal cities of
California."
