# Graduate Newsletter Features Viet Theme

### JOE ROSEN BLOOM Associate Editor 
The Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee began distributing yesterday
its four-page Newsletter, and it might
well have been entitled "The Vietnam
War."
This theme comes about "by acci
dent," according to the publication's
co-editor, Igor Webb, but somehow
all of the articles arc at least indirect
ly connected with the War. All are

with emphasis on the "leisurely." The
issue, which Webb describes as "our
best to date," probably merits some
close, if not leisurely, attention.
fiuns Greatness
The most prominent article, and
certainly the most explosive, guns
down Stanford for "gunning for
greatness" or, in other words, for ac
cepting lucrative federal defense con
tracts.
Written by Robert Ilass, the article
is in the best muckraking tradition,
complete with an expose of interlock
ing directorates among the Stanford
Board of Trustees, the Stanford He
search Institute (SRI), and the In
dustrial-Commercial Research Clients
of SRI. And Hass makes some caustic
points:
After explaining how everyone ex
cept the Graduate Cordinating Com
mittee profits from the arangement
beneficiaries include Stanford scien
tists and the United States govern
ment among others—which jeopar
dizes academic freedom and Univers
ity autonomy, he unleashes his major
criticism:
"Not an unscratchcd back in the
room and in Vietnam, where backs
are known to be lousy due to political
underdevelopment, we are personally,
;is it were, purging the flesh of the
peasants."
Open Letter
There is another article, an open
letter to Dr. Stefan Possony from
Dave Ransom, chairman of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
with less drama but the same polem
ics.
Ransom lashes Possony for state
ments he made in a national magazine
about Communist influence on United
States campuses. "Sir. your state
ments are not only intellectually but
morally dishonest," Ransom charges.
Luke Kabat, a third-year medical
student with little concern for camou
flaging his interest in psychology,
writes after leading us through a
civil rights experience in Mississippi
and the Vietnam War:
"Projection is the basis for all of
our prejudices. Wo don't really hale
Negroes of Communists . . . We sec
them as symbols and they represent
the frustration, loneliness, and ugli
ness of our lives. We hate ourselves
and we turn our anger on the scape
goats."

Open Letter
There is another article, an open
letter to Dr. Stefan Possony from
Dave Ransom, chairman of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
with less drama but the same polem
ics.
Ransom lashes Possony for state
ments he made in a national magazine
about Communist influence on United
States campuses. "Sir. your state
ments are not only intellectually but
morally dishonest," Ransom charges.
Luke Kabat, a third-year medical
student with little concern for camou

writes after leading us through a

The most prominent article, and
certainly the most explosive, guns
down Stanford for "gunning for
greatness" or, in other words, for ac

tracts.
Written by Robert Ilass, the article
is in the best muckraking tradition,
complete with an expose of interlock
ing directorates among the Stanford
Board of Trustees, the Stanford He
search Institute (SRI), and the In

of SRI. And Hass makes some caustic
