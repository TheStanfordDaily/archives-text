# Girl Joins El Capitan?
## 
### 
The first Stanford woman has been
voted into Ihe otherwise all-male
membership of a Stanford Eating
Club.
The tradition was broken so quietly
it caused hardly a ripple.
El Capitan Club's new associate
member is nerolled in the University
as Agnes Idele Peterson, sophomore
student from Albany, Calif. Off cam
pus she is better known as Anya
Peters, ballet dancer and teacher with
some six years experience in New
York and Europe.
"Please don't say she crashed. We
invited her, you know," explained a
fellow member, casting an admiring
glance across the dining room.
Why Not?
Members of all seven Stanford Eat
ing Clubs occasionally invite women
guests to meals. Anya, asked repeat
edly to El Capitan, soon made friends
and was generally welcomed. When
the inevitable joking suggestion was
voiced that she become a member,
somebody countered with "Why not?"
It was quickly determined that
there was no technical barrier. The
clubs, established early in Stanford's
history, are traditionally devoted to
the principle of personal independ
ence. Each one controls its own fi
nances. buys its food, hires its cook
and determines the organization of
its members.
Anya was voted in at the next
meeting.
"There was a little discussion but
not too much dissent," reported mem
ber David Devine, a junior from Cu
pertino, of the unprecedented action.
Undcrgradute women at Stanford
normally live in campus residence
units. Anya. 23. lives part time in the
Palo Alto home of a friend and part
;it her parents' home near Berkeley.
She goes to El Capitan for only one
meal, at 110,011. like some of the club's
married members.
Club President Christopher "Kit"
Tuveson. a senior from Phoenix, said
everybody seems happy with the ar
rangement. He sees the move as a
forerunner of other memberships for
women living off campus.
