## Tribulations Of A Coach: Frosh Beat No. 1 Varsity 
### Joe Hernandez 
What kind of faro does a bask
etball ooach put on when his
two-time NCAA champ and top
ranked team is being slaugh
tered by a group of freshmen?
The answer to lhat one was
apparent to the 12,000 people at
the inauguration of UCLA's new
Pauley Pavilion and to the thou
sands more who watched "John
ny Wooden Night" on TV.
As he sat calmly along the
sidelines, Coach Wooden as
sumed the proper "I'm disap
pointed in you, varsity" expres
sion. but he couldn't help but let
the irrepressible gleam in his
eyes show through as he watched

an irresistible machine on the
move.
"The Alcindor Years"
That irresistible machine, the
UCLA'S Mr. Defense, otherwise
was a legend almost before it
started. Their 75-60 victory over
the varsity only clinched it. In
L.A., 1965 isn't known as the
first year of the Pauley Pavilion;
it's the beginning of "the Alcin
dor Years."
Led, of course, by T'l" Lew
Alcindor, the Frosh started four
high school all-Americans
against the varsity. The poor
fellow who isn't an all-American,
Kent Taylor, took some of the
sting away by scoring 10 points
and playing a fine game. Ken
Heitz, Lynn Shakelford, and Lu
cius Alien are the other ail-
Americans.
Heitz had the poorest night
among the starters. He only hit
two long jumpers and grabbed
seven rebounds.
>Ir. Defense
Shakelford reminded many of
UCLA's Mr. Defense, otherwise,
known as Keith Erickson. Shak
elford had the unenviable task
of guarding Edgar Lacey. But at
the end of the night the attitude
changed to, "Lacey was in the
unenviable position of having
Shakelford guard him."
Frustrated Edgar sizzled the
nets for five points. The closest
he got to the basket was in the
second quarter when he went to
the free throw line. Oh yes,
someone else fouled Lacey.
Shakelford failed to commit a
foul during the game.
At guard, the 6'2" Allen was a
regular dynamo. He handled the
ball flawlessly setting up plays,
stole passes, touched the rafters
as he popped in his long jumper
(16 points), and he also found
time to be the frosh's number
two rebounder with eight.
Frosh Press Works
Allen completely dominated
the backcourt game as the var
sity threw the ball away four or
five times against the freshman
press.
If Allen dominated the back
court, then there was only one
person in the frontcourtâ€”Lew
Alcindor. Although he scored 31
points and grabbed 21 rebounds,
Alcindor looked like a veteran
Bruin eager, that is, a team man.

When he got the ball, he quickly
passed to the open man if the
varsity's defense collapsed on
him. or he sank one of his jump
ers if they were brave enough
to let one man guard him.
The crowd got one of its big
gest thrills when Mike Lynn
tried to guard Alcindor by him
self. Alcindor was 10 feet to the
side of the basket facing the
bench. He took one giant step
left, leaped, and as he floated by
the rim, ho rammed the ball into
the hoop with his outside hand.
And Quick, Too?
His move was so quick that
observers thought he had put
his whole arm up to the shoulder
in the basket. Upon clearer anal
ysis, it was agreed that he only
had his arm up to the elbow in
the basket.
Alcindor also did a creditable
job on defense. He did get
screened out near the basket at
times, but he made up for it by
blocking numerous shots and by
breaking up passes on the press.
Alcindor and Allen will be
names remembered by basket
ball coaches not only for 47
points and 29 rebounds, but be
cause they broke the UCLA
press. The frosh didn't lose the
ball once to the press when both
the big A's were in there. Per
haps Stanford's varsity could
take a lesson from the ease with
which the frosh brought the ball
upcourt.
What Press?
Of course, varsity guard Fred
die Goss was out with an un
diagnosed back ailment, but then
he is best on offense.
Maybe the UCLA varsity is
overrated, and maybe the UCLA
frosh aren't as fantastic as they
appear to be, but if Stanford is
going to win the AAWU basket
ball title this is as good a season
as any to do it.
Stanford has four lettermen
returning from last year and one
from the year before. Among
these is high-scoring Bob Bedell
who was an all-conference selec
tion last year.
If the Indians can learn a few
tricks from the UCLA frosh,
they will break out of the second
place spot they have held for
two years and trade places with
the Bruins.
