### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford opens its varsity
basketball season tonight at the
San Jose Civic Auditorium

against the Santa Clara Broncos.
The tilt begins at 8 p.m. and will
be broadcast over radio station
KCBS.
Conflicted by an array of pre
season injuries Stanford Coach
Howie Dallmar will court a team
with a pair of sophomore
guards. Art Harris who was the
leading Froth rehounder and
scorer last season will be flanked
by his buddy-guard from last
year Gary Petersmeyer, who is
smallish but has a devastating
bomb-shot from the perimeter.
Indian Injuries
Injuries to Ray Kosanke, Mike
Preisler, and Jack Gilbert have
cut into the Indian's honch
strength. Kosanke has a history
of yearly injuries, and this year
he turns up with back trouble.
He missed a week of practice
earlier. Preisler has an ankle
sprain, and Gilbert has a leg in
fection.
Bob Bedell the Tribe's leading
scorer last year will switch to
forward to make room for Rich
Baker, who rod-shirtcd last year
because of an injury. He was a
letterman his sophomore cam
paign. He will be situated at the
center position this evening.

The Stanford squad has for
the past two years managed to
outdo all of the conference op
ponents except the slightly po
tent UCLA Bruins. Again this
year it seems to he the fate of
the Indians to only be runner
ups. Even after being trounced
by their frosh, the Bruin varsity
is picked to take the AAYVU
crown.
The Santa Clara team despite
having two fine guards is hurt
ing badly because of study prob
lems whieh three of its top per-

formers have had. Chris Demp
sey was billed to take over the
center spot. Bob Stucey was a
regular forward last year. Rich
Levitt is a veteran of two previ
ous campaigns. All three will be
ineligible for the first quarter,
and will be out of action until
after the Christmas break.
Mike Gervasoni at guard last
year was the team's leading
scorer, though only a sophomore.
He is accompanied by his posi
tion-partner Eric Paulson.
Following the game tonight
Stanford will meet USF Satur
day and San Jose Monday at the
Stanford Pavilion. The Tribe
does not open the AAWU season
until after the Christmas break
on January 8 against Washing
ton.
