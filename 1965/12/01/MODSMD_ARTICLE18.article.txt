# AFTER MANY TWISTS...

Intramural grid playoffs nar
rowed to four teams as quarter
finals were concluded last Mon
day. Highlighting the action was
the contest between Fremont
and the DU's. Battling an en
croaching darkness and a stub
born defense, Fremont finally
edged the fraternity team by the
slightest of margins.
The game ended knotted at 12-
12. Consequently, victory was
given to the team going farlhest
in four plays. With Stan Smith
passing to John Stitt and Mick
Alexander, Fremont dominated
the aftermath, accumulating
about 30 yards more than the
DU's.
Throughout the game the
Smith-Stitt combination was
deadly, clicking 112 or 40-yard
touchdowns in each half. The
running and passing of Bill
Twist, however, kept the DU's in ;
the game. He brought the DU's i
back in the first half with a '
30-yard aerial to his brother, j
George Twist. Bill again chal- .
longed in the second half, scor- 1
ing on a 20-yard run. But the |
DU's apparently ran out of 1
Twists in the "fifth" quarter, i
falling from the playoffs.
Rough One for Sigma C his
The Sigma Chis continued to I
roll, but not quite as smoothly j
as usual, beating a reluctant Phi i
Psi team 6-0. A big rush by the !

Phi Psi's stalled the Chi offen
sive, but Paul Hazelrig ran back
an early pass interception about
50 yards for the lone touchdown.
Pat Concannon led the Phi
Delts to an impressive 2-1-0 vic
tory over the KA's. Concannon
ran for one score and passed for
three others as the Phi Delts bal
anced the scoring with a pair
of touchdowns each half.
The possibility of an all-Sigma
Chi championship game was
squashed by the Theta Delts
when they beat the Chi II team
13-12. The Theta Delts jumped
to a quick lead when Fred Mose-
ley dropped a 60-yard scoring
bomb to Bill Stineheart. Moseley
hit Mike Walsh with a 12-yarder
for the Theta Delts final six.
