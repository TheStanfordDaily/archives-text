## Beutelsbach Director Urges Seminar Study Of Proposals To Improve Overseas Campi 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Having road Iho critiques con
cerning Dr. Walker and Stan
ford in Germany, published on
November 15 and 16 in The Stan
ford Daily, I think it necessary
to define my point of view.
As well known by the admin
istration of Stanford Overseas
Campuses I am also not in full
agreement, with the way in which
Stanford's program in Germany
is handled. After years of suc
cessful consolidation the concept
certainly calls for a reconsidera
tion by now. A carefully thought
out demand in this regard would
have found me on the side of the
letter-writers, therefore. As it is,
the critics take their task too
lightly. Though true in single
points, their criticism remains
simply destructive and must bo
rejected. If one wants to open
a constructive discussion and to
further a program, the basic
value of which is beyond doubt,
one has to regard possible im
provements first of all. Such
thoroughly worked-out propos
als from a student's standpoint
are missing so far. As long as
this is true, any protest will lack
a solid base. Independent of the
question whether the adminis
tration is wise in handling criti
cisms. the students cannot ex
pect to be taken as serious part
ners if they exhaust themselves
in complaints.
My advice would be to organ
ize a seminar, open to all inter
ested people, faculty and admin
istration included, in order to
• study the questions which
have arisen,
• examine the different pro

posals for improvement, and
• publish the results in the
form of a solidly based memo
randum.
li should be added that I dis
cussed a different conception of
Stanford in Germany at a recent
Alumni meeting in Berlin where
Dr. Walker was present. I would
be ready to give the manuscript
of my Talk as material for such
a seminar. Interested, however,
as we all are in the institution
of Stanford's overseas program,
we should avoid crossing swords
on the level of personal attacks,
unreflected sympathies or antip
athies.

Editor, The Daily:
To enlist or not to enlist: that is
the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer
The bullets and booby-traps of
outraged Cong
Or to protest against a sea of
troubles,
And by talking end them. To
register: to enroll;
Once more; and by paying our
fees to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thou
sand natural shocks
That IS'2 to 23 year olds are
heir to, 'tis a succor
Devoutly to be wish'd. To enroll,
to study;
To study: perchance to gradu
ate: ay, there's the rub;
For after that deferment what
quotas may come.
When we have taken off ibis

transparent armor,
Must Kiv'e us pause: there's the
respect
That makes grad school of so
long life;
For who would hear Ihe red and
blue marks of readers,
In loco parentis, the Registrar's
contumely,
The pangs of unauthorized love,
the meal's delay,
When he himself might his qui
etus make
With a bare ballpoint? Who
would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under n
heavy academic load,
But that the dread of something
worse than death,
The draft board from whose
greetings
No physically fit, mentally com
petent, morally straight,
Married or single 1-A ever re
covers,
Stiffens the rubber spine and
sharpens the wooden pencil.
And makes us rather those ills
we have
Than fly to others we DO know
of?
Thus fear does make cowards of I
us all.
And thus the ivy hue of learn
ing
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast
of yellow,
And undertakings of great pith
and number
With this regard their currents
turn awry
And lose the name of consensus.
Soft you now!
The unfair Madame Nhu! Bitch, 1
in thy orisons
Be all our sins remember'd.

The time has come to clear
the air of a great fallacy—the
Stanford ratio. Stanford women
admit that they are definitely
outnumbered; however, the atti
tude of Stanford males worsens |
this situation. Hearsay has it
that certain freshman males
have sworn off females this
quarter because there are never
any available girls.
Because there are not enough !
girls to go around, onp would
think that the Stanford woman
would be in great demand. Nay:

not so! On past Friday and
Saturday nights, a good .10 per
cent of Roble Ilnll has stayed in
the dorm reading Western Civ.
Needless to say, frosh dollies
prefer the frosh males over
Western Civ, or. for that matter,
over anything.
In a school with a shortage of
women, it is impossible for wo
men to be the aggressors. Stan
ford women are therefore slaves
to the telephone.
Meanwhile, ihose very boys
who could solve all their prob
lems decide not to call. Why?
They say that Roble-ites are
probably already going out, or
else they would rather go out
with upperclassmen. (What up
perclassmen?) This is not true!
The freshman males are highly
esteemed by frosh dollies.
Roble-ites pride themselves on
not being complete rejects, but
their social life depends on Stan
ford men. t Have you ever heard
of a Stanford woman going
after a Paly High Boy?)
It is with fervor that the Stan

ford women ask that you men
keep on trying. You bring this
social disaster on yourselves.
This situation is under your con
trol; the outcome is on your
shoulders. (Dating Men of Stan

that if under "our Baltic Repub

under no circumstances can these

Having road Iho critiques con
cerning Dr. Walker and Stan
ford in Germany, published on
November 15 and 16 in The Stan
ford Daily, I think it necessary
to define my point of view.
As well known by the admin
istration of Stanford Overseas
Campuses I am also not in full
agreement, with the way in which
Stanford's program in Germany
is handled. After years of suc
cessful consolidation the concept
certainly calls for a reconsidera
tion by now. A carefully thought
out demand in this regard would
have found me on the side of the
letter-writers, therefore. As it is,
the critics take their task too
lightly. Though true in single
points, their criticism remains
simply destructive and must bo
rejected. If one wants to open
a constructive discussion and to
further a program, the basic
value of which is beyond doubt,
one has to regard possible im
provements first of all. Such
thoroughly worked-out propos
als from a student's standpoint
are missing so far. As long as
this is true, any protest will lack
a solid base. Independent of the
question whether the adminis
tration is wise in handling criti
cisms. the students cannot ex
pect to be taken as serious part
ners if they exhaust themselves
in complaints.
My advice would be to organ
ize a seminar, open to all inter
ested people, faculty and admin
istration included, in order to
• study the questions which
have arisen,
• examine the different pro

posals for improvement, and
• publish the results in the
form of a solidly based memo

li should be added that I dis
cussed a different conception of
Stanford in Germany at a recent
Alumni meeting in Berlin where
Dr. Walker was present. I would

The time has come to clear
the air of a great fallacy—the
Stanford ratio. Stanford women
admit that they are definitely
outnumbered; however, the atti
tude of Stanford males worsens |
this situation. Hearsay has it
that certain freshman males
have sworn off females this
quarter because there are never
any available girls.
Because there are not enough !
girls to go around, onp would
think that the Stanford woman
would be in great demand. Nay:

not so! On past Friday and
Saturday nights, a good .10 per
cent of Roble Ilnll has stayed in
the dorm reading Western Civ.
Needless to say, frosh dollies
prefer the frosh males over
Western Civ, or. for that matter,
over anything.
In a school with a shortage of
women, it is impossible for wo
men to be the aggressors. Stan
ford women are therefore slaves
to the telephone.
Meanwhile, ihose very boys
who could solve all their prob
lems decide not to call. Why?
They say that Roble-ites are
probably already going out, or
else they would rather go out
with upperclassmen. (What up
perclassmen?) This is not true!
The freshman males are highly
esteemed by frosh dollies.
Roble-ites pride themselves on
not being complete rejects, but
their social life depends on Stan
ford men. t Have you ever heard
of a Stanford woman going
after a Paly High Boy?)
It is with fervor that the Stan

Having road Iho critiques con
cerning Dr. Walker and Stan
ford in Germany, published on
November 15 and 16 in The Stan
ford Daily, I think it necessary
to define my point of view.
As well known by the admin
istration of Stanford Overseas
Campuses I am also not in full
agreement, with the way in which
Stanford's program in Germany
is handled. After years of suc
cessful consolidation the concept
certainly calls for a reconsidera
tion by now. A carefully thought
out demand in this regard would
have found me on the side of the
letter-writers, therefore. As it is,
the critics take their task too
lightly. Though true in single
points, their criticism remains
simply destructive and must bo
rejected. If one wants to open
a constructive discussion and to
further a program, the basic
value of which is beyond doubt,
one has to regard possible im
provements first of all. Such
thoroughly worked-out propos
als from a student's standpoint
are missing so far. As long as
this is true, any protest will lack
a solid base. Independent of the
question whether the adminis
tration is wise in handling criti
cisms. the students cannot ex
pect to be taken as serious part
ners if they exhaust themselves
in complaints.
My advice would be to organ
ize a seminar, open to all inter
ested people, faculty and admin
istration included, in order to
• study the questions which
have arisen,
• examine the different pro

posals for improvement, and
• publish the results in the
form of a solidly based memo
randum.
li should be added that I dis
cussed a different conception of
Stanford in Germany at a recent
Alumni meeting in Berlin where
Dr. Walker was present. I would
be ready to give the manuscript
of my Talk as material for such

as we all are in the institution

cerning Dr. Walker and Stan
ford in Germany, published on
November 15 and 16 in The Stan
ford Daily, I think it necessary
to define my point of view.
As well known by the admin
istration of Stanford Overseas
Campuses I am also not in full
agreement, with the way in which
Stanford's program in Germany
is handled. After years of suc
cessful consolidation the concept
certainly calls for a reconsidera
tion by now. A carefully thought
out demand in this regard would
have found me on the side of the
letter-writers, therefore. As it is,
the critics take their task too
lightly. Though true in single
points, their criticism remains
simply destructive and must bo
rejected. If one wants to open
a constructive discussion and to
further a program, the basic
value of which is beyond doubt,
one has to regard possible im
provements first of all. Such
thoroughly worked-out propos
als from a student's standpoint
are missing so far. As long as
this is true, any protest will lack
a solid base. Independent of the
question whether the adminis
tration is wise in handling criti
cisms. the students cannot ex
pect to be taken as serious part
ners if they exhaust themselves
in complaints.
My advice would be to organ
ize a seminar, open to all inter
ested people, faculty and admin
istration included, in order to
• study the questions which
have arisen,
• examine the different pro

posals for improvement, and
• publish the results in the
form of a solidly based memo
randum.
li should be added that I dis
cussed a different conception of
Stanford in Germany at a recent
Alumni meeting in Berlin where
Dr. Walker was present. I would
be ready to give the manuscript
of my Talk as material for such
a seminar. Interested, however,
as we all are in the institution
of Stanford's overseas program,
we should avoid crossing swords
on the level of personal attacks,
unreflected sympathies or antip
athies.

• The Hard On Vietnam
Editor, The Daily:
To enlist or not to enlist: that is
the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer
The bullets and booby-traps of
outraged Cong
Or to protest against a sea of
troubles,
And by talking end them. To
register: to enroll;
Once more; and by paying our
fees to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thou
sand natural shocks
That IS'2 to 23 year olds are
heir to, 'tis a succor
Devoutly to be wish'd. To enroll,
to study;
To study: perchance to gradu
ate: ay, there's the rub;
For after that deferment what
quotas may come.
When we have taken off ibis

transparent armor,
Must Kiv'e us pause: there's the
respect
That makes grad school of so
long life;
For who would hear Ihe red and
blue marks of readers,
In loco parentis, the Registrar's
contumely,
The pangs of unauthorized love,
the meal's delay,
When he himself might his qui
etus make
With a bare ballpoint? Who
would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under n
heavy academic load,
But that the dread of something
worse than death,
The draft board from whose
greetings
No physically fit, mentally com
petent, morally straight,
Married or single 1-A ever re
covers,
Stiffens the rubber spine and
sharpens the wooden pencil.
And makes us rather those ills
we have
Than fly to others we DO know
of?
Thus fear does make cowards of I
us all.
And thus the ivy hue of learn
ing
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast
of yellow,
And undertakings of great pith
and number
With this regard their currents
turn awry
And lose the name of consensus.
Soft you now!
The unfair Madame Nhu! Bitch, 1
in thy orisons
Be all our sins remember'd.

• Kalio Rationalized
Editor, The Daily:
The time has come to clear
the air of a great fallacy—the
Stanford ratio. Stanford women
admit that they are definitely
outnumbered; however, the atti
tude of Stanford males worsens |
this situation. Hearsay has it
that certain freshman males
have sworn off females this
quarter because there are never
any available girls.
Because there are not enough !
girls to go around, onp would
think that the Stanford woman
would be in great demand. Nay:

not so! On past Friday and
Saturday nights, a good .10 per
cent of Roble Ilnll has stayed in
the dorm reading Western Civ.
Needless to say, frosh dollies
prefer the frosh males over
Western Civ, or. for that matter,
over anything.
In a school with a shortage of
women, it is impossible for wo
men to be the aggressors. Stan
ford women are therefore slaves
to the telephone.
Meanwhile, ihose very boys
who could solve all their prob
lems decide not to call. Why?
They say that Roble-ites are
probably already going out, or
else they would rather go out
with upperclassmen. (What up
perclassmen?) This is not true!
The freshman males are highly
esteemed by frosh dollies.
Roble-ites pride themselves on
not being complete rejects, but
their social life depends on Stan
ford men. t Have you ever heard
of a Stanford woman going
after a Paly High Boy?)
It is with fervor that the Stan

ford women ask that you men
keep on trying. You bring this
social disaster on yourselves.
This situation is under your con
trol; the outcome is on your
shoulders. (Dating Men of Stan
ford, l T nite!)

• 'Our Baltic ItcpiiMic?*
Editor, Tin* Daily:
In your article "Russian Stu
dents Compare Counlries" (Mori.
Nov. 20) Mr. Vadim Golovanov
likens tho Ray Area to "our Hal
tic Republic." Let us point out
that if under "our Baltic Repub
lic" "Comrad" Golovanov means
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,
under no circumstances can these
countries he referred to as "our
Baltic Republic." Even the free
western world nations have not
recognized them as part of the
Soviet Union. They are only oc
cupied by the Soviet Army.
