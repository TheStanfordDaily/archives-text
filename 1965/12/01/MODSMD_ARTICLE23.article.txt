# 'The Mind Boggles' Claim Two LASSU Observers
## 
### James Johnston Martin Gerry (alias Holmes Brandeis— Dissenting 
My first day of nursery school
my mind boggled at the display
of disgraceful, indecorous, and
dilatory conduct on the part of
my playfellows as they revelled
in a sea of meaningless trivia.
1 resolved that, whereas this
conduct was in order but rude.
I musl follow an inner duty to
bring Robertsian Creed to these
immature enfants tumbles.
The following Thursday I at
tended the meeting of the elders
wherp I related the plight of
these confused idolaters. Heart
warming in their purity and de
votion to the ideal stated in the
proselytized Word, they sent me
forth, ordained and sanctified,
for the task of bringing the
beatific vision of the Pro-Con
ceptualized Regimentation to the
discordant throng of my nursery
school. I returned eagerly to the
locus primus of those with the
errant ways.
Imbued in the logos of my rai
son d'etre was the belief, no,
the Conviction, that DISORDER
IS NOT ORDERLY. Rededicated
and Revitalized I brought this
Weltanschauung delineated in
that one transcendental master
piece, ROBERT'S RULES OF
ORDER REVISED (Harcourt,
Brace, New York, 1959.) to the
assembled wunderkind.
Their reaction was gratifying
in its spontaneity. Acceptance of
my philosophy, guised in the
form of questions permeated the
assemblage. While this Weltan
schauung is self-explanatory, I,
nevertheless, warmed by the in
stant conversion of my playfel
lows, deigned to permit that one
insidious heresy —- INQUIRY.
Searching for the answer to
these parliamentary problems is
a difficult, unrewarding, and es
sentially bucolic exercise of my
immeasurable talent.
Answers are the Seeds of Dis
content. Having allowed this her
esy liebesrauni I was now

pressed to answer these inquir
ies.
Triumph of Triumphs, T es
caped the commission of the
deadliest sin -EXPLICATION
with an oft-used but n'er abused
phrase, "I'm working on it." The
mind boggles at any other reply.
