# EDITORIAL OPINION
## A 						Third-Force Would End The Vietnam Conflict 
### 
(4'kl. Nato: On Octolwv 28 and
Kditor Steve Leopold attend
ed the semi-annual National
lYtreign Policy Conference for
Editors and Broadcasters ton
ducted by the State Department
in Washington, I).C. Speakers
included Dean Rusk, Undersecre
tary of State George Bali, Un
dersecretary of State for Kcoii
nomic Affairs Thomas Mann,

Ambassador at Large Averill
ilarriman, Assistant Secretary
of Stale for Far Eastern Affairs
William Bundy and other high
department officials. Since the
conference was conducted under
"background only" rules, quotes
of the officials cannot be direct
ly attributed.
Moreover, the following' repre
sents not only a coverage of the
conference but the author's own

analysis of the problems dis
cussed there.)
"We must convince North
Vietnam that she cannot suc
ceed by force, then take the step
back to negotiate. Now those
who disagree with the war have
every right to do so and I'll have
fend that right to the end—but
they had best realize that they
are prolonging the war."
The speaker, a high govern*

ment official and a liberal of
long standing, spoke with un
usual force in trying to defend
Administration policy s is. a vis.
the Viet Cong and the home
front dissenters. Yet he, like the
other officials at the conference,
never defined what the U.S.
wished to "step back to" or
what was "negotiable." It is this
refusal to delineate the objec
tives of American intervention
in Vietnam and the means,
aside from military might, the
Administration hopes to utilize
in achieving these goals — that
must be questioned and debated.
U.S. (ioals Unclear
What the U.S. wants in Viet
nam is not clear. The President
and his advisors use words like
"freedom" and "self determina
tion", but in the South Viet
namese context these phrases
have meant practically nothing.
The Ngo Dinh Diem regime and
the subsequent musical-chair
juntas have not granted the
peasant any more freedom than
their French predecessors; that
is, if competent and respected
journalists such as David Hal
berstam and Malcolm Browne
are to be believed. Moreover, the
U. S. backed the French prior
to Dienbienphu in refusing to
grant independence to Indo
china. and subsequently ap
proved South Vietnam's decision
not to allow the pan-Vietnam
elections provided for in the
Geneva Accords of 1954, thus
casting doubt on our commit
ment to self-determination.

On the military front, the
President has recently repudi
ated the Dulles doctrine <»112 in
cluding South Vietnam in the
forward defense perimeter of
the Western world. More than
one speaker at the conference
reiterated that the U.S. seeks
no permanent military bases in
South Vietnam. However, on
August 2") of this year, James
Res ton of the New York Times
reported from Saigon that "U.S.
bases and supply areas are be
ing constructed on a scale far
larger than is necessary to care
for the present level of Ameri
can forces therefore it is as
sumed that the buildup will con
tinue well beyond what has been
announced so far ... In fact,
the U.S. base at Canranh, which
has one of the best natural ports
in Asia, is being developed into
another Okinawa, not merely for
the purposes of this war, but as
a major power complex from
which American officials hope
a wider alliance of Asian na
tions, with the help of the U.S.,
will eventually lie able to con
tain the expansion of China."
Thus it is unclear as to wheth
er we are really committed to
an independent and neutral
South Vietnam.
Current U.S. Tactics
Similar questions crop up in
consideration of current U.S.
tactics. To quote one official,
"without the bombing in the
North, there would be a lack of
confidence in the South; it lets
the North Vietnamese know

they must pay the price and in
hibits massive infiltration." Or
ns Reston put it September 10,
"American strategy in Vietnam
is to stun the Viet Cong with
air power, force Hanoi and the
Communist National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam to sue
for peace, and then leave the
control and pacification of the
country primarily to the South
Vietnamese government . .
So far, the efficacy of this
policy has not been demon
strated. As we escalate the air
war, the North Vietnamese es
calate the ground war by send
ing more troops across the un
patrollable borders of Laos and
Cambodia. Contradictory re
ports are now emanating from
Saigon on the morale and tacti
cal condition of the Viet Cong.
One cannot tell who is winning.
It does seem clear, however,
that air power will not be
enough to turn the tide. The
only targets left for U.S. planes
are the military-civilian-indus
trial complexes of the Ilanoi-
Haiphong area. To bomb these
would, in reality, leave the
North Vietnamese no further
reason to refrain from sending
its entire 300,000 man army into
the South. The only way Ameri
ca could retaliate would he to
send even more troops to South
.Vietnam (under present condi
tions, the highly respected mili
tary authority of the New York
Times, Hanson Baldwin, has
stated that it will take approxi
mately 1,000,000 U.S. soldiers to
pacify the guerilla-plagued
South) or invade the North - a
military ally of the Russians and
the Chinese.
Increased escalation would
thus bring the U.S. to the brink
of another land war on the
Asian continent.
Prior to making this unilat
eral commitment, it would seem
wise to consider the alternatives.
Unilateral Withdrawal
The first alternative would be
for the U.S. to withdraw and
leave the Viet Cong to finish off
the Saigon government. There
is more than enough validity in
the "domino" and "chain reac
tion" theories to make such a
move extremely unwise. Thai
land, Burma, Malaya— not to
mention certain countries in
South America — would soon be
faced with similar insurrections.
It seems incumbent upon the
U.S. to insure that "national
wars of liberation" do not suc
ceed, at least as long as they
are more "communist wars of
liberation" than "national"
wars.
Another alternative is for the
U.S. to begin negotiating now.
One thinks that such bilateral
discussions, though preferable
to the present cycle of escala
tion. would also be unwise. Ne
gotiations—if acceptable to both
sides on a no-precondition basis
- would probably lead only to
partition, which would repre
sent still another triumph for
the communist tactic of "What's
mine is mine; what's yours is
negotiable." Moreover, any ne
gotiation would undoubtedly be
carried on while the fighting
continued -as was the case in
Korea. (The suggestion of both
sides withdrawing to "regroup
ing zones." even if possible in
a guerrila conflict, would only
make partition all the more in
evitable. > The morale of. U.S
and South Vietnamese troops
would then suffer and the pres
sure on the U.S. to give in at
the conference table would be
come irresistible. Moreover, par
tition would not be in the best
interests of Vietnam itself—the
land everyone is presumably
committed to aiding.

It would be wisest, therefore,
for a third-power to enter the
picture, enforce a cease-fire and
facilitate free pan-Vietnam elec
tions. Obviously, the U.N. is the
third-power in question.
On moral grounds, this alter
native appears impregnable; that
is, if the U.S. and Hanoi really
wish to see a neutral and inde
pendent Vietnam. History would
tend to support the contention
that Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people as a whole are
nationalist and anti-Chinese and,
thus, even if the NFL won
power, Vietnam would become
at worst a Titoist buffer be
tween China and the rest of
Southeast Asia. Besides, it
seems morally inconsistent for
the U.S. to advocate U.N. inter
vention in the India-Pakistan
dispute as Ambassador Gold
berg did this fall — but not in
Vietnam.
Pragmatically, this solution
would present problems. The
U.N. would have to beef-up its
present peace-keeping appartus
considerably. However, th e
moral obligation confronting
France and the Soviet Union to
help finance such an operation
would be compelling. In the
same vein, the U.S. would be
able to seize the initiative and
force Moscow to decide whether
she is to go all the way with
the increasingly militant and
xenophobic Chinese or opt for
peace and a neutral Vietnam.
The Johnson Consensus
Most importantly in prag
matic terms — and most un
fortunately for the Johnson
consensus, such a decision would
finally provide the now-morib
und GOP with an issue which it
could not resist exploiting. The
old familiar Nixon- McCarthy
ist cries of 'betrayal' and "ap
peasement' would be heard in
the land once more. However,
the President should be aware
that the cost of the present
policy is becoming too great. It
is splitting his own party, it is
disillusioning most of the rest
of the world and it is delaying
the inevitable and much-needed
U.S. confrontation with the
vital issues of China, disarma
ment and the Great Society at
home.
For these reasons, one feels
that U.S. policy in Vietnam
must be reconsidered before the
emotional commitment to the
war becomes such that it will no
longer be possible to have a
rational dialogue.
There is an obvious "precon
dition" for this debate, however,
and that is that the present
policy of escalation accompanied
by conciliatory remarks must
be abandoned. The former
makes the latter appear hypo
critical, especially when this
country continues to disdain
any diplomatic initiative that
would place the moral impera
tive for continuing the war on
the communists and might con
ceivably lead to a unified, inde
pendent and neutral Vietnam.

"background only" rules, quotes
of the officials cannot be direct
ly attributed.
Moreover, the following' repre
sents not only a coverage of the
conference but the author's own

analysis of the problems dis
cussed there.)
"We must convince North
Vietnam that she cannot suc
ceed by force, then take the step
back to negotiate. Now those
who disagree with the war have
every right to do so and I'll have
fend that right to the end—but
they had best realize that they
are prolonging the war."
The speaker, a high govern*

ment official and a liberal of
long standing, spoke with un
usual force in trying to defend
Administration policy s is. a vis.
the Viet Cong and the home
front dissenters. Yet he, like the
other officials at the conference,
never defined what the U.S.
wished to "step back to" or
what was "negotiable." It is this
refusal to delineate the objec
tives of American intervention
in Vietnam and the means,
aside from military might, the
Administration hopes to utilize
in achieving these goals — that
must be questioned and debated.
U.S. (ioals Unclear
What the U.S. wants in Viet
nam is not clear. The President
and his advisors use words like
"freedom" and "self determina
tion", but in the South Viet
namese context these phrases
have meant practically nothing.
The Ngo Dinh Diem regime and
the subsequent musical-chair
juntas have not granted the
peasant any more freedom than
their French predecessors; that
is, if competent and respected
journalists such as David Hal
berstam and Malcolm Browne
are to be believed. Moreover, the
U. S. backed the French prior
to Dienbienphu in refusing to
grant independence to Indo
china. and subsequently ap
proved South Vietnam's decision
not to allow the pan-Vietnam
elections provided for in the
Geneva Accords of 1954, thus
casting doubt on our commit
ment to self-determination.

On the military front, the
President has recently repudi
ated the Dulles doctrine <»112 in
cluding South Vietnam in the
forward defense perimeter of
the Western world. More than
one speaker at the conference
reiterated that the U.S. seeks
no permanent military bases in
South Vietnam. However, on
August 2") of this year, James
Res ton of the New York Times
reported from Saigon that "U.S.
bases and supply areas are be
ing constructed on a scale far
larger than is necessary to care
for the present level of Ameri
can forces therefore it is as
sumed that the buildup will con
tinue well beyond what has been
announced so far ... In fact,
the U.S. base at Canranh, which
has one of the best natural ports
in Asia, is being developed into
another Okinawa, not merely for
the purposes of this war, but as
a major power complex from
which American officials hope
a wider alliance of Asian na
tions, with the help of the U.S.,
will eventually lie able to con
tain the expansion of China."
Thus it is unclear as to wheth
er we are really committed to
an independent and neutral
South Vietnam.
Current U.S. Tactics
Similar questions crop up in
consideration of current U.S.
tactics. To quote one official,
"without the bombing in the
North, there would be a lack of
confidence in the South; it lets
the North Vietnamese know

they must pay the price and in
hibits massive infiltration." Or
ns Reston put it September 10,
"American strategy in Vietnam
is to stun the Viet Cong with
air power, force Hanoi and the
Communist National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam to sue
for peace, and then leave the
control and pacification of the
country primarily to the South
Vietnamese government . .
So far, the efficacy of this
policy has not been demon
strated. As we escalate the air
war, the North Vietnamese es
calate the ground war by send
ing more troops across the un
patrollable borders of Laos and
Cambodia. Contradictory re
ports are now emanating from
Saigon on the morale and tacti
cal condition of the Viet Cong.
One cannot tell who is winning.
It does seem clear, however,
that air power will not be
enough to turn the tide. The
only targets left for U.S. planes
are the military-civilian-indus
trial complexes of the Ilanoi-
Haiphong area. To bomb these
would, in reality, leave the
North Vietnamese no further
reason to refrain from sending
its entire 300,000 man army into
the South. The only way Ameri
ca could retaliate would he to
send even more troops to South
.Vietnam (under present condi
tions, the highly respected mili
tary authority of the New York
Times, Hanson Baldwin, has
stated that it will take approxi
mately 1,000,000 U.S. soldiers to
pacify the guerilla-plagued
South) or invade the North - a
military ally of the Russians and
the Chinese.
Increased escalation would
thus bring the U.S. to the brink
of another land war on the
Asian continent.
Prior to making this unilat
eral commitment, it would seem
wise to consider the alternatives.
Unilateral Withdrawal
The first alternative would be
for the U.S. to withdraw and
leave the Viet Cong to finish off
the Saigon government. There
is more than enough validity in
the "domino" and "chain reac
tion" theories to make such a
move extremely unwise. Thai
land, Burma, Malaya— not to
mention certain countries in
South America — would soon be
faced with similar insurrections.
It seems incumbent upon the
U.S. to insure that "national
wars of liberation" do not suc
ceed, at least as long as they
are more "communist wars of
liberation" than "national"
wars.
Another alternative is for the
U.S. to begin negotiating now.
One thinks that such bilateral
discussions, though preferable
to the present cycle of escala
tion. would also be unwise. Ne
gotiations—if acceptable to both
sides on a no-precondition basis
- would probably lead only to
partition, which would repre
sent still another triumph for
the communist tactic of "What's
mine is mine; what's yours is
negotiable." Moreover, any ne
gotiation would undoubtedly be
carried on while the fighting
continued -as was the case in
Korea. (The suggestion of both
sides withdrawing to "regroup
ing zones." even if possible in
a guerrila conflict, would only
make partition all the more in
evitable. > The morale of. U.S
and South Vietnamese troops
would then suffer and the pres
sure on the U.S. to give in at
the conference table would be
come irresistible. Moreover, par
tition would not be in the best
interests of Vietnam itself—the
land everyone is presumably
committed to aiding.

It would be wisest, therefore,
for a third-power to enter the
picture, enforce a cease-fire and
facilitate free pan-Vietnam elec
tions. Obviously, the U.N. is the
third-power in question.
On moral grounds, this alter
native appears impregnable; that
is, if the U.S. and Hanoi really
wish to see a neutral and inde
pendent Vietnam. History would
tend to support the contention
that Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people as a whole are
nationalist and anti-Chinese and,
thus, even if the NFL won
power, Vietnam would become
at worst a Titoist buffer be
tween China and the rest of
Southeast Asia. Besides, it
seems morally inconsistent for
the U.S. to advocate U.N. inter
vention in the India-Pakistan
dispute as Ambassador Gold
berg did this fall — but not in
Vietnam.
Pragmatically, this solution
would present problems. The
U.N. would have to beef-up its
present peace-keeping appartus
considerably. However, th e
moral obligation confronting
France and the Soviet Union to
help finance such an operation
would be compelling. In the
same vein, the U.S. would be
able to seize the initiative and
force Moscow to decide whether
she is to go all the way with
the increasingly militant and
xenophobic Chinese or opt for
peace and a neutral Vietnam.
The Johnson Consensus
Most importantly in prag
matic terms — and most un
fortunately for the Johnson
consensus, such a decision would
finally provide the now-morib
und GOP with an issue which it
could not resist exploiting. The
old familiar Nixon- McCarthy
ist cries of 'betrayal' and "ap
peasement' would be heard in
the land once more. However,
the President should be aware
that the cost of the present
policy is becoming too great. It
is splitting his own party, it is
disillusioning most of the rest
of the world and it is delaying
the inevitable and much-needed
U.S. confrontation with the
vital issues of China, disarma
ment and the Great Society at
home.
For these reasons, one feels
that U.S. policy in Vietnam
must be reconsidered before the
emotional commitment to the
war becomes such that it will no
longer be possible to have a
rational dialogue.
There is an obvious "precon
dition" for this debate, however,
and that is that the present
policy of escalation accompanied
by conciliatory remarks must
be abandoned. The former
makes the latter appear hypo
critical, especially when this
country continues to disdain
any diplomatic initiative that
would place the moral impera
tive for continuing the war on
the communists and might con
ceivably lead to a unified, inde
pendent and neutral Vietnam.

long standing, spoke with un
usual force in trying to defend
Administration policy s is. a vis.
the Viet Cong and the home
front dissenters. Yet he, like the
other officials at the conference,
never defined what the U.S.
wished to "step back to" or
what was "negotiable." It is this
refusal to delineate the objec
tives of American intervention
in Vietnam and the means,
aside from military might, the
Administration hopes to utilize
in achieving these goals — that
must be questioned and debated.
U.S. (ioals Unclear
What the U.S. wants in Viet
nam is not clear. The President
and his advisors use words like
"freedom" and "self determina
tion", but in the South Viet
namese context these phrases
have meant practically nothing.
The Ngo Dinh Diem regime and
the subsequent musical-chair
juntas have not granted the
peasant any more freedom than
their French predecessors; that
is, if competent and respected
journalists such as David Hal
berstam and Malcolm Browne
are to be believed. Moreover, the
U. S. backed the French prior
to Dienbienphu in refusing to
grant independence to Indo
china. and subsequently ap
proved South Vietnam's decision
not to allow the pan-Vietnam
elections provided for in the
Geneva Accords of 1954, thus
casting doubt on our commit
ment to self-determination.

On the military front, the
President has recently repudi
ated the Dulles doctrine <»112 in
cluding South Vietnam in the
forward defense perimeter of
the Western world. More than
one speaker at the conference
reiterated that the U.S. seeks
no permanent military bases in
South Vietnam. However, on
August 2") of this year, James
Res ton of the New York Times
reported from Saigon that "U.S.
bases and supply areas are be
ing constructed on a scale far
larger than is necessary to care
for the present level of Ameri
can forces therefore it is as
sumed that the buildup will con
tinue well beyond what has been
announced so far ... In fact,
the U.S. base at Canranh, which
has one of the best natural ports
in Asia, is being developed into
another Okinawa, not merely for
the purposes of this war, but as
a major power complex from
which American officials hope
a wider alliance of Asian na
tions, with the help of the U.S.,
will eventually lie able to con
tain the expansion of China."
Thus it is unclear as to wheth
er we are really committed to
an independent and neutral
South Vietnam.
Current U.S. Tactics
Similar questions crop up in
consideration of current U.S.
tactics. To quote one official,
"without the bombing in the
North, there would be a lack of
confidence in the South; it lets
the North Vietnamese know

they must pay the price and in
hibits massive infiltration." Or
ns Reston put it September 10,
"American strategy in Vietnam
is to stun the Viet Cong with
air power, force Hanoi and the
Communist National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam to sue
for peace, and then leave the
control and pacification of the
country primarily to the South
Vietnamese government . .
So far, the efficacy of this
policy has not been demon
strated. As we escalate the air
war, the North Vietnamese es
calate the ground war by send
ing more troops across the un
patrollable borders of Laos and
Cambodia. Contradictory re
ports are now emanating from
Saigon on the morale and tacti
cal condition of the Viet Cong.
One cannot tell who is winning.
It does seem clear, however,
that air power will not be
enough to turn the tide. The
only targets left for U.S. planes
are the military-civilian-indus
trial complexes of the Ilanoi-
Haiphong area. To bomb these
would, in reality, leave the
North Vietnamese no further
reason to refrain from sending
its entire 300,000 man army into
the South. The only way Ameri
ca could retaliate would he to
send even more troops to South
.Vietnam (under present condi
tions, the highly respected mili
tary authority of the New York
Times, Hanson Baldwin, has
stated that it will take approxi
mately 1,000,000 U.S. soldiers to
pacify the guerilla-plagued
South) or invade the North - a
military ally of the Russians and
the Chinese.
Increased escalation would
thus bring the U.S. to the brink
of another land war on the
Asian continent.
Prior to making this unilat
eral commitment, it would seem
wise to consider the alternatives.
Unilateral Withdrawal
The first alternative would be
for the U.S. to withdraw and
leave the Viet Cong to finish off
the Saigon government. There
is more than enough validity in
the "domino" and "chain reac
tion" theories to make such a
move extremely unwise. Thai
land, Burma, Malaya— not to
mention certain countries in
South America — would soon be
faced with similar insurrections.
It seems incumbent upon the
U.S. to insure that "national
wars of liberation" do not suc
ceed, at least as long as they
are more "communist wars of
liberation" than "national"
wars.
Another alternative is for the
U.S. to begin negotiating now.
One thinks that such bilateral
discussions, though preferable
to the present cycle of escala
tion. would also be unwise. Ne
gotiations—if acceptable to both
sides on a no-precondition basis
- would probably lead only to
partition, which would repre
sent still another triumph for
the communist tactic of "What's
mine is mine; what's yours is
negotiable." Moreover, any ne
gotiation would undoubtedly be
carried on while the fighting
continued -as was the case in
Korea. (The suggestion of both
sides withdrawing to "regroup
ing zones." even if possible in
a guerrila conflict, would only
make partition all the more in
evitable. > The morale of. U.S
and South Vietnamese troops
would then suffer and the pres
sure on the U.S. to give in at
the conference table would be
come irresistible. Moreover, par
tition would not be in the best
interests of Vietnam itself—the
land everyone is presumably
committed to aiding.

It would be wisest, therefore,
for a third-power to enter the
picture, enforce a cease-fire and
facilitate free pan-Vietnam elec
tions. Obviously, the U.N. is the
third-power in question.
On moral grounds, this alter
native appears impregnable; that
is, if the U.S. and Hanoi really
wish to see a neutral and inde
pendent Vietnam. History would
tend to support the contention
that Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people as a whole are
nationalist and anti-Chinese and,
thus, even if the NFL won
power, Vietnam would become
at worst a Titoist buffer be
tween China and the rest of
Southeast Asia. Besides, it
seems morally inconsistent for
the U.S. to advocate U.N. inter
vention in the India-Pakistan
dispute as Ambassador Gold
berg did this fall — but not in
Vietnam.
Pragmatically, this solution
would present problems. The
U.N. would have to beef-up its
present peace-keeping appartus
considerably. However, th e
moral obligation confronting
France and the Soviet Union to
help finance such an operation
would be compelling. In the
same vein, the U.S. would be
able to seize the initiative and
force Moscow to decide whether
she is to go all the way with
the increasingly militant and
xenophobic Chinese or opt for
peace and a neutral Vietnam.
The Johnson Consensus
Most importantly in prag
matic terms — and most un
fortunately for the Johnson
consensus, such a decision would
finally provide the now-morib
und GOP with an issue which it
could not resist exploiting. The
old familiar Nixon- McCarthy
ist cries of 'betrayal' and "ap
peasement' would be heard in
the land once more. However,
the President should be aware
that the cost of the present
policy is becoming too great. It
is splitting his own party, it is
disillusioning most of the rest
of the world and it is delaying
the inevitable and much-needed
U.S. confrontation with the
vital issues of China, disarma
ment and the Great Society at
home.
For these reasons, one feels
that U.S. policy in Vietnam
must be reconsidered before the
emotional commitment to the
war becomes such that it will no
longer be possible to have a
rational dialogue.
There is an obvious "precon
dition" for this debate, however,
and that is that the present
policy of escalation accompanied
by conciliatory remarks must
be abandoned. The former
makes the latter appear hypo
critical, especially when this
country continues to disdain
any diplomatic initiative that
would place the moral impera
tive for continuing the war on
the communists and might con
ceivably lead to a unified, inde
pendent and neutral Vietnam.

nam is not clear. The President
and his advisors use words like
"freedom" and "self determina
tion", but in the South Viet
namese context these phrases
have meant practically nothing.
The Ngo Dinh Diem regime and
the subsequent musical-chair
juntas have not granted the
peasant any more freedom than
their French predecessors; that
is, if competent and respected
journalists such as David Hal
berstam and Malcolm Browne
are to be believed. Moreover, the
U. S. backed the French prior
to Dienbienphu in refusing to
grant independence to Indo
china. and subsequently ap
proved South Vietnam's decision
not to allow the pan-Vietnam
elections provided for in the
Geneva Accords of 1954, thus
casting doubt on our commit
ment to self-determination.

On the military front, the
President has recently repudi
ated the Dulles doctrine <»112 in
cluding South Vietnam in the
forward defense perimeter of
the Western world. More than
one speaker at the conference
reiterated that the U.S. seeks
no permanent military bases in
South Vietnam. However, on
August 2") of this year, James
Res ton of the New York Times
reported from Saigon that "U.S.
bases and supply areas are be
ing constructed on a scale far
larger than is necessary to care
for the present level of Ameri
can forces therefore it is as
sumed that the buildup will con
tinue well beyond what has been
announced so far ... In fact,
the U.S. base at Canranh, which
has one of the best natural ports
in Asia, is being developed into
another Okinawa, not merely for
the purposes of this war, but as
a major power complex from
which American officials hope
a wider alliance of Asian na
tions, with the help of the U.S.,
will eventually lie able to con
tain the expansion of China."
Thus it is unclear as to wheth
er we are really committed to
an independent and neutral
South Vietnam.
Current U.S. Tactics
Similar questions crop up in
consideration of current U.S.
tactics. To quote one official,
"without the bombing in the
North, there would be a lack of
confidence in the South; it lets
the North Vietnamese know

they must pay the price and in
hibits massive infiltration." Or
ns Reston put it September 10,
"American strategy in Vietnam
is to stun the Viet Cong with
air power, force Hanoi and the
Communist National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam to sue
for peace, and then leave the
control and pacification of the
country primarily to the South
Vietnamese government . .
So far, the efficacy of this
policy has not been demon
strated. As we escalate the air
war, the North Vietnamese es
calate the ground war by send
ing more troops across the un
patrollable borders of Laos and
Cambodia. Contradictory re
ports are now emanating from
Saigon on the morale and tacti
cal condition of the Viet Cong.
One cannot tell who is winning.
It does seem clear, however,
that air power will not be
enough to turn the tide. The
only targets left for U.S. planes
are the military-civilian-indus
trial complexes of the Ilanoi-
Haiphong area. To bomb these
would, in reality, leave the
North Vietnamese no further
reason to refrain from sending
its entire 300,000 man army into
the South. The only way Ameri
ca could retaliate would he to
send even more troops to South
.Vietnam (under present condi
tions, the highly respected mili
tary authority of the New York
Times, Hanson Baldwin, has
stated that it will take approxi
mately 1,000,000 U.S. soldiers to
pacify the guerilla-plagued
South) or invade the North - a
military ally of the Russians and
the Chinese.
Increased escalation would
thus bring the U.S. to the brink
of another land war on the
Asian continent.
Prior to making this unilat
eral commitment, it would seem
wise to consider the alternatives.
Unilateral Withdrawal
The first alternative would be
for the U.S. to withdraw and
leave the Viet Cong to finish off
the Saigon government. There
is more than enough validity in
the "domino" and "chain reac
tion" theories to make such a
move extremely unwise. Thai
land, Burma, Malaya— not to
mention certain countries in
South America — would soon be
faced with similar insurrections.
It seems incumbent upon the
U.S. to insure that "national
wars of liberation" do not suc
ceed, at least as long as they
are more "communist wars of
liberation" than "national"
wars.
Another alternative is for the
U.S. to begin negotiating now.
One thinks that such bilateral
discussions, though preferable
to the present cycle of escala
tion. would also be unwise. Ne
gotiations—if acceptable to both
sides on a no-precondition basis
- would probably lead only to
partition, which would repre
sent still another triumph for
the communist tactic of "What's
mine is mine; what's yours is
negotiable." Moreover, any ne
gotiation would undoubtedly be
carried on while the fighting
continued -as was the case in
Korea. (The suggestion of both
sides withdrawing to "regroup
ing zones." even if possible in
a guerrila conflict, would only
make partition all the more in
evitable. > The morale of. U.S
and South Vietnamese troops
would then suffer and the pres
sure on the U.S. to give in at
the conference table would be
come irresistible. Moreover, par
tition would not be in the best
interests of Vietnam itself—the
land everyone is presumably
committed to aiding.

It would be wisest, therefore,
for a third-power to enter the
picture, enforce a cease-fire and
facilitate free pan-Vietnam elec
tions. Obviously, the U.N. is the
third-power in question.
On moral grounds, this alter
native appears impregnable; that
is, if the U.S. and Hanoi really
wish to see a neutral and inde
pendent Vietnam. History would
tend to support the contention
that Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people as a whole are
nationalist and anti-Chinese and,
thus, even if the NFL won
power, Vietnam would become
at worst a Titoist buffer be
tween China and the rest of
Southeast Asia. Besides, it
seems morally inconsistent for
the U.S. to advocate U.N. inter
vention in the India-Pakistan
dispute as Ambassador Gold
berg did this fall — but not in
Vietnam.
Pragmatically, this solution
would present problems. The
U.N. would have to beef-up its
present peace-keeping appartus
considerably. However, th e
moral obligation confronting
France and the Soviet Union to
help finance such an operation
would be compelling. In the
same vein, the U.S. would be
able to seize the initiative and
force Moscow to decide whether
she is to go all the way with
the increasingly militant and
xenophobic Chinese or opt for
peace and a neutral Vietnam.
The Johnson Consensus
Most importantly in prag
matic terms — and most un
fortunately for the Johnson
consensus, such a decision would
finally provide the now-morib
und GOP with an issue which it
could not resist exploiting. The
old familiar Nixon- McCarthy
ist cries of 'betrayal' and "ap
peasement' would be heard in
the land once more. However,
the President should be aware
that the cost of the present
policy is becoming too great. It
is splitting his own party, it is
disillusioning most of the rest
of the world and it is delaying
the inevitable and much-needed
U.S. confrontation with the
vital issues of China, disarma
ment and the Great Society at
home.
For these reasons, one feels
that U.S. policy in Vietnam
must be reconsidered before the
emotional commitment to the
war becomes such that it will no
longer be possible to have a
rational dialogue.
There is an obvious "precon
dition" for this debate, however,
and that is that the present
policy of escalation accompanied
by conciliatory remarks must
be abandoned. The former
makes the latter appear hypo
critical, especially when this
country continues to disdain
any diplomatic initiative that
would place the moral impera
tive for continuing the war on
the communists and might con
ceivably lead to a unified, inde
pendent and neutral Vietnam.

proved South Vietnam's decision
not to allow the pan-Vietnam
elections provided for in the
Geneva Accords of 1954, thus
casting doubt on our commit
ment to self-determination.

On the military front, the
President has recently repudi
ated the Dulles doctrine <»112 in
cluding South Vietnam in the
forward defense perimeter of
the Western world. More than
one speaker at the conference
reiterated that the U.S. seeks
no permanent military bases in
South Vietnam. However, on
August 2") of this year, James
Res ton of the New York Times
reported from Saigon that "U.S.
bases and supply areas are be
ing constructed on a scale far
larger than is necessary to care
for the present level of Ameri
can forces therefore it is as
sumed that the buildup will con
tinue well beyond what has been
announced so far ... In fact,
the U.S. base at Canranh, which
has one of the best natural ports
in Asia, is being developed into
another Okinawa, not merely for
the purposes of this war, but as
a major power complex from
which American officials hope
a wider alliance of Asian na
tions, with the help of the U.S.,
will eventually lie able to con
tain the expansion of China."
Thus it is unclear as to wheth
er we are really committed to
an independent and neutral
South Vietnam.
Current U.S. Tactics
Similar questions crop up in
consideration of current U.S.
tactics. To quote one official,
"without the bombing in the
North, there would be a lack of
confidence in the South; it lets
the North Vietnamese know

they must pay the price and in
hibits massive infiltration." Or
ns Reston put it September 10,
"American strategy in Vietnam
is to stun the Viet Cong with
air power, force Hanoi and the
Communist National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam to sue
for peace, and then leave the
control and pacification of the
country primarily to the South
Vietnamese government . .
So far, the efficacy of this
policy has not been demon
strated. As we escalate the air
war, the North Vietnamese es
calate the ground war by send
ing more troops across the un
patrollable borders of Laos and
Cambodia. Contradictory re
ports are now emanating from
Saigon on the morale and tacti
cal condition of the Viet Cong.
One cannot tell who is winning.
It does seem clear, however,
that air power will not be
enough to turn the tide. The
only targets left for U.S. planes
are the military-civilian-indus
trial complexes of the Ilanoi-
Haiphong area. To bomb these
would, in reality, leave the
North Vietnamese no further
reason to refrain from sending
its entire 300,000 man army into
the South. The only way Ameri
ca could retaliate would he to
send even more troops to South
.Vietnam (under present condi
tions, the highly respected mili
tary authority of the New York
Times, Hanson Baldwin, has
stated that it will take approxi
mately 1,000,000 U.S. soldiers to
pacify the guerilla-plagued
South) or invade the North - a
military ally of the Russians and
the Chinese.
Increased escalation would
thus bring the U.S. to the brink
of another land war on the
Asian continent.
Prior to making this unilat
eral commitment, it would seem
wise to consider the alternatives.
Unilateral Withdrawal
The first alternative would be
for the U.S. to withdraw and
leave the Viet Cong to finish off
the Saigon government. There
is more than enough validity in
the "domino" and "chain reac
tion" theories to make such a
move extremely unwise. Thai
land, Burma, Malaya— not to
mention certain countries in
South America — would soon be
faced with similar insurrections.
It seems incumbent upon the
U.S. to insure that "national
wars of liberation" do not suc
ceed, at least as long as they
are more "communist wars of
liberation" than "national"
wars.
Another alternative is for the
U.S. to begin negotiating now.
One thinks that such bilateral
discussions, though preferable
to the present cycle of escala
tion. would also be unwise. Ne
gotiations—if acceptable to both
sides on a no-precondition basis
- would probably lead only to
partition, which would repre
sent still another triumph for
the communist tactic of "What's
mine is mine; what's yours is
negotiable." Moreover, any ne
gotiation would undoubtedly be
carried on while the fighting
continued -as was the case in
Korea. (The suggestion of both
sides withdrawing to "regroup
ing zones." even if possible in
a guerrila conflict, would only
make partition all the more in
evitable. > The morale of. U.S
and South Vietnamese troops
would then suffer and the pres
sure on the U.S. to give in at
the conference table would be
come irresistible. Moreover, par
tition would not be in the best
interests of Vietnam itself—the
land everyone is presumably
committed to aiding.

It would be wisest, therefore,
for a third-power to enter the
picture, enforce a cease-fire and
facilitate free pan-Vietnam elec
tions. Obviously, the U.N. is the
third-power in question.
On moral grounds, this alter
native appears impregnable; that
is, if the U.S. and Hanoi really
wish to see a neutral and inde
pendent Vietnam. History would
tend to support the contention
that Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people as a whole are
nationalist and anti-Chinese and,
thus, even if the NFL won
power, Vietnam would become
at worst a Titoist buffer be
tween China and the rest of
Southeast Asia. Besides, it
seems morally inconsistent for
the U.S. to advocate U.N. inter
vention in the India-Pakistan
dispute as Ambassador Gold
berg did this fall — but not in
Vietnam.
Pragmatically, this solution
would present problems. The
U.N. would have to beef-up its
present peace-keeping appartus
considerably. However, th e
moral obligation confronting
France and the Soviet Union to
help finance such an operation
would be compelling. In the
same vein, the U.S. would be
able to seize the initiative and
force Moscow to decide whether
she is to go all the way with
the increasingly militant and
xenophobic Chinese or opt for
peace and a neutral Vietnam.
The Johnson Consensus
Most importantly in prag
matic terms — and most un
fortunately for the Johnson
consensus, such a decision would
finally provide the now-morib
und GOP with an issue which it
could not resist exploiting. The
old familiar Nixon- McCarthy
ist cries of 'betrayal' and "ap
peasement' would be heard in
the land once more. However,
the President should be aware
that the cost of the present
policy is becoming too great. It
is splitting his own party, it is
disillusioning most of the rest
of the world and it is delaying
the inevitable and much-needed
U.S. confrontation with the
vital issues of China, disarma
ment and the Great Society at
home.
For these reasons, one feels
that U.S. policy in Vietnam
must be reconsidered before the
emotional commitment to the
war becomes such that it will no
longer be possible to have a
rational dialogue.
There is an obvious "precon
dition" for this debate, however,
and that is that the present
policy of escalation accompanied
by conciliatory remarks must
be abandoned. The former
makes the latter appear hypo
critical, especially when this
country continues to disdain
any diplomatic initiative that
would place the moral impera
tive for continuing the war on
the communists and might con
ceivably lead to a unified, inde
pendent and neutral Vietnam.

conference but the author's own

analysis of the problems dis
cussed there.)
"We must convince North
Vietnam that she cannot suc
ceed by force, then take the step
back to negotiate. Now those
who disagree with the war have
every right to do so and I'll have
fend that right to the end—but
they had best realize that they
are prolonging the war."
The speaker, a high govern*

ment official and a liberal of
long standing, spoke with un
usual force in trying to defend
Administration policy s is. a vis.
the Viet Cong and the home
front dissenters. Yet he, like the
other officials at the conference,
never defined what the U.S.
wished to "step back to" or
what was "negotiable." It is this
refusal to delineate the objec
tives of American intervention
in Vietnam and the means,
aside from military might, the
Administration hopes to utilize
in achieving these goals — that
must be questioned and debated.
U.S. (ioals Unclear
What the U.S. wants in Viet
nam is not clear. The President
and his advisors use words like
"freedom" and "self determina
tion", but in the South Viet
namese context these phrases
have meant practically nothing.
The Ngo Dinh Diem regime and
the subsequent musical-chair
juntas have not granted the
peasant any more freedom than
their French predecessors; that
is, if competent and respected
journalists such as David Hal
berstam and Malcolm Browne
are to be believed. Moreover, the
U. S. backed the French prior
to Dienbienphu in refusing to
grant independence to Indo
china. and subsequently ap
