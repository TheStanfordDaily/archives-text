# STANFORD HISTORY
## God And Man On The Farm 
### HUGH MORAN, '50 
(Eel. Note: .Mr, iVloran, who did both undergradu
ate and graduate work at Stanford in the 1900's,
has first-hand knowledge of Stanford's religious
policy. As his letter demonstrates, lie was active
in religious affairs here and later served as Uni
versity Pastor at Cornell. He presently lives in
Palo Alto.
The founding of Stanford University by Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford was a new thing under
the sun. Most older colleges had been established
on a limited or sectarian basis, with the exception
of the Morrel Land Grant Colleges. These land
grant colleges, founded under the separation of
church and state, were originally secular.
But while church and state can be separated,
education and religion cannot be ultimately sep
arated. The people in the colleges are basically
religious, and some means of religious expression,
which is individual and social, must not only be
permitted but encouraged.
Governor and Mrs. Stanford, themselves not
university trained, founded an institution under
the best religious auspices known at that time.
The consulted the president of Harvard, who sent,
them to Dr. Andrew D. White, a Yale man. Both
of these institutions were broadly and inclusively
religious, but they had been founded as sectarian
colleges. Andrew D. White was the president of
the new university of Cornell, which was, and is,
partly land grant and partly independently en
dowed and free. Dr. White had his own private
war with certain narrow minded sectarians, who
sought the land grant endowments for them
selves, and stygmatized Cornell as a heathen
institution.
Stanford and Cornell
The Stanfords based Stanford University's
foundation on the successful experience of Dr.
White at Cornell, with a non-sectarian chapel and
freedom from sectarian worship or control, which
were definitely prohibited. Outside of regular
chapel services in both institutions, this policy
took the form of the recently invented YM and
YWCA. which are strictly non-sectarian and
non-denominational.
Stanford, like Cornell, opened before a chapel
was built. For its first twelve years regular
services were held at Stanford on Sunday morn
ing and Sunday evening in lecture hall 100 on
the Quad. They were conducted by members of
the faculty or by individually invited ministers.
Professor Thoburn, a much beloved faculty mem
ber personally a Methodist had charge of these
services until 1899. Among students interested
there were held student-led Bible classes, and
sometimes prayer groups.
There were also the Y Wand the Y M C A.
Theresa Wilbur, the sister of Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, was president of the YW; and for two
years I was president of the Y M. At the end of
the two years I went to Dr. Jordan and asked
him about organizing a Board of Directors as
faculty advisers of the Y. M. He sent me down
to ask Mrs. Stanford's opinion. To this proposal

she gave enthusiastic approval. Following the
organization of the board of directors, the YM
prospered and grew in influence and useful ac
tivities.
V >1 Had Own Building
At one time, more than half the men at Stanford
were paid up members of the Stanford YMCA.
They eventually had a building of their own; but
the organization was allowed to die out. during
the first World War. In all this the charter pro
visions for religious worship and instruction and
prohibiting sectarian activities were strictly ad
hered to. Never once was denominational worship
held or sectarian propaganda allowed.
A chance remark of mine two or three weeks
ago that I had charge of the Sunday evening
worship services in room 100 for about two years
previous to the dedication of Memorial Church
in 1903 was misunderstood by The Daily and a
conclusion reached exactly the reverse of the
facts. On the death of Dr. Thoburn some one had
to lie found to take charge of the Sunday vesper
service. which was strictly non-sectarian and an
official service of the University. I was asked by
Dr. Jordan to take charge of these services. I
arranged the schedule and invited the speakers.
My two chief dependents were President Jordan
himself and the Rev. Charles R. Brown, pastor of
the First Congregational Church of Oakland.
Prototype For Stanford
In 1919, after some years abroad, I went to
Cornell to assist in setting up a prototype of
what is now proposed at Stanford. We had from
the first a staff of six trained and ordained men,
five of them nominated and supported by five
leading Protestant denominations and approved
by the Cornell trustees. To these six chaplains
were added as rapidly as they wore available a
Roman Catholic priest and a Jewish rabbi; later
also one or more women religious leaders. This
is the Cornell Religious Work, which occupies
the Anabel Taylor Ilall at the heart of the Cornell
campus.
The staff meets weekly. Each member of the
staff is assigned some university-wide responsi
bility. At the same time each member is respon
sible for and pastor or members of his own
particular religious persuasion. Most staff mem
bers are connected with their off-campus church
to which they show due loyalty, and in which
much of their activity is carried on.
Thus the students have a wide variety of choice
of church life, and at the same time through the
United Religious Work they grow together in a
spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding.
The staff members conduct, worship services and
carry on their other activities on or off the cam
pus as may be convenient.
The Cornell religious organization has become
more and more effective during its existence of
more than forty years. It has been one of the
chief influences in pioneering in cooperative re
ligious work in American universities, and has
inspired organizations throughout the country de
voted to mutual understanding and good will.
