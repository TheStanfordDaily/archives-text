# THE 						CAPITOL SCENE
## Sibling Rivalries Among The Anti-Vietnam Groups 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
There seems to be as much
division amongst the people who
want us to get out of Viet Nam
as there is amongst the people
who want us to stay there.
Saturday, the "Students For
A Safe And Sane Dien Bien
Phu" got into a terrific argu
ment with the "Mothers For A
Neutralized Mekong Delta." Tin*
two groups were walking along
together in front of the White
Mouse when one of the mothers
said she thought we should re
main in Viet Nam until the
United States had some guaran
tors from the Ho Chi Minh re
gime. This so infuriated one of
the students he threatened to hit
her with a Viet Cong flag he
was carrying.
A teacher from the "Profes
sors Against Using Tear Gas
Against Buddhist Priests," tried
to settle the dispute, but he in
turn was accused of being a war
monger by the "Co-eds For A
Militant Peace In Pleiku."
Before any blows were struck
a leader of the "Co-ordinating
Committee To Sink The U.S.
Seventh Fleet" shouted, "Down
with the bombing of North Viet
Nam."
"What about South Viet
Nam?" someone from the
"Blood donors Of Hanoi And
Haiphong" group rctorled.
"Down with the bombing of
South Viet Nam too."
"Pull out of Saigon," said
someone from the "Citizens For
Free Speech In Hue."
"But first, negotiate," a voice
from "Fathers For Peace And
Honor In Tan Phung Phu Or
ganization" retorted.
Gas The Buddhists
Several pickets turned on him.
"Pull out first, and then negoti
ate," cried a leader of the "Sol
diers And Sailors Against The
Fourth Of July."
"Peaceful negotiations first."
retorted one of the "Women For
A White Christmas."

"Mow can we have peaceful
negotiations if we don't pull
out?" charged the President of
the "Society For The Abolish
ment Of Basic Training."
"How can we be sure of
peaceful negotiations if we do
pull out?" argued a "Moderate
Student For A Weak Southeast
Asia Policy."
"Why didn't Rusk agree to
negotiate in 1964," demanded a
man from the "Non-Violent Agi
tat ion Committee Against
World War III."
"Because Hanoi .said they
never made the offer," screamed
a woman with the "Daughters
Against The Rhodesian Revolu
tion."
"Johnson is lying to us," said
a student lighting his cigarette
on his draft card.
He offered his draft card to
two other students to light their
cigarettes.
"Three on a draft card is un
lucky." said a startled girl rep
resenting "Teen-agers For Total
Disarmament."
Lying C'ommies
"The Commies are the liars,"
heckled a Georgetown U. law
major from the "Committee To
Fly The American Flag Twenty
Four Hours A Day."
"All right, keep moving, keep
moving," a policeman from the
"Benevolent Society For Strong
er Law Enforcement" said.
"Down with the Army-Navy
game."
"Send McNamara back to
Ford."
"Bundy is a Buddhist."
And so it went all morning
long.
I was just about to take my
leave when one of the pickets
said, "Who arc you with?"
1 thought fast. "I'm with the
"Society Of Non-Violent News
papermen To Permit Luci John
son To Marry The Man She
Loves."
He asked me to join him in
singing "We Shall Overcome."
