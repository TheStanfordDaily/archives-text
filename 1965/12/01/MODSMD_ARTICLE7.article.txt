# SANFORD ON SEX
## Sex Linked To Development 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
"Sex should be seen in the context
of the development of the person to
ward full humanity," R. Nevitt San
ford, Director of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, advised
the large group gathered to partici
pate in Ihe second lecture of the sex
ual morality series sponsored by
Otero House.
Sanford contended that people
should wait until they have achieved
full "integration of personality" when
"each bit of behavior favors the func
tioning of the whole," and the whole
is favorable to the performance of
the particular act.
"The more there is to the personal
ity," he said, "the more there is to
the person, the more one can do. the
more one can respond and have con

trol over his impulses." The Stanford
faculty member continued, stating
that in "an integrated setup, partici
pation in the act is expressive of the
whole range of things in the person
ality" and more pleasure can be de
rived.
Education Inhibits Sex
This explains, he said, why Kinsey
and others found that educated people
are slower in getting started with sex.
Sanford pointed to the plight of lower
class girls who are pushed into sex
uality by the influence of mass media
and who think of themselves as sex
objects.
Sanford cited the example of Vas
sar College where a poll was taken
following President Sarah Blanding's
statement concerning sexual immoral
ity. Findings concluded that such ac
tivity was slight; the great majority,
he commented, wanted to wait and
were waiting.
Those girls who are active sexually.
Sanford said, have a low opinion of
themselves and they submit "because
they fed that it is the only way to
secure attention and it gives them a
feeling of being wanted." He feels
that men have an enormous interest
in sex in order to assure their ade
quacy as males and to demonstrate
their power and superiority before
their peers.

Sanford went on to state that the
well-being of society must be con
sidered and that people must relate
the way they behave to a universal
standard for the whole of society.
Kffect Of Contraceptives
When asked how contraceptives af
fect sexual standards, Sanford ans
wered that while people can't fall
back on dangers of pregnancy to as
sure restraint, they are not reliable
because "young girls don't want to
use contraceptives; they feel that they
are unromantic."
"Young men today have a great
deal of sensitivity," Sanford said.
"They want to be decent, yet not
backward. But it doesn't hurt for
them to wait. It isn't necessary to
have all experiences right away. They
should have time to develop their per
sonalities."
Sanford noted that when people
know each other well, they respect
each other and are mutually concern
ed, and they can make sex a part of
their love relationship. He also said
that we "shouldn't make marriage a
eiterion for a relationship, but it is
more highly favorable to sexual pleas
ure."
"If you have had to ask 'should I
or shouldn't I have intercourse,' then
obviously you're not ready." Sanford
concluded.
