# Snow Job
## Ski Club To Lease Lodge 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
With dead week and finals looming
ominously ahead, most ski bums and
snow bunnies have buried their heads
in the books. Rut Stanford's Ski Club
has acquired a ski lodge that may
tempt even the most diligent student
to head for the hills.
i Located in Norden, California, on
the south side of Highway 40 this
skiers' meeca is situated 300 yards
west of the entrance to Sugar Bowl,
three-fourths of a mile from the Don
ner Ski Ranch, close to Soda Springs,
and fifteen miles away from Squaw
Valley.
Ideal Facilities
The facilities available to Stanford
students are as ideal as the location,
according to Kay Polivka, Chairman
of the Lodging Committee of Ski Club
Ex. Com. Stanford is leasing the bot
tom floor of the three story lodge
which contains two dormitories with
a capacity of 75 persons each. The
men's and women's sleeping areas are
separated by a lounge. There are two
private showers, an unlimited supply
of hot water, and themostatically con
trolled heating. Coke and coffee ma
chines are available.

The large second floor of the lounge
will be open to Stanford skiers in the*
afternoons and by the owner's invita
tion in the evenings. The upstairs liv
ing room has a massive fireplace, a
dining room, a large kitchen, and a
bar, all of which may bo available
for after-ski parties.
Discounts On Meals
Although the eating facilities are
not included in present leasing plans,
oeupants will be offered discounts on
meals at Donner Ski Ranch $1.00
for dinner. Donner and Sugar Bowl
will also give Stanford students with
Ski Club memberships or lodge occu
pants reduced rates on lift tickets,
equipment rentals, and ski instruc
tion.
Stanford students may park their
cars in a lot across the street from the
lodge or in the Magic Carpet garage.
In addition to being situated near
Northern California's finest ski areas,
Miss Polivka also pointed out that the
Norden lodge is opposite the Univers
ity of California's lodge, down the
highway from the Mills hide-out, and
close to many other penninsuki ski
clubs' retreats.

The cost per night for Ski Club card
holders is throe dollars. Guests from
other schools or Stanford non-mem
bers will be charged $3.50. Lodgers
will have to provide their own sleep
ing bags or bed rolls.
The lodge will be open starting this
weekend and during the Winter break
from December 1G through January
2. Skiers may make reservations for
Friday and Saturday at the Ski Club
desk in the ASSU loft between 1:00
and 5:00 p.m. until Friday. Times for
signing up for Christmas dates will
be announced to living groups early
in December.
Card Carriers Privileged
Ski Club membership cards may al
so be purchased at those times for
the cost of one dollar. The card en
titles its owner to enjoy the privileges
of the lodge and also to participate in
the Stanford Winter Carnival to be
held at Squaw Valley January 5S
through 9. The two-day festivities will
include advanced skier competition,
fun races for beginners, nightly par
ties featuring "The Coasters," ice skat
ing, and mealsâ€”all for the price of
$19.00.
Following Winter Carnival, the Nor
den lodge will be open seven days a
week until May 1, 1906. Ski club of
ficers or other affiliated personnel
will staff the lodge at all times. Buses
to transport weekend skiers may be
arranged later in the season. Skiers
may drop by the lodge without reser
vations, but space may already be
filled with enthusiastic ski-toting
plan-aheaders.
