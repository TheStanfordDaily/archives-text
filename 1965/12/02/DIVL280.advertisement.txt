Sex Without Sorrow
More and more today sex is being billed as the thing to do and even
among collegians there is often little concern about the right and wtong of
free sexual expression. Some who look at marriage as the ultimate place for
sex openly advocate premarital ' experience as if one were in training for mar
riage. Quite a few think that the sexual drive is in the same class as physical
hunger, justifying their immorality by saying that repression breeds neurosis.
The wrong kind of sex not only never satisfies but does lead to emotional prob
lems, guilt, and anxiety from which some people never recover. Perhaps you
are amortg those who are discovering these ' facts of life byex perience. As
much as one would like to believe otherwise at times, the right and wrong
of sex are established laws of our beinq which, when violated, inevitably have
unhappy consequences.
Our Creator as given man strong drives for procreation, and a great potential
for love. The Christian view of sex is not one of represison and puritanical self
denial, but one which calls attention to the one proper channel of sexual expres
sion which God has provided. Within the bounds of holy matrimony sex is
beautiful and sacred, complementing other aspects of the relationship to pro
duce deep ties of love. God alone provides the self-control we need in single
life, and God alone can bring true sexual freedom and fulfillment within mar
riage. Only when God is in control, however, are the energies and drives of
our human nature channeled into their proper use.
Jesus Christ amplifies God's view of sex by pointing to the motive of the
heart as well as the overt act, for morality is deeper than deeds and stronger
than the surface behavior. In fact, said Jesus, ' You have heard that it was
said, 'you shall not commit adultery', but I say to you that everyone who looks
at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
(Matthew 5:27-28)
The key to self-control in matters of sex, and to true morality in marriage
or outside of marriage is a personal relationship to Jesus Christ who alone can
change that depraved human heart which is bent on sinning.
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? ;
Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
robbers, will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you,but you
were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God." (I Corinthinians 6:9-1 1)
Perhaps you have not yet experienced the indwelling, delivering, saving
power of Jesus Christ in your life. Perhaps you do not know the cleansing and
renewing which only He can bring. Jesus Christ does not propose leading you
down a narrow road of self-negation, but down a path of fulfillment and hap
piness. He wants you to reach your fullest potential as a man or woman, sex
included, that you may know life to its fullest and deepest. Why not let Jesus
Christ lead you today?

denial, but one which calls attention to the one proper channel of sexual expres
sion which God has provided. Within the bounds of holy matrimony sex is
beautiful and sacred, complementing other aspects of the relationship to pro
duce deep ties of love. God alone provides the self-control we need in single
life, and God alone can bring true sexual freedom and fulfillment within mar
riage. Only when God is in control, however, are the energies and drives of
our human nature channeled into their proper use.
Jesus Christ amplifies God's view of sex by pointing to the motive of the
heart as well as the overt act, for morality is deeper than deeds and stronger
than the surface behavior. In fact, said Jesus, ' You have heard that it was
said, 'you shall not commit adultery', but I say to you that everyone who looks
at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
(Matthew 5:27-28)
The key to self-control in matters of sex, and to true morality in marriage
or outside of marriage is a personal relationship to Jesus Christ who alone can
change that depraved human heart which is bent on sinning.
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? ;
Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
robbers, will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you,but you
were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God." (I Corinthinians 6:9-1 1)
Perhaps you have not yet experienced the indwelling, delivering, saving
power of Jesus Christ in your life. Perhaps you do not know the cleansing and
renewing which only He can bring. Jesus Christ does not propose leading you
down a narrow road of self-negation, but down a path of fulfillment and hap
piness. He wants you to reach your fullest potential as a man or woman, sex
included, that you may know life to its fullest and deepest. Why not let Jesus
Christ lead you today?

Sex Without Sorrow
More and more today sex is being billed as the thing to do and even
among collegians there is often little concern about the right and wtong of
free sexual expression. Some who look at marriage as the ultimate place for
sex openly advocate premarital ' experience as if one were in training for mar
riage. Quite a few think that the sexual drive is in the same class as physical
hunger, justifying their immorality by saying that repression breeds neurosis.
The wrong kind of sex not only never satisfies but does lead to emotional prob
lems, guilt, and anxiety from which some people never recover. Perhaps you
are amortg those who are discovering these ' facts of life byex perience. As
much as one would like to believe otherwise at times, the right and wrong
of sex are established laws of our beinq which, when violated, inevitably have
unhappy consequences.
Our Creator as given man strong drives for procreation, and a great potential
for love. The Christian view of sex is not one of represison and puritanical self
denial, but one which calls attention to the one proper channel of sexual expres
