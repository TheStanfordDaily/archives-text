# Sectarian Worship Thought Non-Divisive
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor (Eleventh in a series 
Ed Note: 'Krotlier* Kruee Campbell, as we af
fectionately term him, announced last week
that "the end is near." Indeed it is, for this is
the concluding article in the series.
Extending the range of worship available
to students would: 1» better implement the in
tentions of the founders and the provisions of
the Charter; and 2> enable a broader interpre
tation of the scope and importance of religious
activities and the student's vital role in them.
This has been the consensus of the wide
range of University personnel from the chap
lain to professors to students- who have been
interviewed for this series.
What has happened this quarter to show
progress in implementation of these hopes?
• The full-time campus ministers were
named chaplain's associates, "a recognition of
the cooperative religious program in which
they play a vital part," according to chaplain
R. M. Minto.
• Work was begun to find the ministers
temporary office space and plans were drafted
for their permanent housing in a 'religious
center' to be built behind Memorial Church.
"The closer cooperation among the ministers
and the expansion of the'program provided
by the Berry money makes this question of
office space an acute one." Minto said.
• Student representation on the President's
Advisory Committee on .Religious Activities
was granted by President Sterling. "This is
tangible recognition by the University that

students have a legitimate part to play in the
formulation of religious policy," said ASSU
Vice President Clark Brown, who submitted
the petition asking for students on the Com
mit tee.
• Reports from several sources indicate
that the question of worship is moving to
resolution with all speed consequent to an
issue "with thorny legal implications."
The problem stems from the Founding
Grant of the University, which states that
"the University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis .... the moral and religious development
of the University will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denominational alli
ances, however slight the bond may be."
Present Policy Prohibitive
The resultant policy has been to prohibit
all worship but the 'non-denominational' serv
ices in Memorial Church, a stand which many
feel is not only against the wishes of the
founders but may be in violation of the Found
ing Grant.
The Stanfords were, as many observers have
noted this year and in the past, "extremely
religious people," although they professed no
specific- denominational affiliation. Thus the
establishment of the University as non-denom
inational a 1 a time of 'sectarianism run ram
pant' was almost unprecedented. The founders
were convinced of the importance of religion
in the university; the Grant instructs "to have
taught in the University the immortality of
the soul, the existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that obedience to His

laws is the highest duty ot man.
And the spirit of the founders was one of
toleration and revolution with the intent of
fostering cooperation and the prevention of
the University's becoming an 'instrument' of
any religious group. (The Trustees are
charged to "prohibit sectarian instruction."»
Ambiguities In Present Policy
Besides better representing the ideals of the
founders, the allowing all faiths to worship
on campus would remove any ambiguity that
the present policy may be in violation of the
Grant.
"Only one denomination is now allowed,"
Edwin M. Good, professor of religious studies,
has said. "There would be less a 'bond' if all
faiths were allowed to worship."
The uniting of the chaplain's office and the
denominational ministers' in a "common min
istry to the campus" means that worship
should now be viewed, the chaplain feels, as
merely one expression of a united religious
program, rather than as the conceding of a
privilege to an outsider.
"1 view the Founding Grant as enabling, not
inhibiting," he explained. "The Grant was con
cerned with prohibiting any group's working
for itself to the exclusion of others. We feel
the non-sectarian provisions of the Charter
are guaranteed by the nature of our group,
cooperative in nature and geared to the ecu
menical spirit of the times."
"A mere administrative decision is all that
is now required to put into effect what is ob
viously implied in the current religious situa
tion." Father John Duryea, Catholic chaplain

to Stantord adds.
The importance of resolving the worship
issue was stressed by Prof. Good. "Worship
is the basic issue in the euri'ent evaluation of
religion; without resolution of this issue, it
is impossible to establish the limits of student
religious life on campus."
"Worship is obviously a major part of re
ligion. If it is curtailed, all other religious
activity is limited. But if it is free, ail else is
allowed. Because many other things go auto
matically with worship, constraints are placed
around the Presidential Committee's consid
eration of other religious activities until the
question of worship is decided."
The committee is charged with "a survey
of the nature and scope of religious activities
at Stanford." "It should be completed this
year," Dean Richard Lyman, chairman of the
Committee, reported.
The Committee was formed in the spring of
19(34, following a gift to the University by
alumnus Lowell Berry of $1.3 million. The
gift earns about $30,000 a year income.
Committee's Work
Lyman views the Committee's work last:
year as largely "educational." Some "interim
recommendations" were made to the Presi
dent. This year he forsees the submission of
"comprehensive recommendations," and ex
pects more news to come out of the Commit
tee "across our whole area of concern."
He looks for the directions of future
changes to include "some broadening of the
meaning of 'religious activities,' and further
ecumenical cooperation." The Committee has

also been considering "additional strength" lor
the religious program, which would include
the chaplain hopes a coordinator of religious
programs.
The only announced action of the Commit tee
so far this year has been the approval of the
ASSU petition for membership on the Commit
tee. The petition had stated that "there are
few areas at Stanford where students can be
so personally and deeply affected as religion.
It is therefore useful that students should be
consulted and help to determine University
policies in this area."
The importance of recognizing and encour
aging student initiative was stressed by Prof.
Good. "For student religious life to be vital,
students must be interested. This will be ac
complished if some of the initiative comes
from them. The identification of the things to
be done should come from the students."
But the University has a further role to
play in the recognition of the place of religion
in the university. "Religion cannot be overly
confident, of its grasp of truth. Liut it can with
integrity serve as a catalyst for 'humanizing'
the educational process, the Rev. James Cor
son of the United Campus Christian Ministry
has stated.
Chaplain's Associates
The designation of the campus ministers as
chaplain's associates formalizes the close tie
to the University developed by the ministers
in recent years, he feels and "makes possible
our fuller participation and more significant
involvement in the life of the University."
