Films
Saturday's Film Series offering at Tresidder is FROM HERE
TO ETERNITY, a war flick directed by Fred Zinneman, starring
Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.
Sunday's Flick is ALL IN A NIGHT'S WORK, a comedy of sorts.
The Bijou has two returnees, DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES and
TOPKAPI. "Wine" stars Jack Lemmon in a bittersweet tale of
love; "Topkapi" is a jewelled dagger caper starring Melinda Mer- i
couri, Maximilian Schell. and Peter Ustinov.
The Fine Arts will continue for a while longer with CASANOVA '
TO, which stars Marcelle Mastroianni as a NATO officer who can j
only make love when mortal danger is involved. He singlehandedly j
saves the movie. With it is LET'S TAIJv ABOUT WOMEN, a ;
pleasant suggestion indeed.
Rod Steiger, THE PAWNBROKER, is still doing business at the
Guild. This searing drama about a Jew's double failure has been
described as headed for an Academy Award for sure.
The Paris has YOU MUST BE JOKING, and I'm not. But it also i
has KING RAT, a really excellent movie which is reviewed at some '
length on this page.
THE KNACK and THE TRAIN (see review on this page) will be
at the Park until next Wednesday, when THE HILL, starring Sean
Connery as a prisoner in a British camp in North Africa, and
OPERATION C ROSSBOW, in which George Peppard and Sophia
Loren try to reach and destroy the German V-2 rockets before they
destroy London, will be playing.
The Stanford has WRONG ARM OF THE LAW, a Peter Sellers
movie (so it's bound to be funny) and the newly-released SANDS
OF KALAHARI, where everybody gets pretty dusty. Expect grit
in your teeth if you go.
The Varsity will wow its audiences with Charleton Heston in
THK WAR LORD, a medieval tale which turns on a bit of legalized
promiscuity. Needless to say, there will be plenty of blood and sex,
and Heston will keep his teeth clenched throughout the whole
thing, as usual. With "War Lord" is LOVE AND KISSES, a change
of pace starring, who else, Ricky Nelson.

On Friday at 8:30 p.m., the STANFORD UNIVERSITY CHORUS
will present its quarterly concert under the direction of Professor

to arrive at Church at least an hour early, or you may find yourself
turned away.)
