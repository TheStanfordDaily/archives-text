# Great Race In 'The Train'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Some movies are plagued with bad writing
and mediocre acting and still manage to
come oin on top; such a one is "The Train,"
and what save it are a good idea, some fine
directing, and the French National Railway.
First of all, the train in question is a very
special one, not loaded with anything so
obvious as troops or artillery, but with care
fully selected art from the museums of
France. For time is running out on Hitler's
Germany; the Allies are advancing on Paris
and almost certainly will take the city. Paul
Scofield, as the German colonel in charge of
thr l siolen art, decides to pack it up and ship
it back to the Fatherland by train.
In public, he pleads that the paintings are
more valuable than gold are thus of vital
importance to the Third Reich. Actually, he
is something of an esthete and would like
10 have the masterpieces all to himself. Any
way, he loads ihem aboard and prepares to
ship them off.
The Resistance
Naturally, he can't he allowed to succeed;
so the Resistance asks railroadman Labiche
(Burt Lancasteri and friends to sop what
can be done. Lancaster just happens to be

in charge of the Paris railroad yards, you
see; he also happens to he violently opposed
to risking lives for a cargo of painting he's
never seen and could care less about.
However, after a rather neat sabotage job
on an artillery train, he is drawn into ihe
conspiracy by both his friends and Scofield.
Scofield picks him to engineer the train; his
friends convince him that the art is worth it.
The idea is to seem to be going to Germany
while in reality not going to Germany, and
thus delay the train long enough for the
allies to reach Paris and rescue it. Lancast
er's scheme is ingenious, and his emergency
measures are extremely resourceful; they
are also, however, extremely costly, in lives
as well as locomotives lost.
Lives or Art?
And the real question is not whether Ihe
train will be saved, or who Scofield who
can appreciate art or Lancaster who can't
ought to have the paintings, but whether the
cost ol saving them was more than they were
worth, whether the price all men must pay
for the preservation of culture is too high.
That this question is deliberately being
asked, in words and by the camera, makes
"The Train" mildly interesting intellectually;

what makes it really exciting visually and
satisfying emotionally is the action itself.
Not coini .it with a Hollywood scale model,
director John Frankenheimer enlisted the aid
of the aforementioned French National Rail
way and used the real thing locomotives
and cars from World War 11. riding on
French rails through French countryside ami
French towns. When the engines go hurtlh.g
into one another oi run off the tracks, the
craekup is not illusion hut reality, and on a
spectacular scale.
Increased Tension
This excitement only increases the tension
already created by Frankenheimer'? dir >
tion. He keeps everyone and everything mov
ing inexorably towards what is obviously
going to be Armageddon for the Germans,
and maybe the French, too. lie puts the cam
era on his actors' shoulders, so that it actu
ally becomes Ihe actor, peering anxiously
down the tr.uks at the train or fearfully up
on the hill at a saboteur.
And he doe? it so well that Burt Lancast
er's and Paul Scofield's slipshod acting, and
the fact that they hardly ever have anything
decent to say, seems really unimportant.
What is important is thai "The Train" is as
exciting a race as has been run in a long
time.

time.
Some movies are plagued with bad writing
and mediocre acting and still manage to
come oin on top; such a one is "The Train,"
and what save it are a good idea, some fine
directing, and the French National Railway.
First of all, the train in question is a very
special one, not loaded with anything so
obvious as troops or artillery, but with care
fully selected art from the museums of
France. For time is running out on Hitler's
Germany; the Allies are advancing on Paris
and almost certainly will take the city. Paul
Scofield, as the German colonel in charge of
thr l siolen art, decides to pack it up and ship
it back to the Fatherland by train.
In public, he pleads that the paintings are
more valuable than gold are thus of vital
importance to the Third Reich. Actually, he
is something of an esthete and would like
10 have the masterpieces all to himself. Any
way, he loads ihem aboard and prepares to
ship them off.
The Resistance
Naturally, he can't he allowed to succeed;
so the Resistance asks railroadman Labiche
(Burt Lancasteri and friends to sop what
can be done. Lancaster just happens to be

in charge of the Paris railroad yards, you
see; he also happens to he violently opposed
to risking lives for a cargo of painting he's
never seen and could care less about.
However, after a rather neat sabotage job
on an artillery train, he is drawn into ihe
conspiracy by both his friends and Scofield.
Scofield picks him to engineer the train; his
friends convince him that the art is worth it.
The idea is to seem to be going to Germany
while in reality not going to Germany, and
thus delay the train long enough for the
allies to reach Paris and rescue it. Lancast
er's scheme is ingenious, and his emergency
measures are extremely resourceful; they
are also, however, extremely costly, in lives
as well as locomotives lost.
Lives or Art?
And the real question is not whether Ihe
train will be saved, or who Scofield who
can appreciate art or Lancaster who can't
ought to have the paintings, but whether the
cost ol saving them was more than they were
worth, whether the price all men must pay
for the preservation of culture is too high.
That this question is deliberately being
asked, in words and by the camera, makes
"The Train" mildly interesting intellectually;

what makes it really exciting visually and
satisfying emotionally is the action itself.
Not coini .it with a Hollywood scale model,
director John Frankenheimer enlisted the aid
of the aforementioned French National Rail
way and used the real thing locomotives
and cars from World War 11. riding on
French rails through French countryside ami
French towns. When the engines go hurtlh.g
into one another oi run off the tracks, the
craekup is not illusion hut reality, and on a
spectacular scale.
Increased Tension
This excitement only increases the tension
already created by Frankenheimer'? dir >
tion. He keeps everyone and everything mov
ing inexorably towards what is obviously
going to be Armageddon for the Germans,
and maybe the French, too. lie puts the cam
era on his actors' shoulders, so that it actu
ally becomes Ihe actor, peering anxiously
down the tr.uks at the train or fearfully up
on the hill at a saboteur.
And he doe? it so well that Burt Lancast
er's and Paul Scofield's slipshod acting, and
the fact that they hardly ever have anything
decent to say, seems really unimportant.
What is important is thai "The Train" is as
exciting a race as has been run in a long
time.
