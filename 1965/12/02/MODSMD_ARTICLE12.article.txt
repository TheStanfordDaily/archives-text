# Osborne Finishes Series With Medical View Of Sex
## People's Choice 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
"The double standard between
private and public morality is a
fact of life," Dr. Maurice Os»
borne, Executive Director of
the Student Health Service,
stated last night in the third
and final program of the Otero
Sexual Morality Symposium.
Dr. Osborne stressed the role
of the physician in his respons
ibility lo both the individual and
to society as a whole. He added
that a double standard "smacks
of hypocrisy for many people"
but is a reality the medical pro
fession must face.
The doctor, he stated, is often
considered a dispenser of
"chaste manuals on how to do
it." He is too often seen as a
technician or even a teacher.
Medical men, claimed Dr. Os
borne, could be of immense
value as consultants on individ
ual problems rather than on
"stereotyped models" about
"when and how to do it"and
"when it doesn't count."

Sex as a whole, said Osborne,
should be approached more from
the angle of "where do 1 fit in?"
rather than from a mechanical
point of view. The mechanical
or objective treatment of sex to
day he considers a reaction to
puritanical taboos.
With our emphasis on objec
tivity, he said, we are running
the risk of turning "the very
best part of a very close rela
tionship" into gimmiekery.
Dr. Osborne voiced his dis
agreement with the view that
"We don't have disease and
pregnancy going for us any
more." He explained that with
the fear removed, we could base
sex on the meaning to our per
sonal lives and relationships.
"A sexual relationship cannot
last without a permanent hu
man relationship," ho pointed
out.
Even with the pregnancy bar
rier removed, Dr. Osborne
stated, men and women still ap

proach sex differently. Women
tend to "clothe the relation with
more totality" than men.
In regard to the official posi
tion of the Stanford Health
Service, Dr. Osborne mentioned
that a prescription for contra
ceptives must be based on "some
genuine acceptable evidence of
sexual responsibility, in 01 her
words, marriage or formal plans
for it."
In the case of unwanted preg
nancy, the Health Service will
"go all the way" to therapeutic
abortion, if necessary, but will
not support illegal abortion.
Answering questions, Dr. Os
borne stressed his favor of con
siderably liberalizing abortion
laws, especially in cases where
there is a "90 per cent risk of a
subnormal child." He added that
therapeutic abortions are now
interpreted to be based on sav
ing the "goodness of the life of
the mother" as well as the life
itself.

"The double standard between
private and public morality is a
fact of life," Dr. Maurice Os»
borne, Executive Director of
the Student Health Service,
stated last night in the third
and final program of the Otero
Sexual Morality Symposium.
Dr. Osborne stressed the role
of the physician in his respons
ibility lo both the individual and
to society as a whole. He added
that a double standard "smacks
of hypocrisy for many people"
but is a reality the medical pro
fession must face.
The doctor, he stated, is often
considered a dispenser of
"chaste manuals on how to do
it." He is too often seen as a
technician or even a teacher.
Medical men, claimed Dr. Os
borne, could be of immense
value as consultants on individ
ual problems rather than on
"stereotyped models" about
"when and how to do it"and
"when it doesn't count."

Sex as a whole, said Osborne,
should be approached more from
the angle of "where do 1 fit in?"
rather than from a mechanical
point of view. The mechanical
or objective treatment of sex to
day he considers a reaction to
puritanical taboos.
With our emphasis on objec
tivity, he said, we are running
the risk of turning "the very
best part of a very close rela
tionship" into gimmiekery.
Dr. Osborne voiced his dis
agreement with the view that
"We don't have disease and
pregnancy going for us any
more." He explained that with
the fear removed, we could base
sex on the meaning to our per
sonal lives and relationships.
"A sexual relationship cannot
last without a permanent hu
man relationship," ho pointed
out.
Even with the pregnancy bar
rier removed, Dr. Osborne
stated, men and women still ap

proach sex differently. Women
tend to "clothe the relation with
more totality" than men.
In regard to the official posi
tion of the Stanford Health
Service, Dr. Osborne mentioned
that a prescription for contra
ceptives must be based on "some
genuine acceptable evidence of
sexual responsibility, in 01 her
words, marriage or formal plans
for it."
In the case of unwanted preg
nancy, the Health Service will
"go all the way" to therapeutic
abortion, if necessary, but will
not support illegal abortion.
Answering questions, Dr. Os
borne stressed his favor of con
siderably liberalizing abortion
laws, especially in cases where
there is a "90 per cent risk of a
subnormal child." He added that
therapeutic abortions are now
interpreted to be based on sav
ing the "goodness of the life of
the mother" as well as the life
itself.
