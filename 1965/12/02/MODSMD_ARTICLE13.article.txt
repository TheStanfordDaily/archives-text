## LOST JOB President Aided 
### 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (CPSt
Efforts to recall the student
body president at the University
of North Carolina are not dead
as was suspected when an elec
tion commission declared a re
call petition invalid.
President Paul Dickson was
convicted last August on a Cam
pus Code violation after he took
a coed into a closed fraternity
house. Dickson received an offi
cial reprimand and the coed was
suspended from the university - .
This has become a major issue
on the Chapel Hill campus this
fall. The Administration had
threatened to reopen Dickson's
case if he did not resign. The
threat was later withdrawn.
The administration warned the
board that oversees the Campus
Code that decisions would have
to be handed down equally for
the same violation, a reference
to the different penalties meted
out hi the Dickson case.
At North Carolina, a recall pe
tition must contain the signa
tures of at least 15 pel cent of
the student body for an election
to be called.
The election commission ruled
55 names on the petition invalid,
and thus it fell short of the
needed number by 5,"5.
If a valid petition is submitted,
the elections commission must
call a campus-wide election to
consider Dickson's status.
