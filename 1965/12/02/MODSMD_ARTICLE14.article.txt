# Amherst 'Rat Fink'
## 
### 
AMI I ERST, Mass. (CPS) Stu
dents at Amherst College are
protesting a new set of rules,
including a so-called "rat-link"
clause which makes all residents
in each dormitory responsible
for reporting violations of the
social code.
Student protest has taken the
form of college-wide discussions
and letters to the student paper,
the Amherst Student. About 100
students have not handed in
signed honor code cards, by
which a student indicates he is
willing to abide by the social
code, including the "rat-link"
clause.
The student council is organ
izing a poll of all students on the
social hours issue and is encour
aging all dormitories to elect
representatives to a student in
ler-dormitoi y council, which is
in charge of formulating the so
cial code.
Along wilh the exclusion of
Ihe "rat-fink" clause, students
are demanding an extension of
the hours during which women
are allowed to visit the dormi
tories.
