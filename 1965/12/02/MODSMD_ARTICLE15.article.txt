# Students Spend Holiday in South
## 
### 
Five major civil rights organizations arc enlisting college stu
dents to spend a "Freedom Christmas" in the South.
Sludents selected for the project will work during their Christ
mas vacations in on-going Negro voter-registration drives in Mis
sissippi, Alabama. Georgia, Louisiana. North Carolina, and South
Carolina.

Between 300 and 600 colic,;e
students from across the nation
are expected to participate in
the project, sponsored by the
Student Nonviolent Coordin t
ing Committee (SNCO. the
Mississippi Freeo Democratic
Party <MFDP>, the Congress Of
Racial Equality (COKE), the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference <SCLC> and the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
"Freedom Christmas" volun
teers will work primarily in
counties which have federal reg
istrars. The project hopes to
help Negroes register to vote
now that the Voting Rights Bill
has provided a vehicle for stu
dent involvement.
The recruiting and initial
screening of applicants is being
handled by the National Stu
dent Association (NSA). The
civil rights organizations them

selves will make the final sclec
t ions.
Volunteers will urge Negroes
!o register by door-to-door can
\ -sing, will assist in organiz
ing and publicizing local meet
ings on voter registration, and
will help administer voter cduea-
I ion projects.
They will live with local fam
ilies and will be required to pro
vide their own expenses and
transportation.
Steve Arons, national director
of "Freedom Christmas," feels
a particular urgency in getting
eligible Negroes registered as
soon as possible, since "in all of
the Southern states, a Senator
ial seal, Congressional scats,
and large portions of state,
county, and municipal offices
will be decided in 1966."
Kent Hudson. Stanford coor
dinator for the project, asks stu
dents interested in the project
to call him a t 323-2523.
