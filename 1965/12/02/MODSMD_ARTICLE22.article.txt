# Card Ruggers Host Tourney
## 
### 
Saturday, Stanford's rugby
team under Coach Pete Kmeto
vie will host its anual Seven-a-
Side Tournament. The tourna
ment is a double elimination af
fair completely run in one day.
Festivities begin at 9 a.m. and
end in the late afternoon.
Thus far over 40 teams have
entered the competition, includ
ing teams from USC, UCLA,
and Brigham Young. Last year,
there was a team from Seattle
among the 36 entrees.
There will be at least four
Stanford teams in the fray.
As defending champs, Stan
ford I, composed of varsity play
ers, is the favorite. But the ATO
and Delt entries are no push
overs as they demonstrated
last year, finishing high up in
the standings. This year the
Beta's will also enter a team.
Contests will be held on the
Rugby Field and on the frosh
football practice field.
