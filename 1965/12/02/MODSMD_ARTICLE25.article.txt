## Star Romps 
### JOHN CALMORE 
Fremont's lightning offense
struck three times before the
Sigma Chis could get going as
th<> Stern team thundered over
the defending champion Chis 19-
(>. Fremont will meet the power
ful Phi Delts, 13-6 winners over
Theta Chi, tomorrow afternoon
to battle for the intramural fool
ball championship. The big clash
will begin at 3:40.
Fremont scored on the open
ing drive when Roger Kitehing
made a diving, one-handed re
ception of a short pass from
Stan Smith. Fremont continued

to dominate the game from this
moment on. The Sigma Chi of
fensive threatened once in the
first half, but Have "Man Moun
tain" jfew and John Stitt rushed
the Chis to death, with Stitt bat
ting down at least four passes in
the game.
Chi Offense Inert
Coming back in the second
half with a 7-0 lead, Smith passed
to Mick Alexander and Stitt as
Fremont moved to the two.
Smith swept right end for these
final two, and it was 13-0. The
Sigma Chi offense remained in
ert, largely due t<> defenders

Dick Ammorman and Pat Brady.
The game was put out of
reach when Smith hit St it t for
a 25-vard touchdown. With little
lime remaining, the Chis showed
an amazing ability to heat the
clock as Paul Hazelrig finally
put them on the scoreboard with
a 10-yard pass to Frank Ohlrich.
But i h(> Cliis had fallen, and for
Fremont, who lost the champion
ship to them last year, it was
what one calls "sweet revenge."
In the other semi-final game,
Pat Concannon's passes gave the
Phi Del Is a 13-0 lead, with John
Raitehel catching a 40-yard strike
in the first half and Skip Soren
son scoring on a 20-yard strike
iti the second half. The rush of
hig Jim Kroener and the defen
sive efforts of Jeff Thigpen and
Tom Congoran secured the Phi
Deli's win, giving only a late
Theta Dell score. With about
seven minutes in Hie game, The
ta Dell Quarterback Fred Mose
le\ tossed a touchdown to Mike
Walsh. Thus the previously un
defeated Theta Dell's high-flying
