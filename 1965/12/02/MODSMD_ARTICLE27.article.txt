# Autonomy And Fraternities The AKL Alternative
## 
### 
In the last five years, three of Stanford's 23
fraternities have decided to go local and an
other—Sigma Clii—will most probably be added
to this list in the forseeable future.
For three of these fraternities—the ATOs,
Beta Chi's and Sigma Chi's—the compelling
reason for disaffiliation was a difference in
principle with the national on the issue of
"de facto" segregation and discrimination. In
making such a decision, each of these houses
opted for a fraternity system that would more
nearly reflect the mores and interests of the
Stanford community instead of the composite
community of the national, which is often
regional I\ (i.e. Southern) based.
However, the AKI/s, by deciding to go local
purely for the sake of autonomy, have brought
to light a new and more fundamental question
which should concern every fraternity on
campus. Of what value, exactly, is the national
fraternity?
On a tangible basis, the national provides its
locals with a constitution, initiation and ritual
procedures, a pin, a magazine and a place to
sleep on the road. According to its proponents,
the national offers other intangible assets such
as prestige and security (i.e. "it you're in
trouble, well bail von out").

We think that each of these "assets "—except
perhaps that pin—is questionable. The AKL's
decided that instead of paying $3.50 per man
per month, they would prefer to write their
own initiation procedures, institute their own
pledge education process and bail themselves
out of trouble if necessary.
Fraternities are not in danger at Stanford.
Last year, some 497 freshmen pledged, a figure
markedly larger than that of the previous two
years—l2o and 400 respectively. Moreover, the
commitment of the University—and the local
alumni—in terms of funds for the new cluster
system, is obvious.
Thus, a rational consideration of the Akf.
alternative need not be considered in a context
of reform or be eliminated. Rather, the 'assets'
of affiliation—prestige, security, pins, maga
zines. convenience—should be carefully con
sidered in relation to their cost. That cost being
a financial and philosophical commitment to a
non-Stanford entity, one which may either be
years—if not decades—behind the local chapter
philosophically or may be using the funds of
a successful local here to build new houses
elsewhere.
In mam instances, we think the fraternities
on campus would do well to opt for autonomy.

on campus would do well to opt for autonomy.
In the last five years, three of Stanford's 23
fraternities have decided to go local and an
other—Sigma Clii—will most probably be added
to this list in the forseeable future.
For three of these fraternities—the ATOs,
Beta Chi's and Sigma Chi's—the compelling
reason for disaffiliation was a difference in
principle with the national on the issue of
"de facto" segregation and discrimination. In
making such a decision, each of these houses
opted for a fraternity system that would more
nearly reflect the mores and interests of the
Stanford community instead of the composite
community of the national, which is often
regional I\ (i.e. Southern) based.
However, the AKI/s, by deciding to go local
purely for the sake of autonomy, have brought
to light a new and more fundamental question
which should concern every fraternity on
campus. Of what value, exactly, is the national
fraternity?
On a tangible basis, the national provides its
locals with a constitution, initiation and ritual
procedures, a pin, a magazine and a place to
sleep on the road. According to its proponents,
the national offers other intangible assets such
as prestige and security (i.e. "it you're in
trouble, well bail von out").

We think that each of these "assets "—except
perhaps that pin—is questionable. The AKL's
decided that instead of paying $3.50 per man
per month, they would prefer to write their
own initiation procedures, institute their own
pledge education process and bail themselves
out of trouble if necessary.
Fraternities are not in danger at Stanford.
Last year, some 497 freshmen pledged, a figure
markedly larger than that of the previous two
years—l2o and 400 respectively. Moreover, the
commitment of the University—and the local
alumni—in terms of funds for the new cluster
system, is obvious.
Thus, a rational consideration of the Akf.
alternative need not be considered in a context
of reform or be eliminated. Rather, the 'assets'
of affiliation—prestige, security, pins, maga
zines. convenience—should be carefully con
sidered in relation to their cost. That cost being
a financial and philosophical commitment to a
non-Stanford entity, one which may either be
years—if not decades—behind the local chapter
philosophically or may be using the funds of
a successful local here to build new houses
elsewhere.
In mam instances, we think the fraternities
on campus would do well to opt for autonomy.
