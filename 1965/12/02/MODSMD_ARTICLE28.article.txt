# Women Are People

The value of the Honor Code cannot be
measured by the amount of explanatory printed
matter that may he distributed. Rather, its
value lies in the development of self-respect
anil respect for others, in an understanding of,
and application of honesty in everyday life, and
in the spirit of freedom and responsibility
which pervades Stanford.
The Stanford 1 landbook
Rack in 1921, 13 years after Stanford had
its first Dean of Women, Stanford students
asked lor, and were given, complete responsi
bility for personal honesty iu their academic
endeavors. The experiment was a successful
one, and the Code was established as the Fun
damental Standards application to academic
matters.
In spite ol its minor shortcomings, it still
stands today as an expression of the belief thai
students are responsible adults.
Its concise 160-word codification requires
no buereaueraey nor expense to enforce it. And
perhaps more important, the Honor Code
proves that the university, as a leader of and
iin example for society, can be different from
the surrounding community.
And then there is the matter of women s
social regulations ....
Outlined in the 2630-word "Social Regula
tions and Procedures" Handbook and detailed
by numerous mimeographed sheets, the regu
lations now require an estimated 50 women to
spend upwards of 2000 w oman-hours and sev

cral hundred dollars a year in bcmuddled and,
we feel, unnecessary bureaucracy. The compli
cated rules create a spirit directly opposed to
that of the concise and briefly-worded mother
law, the Fundamental Standard, from which
the social regulations are theoretically derived.
In addition, the closely scrutinized., spy-and
counter-spy ethic by which the regulations
are enforced does nothing toward teaching a
woman responsibility, as the "Procedures'
handbook claims. Responsibility, like knowl
edge, comes about most effectively through
willful assimilation, and not through pounding
it into one's head. Part of Webster's definition
of the word is "trustworthiness"; in regard to
social regulations, this should mean the de
velopment of trust (i.e. dependibility) of one
self in the minds of others. We cannot see
where the present situation places any trust
in the women of Stanford.
Therefore, we suggest in all earnestness that
the Social Regulations Committee of AWS—
suddenly very active under pressure from the
Legislature—take a serious look into the feasi
bility of placing the social regulations under
;in extension ol the Honor Code. Granted, there
would be a myriad of technicalities that would
have to be ironed out in the transition, but we
feel that the effort would be well worth the
spirit that should result from the extension of
trust from academic matters into the greater
life of the University community.
