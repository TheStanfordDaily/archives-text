## Re: That Russian 'Interview' 
### 
Editor, Tile Daily:
I was very surprised by the
article "Russian Students Com
pare Countries" (November 29.)
Neither I nor my friend, Victor
Srdyuk ever met the author of
the article, Dick Livingston.
It seems to me this is not in
the best tradition of responsible
journalism. The author rewrote
the article from"The Palo Alto
Times" repeating stupid jokes
which we allegedly told, for in
stance about communists, homo
sexuals, and drunkards, and
that one of us likes only scien
tific instruments but not people.
I'm very sorry that you have
such lazy reporters on your
staff who can't walk a few steps
to Crothers Hall and talk to us.

• Lecture Procedure
Editor, The Daily:
The system of instruction in
the social sciences needs exam
ining. New educational aids are
revolutionizing classroom pro
cedures in elementary and sec
ondary schools, but the tradi
tional lecture format continues
to preside in the university. For
some thirty hours a quarter,
professors at this institution
present, in lectures long famil
iar to themselves, information
to students from comprehensive
notes that could just as well be
dublicated and distributed, or
sold, to students. At present, lit

tie more than a fifty-minute
transfer process occurs as stu
dents strive to reproduce accur
ately in their notes what a pro
fessor is often merely reading
from his own. This procedure
often results in misconceptions
and confusion as ideas are taken
down incompletely or inaccur
ately.
There is no heroic or academic
virtue in writer's cramps, and
yet there has apparently been
no search for more effective and
sure means of acquiring knowl
edge. Particularly in history
courses, audio-visual aids have
been completely unexploited,
save for an occasional map. Pro
fessors should have attempted
creatively to use the possibili
ties that group meetings of stu
dents offer them, but they have
not. Other than special research
a professor wishes to bring to
the class, featured guest speak
ers are the only excuse for a
lecture. Students can always
read by themselves the same
ideas and facts now verbally
presented, but slides, motion pic
tures, and records are not so
conveniently available.
It is unfortunate that profes
sors have not considered rein
forcing and extending knowl
edge by senses other than that
of hearing. Pictures of historical
figures, cities, occurrences, and
of pertinent geography; record
ings of speeches and of signifi
cant music: these would help
better than can lectures to give
a feeling for history and politics.
If professors will not evaluate
their own system, the medieval

stamp to present affairs will
continue to rankle in an other
wise modern university.

• Why The Stop Sign?
Editor, The Daily:
The University, through the
far-sighted work of its Planning
Office and the daily devotion
of the staff at the Escondido
Village office, is providing mar
ried students at Stanford with
some of the best-conceived and
most ably administered housing
facilities to be found on any
campus. Much has been done,
too. to improve access to the
main campus along both Escon
dido Road and Serra Street.
Because so much has been and
is being accomplished by those
charged with these responsibili
ties, one hesitates to make pub
lic "suggestions" for improve
ment. However, I am convinced
that I speak not only for my
self but for many hundreds of
other commuting students who
daily travel along the Serra
Street approach, when I con
fess being puzzled by the stop
signs at the entrance to the Ar
guello Street parking lots. The
lot on the North side, next to
Encina gym, is gated shut to
motor traffic during the week.
What then is the point of
making the in-bound cyclist dis
mount at Arguello Street? If the
purpose is to impede the morn
ing traffic into the campus, this
could be accomplished more
safely by a prominent speed
limit sign than by the present
stop sign. I emphasize the safety
aspect. Cyclists carrying the
normal load of books, hinders
and brunches are less of a haz
ard to themselves and to passing
motor traffic if allowed to keep
moving than if forced to dis
mount and re-mount their bi
cycles.
An officer of the Campus
Police force, after stopping and
warning me when I failed to
heed the stop sign during a time
of zero traffic, gave me a per
suasive lesson on the need to
obey traffic regulations, but in
the end agreed that the stop
signs at this particular point on
Serra made no more sense to
him than to me. He was nice
enough not to ticket me. But
being on the right side of logic
and of human relations still left
mo on the wrong side of the
law.
Obviously, the kindness of an
individual officer or even of the
whole Campus Police force,
howe v e r much appreciated,
should not be looked upon as a
substitute for excellence in plan
ning traffic controls on the
campus.

Neither I nor my friend, Victor

It seems to me this is not in

the article from"The Palo Alto

which we allegedly told, for in
stance about communists, homo

that one of us likes only scien

• Lecture Procedure
Editor, The Daily:
The system of instruction in
the social sciences needs exam
ining. New educational aids are
revolutionizing classroom pro
cedures in elementary and sec
ondary schools, but the tradi
tional lecture format continues
to preside in the university. For
some thirty hours a quarter,
professors at this institution
present, in lectures long famil
iar to themselves, information
to students from comprehensive
notes that could just as well be
dublicated and distributed, or
sold, to students. At present, lit

tie more than a fifty-minute
transfer process occurs as stu
dents strive to reproduce accur
ately in their notes what a pro
fessor is often merely reading
from his own. This procedure
often results in misconceptions
and confusion as ideas are taken
down incompletely or inaccur
ately.
There is no heroic or academic
virtue in writer's cramps, and
yet there has apparently been
no search for more effective and
sure means of acquiring knowl
edge. Particularly in history
courses, audio-visual aids have
been completely unexploited,
save for an occasional map. Pro
fessors should have attempted
creatively to use the possibili
ties that group meetings of stu
dents offer them, but they have
not. Other than special research
a professor wishes to bring to
the class, featured guest speak
ers are the only excuse for a
lecture. Students can always
read by themselves the same
ideas and facts now verbally
presented, but slides, motion pic
tures, and records are not so
conveniently available.
It is unfortunate that profes
sors have not considered rein
forcing and extending knowl
edge by senses other than that
of hearing. Pictures of historical
figures, cities, occurrences, and
of pertinent geography; record
ings of speeches and of signifi
cant music: these would help
better than can lectures to give
a feeling for history and politics.
If professors will not evaluate
their own system, the medieval

stamp to present affairs will
continue to rankle in an other
wise modern university.

• Why The Stop Sign?
Editor, The Daily:
The University, through the
far-sighted work of its Planning
Office and the daily devotion
of the staff at the Escondido
Village office, is providing mar
ried students at Stanford with
some of the best-conceived and
most ably administered housing
facilities to be found on any
campus. Much has been done,
too. to improve access to the
main campus along both Escon
dido Road and Serra Street.
Because so much has been and
is being accomplished by those
charged with these responsibili
ties, one hesitates to make pub
lic "suggestions" for improve
ment. However, I am convinced
that I speak not only for my
self but for many hundreds of
other commuting students who
daily travel along the Serra
Street approach, when I con
fess being puzzled by the stop
signs at the entrance to the Ar
guello Street parking lots. The
lot on the North side, next to
Encina gym, is gated shut to
motor traffic during the week.
What then is the point of
making the in-bound cyclist dis
mount at Arguello Street? If the
purpose is to impede the morn
ing traffic into the campus, this
could be accomplished more
safely by a prominent speed
limit sign than by the present
stop sign. I emphasize the safety
aspect. Cyclists carrying the
normal load of books, hinders
and brunches are less of a haz
ard to themselves and to passing
motor traffic if allowed to keep
moving than if forced to dis
mount and re-mount their bi
cycles.
An officer of the Campus
Police force, after stopping and
warning me when I failed to
heed the stop sign during a time
of zero traffic, gave me a per
suasive lesson on the need to
obey traffic regulations, but in
the end agreed that the stop
signs at this particular point on
Serra made no more sense to
him than to me. He was nice
enough not to ticket me. But
being on the right side of logic
and of human relations still left
mo on the wrong side of the
law.
Obviously, the kindness of an
individual officer or even of the
whole Campus Police force,
howe v e r much appreciated,
should not be looked upon as a
substitute for excellence in plan
ning traffic controls on the
campus.

Neither I nor my friend, Victor

It seems to me this is not in

the article from"The Palo Alto

which we allegedly told, for in
stance about communists, homo

that one of us likes only scien

• Lecture Procedure
Editor, The Daily:
The system of instruction in
the social sciences needs exam
ining. New educational aids are
revolutionizing classroom pro
cedures in elementary and sec
ondary schools, but the tradi
tional lecture format continues
to preside in the university. For
some thirty hours a quarter,
professors at this institution
present, in lectures long famil
iar to themselves, information
to students from comprehensive
notes that could just as well be
dublicated and distributed, or
sold, to students. At present, lit

tie more than a fifty-minute
transfer process occurs as stu
dents strive to reproduce accur
ately in their notes what a pro
fessor is often merely reading
from his own. This procedure
often results in misconceptions
and confusion as ideas are taken
down incompletely or inaccur
ately.
There is no heroic or academic
virtue in writer's cramps, and
yet there has apparently been
no search for more effective and
sure means of acquiring knowl
edge. Particularly in history
courses, audio-visual aids have
been completely unexploited,
save for an occasional map. Pro
fessors should have attempted
creatively to use the possibili
ties that group meetings of stu
dents offer them, but they have
not. Other than special research
a professor wishes to bring to
the class, featured guest speak
ers are the only excuse for a
lecture. Students can always
read by themselves the same
ideas and facts now verbally
presented, but slides, motion pic
tures, and records are not so
conveniently available.
It is unfortunate that profes
sors have not considered rein
forcing and extending knowl
edge by senses other than that
of hearing. Pictures of historical
figures, cities, occurrences, and
of pertinent geography; record
ings of speeches and of signifi
cant music: these would help
better than can lectures to give
a feeling for history and politics.
If professors will not evaluate
their own system, the medieval

stamp to present affairs will
continue to rankle in an other
wise modern university.

• Why The Stop Sign?
Editor, The Daily:
The University, through the
far-sighted work of its Planning
Office and the daily devotion
of the staff at the Escondido
Village office, is providing mar
ried students at Stanford with
some of the best-conceived and
most ably administered housing
facilities to be found on any
campus. Much has been done,
too. to improve access to the
main campus along both Escon
dido Road and Serra Street.
Because so much has been and
is being accomplished by those
charged with these responsibili
ties, one hesitates to make pub
lic "suggestions" for improve
ment. However, I am convinced
that I speak not only for my
self but for many hundreds of
other commuting students who
daily travel along the Serra
Street approach, when I con
fess being puzzled by the stop
signs at the entrance to the Ar
guello Street parking lots. The
lot on the North side, next to
Encina gym, is gated shut to
motor traffic during the week.
What then is the point of
making the in-bound cyclist dis
mount at Arguello Street? If the
purpose is to impede the morn
ing traffic into the campus, this
could be accomplished more
safely by a prominent speed
limit sign than by the present
stop sign. I emphasize the safety
aspect. Cyclists carrying the
normal load of books, hinders
and brunches are less of a haz
ard to themselves and to passing
motor traffic if allowed to keep
moving than if forced to dis
mount and re-mount their bi
cycles.
An officer of the Campus
Police force, after stopping and
warning me when I failed to
heed the stop sign during a time
of zero traffic, gave me a per
suasive lesson on the need to
obey traffic regulations, but in
the end agreed that the stop
signs at this particular point on
Serra made no more sense to
him than to me. He was nice
enough not to ticket me. But
being on the right side of logic
and of human relations still left
mo on the wrong side of the
law.
Obviously, the kindness of an
individual officer or even of the
whole Campus Police force,
howe v e r much appreciated,
should not be looked upon as a
substitute for excellence in plan
ning traffic controls on the
campus.

political agitators again. The re
ligious sects iti the city were
restive and on the brink of ad
vocating a coup d'etat.
Most of the people were apa
thetic. but one minority sect was
advocating a nationalistic alter
native that was totally unthink
able. The propagandists were
crying, "Foreign intervention."
The general didn't want to be
here. He knew the reports of
slaughters of children wouldn't
help his reputation back home.
He was an administrator doing
his job. The only reason he was
here was to keep this country
under law and order.
After much thought the Gen
eral washed his hands of the en
tire matter and let the local boys
crucify Him.
