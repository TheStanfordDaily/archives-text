## Show By Resident Artist Can Mean Idea Exchange 
### 
According to Dr. Lorenz Kit
nor, Director of the Stanford
Art Gallery, Stanford hopes to
show Frank Lobdell's "Retro
spective." in the Spring of 1966.
at the Art. Gallery.
Frank Lobdell is Stanford's
"Artist-in-Residence" this year.
He has taught at the San Fran
cisco Art Institute (formerly the
California School of Fine Arts)
and originates in the Bay Area.
He and h®■: wife and children
live on the Campus.
The San Francisco Museum of
Ar had i tinned to show the
"Retrospective," which is now
being exhibited in Pasadena,
within a year, but changed its
mind to present a conference of
artists instead.
Fine Arts Not 'Marketable'
As the above example may il
lustrate. it is exceedingly hard
for a Bay Area artist to show
his works in the Bay Area, at
least insofar as his works reach
a broad public, beyond the atten
tion of the trade alone. The Fine
Arts, unlike other cultural art
forms, cannot be performed, that
is, the Fine Arts cannot be mar
keted to the public. An artist,
however, depend upon the pub
lic for sustenance, for criticism,
and for acceptance. Reciprocally,
the public must support its art
ists for the cultural stimulation
and benefits they bring to a com
munity.
The Bay Area is traditionally
notorious for failing to suppori
the Fine Arts in particular, and
hence, artists must show their
works outside of the area (as
Frank Lobdell is now doing in
Pasadena), or else produce else
where; neither is a desirable al
ternative. The example set by
the San Francisco Museum of
Art demonstrates the difficulty
met by a respected, noted, and
successful artist.
A Wide Spectrum
A "Retrospective" is an exhi
bition which includes a wide

spectrum of the artist in ques
tion: not o'nly are different me
dia presented, hut also the art
ists errors and successes, in the
course of progress, are seen in
their developmental scheme. Con
sequently, a "Retrospective" is
more than a showing of the art
ist's works it is a history of the
artist and an education to its
viewers.
It is particularly appropriate
that Stanford, certainly a major
cultural component of the Bay
Area, has decided to show Frank
Lobdell's "Retrospective." In this
way Stanford serves to support
its own. as well as Bay Area,
arlists. The artist-in-residence
not only brings cultural contact
in an extended stay to Stanford,
but also serves as an educator
to students of art. He teaches
small graduate seminars, and al
so guides students in a classi
cally Socratic method.
Art Guest For Year
The Art Department is one of
the few departments at Stanford
which supports a "guest-in-resi
dence" for a whole year. It is
only fitting that his own stu
dents. as well as the Stanford
community, will be able to un
derstand the association between
the man and his works through
this upcoming show.
The Stanford Art Gallery is
presently showing the works of
Francois Stahly and his wife.
Francois Stahly was last year's
"Artist-in-Residence" at Stan
ford, but is, unfortunately, no
longer here.
If Stanford succeeds in bring
ing Frank Lobdell's "Retrospec
tive" to the Stanford Art Gal
lery, then it will be a credit to
Stanford's attempt at support
ing the arts in the Bay Area and
a boon to the community. In
particular, students at Stanford
will benefit from seeing the ca
reer of a man with whom they
wilbl be able to exchange ideas.
