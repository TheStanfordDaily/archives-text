# Meeting On Future 01 Frats
## Glee Club Concert 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
Presidents of national fraternities
will meet today with two Stanford
deans to consider the future role of
fraternities here.
Associate Dean of Students Robert
Gordon and Dean of Fraternities John
Hansen have scheduled a luncheon
this afternoon at the National Inter
fraternity Conference (NICi in Wash
ington. D.C. Invited to meet with the
Stanford deans are presidents of all
national fraternities now represented
on campus. The luncheon was ar
ranged by Dean Gordon, who said he
hopes to make clear Stanford's posi
tion on fraternities.
Gordon argued Stanford's extensive
fraternity housing program presently
underway is proof that the University
"is very much interested in a frater
nity system."
But, Gordon added, "the difference
in our student body and general house
plan has resulted in a fraternity sys
tem considerably different from that
on many other campuses.
Within the last five years three
houses -Beta Chi, ATO, and AKL
have gone independent. Sigma Chi is
now on a year's suspension from its
national, and several other houses re
portedly may be kicked out of their
nationals or may go independent.
Some national officers have consid
ered the "independence" of Stanford
chapters as a sign of hostility to na
tional ritual and tradition, and may
even suspect the University's encour
aging this attitude.


Preparing for the coming Yuletide
season. Bob McKenna leads a vigorous
Men's Glee Club practice session. The
group will perform a program of
< hristmas carols and secular music
Friday at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder Large
I/Ollllge.
