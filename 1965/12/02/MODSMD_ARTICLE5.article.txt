# Transfer Plan Unites All Campus Kitchens
## 
### 
A liberalized meal transfer policy
for University residences will be
tested next quarter. The program
will allow a freer exchange of guests
among students who pay board to the
University.
The revision will permit such stu
dents to invite eligible guests to meals
without paying for them. Eligibility
will be limited to other board-paying
ii ii ii

students. Since the guest's meal has
already been paid for in his respective
dormitory, the transfer theoretically
should balance between the two resi
dences involved.
A guest quota will be established
for each dining hall. Separate sign
up sheets for each meal will be posted
with the quota stipulation. Residents
may either sign guests in and ensure
their seating, or take a chance that
the quota will not be filled and invite
students without prior notice.
Other non-board paying students
and parents will also be registered on
the quota sign-in list. The host will be
expected to pay the established fee
for such guests.
In order to identify eligible students
for participation in Ibis program,
meal transfer cards will be issued to
women. Meal tickets which men pres
ently have will serve for transfers.
The program will be optional.
Houses may decline to participate or
may close certain meals to guests. If
a house does elect to participate, the
residents will be responsible for de
veloping procedures, enforcing poli
cies, and evaluating the program as
the quarter progresses.
The "cooperating agencies" coordin
ating the program include the Uni
versity Food Services, the Office ol
the Dean of Undergraduate Education,
and the Residential Education Com
mission. an organization of students
representing living groups which
meets with the members of the Dean
of Students staff.
