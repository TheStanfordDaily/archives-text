# 'King Rat' An Excellent Movie; Segal Brilliant In The Title Role
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
By conventional standards
"King Rat" should bo a real dud.
It is a wartime picture with no
iragie sexual interludes. Set in
a prisoner-of-war camp, it offers
neither escape attempts (always
good for a little suspensei, per
sonal heroism la great sympa
thy-getter*, nor much physical
brutality (standard fare in a vio
lent ago). Instead it is a brilliant,
study in mental and spiritual
despotism and a frightening doc
umentary of men become sheep.
The movie opens as Corporal
King (George Segal) is in the
middle of his customary shave,
shooshino, and manicure, which
would be all right were he not
getting this shave, shooshino,
and manicure right in the middle
of the infamous Changi camp in
Ja pa nese-occ u pied Ma lay a.
He is wearing a cleaned and
pressed uniform, in sharp con
trast to even the brass in camp,
and generally looks like some
thing out of a recruiting poster.
Back in the barrack, he has,
among other things, seven or
eight more eloaned and pressed
uniforms, unlimited cigarettes,
a stove, fresh eggs, an armchair,
and his very own valet.
A Sharpie
In short, King is the sharpest
dealer and the biggest operator
in camp, with enough money
and influence to buy protection
and a measure of well-being for
himself and his associates, and
make a sizeable profit in Ihe
bargain.
But ho wants to move up to
even bettor things, and for that
he needs an interpreter. So he
tries to buy, and when that
doesn't work, befriends, a dis
illusioned British aristocrat
(James Fox); and together they
set up a thriving trade (with
native guards) in officers' watch
es, diamonds, and other little
baubles. They also breod rats
and sell them to colonels and
generals as deer meat. Mean
while, the ordinary camp life
goes on much the same.

Now all this happens in a
sort of ramshackle fashion, with
no particular order in ihe pro
gression of events, nor any ap
proaching crisis to hold the at
tention. What makes "King Rat"
coherent in spite of this, and
moreover, fascinating, is the
gradual delineation of King's
character and of the terrifying
power he wields in the camp.
For he has corrupted nearly
everyone, from general to pri
vate, in one way or another.
Some have become his lackeys,
enduring his insults, and mate
rially assisting his schemes in
hopes of getting money or cigar
ettes. Others are as crooked as
hp in their own small way, tam
pering with the weights so they
can steal a little extra grain for
themselves.
Still others buy from him food
that they know to be stolen and
devour it without caring that
others may be starving for lack
of it. These corrupt ones King
Rat can control through bribery
or blackmail; the rest, the ex
ploited, have sunk so far into
apathy and despair that even in
their hatred of King they do not
resist him.
Aniorality
As for King himself, he rules
because he is totally amoral, en
tirely without scruples, and in
terested in only one person's
welfare, his own. He cooks a
fellow prisoner's dog, then serves
it to horrified friends and makes
thorn enjoy it. Ho cheats un
mercifully those who sell on the
black market through him. Ho
buys people as if they were so
many pounds of meat in a butch
er shop.
Ho saves his British friend's
arm only because he needs him
for a big deal. In a society of
laws he would bo a failure; in
the jungle of Changi he cannot
holp but succeed. However, once
the camp is lit>erated, King Rat
is again merely Corporal King,
a bitter and pathetically defiant
remnant of his former self.
By now it is pretty clear that
the movie stands or falls on
George Segal's performance as

King; and thanks to him it not
only stands, but leaps, runs, even
soars. His King exudes insolence
and self-assurance. Ho is blind
cruelty personified, with a face
that has only two expressions in
its repertory, raging anger and
savage laughter. Even his smilo
is amoral, like a satyr's before a
debauch.
A Fallen Angel
Yet he is not repulsive; on the
contrary, ho is irresistibly, al
most hypnotically, attractive, bo
cause Sogal plays him like a
fallen angel, evil on a grand
scale and, amid living death, lull
of life.
Without Segal, "King Rat"
would be mediocre at best; with
him, supported by fine perfor
mances from James Fox <;is the
aristocrat) and Tom Courtenay
(as a rule-bound, puritannical,
lower-class British lieutenant),
and with direction by Brian
Forbes that keeps attention fo
cused on Sogal nearly all the
time, it is a compelling study
in tyranny.

In short, King is the sharpest
dealer and the biggest operator
in camp, with enough money
and influence to buy protection
and a measure of well-being for
himself and his associates, and
make a sizeable profit in Ihe
bargain.
But ho wants to move up to
even bettor things, and for that
he needs an interpreter. So he
tries to buy, and when that
doesn't work, befriends, a dis
illusioned British aristocrat
(James Fox); and together they
set up a thriving trade (with
native guards) in officers' watch
es, diamonds, and other little
baubles. They also breod rats
and sell them to colonels and
generals as deer meat. Mean
while, the ordinary camp life
goes on much the same.

Now all this happens in a
sort of ramshackle fashion, with
no particular order in ihe pro
gression of events, nor any ap
proaching crisis to hold the at
tention. What makes "King Rat"
coherent in spite of this, and
moreover, fascinating, is the
gradual delineation of King's
character and of the terrifying
power he wields in the camp.
For he has corrupted nearly
everyone, from general to pri
vate, in one way or another.
Some have become his lackeys,
enduring his insults, and mate
rially assisting his schemes in
hopes of getting money or cigar
ettes. Others are as crooked as
hp in their own small way, tam
pering with the weights so they
can steal a little extra grain for
themselves.
Still others buy from him food
that they know to be stolen and
devour it without caring that
others may be starving for lack
of it. These corrupt ones King
Rat can control through bribery
or blackmail; the rest, the ex
ploited, have sunk so far into
apathy and despair that even in
their hatred of King they do not
resist him.
Aniorality
As for King himself, he rules
because he is totally amoral, en
tirely without scruples, and in
terested in only one person's
welfare, his own. He cooks a
fellow prisoner's dog, then serves
it to horrified friends and makes
thorn enjoy it. Ho cheats un
mercifully those who sell on the
black market through him. Ho
buys people as if they were so
many pounds of meat in a butch
er shop.
Ho saves his British friend's
arm only because he needs him
for a big deal. In a society of
laws he would bo a failure; in
the jungle of Changi he cannot
holp but succeed. However, once
the camp is lit>erated, King Rat
is again merely Corporal King,
a bitter and pathetically defiant
remnant of his former self.
By now it is pretty clear that
the movie stands or falls on
George Segal's performance as

King; and thanks to him it not
only stands, but leaps, runs, even
soars. His King exudes insolence
and self-assurance. Ho is blind
cruelty personified, with a face
that has only two expressions in
its repertory, raging anger and
savage laughter. Even his smilo
is amoral, like a satyr's before a
debauch.
A Fallen Angel
Yet he is not repulsive; on the
contrary, ho is irresistibly, al
most hypnotically, attractive, bo
cause Sogal plays him like a
fallen angel, evil on a grand
scale and, amid living death, lull
of life.
Without Segal, "King Rat"
would be mediocre at best; with
him, supported by fine perfor
mances from James Fox <;is the
aristocrat) and Tom Courtenay
(as a rule-bound, puritannical,
lower-class British lieutenant),
and with direction by Brian
Forbes that keeps attention fo
cused on Sogal nearly all the
time, it is a compelling study
in tyranny.
By conventional standards
"King Rat" should bo a real dud.
It is a wartime picture with no
iragie sexual interludes. Set in
a prisoner-of-war camp, it offers
neither escape attempts (always
good for a little suspensei, per
sonal heroism la great sympa
thy-getter*, nor much physical
brutality (standard fare in a vio
lent ago). Instead it is a brilliant,
study in mental and spiritual
despotism and a frightening doc
umentary of men become sheep.
The movie opens as Corporal
King (George Segal) is in the
middle of his customary shave,
shooshino, and manicure, which
would be all right were he not
getting this shave, shooshino,
and manicure right in the middle
of the infamous Changi camp in
Ja pa nese-occ u pied Ma lay a.
He is wearing a cleaned and
pressed uniform, in sharp con
trast to even the brass in camp,
and generally looks like some
thing out of a recruiting poster.
Back in the barrack, he has,
among other things, seven or
eight more eloaned and pressed
uniforms, unlimited cigarettes,
a stove, fresh eggs, an armchair,
and his very own valet.

Some have become his lackeys,
enduring his insults, and mate
rially assisting his schemes in
hopes of getting money or cigar
ettes. Others are as crooked as
hp in their own small way, tam
pering with the weights so they
can steal a little extra grain for
themselves.
Still others buy from him food
that they know to be stolen and
devour it without caring that
others may be starving for lack
of it. These corrupt ones King
Rat can control through bribery
or blackmail; the rest, the ex
ploited, have sunk so far into
apathy and despair that even in
their hatred of King they do not
resist him.
Aniorality
As for King himself, he rules
because he is totally amoral, en
tirely without scruples, and in
terested in only one person's
welfare, his own. He cooks a
fellow prisoner's dog, then serves
it to horrified friends and makes
thorn enjoy it. Ho cheats un
mercifully those who sell on the
black market through him. Ho
buys people as if they were so
many pounds of meat in a butch
er shop.
Ho saves his British friend's
arm only because he needs him
for a big deal. In a society of
laws he would bo a failure; in
the jungle of Changi he cannot
holp but succeed. However, once
the camp is lit>erated, King Rat
is again merely Corporal King,
a bitter and pathetically defiant
remnant of his former self.
By now it is pretty clear that
the movie stands or falls on
George Segal's performance as

King; and thanks to him it not
only stands, but leaps, runs, even
soars. His King exudes insolence
and self-assurance. Ho is blind
cruelty personified, with a face
that has only two expressions in
its repertory, raging anger and
savage laughter. Even his smilo
is amoral, like a satyr's before a
debauch.
A Fallen Angel
Yet he is not repulsive; on the
contrary, ho is irresistibly, al
most hypnotically, attractive, bo
cause Sogal plays him like a
fallen angel, evil on a grand
scale and, amid living death, lull
of life.
Without Segal, "King Rat"
would be mediocre at best; with
him, supported by fine perfor
mances from James Fox <;is the
aristocrat) and Tom Courtenay
(as a rule-bound, puritannical,
lower-class British lieutenant),
and with direction by Brian
Forbes that keeps attention fo
cused on Sogal nearly all the
time, it is a compelling study
in tyranny.
By conventional standards
"King Rat" should bo a real dud.
It is a wartime picture with no
iragie sexual interludes. Set in
a prisoner-of-war camp, it offers
neither escape attempts (always
good for a little suspensei, per
sonal heroism la great sympa
thy-getter*, nor much physical
brutality (standard fare in a vio
lent ago). Instead it is a brilliant,
study in mental and spiritual
despotism and a frightening doc
umentary of men become sheep.
The movie opens as Corporal
King (George Segal) is in the
middle of his customary shave,
shooshino, and manicure, which
would be all right were he not
getting this shave, shooshino,
and manicure right in the middle
of the infamous Changi camp in
Ja pa nese-occ u pied Ma lay a.
He is wearing a cleaned and
pressed uniform, in sharp con
trast to even the brass in camp,
and generally looks like some
thing out of a recruiting poster.
Back in the barrack, he has,
among other things, seven or
eight more eloaned and pressed
uniforms, unlimited cigarettes,
a stove, fresh eggs, an armchair,
and his very own valet.
A Sharpie
In short, King is the sharpest
dealer and the biggest operator
in camp, with enough money
and influence to buy protection
and a measure of well-being for
himself and his associates, and
make a sizeable profit in Ihe
bargain.
But ho wants to move up to
even bettor things, and for that
he needs an interpreter. So he
tries to buy, and when that
doesn't work, befriends, a dis
illusioned British aristocrat
(James Fox); and together they
set up a thriving trade (with
native guards) in officers' watch
es, diamonds, and other little
baubles. They also breod rats
and sell them to colonels and
generals as deer meat. Mean
while, the ordinary camp life
goes on much the same.

Now all this happens in a
sort of ramshackle fashion, with
no particular order in ihe pro
gression of events, nor any ap
proaching crisis to hold the at
tention. What makes "King Rat"
coherent in spite of this, and
moreover, fascinating, is the
gradual delineation of King's
character and of the terrifying
power he wields in the camp.
For he has corrupted nearly
everyone, from general to pri
vate, in one way or another.
Some have become his lackeys,
