# ‘Identification’ Helps Negro, Says Anderson
## 
### 
Lieutenant-Governor Glen n
Anderson said yesterday in a
Cubberly address that Ameri
cans must give Negroes an
"identification" with our na
tion's past, as the first step of
improving the Negro's status
and ending de-facto segregation.
Education, the key to the Ne
gro's progress, must be promot
ed by college students and civic
and business organizations, as
well as government agencies,

Anderson said in the Young
Democrats' talk. He cited the ex
ample of the Lions club of East
Los Angeles during the 1940's
in helping the Mexican commu
nity through a "buddy system"
of personal contacts.
Watts and Ellis
In reply to a question, Ander
son compared tiie Watts section
of Los Angeles to Ellis Island
in New York city, where a ghet
to of alienated immigrants faced
the same kind of problem in pen
etrating society. Negroes who
lack the motivation and drive to
break out, he said, fester like
an infected wound, creating an
atmosphere of discontent which
can produce outbreaks like the
Watts riot.
Anderson also said "proper
recognition" was at last coming
to the contribution of ethnic
minorities to the nation's his
tory.
"Most of us know,"he said,
"of the contributions of thou
sands of Negroes who served the
Union army during the Civil
War . . . But how many school
children were told the history of
Negro cowboys?" he asked,
pointing out that white children
have their cowboy heroes but
Negro children can imagine only
a lily-white wild west.
