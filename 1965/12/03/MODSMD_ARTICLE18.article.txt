# Indians Fight ‘Ivy’ Image
## 
### HUGH WEST 
It was with a certain amount
of relief that certain segments
of Stanford greeted the Indian
football loss in October to USC.
When the Indians followed up
( by being shellacked by a sput
tering Washington team, the
j Stanford student body could re
lax again.
! Winning those two games
would have been an embarrass
ment to most of the Stanford
J Student Body. At the time, vic
tory meant a definite bowl bid
and would have catapulted Stan
ford into national recognition
and into the circus of post
season games.
Not Kosher
It would not have been kosher
in the least, for Stanford enjoys
• and suffers from) an "Ivy
League" image. She is the "Har
vard of the West." Her band

wears non-militaristic blazers,
prides itself as a hack organiza
tion. She has Freshman Semi
nars, Western Civ, and Faculty
Residents. Therefore, it follows,
Stanford cannot have a nation
ally recognized football team.
Harvard lies comfortably en
sconced in the con fines of a con
spiracy known as the Ivy
League, wherein the conspira
tors agree to pretend that they
don't recruit. For instance, it is
well known to those in the cabal
that certain Yale football play
ers go down the road to Chesh
ire Academy to get "cultured
up" before they are really ready
to meet the Harvard line and
the Yale curve.
Preserve Image
The "League" provides these
revered institutions with a way
of having their cake and eating
it too. They don't spoil their
public image of high-powered in
tellectualism and yet they can
point to their 230 pound lines
and 9.8 second backfields when
complaining about not winning
the Lambert Trophy.
Stanford has not the benefit
of a conspiracy. In fact, the in
stitution has sprung up as sort
of an anomaly. Out of dubious
beginnings at the turn of the
present century, Stanford has
overcome a four-century handi
cap and found itself sitting on
the west coast emulating the
Ivy model.
Unlikely Soil
Stanford has made all this
phenomenal hothouse growth on
unlikely soil. As Chuck Taylor,
Stanford Athletic Director points
out, the university finds itself
in the midst of "no comparable

Institutions." There are no pri
vate universities with a high
powered intellectual program.
Taylor adds that year in and
year out feelers are put out to
play the Ivy League. Attempts
have been made even on the
Presidential level to no avail.
As a result, Stanford finds
herself in a constant dilemma
in the recruitment of athletes
and someiimes finds herself rec
ognizing practices which do not
belong in an intellectual com
munity.
Athletic Director Taylor is a
conscientious man and very
much aware of the dilemma. He
has walked the tightrope be
tween educational athletics and
professionalism with remarkable
success.
Academic Achievement
He is interested in the aca
demic achievement of all ath
letes coming to Stanford and
stresses that athletes have al
ways had to have a "B" average
for "as long as I can remember."
Recruiters always talk to school
principals and counselors before
they even consult the boy and
do not even consider him unless
he has a solid "B."
Taylor adds that a "B" aver
age does not. really mean that
much and that the grades are
always evaluated by the Admis
sions office. In fact, the athletic
department cannot do anything
beyond recommending to the
Admissions and Scholarship of
fices. They cannot promise a
boy they are recruiting any
thing. They can only encourage
him to apply.
Ruck Club
In addition the athletic depart
ment maintains a close alliance
with a fund-raising group made
up mostly of alumni called the
Buck Club which provides funds
for "needy scholar athletes."
Currently, 128 athletes spread
over the four years hold Buck
Club scholarships, amounting to
$214,950. Most holders show fi
nancial need, though under a
special AAWU program Achieve
ment Awards of room, board,
and tuition may be awarded re
gardless of financial need. Ten
freshmen now hold this award.
Also, sixteen Buck Club grants
in-aid may be given per year for
tuition, regardless of need.

About forty of Stanford's ath
letes hold non-athletic scholar
ships. Much of the problem
seems, however, not that Stan
ford athletes are academically
ineapable of doing Stanford
work (92 percent of them grad
uate >, but that they come here
as athletes and not as students.
This is the opinion of Dell
Martin, winner last year of a
Freshman Achievement award
and chosen most valuable man
on the freshman track team.
Martin feels that many of the
athletes feel themselves as part
of a team and not as part of
an "intellectual community" of
which t he team is a part. Martin
himself is a devoted student and
a devoted athlete, and deplores
Stanford "jock heroism."
Improvement Needed
The relationship between aca
demics and athletics seems bet
ter at Stanford than anywhere in
the country, with the exception
of the Ivy League. But the situ
ation is not perfect and some
improvements seem in order:
—The intramural program
needs strengthening. For exam
ple, Harvard and Yale House
football is tackle football. Stan
ford could at least play rag.
Jock heroism and professional
ism would be alleviated.
—Spring football should he

put on an informal basis and
lacrosse should ho recognized as
a University sport. This would
also alleviate ihe problem of pro
fessionalism.
Buck Club awards should
not lie identified as to recipients,
so that students would feel that
they are not hero as athletes,
but as students with a special
athletic talent.


RAY HANDLEY, Stanford eo
eaptain, was chosen as the
squad's most valuable player for
the past season. Terry DeSylvia
was voted the most inspirational
and Gene VYashinglon was se
lected as the frosli MVP.
