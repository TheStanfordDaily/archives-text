# Stanford Cagers Meet USF
## 
### 
Stanford kicks off its home
basketball slate Saturday night
when Coach Howie Dallmars's
Indians face national power—the
University of San Francisco. Tip
off is at 8 o'clock with the game
being carried on KCBS Radio
and KTVU-TV (Channel 2).
San Francisco, kingpins of the
W.C.A.C. for the past three
years and runner-up for the past
two in the Western Regionals,
will give Stanford its toughest
early season test. Leading the
Dons are three-year-veterans —
6'6" Joe Ellis, 6'B" Erwin Muel
ler, and 6'2" Russ Gumina, This
trio must rate as one of the best
on the Coast. Ellis hit at a 13.7
clip a year ago, while Gumina
averaged 12.4 points, and Muel
ler, 11.9. Other starters will be

6'5" forward Charlie James and
6'o" guard Larry Blum, both lot
tor winners.
The Indians come back Mon
day to play their third straight
opponent from the WCAC. Stan
ford hosts San Jose State in an
8 o'clock contest. The Spartans
field a veteran team led by for
wards S. T. Saffold and Pete
Newell. The 6'4" Saffold hit at
a 15.6 clip last season, while
Newell shot for 14.1 points per
contest. Lettermen Frank Tar
ran Its, at center, and Jack Glea
son and John Keating at guards,
round out the starting quintet
for Coach Stu Inman's Spartans.
