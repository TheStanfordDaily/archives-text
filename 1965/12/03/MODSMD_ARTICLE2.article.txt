# CHAPPIE REVIEW
## ‘Old Boy’ Staggers Forth 
### BILL WERTZ Managing Editor 
Chaparral, Stanford's onetime hu
mor magazine, goes on sale this morn
ing, providing o 11 e more grim
reminder thai tilings just aren't what
they used to be. and that new editor
notwithstanding, Chappie's "Old Boy"
is tottering on his last legs.
There was a time when Chaparral
was funny. lis cartoons were original,
its stories genuinely humorous, and
its parodies sharp and incisive. Few
Stanford students today can remem
ber that far back.
For years, Chaparral has labored
under t he misconception that some

thing dirty is necessarily something
funny. Editor after editor has fol
lowed the same well-worn path, and
any trace of humor has stagnated.
This month's Chappie, with a 'war'
theme, is no exception.
"The Battle of San Gregorio Beach"
is the til It 1 of one story. Typically
Chaparral, it offers dirty puns, pic
tures of five girls in swimming suits,
and a picture of Topless Swim dancer
Carol Doda. which was left over from
the last Chaparral. Ii is not in the
least funny.
"Your War"?
"This Is Your War" is a tasteless,
half-hearted protest against the Viet

nam War thai also has no place in
a humor magazine, since it's not fun
ny either.
In fact, tastelessness is evident
throughout this month's Chappie. A
full page picture shows a dead and
bloody soldier over the caption "Join
the Action Army." and an advertise
ment for an accessories company
shows a boy lying on top of a girl
in a sports car.
"The Phenomenal Rise of SPLEEN"
is tin 1 story of a successful rock and
roll group, which uses a toilet bowl
for a guitar and sings a three word
song, "You fatassed phonies." Need
less to say, this is not enough to make
the story funny, but does help to
make it unpleasant to read.
One Highlight
The one funny thing in this month's
Chaparral is a series of drawings by
Mike llugg portraying the soldier as
seen from differing viewpoints. Un
fortunately, the article only takes up
two of the Chappie's 39 pages.
This month's Chaparral, despite
Rugg's drawings and some clever la
pel buttons on the inside co\tt. must
be considered a failure. It is a failure
for the simple reason that it is not
funny, and that, after all, is the goal
of a college humor magazine.
It is time the Chaparral staff real
ized that dirty words and girls in
swimming suits cannot be substituted
for genuine humor in a humor maga
zine. It is time they realized that
originality and high quality writing
will appeal to the Stanford campus
far more strongly than stale, off-color
puns and immature suggestivity.
Until the Chaparral staff comes to
this realization, the Chaparral will
continue to fall far below the stand
ards set by the original Chaparral
many years ago, and ihc standards
currently maintained by many other
college humor magazines.

nam War thai also has no place in
a humor magazine, since it's not fun
ny either.
In fact, tastelessness is evident
throughout this month's Chappie. A
full page picture shows a dead and
bloody soldier over the caption "Join
the Action Army." and an advertise
ment for an accessories company
shows a boy lying on top of a girl
in a sports car.
"The Phenomenal Rise of SPLEEN"
is tin 1 story of a successful rock and
roll group, which uses a toilet bowl
for a guitar and sings a three word
song, "You fatassed phonies." Need
less to say, this is not enough to make
the story funny, but does help to
make it unpleasant to read.
One Highlight
The one funny thing in this month's
Chaparral is a series of drawings by
Mike llugg portraying the soldier as
seen from differing viewpoints. Un
fortunately, the article only takes up
two of the Chappie's 39 pages.
This month's Chaparral, despite
Rugg's drawings and some clever la
pel buttons on the inside co\tt. must
be considered a failure. It is a failure
for the simple reason that it is not
funny, and that, after all, is the goal
of a college humor magazine.
It is time the Chaparral staff real
ized that dirty words and girls in
swimming suits cannot be substituted
for genuine humor in a humor maga
zine. It is time they realized that
originality and high quality writing
will appeal to the Stanford campus
far more strongly than stale, off-color
puns and immature suggestivity.
Until the Chaparral staff comes to
this realization, the Chaparral will
continue to fall far below the stand
ards set by the original Chaparral
many years ago, and ihc standards
currently maintained by many other
college humor magazines.
Chaparral, Stanford's onetime hu
mor magazine, goes on sale this morn
ing, providing o 11 e more grim
reminder thai tilings just aren't what
they used to be. and that new editor
notwithstanding, Chappie's "Old Boy"
is tottering on his last legs.
There was a time when Chaparral
was funny. lis cartoons were original,
its stories genuinely humorous, and
its parodies sharp and incisive. Few
Stanford students today can remem
ber that far back.
For years, Chaparral has labored
under t he misconception that some

thing dirty is necessarily something
funny. Editor after editor has fol
lowed the same well-worn path, and
any trace of humor has stagnated.
This month's Chappie, with a 'war'
theme, is no exception.
"The Battle of San Gregorio Beach"
is the til It 1 of one story. Typically
Chaparral, it offers dirty puns, pic
tures of five girls in swimming suits,
and a picture of Topless Swim dancer
Carol Doda. which was left over from
the last Chaparral. Ii is not in the
least funny.
"Your War"?
"This Is Your War" is a tasteless,
half-hearted protest against the Viet

nam War thai also has no place in
