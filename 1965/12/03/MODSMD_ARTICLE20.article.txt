Even If Jesus Christ were not the Son of God, but just a great teacher, wouldn't
it be worth your while to learn more about this man who changed the entire
course of world history?
Even if the Bible were not the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God,
shouldn't you, as a well-informed collegian, be familiar with this all-time best
seller and great work of literature?
Even if heaven and hell were mythological remnants from the past, shouldn't
you consider the real possibility of some kind of life after death?
Even if all religions have some truth in them, shouldn't you consider Chris
tianity which claims to have the entire truth, the religion whose founder said
He was "the way, the truth and the life" (John 14:6)?
Even if the Christians you know are lukewarm or hypocritical, shouldn't you
see for yourself what they claim to know regarding a living person, Jesus Christ?
Even if there were no God at all, wouldn't a life based on the teachings of
Jesus Christ be the best kind of life for you and for your fellow man?
Even if the Bible and Jesus Christ and the Christian faith seem irrelevant
today, shouldn't you seek the reasons why millions down through the ages
have completely sold-out themselves to Jesus Christ?
What if the claims of Christianity are true? What if you have been wrong
about Jesus Christ, God and the Bible? Have you looked at the issues and
the facts? A true believer in Christ proclaims that you need have no doubts, that
you can throw all "ifs", "ands", and "buts" out of your life and rejoice in
the certain knowledge of a living Lord and Friend, Jesus Christ, the only really
"live" option in the world today.
