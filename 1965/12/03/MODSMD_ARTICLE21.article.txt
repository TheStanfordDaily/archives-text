# MEET FRESNO STATE:
## Grapplers Open Tonite 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Fresno State's belligerent Bull
dogs challenge Stanford's grap
plers in the Tribe's season debut
at the Pavilion tonight. The
Stanford freshmen meet the
Bullpups at 6:30, and the varsity
seeks to grab a few dog bones
starling at 8:00.
The Indians participate in the
Northern California Invitational
Tournament: at San Jose State
tomorrow. Stanford will vie
with eleven other teams for the
top spot. The Cards can expect
their stiffest opposition from
Cal Poly, second small college
in the nation last year.
Fresno State consistently
fields one of the best small col
lege teams in the country. They
were ranked tenth last year.
Tight Meet
Stanford coach Bill Leland
sees the meei as a very close
one. The Bulldogs appear to
have the edge in the lower
weight divisions, while the In
dians seem to be on top in the
heavier classes.
The Bulldogs have Steve Jo
hanson wrestling at 123 pounds.
Johanson was NCAA small col
lege champ at 115 pounds last
year. At 130 pounds, Jim Nors
worthy, who placed third at 137
in the California JC Tourna
ment, will go for Fresno.
John Hazelton, one of the
Tribe's five starting sophomores,
will meet Johanson in the first
match of the evening. Steve Boy.
an, a junior, will pit skills with
Norsworthv. Jack Clement son,
a junior, and Tom Rajala, a
sophomore, will try to pound the
rabid Bulldogs in the 137 and
345 weight divisions.
Marshall Ott will hold the In
dian fort at 152 pounds. Bill
Vogelpohl, a standout from last
year's freshman team, meets a
160 pound opponent whom lie
pinned last year in frosh compe
tition.
Schaum, Davison Load Cards
Steve Schaum, a senior, has
gained two silver medals in
AAWU championships in his ca
reer at Stanford. Starting his
drive for the top, Schaum will
take on Fresno's Erik Christen
son, a returning letterman.
Mike Davison took third in the
AAWU as a junior last season.
Davison will take the mat in the
177 division tonight against the
Bulldogs' Bill Bernstein.
Rick Lindsley will bear the
Stanford colors into the unlim
ited weight bracket match.
Lindsley, a 215 pound sopho
more, fills in the hole left by
Bruce Wilhelm, undefeated con
ference champion last season.
Lindsley grapples with Dick Bir
beck, Fresno State letterman at
about 230 pounds.
With Fresno's edge in the
lower weights and Stanford's
slight advantage in the heavier
divisions, the match could easily
go undecided until the unlimited
rou nd.
Krvukihroughs Crucial
A breakthrough by Stanford
in the lower classes or by the
Bulldog intrusion into the upper
weights could be a deciding fac
tor of the contest.
Stanford enters two teams in
the Northern California Invita
tional tournament tomorrow. In
addition to the varsity, there will
be novice competition.

Two weight divisions are add
ed in tournament competition:
115 and 191 pounds. Jim Henni
fer will fill the 190 spot, but the
Tribe doesn't have an Indian
small enough to fil in the 115
slot.
Frosh Strongest Ever
Eight of nine Card entries in
the novice division will be fresh
men. Coach Leland describes the
'69 wrestlers as "the strongest
freshman team since I have been
here, and, I imagine, ever at
Stanford.
The Papooses boast three re
gional champions and two run
ners-tip. Burt Ambler, at 167.
was a two-time Southern Califor
nia champion. Rock Carroll,
wrestling at 130 pounds, was
New England Champion last
year. Len Borehers, a 152 pound
er, was the Oregon AAU high
school top man.

Roy Milwid, at 145, was twice
a Northern California runner-up.
Dick Kilpatrick, lipping tho
scales at 123, finished second in
the Montana State finals.
