# Letters To The Editor
## Good Seconds Freudenberg

Editor, Tilt' Daily:
Professor Freudenberg/ bless
his heart, penetrates as usual to
the heart of the matter. If peo
ple want to see something done
in Overseas Campus programs,
they must hammer out propos
als for specific improvements.
The criticisms are real, but they
are not enough. II is harder and
takes longer to reflect responsi
bility and to propose solutions.
I would urge Overseas Cam
pus Board to snatch upon Pro
lessor Freudenberg's recommen
dation and to hold continuing
discussions of the problems, in
viting interested faculty and ad
ministration members to partic
ipate regularly. I for one would
cherish and respond to such an
invitation. It is no secret that
on the strength of one stint at
Landgut Burg, I too have ex
pressed some dissatisfaction with
some proposals to Dr. Walker.
One thing ought to be said
about some of the critical com
ments coming particularly out
of Germany XIV. I was there
for half of that group's term. It
was an exceedingly interesting
group to teach, a very lively,
enthusiastic bunch of people to
associate with. The courses
Group XIV had were more thor
ougly directed to Germany than
has often been the case, and I
had the over-all impression that
this group's experience, both col
lectively and individually, was
unusually good. The criticisms
emanating from it are based, in
my opinion, on good morale, not
bad, on a notably fine experi
ence, not a poor one.
Group XIV had a glimpse of
what S t a n 112 or d in Germany
might be. 1 was privileged to
GRUBER SPEAKS

catch such a glimpse along with
them, and to be initiated into
the potentialities of Stanford
Abroad under the warmth and
remarkable wisdom of Professor
(lunler Freudenberg.

Editor, The Daily:
Many students have been ask
ing their Western Civ instruc
tors this week about a recent
product of student initiative and
private enterprise called "An
Outline for History I" prepared
by the "Academic Publishing
Company." They want to know
if they should use this publica
tion in studying for the final
exam. How should the consci
entious instructor respond? He
could say, "I don't know any
thing about it. You decide for
yourselves." That would be all
right except that he does know
something about it, and he
would be encouraging the un
wary student to think that the
outline was a secret key to the
exam.. On the other hand, he
could tell his students that the
outline was a pack of lies and
to use it would be to study all
the wrong things. But that
would not be accurate, for the
Academic Publishing Company
has done a thorough job of gut
ting the books for the course,
and the instructor would be re
duced to inventing wild ques
tions contra the outline. A third
response might be, "Go skiing,
boys and take along the outline
for casual bedtime reading." This
would perhaps serve the ski
bums right but would be the

most dangerous of all responses
for the students' academic wel
fare.
Ponies for Western Civ are
put out in varying quantity and
quality at Stanford since the
course began. And they seem to
be very much of a pattern in
nothing new. They have been
college education these days.
There is an interesting article
in Newsweek of Noveml:>er 22
which says, among other things,
that fifty percent of the sales
at one college bookstore is in
ponies, outlines and student aids
of various sorts. The danger in
all of this is that students will
make these shortcuts to knowl
edge a substitute for reading the
material in a given course. This
can only impoverish the content
of education and result in medi
ocre intellectual performance.
How then should the instruc
tor respond to his students'
questions about the Western Civ
outline? I think I should say:
"Take a look at it. You may find
it helpful on a few points. But
don't regard it as gospel. It is
a book, like the others in the
course, which you must individ
ually evaluate and use or reject
as it helps you answer questions
posed in class. You will be asked
to demonstrate specific knowl
edge about material in the
course and to use it in a creative
way on the examination. Re
member that your own notes are
more meaningful than someone
else's and that all instructors
did not assign exactly the same
syllabus. There are a few copies
of the outline on reserve in the
RBR for perusal by the curious."

be very much of a pattern in
nothing new. They have been
college education these days.
There is an interesting article
in Newsweek of Noveml:>er 22
which says, among other things,
that fifty percent of the sales
at one college bookstore is in
ponies, outlines and student aids
of various sorts. The danger in
all of this is that students will
make these shortcuts to knowl
edge a substitute for reading the
material in a given course. This
can only impoverish the content
of education and result in medi
ocre intellectual performance.
How then should the instruc
tor respond to his students'
questions about the Western Civ
outline? I think I should say:
"Take a look at it. You may find
it helpful on a few points. But
don't regard it as gospel. It is
a book, like the others in the
course, which you must individ
ually evaluate and use or reject
as it helps you answer questions
posed in class. You will be asked
to demonstrate specific knowl
edge about material in the
course and to use it in a creative
way on the examination. Re
member that your own notes are
more meaningful than someone
else's and that all instructors
did not assign exactly the same
syllabus. There are a few copies
of the outline on reserve in the
RBR for perusal by the curious."

Many students have been ask
ing their Western Civ instruc
tors this week about a recent
product of student initiative and
private enterprise called "An
Outline for History I" prepared
by the "Academic Publishing
Company." They want to know
if they should use this publica
tion in studying for the final
exam. How should the consci
entious instructor respond? He
could say, "I don't know any
thing about it. You decide for
yourselves." That would be all
right except that he does know
something about it, and he
would be encouraging the un
wary student to think that the
outline was a secret key to the
exam.. On the other hand, he
could tell his students that the
outline was a pack of lies and
to use it would be to study all
the wrong things. But that
would not be accurate, for the
Academic Publishing Company
has done a thorough job of gut
ting the books for the course,
and the instructor would be re
duced to inventing wild ques
tions contra the outline. A third
response might be, "Go skiing,
boys and take along the outline
for casual bedtime reading." This
would perhaps serve the ski
bums right but would be the

most dangerous of all responses
for the students' academic wel
fare.

Editor, The Daily:
Many students have been ask
ing their Western Civ instruc
tors this week about a recent
product of student initiative and
private enterprise called "An
Outline for History I" prepared
by the "Academic Publishing
Company." They want to know
if they should use this publica
tion in studying for the final
exam. How should the consci
entious instructor respond? He
could say, "I don't know any
thing about it. You decide for
yourselves." That would be all
right except that he does know
something about it, and he
would be encouraging the un
wary student to think that the
outline was a secret key to the
exam.. On the other hand, he
could tell his students that the
outline was a pack of lies and
to use it would be to study all
the wrong things. But that
would not be accurate, for the
Academic Publishing Company
has done a thorough job of gut
ting the books for the course,
and the instructor would be re
duced to inventing wild ques
tions contra the outline. A third
response might be, "Go skiing,
boys and take along the outline
for casual bedtime reading." This
would perhaps serve the ski
bums right but would be the

most dangerous of all responses
for the students' academic wel
fare.
Ponies for Western Civ are
put out in varying quantity and
quality at Stanford since the
course began. And they seem to
be very much of a pattern in
nothing new. They have been
college education these days.
There is an interesting article
in Newsweek of Noveml:>er 22
which says, among other things,
that fifty percent of the sales
at one college bookstore is in
ponies, outlines and student aids
of various sorts. The danger in
all of this is that students will
make these shortcuts to knowl
edge a substitute for reading the
material in a given course. This
can only impoverish the content
of education and result in medi
ocre intellectual performance.
How then should the instruc
tor respond to his students'
questions about the Western Civ
outline? I think I should say:
"Take a look at it. You may find
it helpful on a few points. But
don't regard it as gospel. It is
a book, like the others in the
course, which you must individ
ually evaluate and use or reject
as it helps you answer questions
posed in class. You will be asked
to demonstrate specific knowl
edge about material in the
course and to use it in a creative
way on the examination. Re
member that your own notes are
more meaningful than someone
else's and that all instructors
did not assign exactly the same
syllabus. There are a few copies
of the outline on reserve in the
RBR for perusal by the curious."

Editor, Tilt' Daily:
Professor Freudenberg/ bless
his heart, penetrates as usual to
the heart of the matter. If peo
ple want to see something done
in Overseas Campus programs,
they must hammer out propos
als for specific improvements.
The criticisms are real, but they
are not enough. II is harder and
takes longer to reflect responsi
bility and to propose solutions.
I would urge Overseas Cam
pus Board to snatch upon Pro
lessor Freudenberg's recommen
dation and to hold continuing
discussions of the problems, in
viting interested faculty and ad
ministration members to partic
ipate regularly. I for one would
cherish and respond to such an
invitation. It is no secret that
on the strength of one stint at
Landgut Burg, I too have ex
pressed some dissatisfaction with
some proposals to Dr. Walker.
One thing ought to be said
about some of the critical com
ments coming particularly out
of Germany XIV. I was there
for half of that group's term. It
was an exceedingly interesting
group to teach, a very lively,
enthusiastic bunch of people to
associate with. The courses
Group XIV had were more thor
ougly directed to Germany than
has often been the case, and I
had the over-all impression that
this group's experience, both col
lectively and individually, was
unusually good. The criticisms
emanating from it are based, in
my opinion, on good morale, not
bad, on a notably fine experi
ence, not a poor one.
Group XIV had a glimpse of
what S t a n 112 or d in Germany
might be. 1 was privileged to
GRUBER SPEAKS

catch such a glimpse along with
them, and to be initiated into
the potentialities of Stanford
Abroad under the warmth and
remarkable wisdom of Professor
(lunler Freudenberg.
