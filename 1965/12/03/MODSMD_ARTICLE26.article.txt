# Which Local Wells Are Witched?

Stanford's wells are witched.
Stanford, as we all know, is
one of the foundations of scien
tific research on the West Coast.
Out of the famed Stanford labo
ratories have come many new
innovations, all intended to in
crease the overall rationality of
the natural sciences.
Who would expect, then, that
water dousing is the University's
most popular method of finding
water?
Bui Stanford always has been
The Farm, and always will be.

And as any good farmer knows,
you have to get out your divin
ing rod to find water.
According to Professor Davis
in his senior colloquium on the
pseudo-sciences, when the Uni
versity wants to drill another
well, they call up a man who
lives in the hills. He comes to
the campus and after a few
passes with his divining rod.
finds water.
Perhaps the new McCollugh
engineering building, the physics
tank, and the physics laboratory

were poor investments. Could
any of our ivory tower physics
TA's go out and do something
practical like find water?
Remember that once Stanford
almost established itself in a
field closely related to water
witching. Mrs. Stanford's broth
er, in his will, endowed a chair
for the study of the occult. The
Psychology Department, obvi
ously not an adventurous group,
left it vacant for nearly 60 years.
The chair was allegedly stolen
from the department last month

by a Menlo Pat'k fortune teller.
There are many possibilities
left for Stanford to become the
center for the study of the
occult on the West Coast. First,
the Mystery Spot in Santa Cruz
should be added as ihe eighth
foreign campus. Six months at
the Mystery Spot would do some
of those physics TA's good.
Questions concerning the
founding grant and Mrs. Stan
ford's will could be decided by
holding seances and getting the
truth, so to speak, straight from
the horse's mouth.
Admission policy for fresh
men could be changed, too.
Palm-reading, one of the most
ancient of the sciences, could
be applied to determine which
prospective freshmen would do
well at Stanford. Rixford Sny
der would have to be replaced
by Spyros Gillardo, the eminent
Menlo Park palmist.
Faith Healing
The Health Service, always a
pioneer in its field, has already
ventured into faith healing, ac
cording to a friend of mine who
went there recently.
Stanford presently leads most
of the universities in the world
in the fields of high tuition, bad
roads, and fairies in the show
ers. It is time for the adminis
tration to dive off the edge of
greatness and establish a Center
for the Study of the Occult.

Faith Healing
The Health Service, always a
pioneer in its field, has already
ventured into faith healing, ac
cording to a friend of mine who
went there recently.
Stanford presently leads most
of the universities in the world
in the fields of high tuition, bad
roads, and fairies in the show
ers. It is time for the adminis

greatness and establish a Center
for the Study of the Occult.
Stanford's wells are witched.
Stanford, as we all know, is
one of the foundations of scien
tific research on the West Coast.
Out of the famed Stanford labo
ratories have come many new
innovations, all intended to in
crease the overall rationality of
the natural sciences.
Who would expect, then, that
water dousing is the University's
most popular method of finding
water?

The Farm, and always will be.

And as any good farmer knows,
you have to get out your divin

According to Professor Davis
in his senior colloquium on the

any of our ivory tower physics
TA's go out and do something
practical like find water?
Remember that once Stanford
almost established itself in a
field closely related to water
witching. Mrs. Stanford's broth

for the study of the occult. The
Psychology Department, obvi

left it vacant for nearly 60 years.
