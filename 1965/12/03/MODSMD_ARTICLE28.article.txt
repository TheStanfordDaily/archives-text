# PLAY REVIEW
## ‘The Skin Of Our Teeth’-- A Talkative Maid Tells All 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
(Little Theater. The Repertory
Theater's performance of Thorn
ton Wilder's "The Skin of Our
Teeth." Sabina, the maid, is wait
ing for Mrs. Antrobus to enter;
she lias twice missed her cue.
The stage manager whispers,
"Make up something! Invent
something!"
Sabina: "Well . .. .uh . . . this
certainly is a fine American
home . . . and uh . . . every
body's very happy . . . and—uh
. . (Suddenly flings pretense
to the winds and coming down
stage says with indignation) "I
can't invent any words for this
play, and I'm glad I can't. I hate
this play and every line in it."
"As for me, I don't understand
a single word of it. anyway all
about the troubles the human
race has gone through. Now
thorp's a subject for you.
Silly Mind?
"Besides, the author hasn't
made up his silly mind as to
whether we're all living back in
caves or in Excelsior, New Jer
sey, and that's the way it is all
the way through.
"Oh why can't we have plays
like we used to have—"Peg o'
My Heart." "Smilin' Thru." and
"The Bat" good entertainment
with a message you can take
home with you?"

(Silence. She suddenly recon
siders.) "Wait a minute! I take
that back; maybe I do under
stand this play. And I don't real
ly hate it; it's just that it kind
of fizzles out in the last act,
when the men come back from
the war and the women crawl j
out of the cellars and the place !
is like amateur philosophy night. \
"But the first two acts are j
0.K., even though I have to
break character and make a lot j
of silly remarks. They're kind of !
crazy, but at least they get some I
good laughs. Even applause. And
you know what? I don't think!
Mr. Wilder likes "Abie's Irish |
Rose," or "Desire Under the j
Elms" either, and he doesn't care
who knows.
"Cave Men and Us"
"And another thing: I think
he mixes those cave men and us ,
all up because we're supposed
to be the same underneath or j
something, although personally J
I can't see myself getting drag-j
ged around by the hair, and
wearing practically nothing, if;
you know what I mean. Besides, j
they were only savages. Savages j
don't love their families — not i
like we do.
"There is one scene and you j
might as well know now — that j
I absolutely refuse to play, be- j
cause there are some lines in !
that scene that would hurt some :
people's feelings and I don't i
think the theater is a place
where people's feelings ought to '
be hurt. I don't care what any-,
body says, even old spare-the-in-;
sult-spoil-the-play Wilder him-1
self. He can really be mean, too, j
sometimes, like when he makes
us make fun of each other, and
ourselves, too.
(Silence. She fidgets, then
goes on.) "You know, a lot of the
people around here are pretty
good actors. You take Jane, Jane
Hoffman, who is Mrs. Antrobus
- and if you want to know any
thing more about Mrs. Antro
bus, just go look at a tigress, and
look hard. Anyway, when I read
the part I said to Jane. I said,
Jane, if you can do anything
with that you're a genius. She's
a genius.
The Wheel
"And Harry, Harold Gould, j
that is—he's >lr. Antrobus, who j
invented the wheel, and the lever, j
and the multiplication tables, I ;
think — is really a scream. 1 !
only wish Sam Schaeht would
make up his mind whether little
Henry Antrobus (his name used
to be Cain, but after he killed
his brother Abel they changed
iO is cuddly or nasty. And even
if I say so myself, I get more
than my share of laughs.
"But the guy I like best is Mel
Cole, the director. He's the one
who made me use all those fun
ny hand signs, like in the villain
landlord plavs. And he sure
knows how to get things moving
and - I - think * I - hear - Mrs. -
Antrobus • coming."
(She rushes back upstage, re
peats tho cue line, and the play
proceeds.)

goes on.) "You know, a lot of the

proceeds.)
(Little Theater. The Repertory
Theater's performance of Thorn

she lias twice missed her cue.

"Make up something! Invent
something!"
Sabina: "Well . .. .uh . . . this
certainly is a fine American
home . . . and uh . . . every
body's very happy . . . and—uh

to the winds and coming down
stage says with indignation) "I
can't invent any words for this
play, and I'm glad I can't. I hate
this play and every line in it."

"The Bat" good entertainment

home with you?"

siders.) "Wait a minute! I take
that back; maybe I do under
