## 
### JON ROISE CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
Legislature last night passed a bill
re-structuring and enlarging the So
cial Regulations Committee of the
Associated Women Students iAWSi,
and gave its approval to a resolution
requesting the Committee of 15 to
"suggest an appropriate and knowl
edgable committee" presumably in
place of the one appointed by Faculty-
Master Eric Hutchinson to make a
comprehensive study of the Wilbur
system.
The new Social Regulations Com
mittee will be composed of 12 mem
bers: seven from upperclass women's
living groups, two freshmen, one
LASSU representative, the ASSU Vice
President or his designated represent
ative, and a member of Women's
Council, who shall chair the commit
tee without vote.

It replaces the present five-woman
committee appointed by the AWS.
LASSU also amended the bill so
that the Social Regulations Commit
tee would report directly to the Legis
lature instead of channeling its de
cisions through the AWS President's
Council.
Tripartite ( 'onunittee
The Wilbur resolution suggested
that the substitute committee be com
posed of students, faculty, and ad
ministrators. Hutchinson's committee
is composed of eight faculty members,
and is chaired by the Faculty-Master.
The Legislature also approved an
allocation of $500 for minor construc
tion in the ASSU office in Tresiddcr.
A $3800 loan by ASSU to the Stanford

Ski club lor leasing a. cabin in the
Sugar Bowl was also approved, on the
grounds that the Ski Club become a
bona fide ASSU Board.

In other business, the Legislature
approved recommendations of the
Publications Board that would:

campus, offset printing beginning

• Grant The Daily a five-year loan
of approximately $7400, and
• Notify the University that unless
some reimbursement can be had for
copies of The Daily distributed to
faculty and staff, it will no longer be
possible to distribute papers to them.
