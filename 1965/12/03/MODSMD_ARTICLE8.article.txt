# â€˜Peace On The Move,' Says SCPV Delegate
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
"Just as the Civil Rights movement
was on the move in 1939, so the Peace
Movement is on the move in the Unit
ed States in 1965."
The was reaction of Stanford stu
dent Elizier Risco y Lozada upon his
return from a Washington conference
last week of the National Coordinat
ing Committee to End the War in Viet
nam (NCC). Risco was one of three
Stanford students representing the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam (SCPVi. Also attending were Da
vid Ransom, head of the SCVP. and
Tom Canterbury.
Ransom told The Daily that the
four-day conference which ended last
weekend was devoted to discussing fu
ture projects and sharing ideas of the
various participants through work
shops.
Risco, Ransom, and Canterbury also
participated in the Vietnam protest
march from the White House to tin-
Washington Monument. This activity
was not, however, sponsored by the
NCC.
Loose Group
The NCC is "a loose federation of
independent groups for whom policy
is not made but whose activities are
coordinated by the NCC," Ransom
said. One of the main concerns of the
conference was to determine the best
structure for the national organiza
tion. In a draft accepted by the con
ference. the member groups agreed
that "under the principle of national
coordination, local groups would main
tain local autonomy for local action."
At the conference the NCC planned
two national protests early next year.
On February 11-12, a protest program
will be staged by the southern groups
which are affiliated with NCC.
A Second "International Days of
Protest" was also set for March 2i>26.
The SCVP joined with other groups
throughout the nation in similar ac
tivities in October with a 60-hour
peace vigil in White Memorial Plaza.
Ransom said that the SCVP plans had
not yet been worked out for I lie March
protest.
Much of the delegates' time was
spent in workshops, described by Eli
zier Risco as a "series of combining

notes" ancl chance for the various pro
test groups to "create a series of work
ing assumptions" for the activities.
Amazed at Vigils
Kisco, who attended the campus
workshop, told The Daily that dele
gates from other schools wore amazed
at the undertakings of the SCVP.
"Stanford still has the image of a mid
dle class school," he noted. The work
shop favorably viewed the SCVP
methods of protest by vigil since it
has a "rational basis for protest and
eliminates the circus atmosphere of a
street rally."
Although each workshop sent a re
port to the plenary session of the con
ference, no formal stand was taken by
the body on the reports. Ransom ob
served that it was not the role of the
conference to make policy for the vari
ous independent groups participating
but to provide merely an interchange
of ideas.
"The Washington protest represen
ted a great deal of concern," Ransom
said. Looking back in time, he ob
served that only the Civil Rights pro
tests and the riots in the 1930's had
stirred more people to action.

independent groups for whom policy
is not made but whose activities are
coordinated by the NCC," Ransom
said. One of the main concerns of the
conference was to determine the best
structure for the national organiza
tion. In a draft accepted by the con
ference. the member groups agreed
that "under the principle of national
coordination, local groups would main
tain local autonomy for local action."
At the conference the NCC planned
two national protests early next year.
On February 11-12, a protest program
will be staged by the southern groups
which are affiliated with NCC.
A Second "International Days of
Protest" was also set for March 2i>26.
The SCVP joined with other groups
throughout the nation in similar ac
tivities in October with a 60-hour
peace vigil in White Memorial Plaza.
Ransom said that the SCVP plans had
not yet been worked out for I lie March
protest.
Much of the delegates' time was
spent in workshops, described by Eli
zier Risco as a "series of combining

notes" ancl chance for the various pro
test groups to "create a series of work
ing assumptions" for the activities.
Amazed at Vigils
Kisco, who attended the campus
workshop, told The Daily that dele
gates from other schools wore amazed
at the undertakings of the SCVP.
"Stanford still has the image of a mid
dle class school," he noted. The work
shop favorably viewed the SCVP
methods of protest by vigil since it
has a "rational basis for protest and
eliminates the circus atmosphere of a
street rally."
Although each workshop sent a re
port to the plenary session of the con
ference, no formal stand was taken by
the body on the reports. Ransom ob
served that it was not the role of the
conference to make policy for the vari
ous independent groups participating
but to provide merely an interchange
of ideas.
"The Washington protest represen
ted a great deal of concern," Ransom
said. Looking back in time, he ob
served that only the Civil Rights pro
tests and the riots in the 1930's had
stirred more people to action.
"Just as the Civil Rights movement
was on the move in 1939, so the Peace
Movement is on the move in the Unit
ed States in 1965."
The was reaction of Stanford stu
dent Elizier Risco y Lozada upon his
return from a Washington conference
last week of the National Coordinat
ing Committee to End the War in Viet
nam (NCC). Risco was one of three
Stanford students representing the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam (SCPVi. Also attending were Da
vid Ransom, head of the SCVP. and
Tom Canterbury.
Ransom told The Daily that the
four-day conference which ended last
weekend was devoted to discussing fu
ture projects and sharing ideas of the
various participants through work
shops.
Risco, Ransom, and Canterbury also
participated in the Vietnam protest
march from the White House to tin-
Washington Monument. This activity
was not, however, sponsored by the
NCC.
Loose Group
The NCC is "a loose federation of
independent groups for whom policy

said. One of the main concerns of the
