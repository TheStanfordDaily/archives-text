the newest Detroit sound I
comes from a combo I
called 4*4*2
Up-tcmpo all the way. With a 400-cube V-8 and 4-barrel carb to carry
the lead. Heavy-duty front and rear suspension to smooth the beat.
Acoustically tuned twin pipes to modulate the sound. And red-line
tires to keep the whole score on track. That's 4-4-2. Try about four bars
today. It's your kind of music! LOOK TO OLDS FOR THE NEW!
