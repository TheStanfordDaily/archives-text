# 'Fondle If Is Sex Rights Forum Slogan
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
Amidst a swirl of administration
displeasure, the new Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum (SSFR) will offer a
petition advocating reform of sex laws
and sell "If it moves, fondle it" but
tons in front of the gymnasium dur
ing registration today.
The group, which was organized in
mid-December, will also pass out a
four-point statement of principles, ad
vocating liberalization of sex laws. At
a neighboring table, the Stanford
Friends of Civil Liberties will offer
five additional proposals relating to
campus issues.
Adverse Effect
SSRF originally supported the on
campus proposals, but agreed to cut
them out of its platform after three
of its five members met with Dean
of Undergraduate Education Robert J.
Wert and Associate Dean of Students

Joel Smith for three and a half hours
December 17. Wert and Smith ex
pressed concern that publicity result
ing from the existence of the group
would adversely affect the possibility
of a change in the University's liquor
regulations.
(The Student Affairs and Services
Committee is currently studying re
vision of the policy; the Committee's
proposals are expected to go before
the Board of Trustees early this year.)
Statement Of Principles
The SSRF's statement of principles
begins: "We view sexual rights as a
proper extension of individual civil
liberties . . .
"Our fundamental tenet is that the
private sexual activities of consenting
adults are sacrosanct and are not the
concern of governments, churches,
schools or other corporate bodies."
The four points which SSRF is ad
vocating are:

• "All laws punishing cohabitation,
sodomy, homosexuality, non-marital
intercourse and adultry should be
abolished;
• "Prostitution should be legalized
and socially useful medical controls
should be instituted;
• "Job discrimination by reason of
homosexuality should be outlawed;
• "Abortion should be legalized."
•Truly Co-Ed Housing:'
The additional points, which appear
on the statement to be distributed by
the SFCL, r.dvocate that:
• "Women's social regulations
should be abolished entirely;
• "All students should be permitted
the opportunity to live in private off
campus housing;
"Open house hours in University
residences should be at the discretion
of each resident and his/her room
mates, with each house retaining the
option to impose some restrictions if

deemed necessary by a majority of
the residents. The administration
should not be concerned with the
amount of privacy desired by resi
dents;
"Truly coed housing should be in
stituted, each resident being allowed
to have a roommate of cither sex;
"The Student Health Service should
provide birth control information and
contraception supplies to all students
desiring them."
Limited Activities
"We agreed with the deans to limit
our activities to discussion of off
campus issues because we believe
that a program they suggested would
be as effective as what we had in
mind," a spokesman for SSRF told
The Daily yesterday.
' That program would establish a
student-faculty group made up of
members of our Forum and interested
and qualified faculty members who

would design an extensive program
on the sexual activities of college stu
dents to be presented this quarter."
Haight Comment
Added Tim Haight, a member of
SSRF who was present at the meet
ing: "The meeting with the deans
was, in my opinion, extremely pro
ductive in that it was a frank ex
change of views leading to mutual
action. There were dissenting opin
ions expressed, but the action taken
reflected the majority feeling of all
at the meeting."
Another member, Jim Sayre, who
is also acting chairman of the ci*il
liberties group, explained the actions
of the SFCL. "As a dissenting mem
ber present at the meeting, I cannot
in good conscience withhold discus
sion of vital matters, be they on or
off campus," he said.
"For that reason, I am presenting
the on-campus additions for consider

ation by Stanford students under the
auspices of the Stanford Friends of
Civil Liberties.
"I respect the right of the majority
of the discussing members of the
SSRF to take a stand for their or
ganization, but I must dissent."
According to Sayre, SSRF has five
members, the minimum number to
constitute a student organization in
the eyes of the administration, with
which SSRF has registered.
In addition to Sayre, and Haight,
they are Jan Handke, Jan Sutherland,
and Don Rightner.
Miss Handke emphasizes that SSRF
is not a membership organization,
but rather was constituted to "pro
mote discussion."
One of its first activities will be to
publicize the Conference on Abortion
and Human Rights, to be held at the
San Francisco Hilton Hotel this Sun
day.
