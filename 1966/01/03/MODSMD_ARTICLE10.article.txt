# Cat Coed Aids Stanford's Demonstration At Pasadena
## 
### 
There was a notable lack of
"demonstrations" — America's
latest pastime—at the Tourna
ment of Roses this year.
Except for one.
Four Stanford University stu
dents preceded the procession
by walking the 5-mile route car
rying a red and white banner
proclaiming: "Stanford to the
Rose Bowl in '67."
Kirk Hanson, 19, of Pasadena,
who came up with the idea for
the stunt, explained:
"I thought I'd do something
to get the ball rolling early for
next year. We should have made
it this time."
Supporting Placards
Hanson and Andy Horowitz,

19, of Whittier, carried the large
banner while two other Stanford
rooters, Cheryle Johnston, 18,
of LaCanada, and Bob Barrett,
18, of Santa Ana, held smaller
placards stating, "The Ultimate
in Demonstrations" and"The
Most Radical Demonstration of
them All."
They were accompanied by
Polly Harsha, 18, of Whittier,
a student at the University of
California.
"We got more cheers than
boos," said Hanson. "But my
greatest regret it that they
weren't taking us very serious
ly with all the other demonstra
tions going on these days."
