# New Anti-Draft Committee To Conduct Survey Today
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A militant new offshoot of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam begins its campus
activities today with a question
naire on the draft handed out
to male students in the registra
tion lines.
The "Freedom Draft Move
ment," which will distribute the
questionnaires, is a small Stan
ford-based group organized in
November. The organization
plans "educational activities and
possibly civil disobedience" to or
ganize draft-age men against the
Vietnam war.
"Our immediate aim is to
show that there is much opposi
tion to the draft among draft
age men," said Allen Traister, a
co-founder of the Freedom Draft
Movement.
The movement's first project
came last Thursday with the
"leafleting" of the San Jose and
San Mateo draft board offices.
Among the handouts were a cir
cular accusing the U. S. of "pro
tecting dictatorships and block
ing progress" and a "Freedom
Draft Card" to be carried by
members.
Traister said the leafleting,
carried out with the help of San
Jose pacifist groups, will be
done weekly. Planned for the
Stanford campus are "an educa
tional campaign in opposition to
the University's cooperation
with the Selective Service."

The Freedom Draft Movement
will also try to influence high
school students newly register
ing for the draft, Traister said.
He accused California draft
boards of classifying graduate
students 1-A.
Traister and Marc Sapil, both
24, are co - founders of the
fledgling anti-draft movement.
Traister, who says he is classi
fied 1-A, is a former Stanford
graduate student now doing so
cial work for Santa Clara coun
ty. Sapil is a second-year Stan
ford medical student,with a 2-S
classification.
