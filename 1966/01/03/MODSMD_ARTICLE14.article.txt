# Packers Nail Browns; NFL Outsigning AFL
## 
### 
GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) —
Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung
charged through the snow, rain
and fog and Don Chandler
kicked three field goals Sunday
to lead Green Bay to the Nation
al Football League champion
ship with a 23-12 victory over
the defending Cleveland Browns.
Playing their old style ball
control game, designed by Coach
Vince Lombardi, Taylor chewed
up Cleveland's line while the
Packers' brilliant defense shut
out the great Jim Brown.
Bart Starr, racked up last
Sunday on the first play of the
bitterly contested playoff game
with Baltimore, hit Carroll Dale
with a 47-yard touchdown pass
in 3:52 of the first period.
Boots
Chandler kicked field goals
from the 15, 23 and 29, tying an
NFL record for most field goals
in a title game, and Hornung
dashed 13 yards on the old style
Packer left end sweep for the
other touchdown.
Taylor, who won the m o st
valuable award and a new car
for his pefrormance in the game,
ground out 96 yards on 27 car
ries on the slippery turf. Hor
nung, the Golden Boy of old
who scored five TDs in a crucial
game with Baltimore in late
season, slid past the Browns'
defenders for 105 yards on 18
carries.
When Taylor wasn't carrying
the ball, Hornung was blocking
for him. And vice versa. The old
Packer pair played briliantly in
this contest played before 50,-
582 in intermittent rain and
snow.
It was the ninth league cham
pionship for the home town
Packers, owned by some 1,400
local fans. They previously had
been tied with the Chicago Bears
at eight.
Jim Brown, the MVP in the
league, was held to 50 yards in
12 carries by the grudging
Packer defense that rose to the
heights once more.
A 3 Mj inch snowstorm in early
morning blanketed the field but
grounds crew and city sanita
tion officials brushed back the
snow and made the field play
able. It rained intermittently
through the game and then
shifted to light snow in the final
stages. Steam rose from the
knots of players as they slithed
in the mud.
Cleveland gave it the big shot

but this simply was not the
Browns' day. Brown had prob
lems finding leverage in the
slipperly turf. The passing game
of Frank Ryan, who completed
eight of 18 for 115 yards, bogged
down due to the alert Packer
defense.
Willie Wood made a key in
terception in the second period,
and Herb Adderly picked off a
last gasp desperation heave by
Ryan in the final seconds.
Starr directed the play calmly
sticking to his running game
after it was established that the
ground route was the way to
travel. However, he still com
pleted 10 of 18 passes with the
hard-to-handle ball and piled up
147 yards passing.
Cleveland struck back quickly
after Starr's early TD pass to
Dale and stunned the big crowd
with a TD on three passes that
ate up only 61 seconds. The pay
off pitch was from Ryan to
Gary Collins, the man who
scored three touchdowns a year
ago in the Browns' upset of the
Baltimore Colts. Then came the
bad break that put the Browns
in the hole. Lou Groza who had
made 96 consecutive points af
ter touchdown in recent years,
was set for the equalizer.
The snap from center appeared
a bit off and was fumbled by
Bobby Franklin ,the holder.
Vital Miss
Groza grabbed the ball and
threw a forward pass to Frank
lin in a desperate try for the
conversion. Wood stacked up
Franklin on the five.
A short punt by Chandler led
the Browns to get into field goal
position midway in the first pe
riod. The 41-year-old veteran
calmly booted the three-pointer
from the 24, sending Cleveland
out front 9-7. Groza, who was
to kick another later, has the
all-time record with 10 field
goals out of 17 attempts.
National Football League
teams struck a bonanza in col
lege talent after weekend bowl
games, scoring overwhelmingly
against the rival American Foot
ball League even though Hous
ton wrapped up a million-dollar
package of tackles.
NFL Romps
NFL clubs signed such highly
prized prospects as Denny An
dersen, Texas Tech's two-time
All-America halfback; tackles
Francis Peay and Butch Allison

and halfback Johnny Roland,
Missouri stars; ends Freeman
White and Tony Jeter and de
fensive tickle Walt Barnes, all
of Nebraska; halfback Jim Lind
sey of Arkansas; Harold Lucas,
Michigan State's mammoth
tackle; and Larry Gagner, the
fine Florida tackle.
The Houston Oilers led the
way for the AFL. They handed
out contracts calling for what
owner Bud Adams termed "in
excess of a million dollars for
four tackles—Glen Ray Hines
and Jim Williams of Arkansas,
and George Rice and Dave Mc-
Cormick of Louisiana State.
Kansas City of the AFL also
signed a big one, halfback Mike
Garrett, the Heisman Trophy
winner from Southern Califor
nia.
Much Money
Andersen went to Green Bay
for a reported $600,000, which
was some $200,000 less than he
could have gotten from the Oil
ers, according to Adams. The
Texas Tech flash will be a Pack
er rookie along with another All-
America, fullback Jim Grabow
ski.
The New York Giants landed
Peay, their top choice in the re
cent draft, and White. Baltimore
signed Allison, Jeter went to
Green Bay, Lindsey to Minne
sota, Gagner to Pittsburgh, and
Barnes to Washington.
St. Louis signed the 286-pound
Lucas and Roland, who was
chosen by the Cardinals as a fu
ture in the 1964 draft. Other
NFL signees included All-Amer
ica end Charles Casey, of Flori
da, with Atlanta, and Missouri
quarterback Gary Lane, with
Cleveland.
Peay, White, Lindsey and Al
lison were second-round choices
in the AFL draft. Gagner, Lucas
and Barnes were chosen on the
third round.
Good Percentage
The NFL now has signed 38 of
their first 43 draft eligibles—l4
of 16 from the first round, 11 of
13 from the second and 13 of 14
from the third. The AFL
grabbed off only five of the 43,
including NFL first-round picks
Rice and linebacker Carl Mc-
Adams of Oklahoma.
AFL teams lost five of their
10 first-round selections, seven
of nine from the second round,
and four of nine from the third
round, with one unsigned.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) —
Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung
charged through the snow, rain
and fog and Don Chandler
kicked three field goals Sunday
to lead Green Bay to the Nation
al Football League champion
ship with a 23-12 victory over
the defending Cleveland Browns.
Playing their old style ball
control game, designed by Coach
Vince Lombardi, Taylor chewed
up Cleveland's line while the
Packers' brilliant defense shut
out the great Jim Brown.
Bart Starr, racked up last
Sunday on the first play of the
bitterly contested playoff game
with Baltimore, hit Carroll Dale
with a 47-yard touchdown pass
in 3:52 of the first period.
Boots
Chandler kicked field goals
from the 15, 23 and 29, tying an
NFL record for most field goals
in a title game, and Hornung
dashed 13 yards on the old style
Packer left end sweep for the
other touchdown.
Taylor, who won the m o st
valuable award and a new car
for his pefrormance in the game,
ground out 96 yards on 27 car
ries on the slippery turf. Hor
nung, the Golden Boy of old
who scored five TDs in a crucial
game with Baltimore in late
season, slid past the Browns'
defenders for 105 yards on 18
carries.
When Taylor wasn't carrying
the ball, Hornung was blocking
for him. And vice versa. The old
Packer pair played briliantly in
this contest played before 50,-
582 in intermittent rain and
snow.
It was the ninth league cham
pionship for the home town
Packers, owned by some 1,400
local fans. They previously had
been tied with the Chicago Bears
at eight.
Jim Brown, the MVP in the
league, was held to 50 yards in
12 carries by the grudging
Packer defense that rose to the
heights once more.
A 3 Mj inch snowstorm in early
morning blanketed the field but
grounds crew and city sanita
tion officials brushed back the
snow and made the field play
able. It rained intermittently
through the game and then
shifted to light snow in the final
stages. Steam rose from the
knots of players as they slithed
in the mud.
Cleveland gave it the big shot

but this simply was not the
Browns' day. Brown had prob
lems finding leverage in the
slipperly turf. The passing game
of Frank Ryan, who completed
eight of 18 for 115 yards, bogged
down due to the alert Packer
defense.
Willie Wood made a key in
terception in the second period,
and Herb Adderly picked off a
last gasp desperation heave by
Ryan in the final seconds.
Starr directed the play calmly
sticking to his running game
after it was established that the
ground route was the way to
travel. However, he still com
pleted 10 of 18 passes with the
hard-to-handle ball and piled up
147 yards passing.
Cleveland struck back quickly
after Starr's early TD pass to
Dale and stunned the big crowd
with a TD on three passes that
ate up only 61 seconds. The pay
off pitch was from Ryan to
Gary Collins, the man who
scored three touchdowns a year
ago in the Browns' upset of the
Baltimore Colts. Then came the
bad break that put the Browns
in the hole. Lou Groza who had
made 96 consecutive points af
ter touchdown in recent years,
was set for the equalizer.
The snap from center appeared
a bit off and was fumbled by
Bobby Franklin ,the holder.
Vital Miss
Groza grabbed the ball and
threw a forward pass to Frank
lin in a desperate try for the
conversion. Wood stacked up
Franklin on the five.

from the 15, 23 and 29, tying an
NFL record for most field goals
in a title game, and Hornung
dashed 13 yards on the old style
Packer left end sweep for the
other touchdown.
Taylor, who won the m o st
valuable award and a new car
for his pefrormance in the game,
ground out 96 yards on 27 car
ries on the slippery turf. Hor
nung, the Golden Boy of old
who scored five TDs in a crucial
game with Baltimore in late
season, slid past the Browns'
defenders for 105 yards on 18
carries.
When Taylor wasn't carrying
the ball, Hornung was blocking
for him. And vice versa. The old
Packer pair played briliantly in
this contest played before 50,-
582 in intermittent rain and
snow.
It was the ninth league cham
pionship for the home town
Packers, owned by some 1,400
local fans. They previously had
been tied with the Chicago Bears
at eight.
Jim Brown, the MVP in the
league, was held to 50 yards in
12 carries by the grudging
Packer defense that rose to the
heights once more.
A 3 Mj inch snowstorm in early
morning blanketed the field but
grounds crew and city sanita
tion officials brushed back the
snow and made the field play
able. It rained intermittently
through the game and then
shifted to light snow in the final
stages. Steam rose from the
knots of players as they slithed
in the mud.
Cleveland gave it the big shot

but this simply was not the
Browns' day. Brown had prob
lems finding leverage in the
slipperly turf. The passing game
of Frank Ryan, who completed
eight of 18 for 115 yards, bogged
down due to the alert Packer
defense.
Willie Wood made a key in
terception in the second period,
and Herb Adderly picked off a
last gasp desperation heave by
Ryan in the final seconds.
Starr directed the play calmly
sticking to his running game
after it was established that the
ground route was the way to
travel. However, he still com
pleted 10 of 18 passes with the
hard-to-handle ball and piled up
147 yards passing.
Cleveland struck back quickly
after Starr's early TD pass to
Dale and stunned the big crowd
with a TD on three passes that
ate up only 61 seconds. The pay
off pitch was from Ryan to
Gary Collins, the man who
scored three touchdowns a year
ago in the Browns' upset of the
Baltimore Colts. Then came the
bad break that put the Browns
in the hole. Lou Groza who had
made 96 consecutive points af
ter touchdown in recent years,
was set for the equalizer.
The snap from center appeared
a bit off and was fumbled by
Bobby Franklin ,the holder.
Vital Miss
Groza grabbed the ball and
threw a forward pass to Frank
lin in a desperate try for the
conversion. Wood stacked up
Franklin on the five.
A short punt by Chandler led
the Browns to get into field goal
position midway in the first pe
riod. The 41-year-old veteran
calmly booted the three-pointer
from the 24, sending Cleveland
out front 9-7. Groza, who was
to kick another later, has the
all-time record with 10 field
goals out of 17 attempts.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) —
Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung
charged through the snow, rain
and fog and Don Chandler
kicked three field goals Sunday
to lead Green Bay to the Nation
al Football League champion
ship with a 23-12 victory over
the defending Cleveland Browns.
Playing their old style ball
control game, designed by Coach
Vince Lombardi, Taylor chewed
up Cleveland's line while the
Packers' brilliant defense shut
out the great Jim Brown.
Bart Starr, racked up last
Sunday on the first play of the
bitterly contested playoff game
with Baltimore, hit Carroll Dale
with a 47-yard touchdown pass
in 3:52 of the first period.
Boots
Chandler kicked field goals
from the 15, 23 and 29, tying an
NFL record for most field goals
in a title game, and Hornung
dashed 13 yards on the old style
Packer left end sweep for the
other touchdown.
Taylor, who won the m o st
valuable award and a new car
for his pefrormance in the game,
ground out 96 yards on 27 car
ries on the slippery turf. Hor
nung, the Golden Boy of old
who scored five TDs in a crucial
game with Baltimore in late
season, slid past the Browns'
defenders for 105 yards on 18
carries.
When Taylor wasn't carrying
the ball, Hornung was blocking
for him. And vice versa. The old
Packer pair played briliantly in
this contest played before 50,-
582 in intermittent rain and
snow.
It was the ninth league cham
pionship for the home town
Packers, owned by some 1,400
local fans. They previously had
been tied with the Chicago Bears
at eight.
Jim Brown, the MVP in the
league, was held to 50 yards in
12 carries by the grudging
Packer defense that rose to the
heights once more.
A 3 Mj inch snowstorm in early
morning blanketed the field but
grounds crew and city sanita
tion officials brushed back the
snow and made the field play
able. It rained intermittently
through the game and then
shifted to light snow in the final
stages. Steam rose from the
knots of players as they slithed
in the mud.
Cleveland gave it the big shot

but this simply was not the
Browns' day. Brown had prob
lems finding leverage in the
slipperly turf. The passing game
of Frank Ryan, who completed
eight of 18 for 115 yards, bogged
down due to the alert Packer
defense.
Willie Wood made a key in
terception in the second period,
and Herb Adderly picked off a
last gasp desperation heave by
Ryan in the final seconds.
Starr directed the play calmly
sticking to his running game
after it was established that the
ground route was the way to
travel. However, he still com
pleted 10 of 18 passes with the
hard-to-handle ball and piled up
147 yards passing.
Cleveland struck back quickly
after Starr's early TD pass to
Dale and stunned the big crowd
with a TD on three passes that
ate up only 61 seconds. The pay
off pitch was from Ryan to
Gary Collins, the man who
scored three touchdowns a year
ago in the Browns' upset of the
Baltimore Colts. Then came the
bad break that put the Browns
in the hole. Lou Groza who had
made 96 consecutive points af
ter touchdown in recent years,
was set for the equalizer.
The snap from center appeared
a bit off and was fumbled by
Bobby Franklin ,the holder.
Vital Miss
Groza grabbed the ball and
threw a forward pass to Frank
lin in a desperate try for the
conversion. Wood stacked up
Franklin on the five.
A short punt by Chandler led
the Browns to get into field goal
position midway in the first pe
riod. The 41-year-old veteran
calmly booted the three-pointer
from the 24, sending Cleveland
out front 9-7. Groza, who was
to kick another later, has the
all-time record with 10 field
goals out of 17 attempts.
National Football League
teams struck a bonanza in col
lege talent after weekend bowl
games, scoring overwhelmingly
against the rival American Foot
ball League even though Hous
ton wrapped up a million-dollar
package of tackles.
