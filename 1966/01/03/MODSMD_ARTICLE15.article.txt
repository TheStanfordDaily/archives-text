# UCLA Lead Bowl Upsetters
## 
### 
With the opening of the new
year came the annual football
bowl games all over the coun
try, and with the coming of the
bowl games many unde
feated and untied teams were
upended in major games. Even
the East-West All-Star Shrine
game saw the underdog West
clout the East.
The most striking game of the
bowls was the Rose Bowl, the
original bowl game. Number
one ranked Michigan State was
faced with number five ranked
UCLA. The feeling was preve
lant that UCLA did not even
belong in the bowl, and Michi
gan State was 112 av or e d by a
heavy 14% points.

In the first half the Uclans
scored two opportunistic touch
downs and these held up in the
waning minutes when Michigan
twice failed to score a two point
conversion.
LSU dumped Arkansas, 14-7,
and once beaten Alabama beat
Nebraska 39-28. Both the losers
were undefeated until game
time. By means of their victory
it would seem that Alabama
would acquire the mythical na
tional championship. But UCLA
Coach Tommy Prothro doesn't
agree; he feels that Michigan
State is still the best team in
the nation.
In the East-West game un
sung and unwanted Tod Hullin
threw three touchdown passes
to lead the West All-Stars to an
easy 22-7 victory over an East
squad favored by as much as six
points.
