# Redefining American Goals In The Vietnam Conflict
## 
### 
As the United States commits more and more
men and material to die brutal conflict in Viet
nam, it is increasingly evident that the policy
of escalation accompanied by conciliatory over
tures is more sympathetic of schizophrenia than
realpolitic.
When the U. S. began bombing North Viet
nam last winter, the North Vietnamese esca
lated the war in their own manner by sending
more regular troops into the South. The U. S.
retaliated by landing still more American
troops, and thus after nearly a year of mutual
escalation the war appears to be tending
toward bloody stalemate.
The problem of how to break this stalemate
will be the most controversial—and the most
essential—issue confronting the Administra
tion and the next session of the Congress. It
appears that the President must either follow
the "hawk" line and completely destroy North
Vietnam with bombs—and invasion if it is nec
essary. Or else he must heed the "doves" and
de-escalate the war while undertaking a deter
mined diplomatic offensive designed to initiate
negotiations.
We tend to side with those urging a diplo
matic offensive, provided that American troops
are not removed as a precondition for negotia
tions and that any settlement provide for a
third force—specifically the U.N.—to insure a

neutral Vietnam. If this were done, the U. S.
could cease pouring men and arms into Viet
nam at the rate of $3 million a day and begin
to aid the Vietnamese—as well as the rest of
Southeast Asia—in building a society both po
litically and economically stable. President
Johnson mentioned just such a Marshall Plan
approach in his speech at John Hopkins Uni
versity last Spring.
Moreover, such a settlement would allow the
Administration to pursue its intention of build
ing a Great Society here at home. Given a con
tinuation of the present policy in Vietnam, it is
inevitable that pioneering programs such as
the War on Poverty will have to be cut back
or else taxes will be raised—and that new pro
gram will not even be mentioned.
To make such a settlement will require pa
tience and a realization by the President that
it is not always possible, nor proper, to be
"President of all the people." Concensus does
not always denote skilled leadership, especially
in the field of foreign relations. As the next
session of Congress will make clear, there will
be those who will castigate the President what
ever action he takes.
However, we hope that the Administration
will monitor the ensuing debate closely and
make every effort to eliminate the inconsisten
cies in our Vietnam policy. I

make every effort to eliminate the inconsisten
cies in our Vietnam policy. I
As the United States commits more and more
men and material to die brutal conflict in Viet
nam, it is increasingly evident that the policy
of escalation accompanied by conciliatory over
tures is more sympathetic of schizophrenia than
realpolitic.
When the U. S. began bombing North Viet
nam last winter, the North Vietnamese esca
lated the war in their own manner by sending
more regular troops into the South. The U. S.
retaliated by landing still more American
troops, and thus after nearly a year of mutual
escalation the war appears to be tending
toward bloody stalemate.
The problem of how to break this stalemate
will be the most controversial—and the most
essential—issue confronting the Administra
tion and the next session of the Congress. It
appears that the President must either follow
the "hawk" line and completely destroy North
Vietnam with bombs—and invasion if it is nec
essary. Or else he must heed the "doves" and
de-escalate the war while undertaking a deter
mined diplomatic offensive designed to initiate
negotiations.
We tend to side with those urging a diplo
matic offensive, provided that American troops
are not removed as a precondition for negotia
tions and that any settlement provide for a
third force—specifically the U.N.—to insure a

neutral Vietnam. If this were done, the U. S.
could cease pouring men and arms into Viet
nam at the rate of $3 million a day and begin
to aid the Vietnamese—as well as the rest of
Southeast Asia—in building a society both po
litically and economically stable. President
Johnson mentioned just such a Marshall Plan
approach in his speech at John Hopkins Uni
versity last Spring.
Moreover, such a settlement would allow the
Administration to pursue its intention of build
ing a Great Society here at home. Given a con
tinuation of the present policy in Vietnam, it is
inevitable that pioneering programs such as
the War on Poverty will have to be cut back
or else taxes will be raised—and that new pro
gram will not even be mentioned.
To make such a settlement will require pa
tience and a realization by the President that
it is not always possible, nor proper, to be
"President of all the people." Concensus does
not always denote skilled leadership, especially
in the field of foreign relations. As the next
session of Congress will make clear, there will
be those who will castigate the President what
ever action he takes.
However, we hope that the Administration
will monitor the ensuing debate closely and
make every effort to eliminate the inconsisten
cies in our Vietnam policy. I
