The painful birth of the Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum demonstrates anew how rational
and sincere people can be totally undone by an
irrational system.
On December 17 Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert J. Wert and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith discussed at length with
three members of SSRF the effect that the or
ganization would have on Stanford. A repre
sentative of The Daily was present. The meet
ing was a frank interchange of views, and not
an attempt at aborting the formation of SSRF.
The administrators were concerned that SSRF
by its very nature would provoke antagonisms
—presumably among the Trustees—toward the
expected proposals on modification of the Uni
versity's liquor and judicial regulations. Al
though we find the Dean's concern in this in
stance to be sincere, even commendable, we
think the very necessity of such a meeting—

and such warnings—is indicative of a distress
ingly irrational system.
Whatever one thinks of the SSRF's ideas, it
is obvious that the issues they deal with are
serious, and therefore worthy of some consider
ation by the community. At best, the SSRF can
provoke a meaningful discussion of these is
sues; at worst, it will be a harmless waste of
student's time and energy.
If the decision - makers of the University,
most importantly the Trustees, do not or can
not differentiate between needed and valid re
forms—ones that have the overwhelming sup
port of the student body, considerable support
within the faculty, and the approval of many
administrators—and a set of proposals which
at best are sanctioned by a small minority of
the Stanford community, then this University
is totally incapable of greatness.
