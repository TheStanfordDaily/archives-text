## Lectures 'A Waste Of Time' In Many Graduate Courses 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Meyer's letter (Dec. 2)
suggesting, among other things,
the distribution of copies of lec
ture notes and use of audio-vis
ual aids in the social sciences,
prompts me to suggest the same
in another area.
The lecture, quite often, is a
waste of time in the university
system, particularly in science
and technology and particularly
on a graduate level (I specifical
ly exclude from criticism such
survey courses as Biology 10—
but even here an assemblage of
superb principal and guest lec
turers is supplemented by a
field trip.)
Consider a one-hour "discus
sion period" in lieu of the usual
lecture. Complete notes on the
material to be discussed had
been distributed in the previous
meeting or earlier, such as at
course initiation. A few refer
ences were listed for optional
background reading. The profes
sor opens with a ten minute
talk to emphasize what he feels
important and then, for most of
the period entertains specific
questions on the details of the
notes or the material of the
references. Or better yet, let
him use the Socratic method!
Or the summary and question
periods can be reversed. Or

eliminate the oral summary—
include it in the written repro
duced notes.
By exploiting the Age of the
Xerox and Ditto Machines we
eliminate two sources of error
in the transmission of informa
tion: transmission by the lec
turer (how often the lecturer
must correct his presentation in
subsequent lectures — if he is
aware of the error) and trans
cription by the auditor.

Editor, The Daily:
Ah! These Plaintive Roble
Tales Rend My Heart.
Let me tell a tale of my own.
It's about a boy, a Stanford boy.
This is not the first Institute of
Higher Education he has attend
ed, but it's the first with a ratio
of 3:1000 (acceptably attractive
snakes to men). Although so
cially acceptable elsewhere
(shined shoes, clean breath, rosy
cheeks, and Mum in the arm
pit), he soon learned that here
he was not up to par. He arrived
at this decision through a proc
ess of not-too-subtle reasoning
after being refused dates by 15
consecutive girls during the first
two weeks of the quarter, nine
of them, incidentally, freshmen.

So he devoted his campus lei
sure time to reading The Daily
and getting engaged in a million
activities, and left the campus
whenever he felt the need to
cross the sex line.
He recently met a girl who
seemed quite nice, so he decided
to relent. lie asked her out. But
she was busy that weekend. And
the next. And the next. Until
now this lad had retained some
vestige of pride. He swallowed
it and made reservations for a
date a month ahead. Three days
before the time of trial elapsed,
he called his dream. The date
was off.
"I hadn't realized I had a pre
vious engagement which I real
ly can't break," she said.
What he said in reply doesn't
bear repeating as he was raised
in a nice family and conditioned
not to tell people what they de
serve to be told.
Decidedly upset, this boy de
cided to test himself. He went
to four nearby campi and tried
to pick up the cutest girl he
bumped into on each. Success?
100 per cent. Now I'm not going
to probe this for a moral, but
it'll be a cold, dark July before
I waste my breath on another
Stanford Dolly.
REJECTED BUT NOT
DEFEATED.
