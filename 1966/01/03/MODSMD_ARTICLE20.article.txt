## LBJ Overextends Himself 
### 
In making the budget the
President has come face to face
with the reality of things—that
he has overextended his commit
ments until they have outrun
his power.
It was the President who ex
tended the intervention in sup
port of the South Vietnamese
government into an American
war which is rapidly involving
most of Indo-China; it was the
President who expanded the re
forms and welfare measures of
the New Deal and the New Fron
tier into a war on poverty and
a promise to reconstruct the
country as a Great Society.
Along with these two greatly
expanded undertakings, we con
tinue to pay the large costs of
an accelerated race to the moon.
Contraction or Taxes
The President is now com
pelled to decide whether he will
contract some of his undertak
ings or, in order to preserve
them and yet keep the budget
financially respectable, to raise
taxes. Yet, though whichever
course he chooses will be un
popular, the real problem for
the country is not financial. The
country can easily afford to pay
for all these operations—Viet
nam, poverty, moon.
The real pinch comes from the
fact that money will not buy
enough technicians and trained
men, qualified administrators
and commanders, nor will it buy
the morale and the attention and
the variegated energy which
would be needed to carry out
effectively and successfully all
the commitments at home and
around the globe.
Only those who suffer from
the delusion of omnipotence will
think that this country can re
construct its own society, can
fight a major war in Asia and
can police the world from Berlin
to Korea, from central Asia to
South America.
The real budgetary problem is
not in the amount of money ex
pended and money received: it
is that our commitments as
compared with our intellectual
and moral assets are grossly out
of balance. That is the reason
why the more the Asian war
expands, the more the domestic
war on poverty is bound to con
tract.
'An Ominous Portent'
There is an ominous portent

in the evolution of the Johnson
administration — the portent of
failure after the bright hopes of
its beginning—because the Pres
ident has not taught himself to
measure his ambitions and his
abilities against his own and the
nation's capacity. In the past
year since his inauguration his
commitments have become
grossly overextended and some
where is going to have to give.
This is the crucial and the
radical defect of policymaking
in this administration — an
habitual lack of prudcnce in
making policy and capacity
agree with one another.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk
is a serious offender in this re
spect. Last week, for example,
he was in Paris for a meeting
with our Allies in NATO, and
he pled with them for help in
the Vietnamese War. His central
thesis was his well-known argu
ment that, as he put it in a tele
vision interview on Sept. 7, "The
integrity of that commitment by
the United States is of great
importance to all of those to
whom we have commitments."
Integrity Vs. Capability
Secretary Rusk failed in his
plea. He got no help, and his
argument fell flat. Why? Be
cause he had missed the point.
Our European Allies are not in
doubt about our integrity. They
are in doubt about our capacity
to fight what may be a major
war in Asia and simultaneously
to fight a major war in Europe.
The Europeans are not senti
mentalists. They know that the
deeper Rusk takes us into Asia,
the more certain it is that he
must pull us back elsewhere.
And so, however noble his pro
testations, the Europeans are
concerned with what the United
States can and will do, not with
what it has promised to do.
Rusk and Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara pled
with our Allies to realize that
the war in Vietnam and the con
tainment of China are vitally im
portant to the security of Eu
rope. So they proposed that in
effect NATO be transformed
from a regional alliance in Eu
rope to a global alliance.
Secretary Rusk neglected to
notice that for such an enor
mous extension of the commit
ments of the European nations
a price would have to be paid in

exchange. The price of a global
alliance would be, of course, a
multi-lateral control of Ameri
can military actions all over the
globe, including Vietnam and
the Dominican Republic.
Thd Path Toward Peace
The same kind of softness
and unrealism has brought the
administration to the verge of
what U.N. Ambassador A r th ur
Goldberg has just described as
"a great crisis of confidence ...
over whether . . . we in the ad
ministration . . . really are pur
suing a path to peace." The
President and Secretary Rusk
and Secretary McNamara have
said repeatedly that we are not
fighting to establish a perma
nent military base in South
Vietnam.
Why then should there still
be "great concern" about what
we mean? Because Secretary
Rusk has in effect made it a
condition of our leaving South
Vietnam that there be a govern
ment in Saigon which is stable
and secure and has come to no
agreement with the Viet Cong
who now occupy more than half
the country. This condition is

almost certainly equivalent to
saying we shall never leave
South Vietnam.
We are in deepening trouble
because we are too proud to
face up to the reality, too proud
to recognize a mistake. It has
been said that a sentimentalist
is a man who knows the value
of everything and the price of
nothing.
It must be said that high pol
icy today is in the hands of men
who know the value of freedom,
peace, righteousness and justice
in human affairs, but are all too
little aware of the price that
must be paid to defend them
and promote them. For this
there will be a reckoning.
