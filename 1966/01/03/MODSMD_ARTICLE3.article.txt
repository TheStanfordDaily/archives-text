# Daily Surveys Faculty, Staff On Readership, Distribution
## 
### 
Approximately 3600 questionaire
cards have been distributed to all
faculty and staff members by The
Daily, according to Business Manager
Graham McSwiney.
The purpose of the survey is to ob
tain information about the number of
non-students who read The Daily or
would if they had access to it, Mc-
Swiney said.
The questionaire, which takes up
one side of a 5 x 8" card, also requests
the names of other morning and eve
ning newspapers read by faculty and
staff members, if any. "In this man
ner," McSwiney explained, "we hope
to ascertain just how many Dailies
should be printed and where they
should be distributed. Also, we can
use the information in our advertising
department."
McSwiney noted that number of
Dailies printed each day has been
boosted from 10,000 to 12,000 begin
ning with today's issue. This increase,
which has been made without any
increase in cost, was made possible
by The Daily's decision to have the
paper printed at the Menlo Park Re
corderâ€”while still having the paper
composed by the Stanford press. The
Recorder's sheet-fed web offset press
will turn out the 12,000 Dailies in
less than an hour, whereas the old
system took five hours.
Editor Steve Leopold added that
the changeover "should improve the
quality of our printing reproduction,
especially picture reproduction." He
also hoped that the change would lead
to a lessening of composition costs.
Both McSwiney and Leopold urged

all members of the faculty and staff
to return the questionaires as soon as
possible. Extra questionaires can be
obtained from the Storke Publica
tions Building or by calling ext. 4631.
