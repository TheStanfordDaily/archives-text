# Poll Shows 63% Of Community Backs American Policy In Vietnam

### STEVE HOGLUND 
Are you a Republican? An engi
neering major? If so, the odds are 4
to 1 that you support the present US
policy in Vietnam. But if you are a
Democrat, or if your field is Humani
ties, it's an even bet. These are but a
few of the intriguing patterns which
emerge from tabulations of the Stan
ford iVetnam Poll taken last Novem
ber 29 and 30, which indicates that a
large majority of the Stanford com
munity (63%) favors the war effort,
while 26% opposes it.
The Poll, sponsored by the Political
Union and distributed in residences
and in departmental offices, was de
signed not only to estimate the extent
of support and opposition to US Viet
nam policy, but also to determine, if
possible, what basic beliefs account
for this support and opposition. In
addition, the Poll sought to indicate
feelings about the conditions for and
the goals of negotiations to end the
war. The tabulations provide a back
drop for the Winter Quarter FOCUS
Program of the Political Union, en
titled "US Policy in Southeast Asia,"
and consisting of five weeks of coor
dinated lectures and discussions of
the various issues involved. A similar
poll will be conducted at the end of
the quarter, in order to trace changes
in Vietnam sentiment.
More Polls I>at«;r
Computer correlation of general
feelings about US Vietnam policy
with class, residence, political lean
ings, and field of study, (see table be
low) revealed the following:
(1) A marked drop in support for
US policy, from the freshman to the
graduate level. (Note: Difficulties in
distribution and collection of polls
made it impossible to obtain a sam
pling of graduate students and facul
ty either sizable or representative
enough to warrant generalizations.)
(2) Greater opposition, proportion
ately, among undergraduate women
than among undergraduate men.
(Note: Women are underrepresented
in the poll; the percentages polled at
Union (16%) and Lagunita (20%) fall
considerably below the overall num
ber of undergraduates polled (33%).

while those at Wilbur (42%) and at
the Eating Clubs (39%) are above the
total percentage.)
(3) A decided split among Demo
crats, a bare plurality favoring pres
ent US policy.
(4) Considerable opposition among
freshmen Sponsors to the war in Viet
nam (Note: Compare the Freshmen
totals with the Branner/Roble-Wilbur
totals in the table below.).
(5) Much greater opposition among
those in the field of Humanities than
among those in other fields. (Note:
This may, however, reflect a dispro
portionately large number of gradu

ate students in this field who were
polled.)
(6) A significant number (8-127<
in nearly all groupings) who are
neither for nor against the present
war effort.
Anti-Communism
The poll listed four possible rea
sons for support of US policy in Viet
nam and asked that they be ranked
in order of their importance to each
individual. By far the most important
(cited first by 59% of those who
ranked this section) is: "It is essen
tial to the containment of commu
nism for U. S. National security."

The other three, in decreasing order
of their importance, are: (2) "It pro
motes the freedom and independence
of the South Vietnamese people";
(3) "It is necessary for us to keep
prior commitments"; (4) "As a US
citizen, I feel it is my duty to support
US foreign policy."
No such clear-cut ranking emerges
among those who oppose US policy.
"It violates my moral principles"
stands out as the most important rea
son (cited first by 25% who ranked
this section), and least important as
a basis for opposition is the belief that
"US national security is not. involved."
Yet many stressed the danger of es
calation to all-out war" (cited first by
21%) and the feeling that "The South
Vietnamese people do not want us
there (19%). And although the belief
that the "US has not kept, its commit
ment to seek peace at any time in
any place" received fewer Ist rank
ings than any of the other listed rea
sons, this response nonetheless
ranked nearly evenly in all categories.
Of particular significance is the ex
tent to which people qualify their
support or opposition. Although those
who oppose US policy in Vietnam are,
proportionately, more inclined to
qualify their general feelings than are
those who support the war effort,
fully 10% of the supporters indicated
a fear of escalation—though only 2-
4 r /r cited each of the other 3 reasons
for opposition. On the other hand,
those who oppose US policy qualified
their opposition rather evenly among
the four reasons offered for support
ing the war in Vietnam; each reason
was cited by 6-8% of the opponents.
Yet opponents of the war in Viet
nam need not be overly disheartened
by the overwhelming (63%) support
given US policy. For while present
policy aims at Viet Cong capitulation,
only 27% of those polled favor such
capitulation as a basis for negotia
tions. (Could it be that some of the
supporters don't understand US pol
icy?) A resounding 63% call for
"United Nations mediation" and 9%
desire "Unilateral US declaration of
a cease-fire." Furthermore, the ma
jority of those polled believe
that in negotiations the US should
"Agree to any settlement acceptable
to a majority of the South Vietnamese
people," while only 38% call for "a
settlement that would guarantee a
non-communist government for South
Vietnam."
Finally, when asked what they
would do if drafted, only 48% of th«»
Stanford men would "be willing to
serve in Vietnam," while 41% would
try "to be assigned elsewhere, but
accept unwillingly service in Viet
nam"; 11% declare that they would
"Refuse to serve in Vietnam." Or, as
one girl on the Row wrote in the
margin: "If drafted, I would burn my
draft officer."
