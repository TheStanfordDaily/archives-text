# Draft Situation 'Grim,' Findeisen Warns
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The draft situation has become
"grim" for students throughout the
country who hold 2-S deferments,
Stanford Selective Service advisor
Walter Findeisen told The Daily yes
terday.
"The number of available men who
aren't students has been practically
exhausted," he said, referring partic
ularly to California draft board
areas. Findeisen confirmed that many
draft boards are being forced to re
classify as I-A students in the 2-S
category "just for safety" in meeting
their inflexible monthly quotas.
Draft policy varies considerably be
tween local boards, but in general stu
dents will be classified 1-A and given
pre-induction examinations if:

• They have been undergraduates
for more than four years, or
• They have spent more than two
years in graduate school working for
a masters or a total of more than
five years in graduate school, or
• They have failed to make "nor
mal progress" in school. This includes
skipping a quarter or not carrying an
arbitrary "minimum" course load.
"Hopefully the five-year engineer
ing major will be an exception," Fin
deisen said. The majority of engi
neers at Stanford need more than 12
quarters to earn their degree. "This
should be clarified soon," he noted.
2-S Under Fire
In addition, heavily pressed draft
boards such as San Mateo's have been
reclassifying as 1-A even students

making "normal" progress.
Findeisen expects a whole new set
of Selective Service guidelines to be
issued between now and May 1, set
ting new eligibility requirements for
the 2-S deferment.
If draft calls continue at the pres
ent pace, this new directive will pre
sumably set academic requirements
for deferment like those of the Ko
rean War. At that time, Findeisen
noted, freshmen had to be in top half
of their class, sophomores in the top
%; and juniors in the first % to
qualify for a 2-S deferment for the
next academic year. In addition,
seniors who wished to do graduate
wcrk in any subject except medicine
and law had to be in the top quarter
of their graduating class.

"This country Is at war," Findeisen
said. "The 2-S deferment is not a
static thing. It Ls a privilege, not a
right."
Students have a "misconception"
about their deferments, Findeisen
said, which accounts for much of the
confusion about the draft. He empha
sized that local boards are required
to fill their quotas, and can induct
any man under 35 if necessary.
A backlog of deferment requests,
rising draft quotas and a lack of na
tionwide standards has produced
"confusion" about the draft every
where, Findeisen said. Draft boards
were "lax" about deferments until re
cently because of a manpower sur
plus. The Vietnam escalation caught
boards relatively unprepared. He said

the San Jose board has 2,000 unre
vievved deferment requests-.
Draft boards were "scared" late
last year by Defense Secretary Rob
ert S. McNamara, who acknowledged
that U. S. forces in Vietnam could
increase by 130,000, and that each
man in the field should be backed up
by 6-10 soldiers at home.
Boards Panic
"A lot of the boards kind of pan
icked," Dean Atkinson of UCLA was
quoted as saying.
The rising draft calls (40,200 in De
cember) have prompted many draft
boards to launch an all-out attack on
the 1-SC deferment, Findeisen said.
This deferment can be invoked by
any student who is reclassified 1-A.
It guarantees that he can complete

his current academic year at college,
and thus temporarily prevents his in
duction.
But the I-SC deferment can be used
only once. If a draft board reclassi
fies a student 1-A he is forced to use
his 1-SC deferment immediately. So
the draft board is assured of his later
availability if quotas continue to rise.
When Stanford students are re
classified 1-A, Findeisen suggests they
immediately appeal the decision to
their local board. Deferments can be
protected only in this way, he stressed.
Findeisen said the newly-formed
"Freedom Draft Movement" is wrong
to criticize the University for "coop
erating" with the draft, because the
National Service Office exists only to
help students obtain deferments.
