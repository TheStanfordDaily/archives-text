# Sterling Names Five Profs To Judicial Body
## 
### 
Five professors have been appoint
ed to an interim judicial body by
President Wallace Sterling.
In a letter to Joseph Sneed, a pro
fessor in the Law School who will
serve as chairman of the body, Presi
dent Sterling charged the five-man
panel with two functions:
• To hear appeals from recom
mendations of the student judicial
councils brought to the interim ju
dicial body either by the students in
volved, or by the Dean of Students as
the representatives of the University.
• To hear cases referred by the
student judicial councils where, be
cause of a conflict between Univer
sity policy and regulations and ASSU
Constitution and Bylaws, the student
judicial councils find themselves un
able to act.
Sterling noted that the interim
body would have initial jurisdiction
in these latter cases.
Other professors named to the in
terim panel are Professors Robert
Horn, Political Science; William
Kays, Mechanical Engineering; Lawr
ence Ryan, English; and Morris Zel
ditch, Sociology.
Sterling commented that "if the
number (of appeals) becomes too
burdensome, or if frivolous appeals
are prosecuted, it would be possible
to develop rules to provide for a pro
forma disposition of insubstantial ap
peals."
The new interim body will serve
until a permanent appellate structure
can be established. Discussions about
such judicial reforms are still being
conducted in the Committee of Fif
teen.
