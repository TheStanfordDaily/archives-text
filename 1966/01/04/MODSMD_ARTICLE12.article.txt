Something Old ...
SEX is old, that Ls, not Jim Sayre's new "Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum," which, in the tradition of its Rerkleague
forerunner, took its stand at registration yesterday and
brazenly told Farmers to "fondle it."

... Something New
The new Cowell student Health Center, now noaring" comple
tion, rises behind Wilbur Hall. It Ls conveniently located for
water fight casualties. time the Wilbur and Stern glad
iators clashed, you remember, several limbs and one skull
were smashed.


Something Borrowed ...
Money to build our new Graduate School
of Business was largely borrowed from
Uncle Sam. With Vietnam on the escalator,
it may soon be converted to an ROTC
barracks.
