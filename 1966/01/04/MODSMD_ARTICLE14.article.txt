### 
Dr. Edwin Parker, co-editor of
The Kennedy Assassination and
the American Public, will he the
first speaker in the Stanford
Author Series, today at 4:30 in
the TMTJ small lounge.
In collaboration with Bradley
S. Greenbeig, assistant profes
sor of communication at Michi
gan State University, he edited
reports of interviews of 1300
persons taken the week follow
ing the assassination of Presi
dent Kennedy.
The editors found, as one of
their most important deduc
tions, that the trust of the
American people in their free
press was not misplaced; "the
people got. the full news, they
got it fast, and they got it, with
a very few exceptions, accurate
ly."
Dr. Parker, now an associate
professor of communication at
Stanford, graduated with honors
from the University of British
Columbia in May, 1954. He is
also the author of Television in
the Lives of Our Children.
