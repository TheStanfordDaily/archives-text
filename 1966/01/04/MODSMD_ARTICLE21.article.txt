# CARDS SECOND IN HOLIDAY TOURNEY
## OSU Dumps Tribe, 62-46 Daily Sports 
### TOM EDISON 
Unable to score until almost
five minutes of play had elapsed,
Stanford's basketball team
proved the adage '*you can't
score unless you have the ball"
in losing to Oregon State, 62-46,
in the final contest of the Far
West Classic last Thursday in
Portland.
The high-school sounding score
resulted from the slow-down
tactics of the Beavers who led
after five minutes 7-2. OSU hung
on to this lead, and the ball,
throughout the contest. The
half-time score was 35-21.
Stanford was anything but im
pressive in their final contest in
the Portland tourney.
The Indians, however, using
their height to advantage did
show the consistency that could
lead them to a satisfying season
in beating previously undefeated
Washington State, 38-77, and
drubbing the eventual third
place team Utah State, 93-79.
Both were convincing victories.
OSU's DOMINATES TOURNEY
This was the tenth straight
Classic championship for Ore
gon State. This was the first

time Stanford has entered the
Portland Classic since it origi
nated 10 years ago.
Deadly shooting from the
floor gave the Beavers a 42-25
bulge at one time and kept the
Indians from using their height
advantage effectively. The In
dians had a final 32-30 rebound
advantage.

Top man for Oregon was 6-5
sophomore Loy Peterson with
30 points. Peterson played out
standing hall in all three tourna
ment contests. Ray Kosanke,
who was named to the tourna
ment all-star team along with
Peterson, was high for Stanford
with 18. Bedell and Harris had

11 and 10 respectively against
OSU.
BEAVERS HIT 10 OF 12
In the first ten minutes of the
contest the Beavers dropped in
10 of 12 field goal attempts and
used their stout defense and
keey-away style of offense in
frustrating the Indians' attempt

at stopping the Beavers from
winning their 27th consecutive
game in this tournament.
The Beavers were shooting 15
for 23 from the floor and five of
six from the foul line at the
half. Oregon State finished with
a fat 22-37 shooting average
with the Indians compiling a
meager 14-46.

Pre-tourney favorite Michigan
was upset in their initial con
test by Arizona State, 88-86.
However, Michigan was able to
capture fourth place and break
nearly every scoring record
available.
RUSSELL SETS RECORDS
Individual sensation for Mich
igan was, of course, Cazzie Rus
sell who set a tournament rec
ord of 91 points in three games.
Without the finesse that has
springboarded greats like Elgin
Baylor and Oscar Robertson
into the professional ranks,
Russell uses his size, 220 pounds
and 6-s'a, speed, and deadly out
side shooting from his guard
position to overwhelm his oppo
sition. He is also strong under
the boards averaging over nine
rebounds per outing.
Russell's 35 field goals set a
tournament record. He also con
tributed to Michigan's record
breaking 263 points.
Defensively Oregon State used
ball-control to limit their oppo
sition to a mere 44.7 points per
game. *
The Beavers' "stall" began
with a 2-0 lead.

five minutes of play had elapsed,
Stanford's basketball team
proved the adage '*you can't
score unless you have the ball"
in losing to Oregon State, 62-46,
in the final contest of the Far
West Classic last Thursday in
Portland.
The high-school sounding score
resulted from the slow-down
tactics of the Beavers who led
after five minutes 7-2. OSU hung
on to this lead, and the ball,
throughout the contest. The
half-time score was 35-21.
Stanford was anything but im
pressive in their final contest in
the Portland tourney.
The Indians, however, using
their height to advantage did
show the consistency that could
lead them to a satisfying season
in beating previously undefeated
Washington State, 38-77, and
drubbing the eventual third
place team Utah State, 93-79.
Both were convincing victories.
OSU's DOMINATES TOURNEY
This was the tenth straight
Classic championship for Ore
gon State. This was the first

time Stanford has entered the
Portland Classic since it origi
nated 10 years ago.
Deadly shooting from the
floor gave the Beavers a 42-25
bulge at one time and kept the
Indians from using their height
advantage effectively. The In
dians had a final 32-30 rebound
advantage.

Top man for Oregon was 6-5
sophomore Loy Peterson with
30 points. Peterson played out
standing hall in all three tourna
ment contests. Ray Kosanke,
who was named to the tourna
ment all-star team along with
Peterson, was high for Stanford
with 18. Bedell and Harris had

11 and 10 respectively against
OSU.
BEAVERS HIT 10 OF 12
In the first ten minutes of the
contest the Beavers dropped in
10 of 12 field goal attempts and
used their stout defense and
keey-away style of offense in
frustrating the Indians' attempt

at stopping the Beavers from
winning their 27th consecutive
game in this tournament.
The Beavers were shooting 15
for 23 from the floor and five of
six from the foul line at the
half. Oregon State finished with
a fat 22-37 shooting average
with the Indians compiling a
meager 14-46.

Pre-tourney favorite Michigan
was upset in their initial con
test by Arizona State, 88-86.
However, Michigan was able to
capture fourth place and break
nearly every scoring record
available.
RUSSELL SETS RECORDS
Individual sensation for Mich
igan was, of course, Cazzie Rus
sell who set a tournament rec
ord of 91 points in three games.
Without the finesse that has
springboarded greats like Elgin
Baylor and Oscar Robertson
into the professional ranks,
Russell uses his size, 220 pounds
and 6-s'a, speed, and deadly out
side shooting from his guard
position to overwhelm his oppo
sition. He is also strong under
the boards averaging over nine
rebounds per outing.
Russell's 35 field goals set a
tournament record. He also con
tributed to Michigan's record
breaking 263 points.
Defensively Oregon State used
ball-control to limit their oppo
sition to a mere 44.7 points per
game. *
The Beavers' "stall" began
with a 2-0 lead.
