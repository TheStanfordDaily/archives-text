# TWO MINUTES OF HAIGHT
## We Need APATHY 
### BY TIM HAIGHT 
It's name time again. The
group is APATHY (Activism,
Politics, Arguing, Theories, Hys
teria — Yecch!) The purpose of
this association is to establish
minority rule at Stanford Uni
versity, so that the student
leaders can go about their busi
ness freely without bothering
the rest of us.
This idea may at first go
against the grain of many a
loyal Daily reader, exposed as
he has been to so much sincere
rhetoric about the need for stu
dent involvement, but really the
true activist would benefit from
this arrangement as much as the
more numerous sloths.
What the Activist Wants
After all, what does the acti
vist really want? (An oft-asked
question.) Basically, he wants
one of two things: Either he
wants to be a "moral witness"
to a social injustice, in which
case what other people think
and do doesn't really matter, or
he wants to get things done. And
anyone who has examined the
University power structure
knows that mass student opin
ion is rarely any help. Especial
ly since mass student opinion at
Stanford is usually ex post fac
to. That is, nobody was sure
how the Social Regulations
Changes were going to work out
after the poll last year, but you
just don't see enraged Stanford
women protesting against them
this fall.
The "need for student consen
sus" is mostly a worrisome
sacred cow for student leaders;
they'd be happier off without it.
As for the students, they would
probably prefer the $10,000-plus
LASSII contingency fund to be
raffled off to the holder of the
lucky alpha-sort number.
Readers of The Daily would
benefit, too, since the paper
could do away with all the fuss
over what LASSU did last night
and put in a page of comics in
stead—which, by the way, would
save most of us 10c a day for
The Chronicle.
No Utopia
A Utopia you say? Not at all.
Surprisingly, Student Govern
ment right now is very close to
an ideal state. All we need to do
is accept the antics of a loqua
tious minority, silence the ideal
istic chatter, and read the
comics.
Now here's my plan. First of
all, make the Legislature elect
the ASSU President. Have all
the LASSU Reps elected for life
as a Stanford student except
freshmen, who would require a
prerequisite of a year's idleness.
Have all the members elected at
large, as the Off-Campus Repre
sentatives are now (in the
Spring election the Off-Campus
Rep with the highest number of
votes polled 127; there were 1100
Off-Campus Men eligible to vote

in that election.) Hold the elec
tions on the first rainy day of
Autumn Quarter or on the last
day of Dead Week, whichever
seems the most inopportune at
the time. Have one polling
place, outside of Schultz Audi
torium.
Onoe a year hold a riot, so
that the administration will not
defer student proposals, as they
have, on the grounds that stu
dent opinion was split. Invite
the Press. Carry lots of signs
and sell buttons (tremendous
money-makers.) Break some
thing of traditional symbolism,
like the fingers on the angel
hovering over little Leland's
bier.
Use Same Channels
That would be student gov
ernment. Of course, anyone in
terested in doing anything could

go tnrougn tne same cnanneis
they do now. Decide for them
selves exactly what they want
(a little-known procedure) and
start eliminating or embarras
sing the opposition to it. Things
will get done. Certain issues,
like freedom of worship, might
require a little concerted action,
but really religion is a minority
thing, isn't it?
Really, then, we would lose
little and gain a lot of quiet.
The leaders would not have to
listen to the people (we can see
precedents to this at the national
level, pick your own), and,
wonder of wonders, the people
would not have to listen to the
leaders. I mean, after reading
this column, don't you think the
space could have been better
filled by "Peanuts," "8.C." or
"Pogo"?
