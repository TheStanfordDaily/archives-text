# MONKEY ON MY BACK
## Why The Protesters Fail 
### BY MIKE COUZENS 
The Viet Nam protests are
hurting the universities in an
important way today. They are
harmful because faculty and
students are not recognizing
their place in relation to the
whole society.
Most of us would agree that
the university should impart,
rather than reflect values. But
leadership implies respect, a
sentiment aroused by a com
munity of scholars, not a com
munity of beatniks.
Before we can hope to influ
ence public opinion, we must
recognize that the almost-uni
versal perception of college by
those on the outside is all wrong.
Students are there to get a de
gree and to raise their lifetime
income expectation. The univer
sity is primarily vocational, and
education amounts to training.
So the argument goes.
Naturally this is true for
many, but education has a
broader function. Otherwise,
there is no reason for speeches
on campus, YD's and YR's, or
any notion akin to general stud
ies. If we believe that aware
ness can sometimes be cultiva
ted, then the university should
strive to this end. Job training
is a valuable corrolary.
Secondly, the public believes
that "education" is books and
classes. Committees, guests - in
residence and social functions
are, at best, respite from the
scholar's toil; at worst, they are
irrelevant. If we believe that a
discussion after dinner is edu
cation, too, it is saddening to
discover that the thought never
occurs to most people on the out
side.

Finally, what we dignify as
legitimate debate on foreign pol
icy is seen as rabble-rousers and
beatniks. In terms of moulding
public opinion, the Viet Nam
protest is a flop.
Ship Out the Protesters
Everyone has heard the view
that protesters should be round
ed up and shipped to the front.
They are given draft deferment
—a privilege—to learn, not to
demonstrate. This attitude is so
widespread outside the univer
sity that it militates against any
protest.
Why do student objectors to
war in Viet Nam fail to com
municate to the outside? The
fault lies, I believe, in methods
which are ill-chosen for two rea
sons.
First, public demonstrations
such as marches, draft-card
burnings and vigils may show
strong student opposition to the
war. But they ignore the ease
with which student views are
deprecated. One reader wrote to
the Los Angeles Tunes last fall
to suggest that third-graders
don't tell their teachers how to
run things. Why then, she asked,
should college students?
Unfortunately, this attitude is
as pervasive as it is wrong. Hys
terical protest, apart from being
unbecoming a scholar, generates
a backlash by people who can
scoff at student opinion rather
than consider it.
Second, and I think more im
portantly, such protests do not
recognize their place in a uni
versity wishing to impart val
ues. Student objectors who ran
kle the public distort even

further its perception of the uni
versity's role.
Abberations to Discipline
When students picket and
march, they are not seen as the
manifestation of a strong pro
test undercurrent, but as ab
berations to be disciplined. We
can deplore this attitude, but it
is crucial that we recognize it.
Because the outside world mis
perceives the university, I sug
gest that many forms of protest
are actually harmful, however
fine their motivating goals and
beliefs. What is questionable is
not the right, but th? judicious
ness of exercising it.
This does not mean that the
protest should be watered down
to Doris Day movie specifica
tions. The issues involve human
lives, not lollipops. It suggests,
instead, that some of the most
physical means of demonstra
ting opposition to war are in
effective and harmful. Any pro
tester who conceives of himself
as a martyr should recognize
that his efforts amount to un
productive self-flagellation.
Those who oppose war in Viet
Nam are then caught in a di
lemma. Intellectual discussion
does not convince the public.
And publicity-getting pyrotech
nics offend it.. The only answer
I can suggest is an appeal ad
dressed to the knowledgeable.
Here we may commend teach
ins, even the lopsided ones. And
the Viet Nam Newsletter, if it
ever stops using all its space for
redundant articles from New
Republic, can be valuable. But
only the muted voice of reason,
which of necessity speaks softly,
can possibly be heard.

hurting the universities in an
important way today. They are
harmful because faculty and
students are not recognizing
their place in relation to the
whole society.
Most of us would agree that
the university should impart,
rather than reflect values. But
leadership implies respect, a
sentiment aroused by a com
munity of scholars, not a com
munity of beatniks.
Before we can hope to influ
ence public opinion, we must
recognize that the almost-uni
versal perception of college by
those on the outside is all wrong.
Students are there to get a de
gree and to raise their lifetime
income expectation. The univer
sity is primarily vocational, and
education amounts to training.
So the argument goes.
Naturally this is true for
many, but education has a
broader function. Otherwise,
there is no reason for speeches
on campus, YD's and YR's, or
any notion akin to general stud
ies. If we believe that aware
ness can sometimes be cultiva
ted, then the university should
strive to this end. Job training
is a valuable corrolary.
Secondly, the public believes
that "education" is books and
classes. Committees, guests - in
residence and social functions
are, at best, respite from the
scholar's toil; at worst, they are
irrelevant. If we believe that a
discussion after dinner is edu
cation, too, it is saddening to
discover that the thought never
occurs to most people on the out
side.

Finally, what we dignify as
legitimate debate on foreign pol
icy is seen as rabble-rousers and
beatniks. In terms of moulding
public opinion, the Viet Nam
protest is a flop.
Ship Out the Protesters
Everyone has heard the view
that protesters should be round
ed up and shipped to the front.
They are given draft deferment
—a privilege—to learn, not to
demonstrate. This attitude is so
widespread outside the univer
sity that it militates against any
protest.
Why do student objectors to
war in Viet Nam fail to com
municate to the outside? The
fault lies, I believe, in methods
which are ill-chosen for two rea
sons.
First, public demonstrations
such as marches, draft-card
burnings and vigils may show
strong student opposition to the
war. But they ignore the ease
with which student views are
deprecated. One reader wrote to
the Los Angeles Tunes last fall
to suggest that third-graders
don't tell their teachers how to
run things. Why then, she asked,
should college students?
Unfortunately, this attitude is
as pervasive as it is wrong. Hys
terical protest, apart from being
unbecoming a scholar, generates
a backlash by people who can
scoff at student opinion rather
than consider it.
Second, and I think more im
portantly, such protests do not
recognize their place in a uni
versity wishing to impart val
ues. Student objectors who ran
kle the public distort even

further its perception of the uni
versity's role.
Abberations to Discipline
When students picket and
march, they are not seen as the
manifestation of a strong pro
test undercurrent, but as ab
berations to be disciplined. We
can deplore this attitude, but it
is crucial that we recognize it.
Because the outside world mis
perceives the university, I sug
gest that many forms of protest
are actually harmful, however
fine their motivating goals and
beliefs. What is questionable is
not the right, but th? judicious
ness of exercising it.
This does not mean that the
protest should be watered down
to Doris Day movie specifica
tions. The issues involve human
lives, not lollipops. It suggests,
instead, that some of the most
physical means of demonstra
ting opposition to war are in
effective and harmful. Any pro
tester who conceives of himself
as a martyr should recognize
that his efforts amount to un
productive self-flagellation.
Those who oppose war in Viet
Nam are then caught in a di
lemma. Intellectual discussion
does not convince the public.
And publicity-getting pyrotech
nics offend it.. The only answer
I can suggest is an appeal ad
dressed to the knowledgeable.
Here we may commend teach
ins, even the lopsided ones. And
the Viet Nam Newsletter, if it
ever stops using all its space for
redundant articles from New
Republic, can be valuable. But
only the muted voice of reason,
which of necessity speaks softly,
can possibly be heard.

students are not recognizing
their place in relation to the
whole society.
Most of us would agree that
the university should impart,
rather than reflect values. But
leadership implies respect, a
sentiment aroused by a com
munity of scholars, not a com
munity of beatniks.
Before we can hope to influ
ence public opinion, we must
recognize that the almost-uni
versal perception of college by
those on the outside is all wrong.
Students are there to get a de
gree and to raise their lifetime
income expectation. The univer
sity is primarily vocational, and
education amounts to training.
So the argument goes.
Naturally this is true for
many, but education has a
broader function. Otherwise,
there is no reason for speeches
on campus, YD's and YR's, or
any notion akin to general stud
ies. If we believe that aware
ness can sometimes be cultiva
ted, then the university should
strive to this end. Job training
is a valuable corrolary.
Secondly, the public believes
that "education" is books and
classes. Committees, guests - in
residence and social functions
are, at best, respite from the
scholar's toil; at worst, they are
irrelevant. If we believe that a
discussion after dinner is edu
cation, too, it is saddening to
discover that the thought never
occurs to most people on the out
side.

Finally, what we dignify as
legitimate debate on foreign pol
icy is seen as rabble-rousers and
beatniks. In terms of moulding
public opinion, the Viet Nam
protest is a flop.
Ship Out the Protesters
Everyone has heard the view
that protesters should be round
ed up and shipped to the front.
They are given draft deferment
—a privilege—to learn, not to
demonstrate. This attitude is so
widespread outside the univer
sity that it militates against any
protest.
Why do student objectors to
war in Viet Nam fail to com
municate to the outside? The
fault lies, I believe, in methods
which are ill-chosen for two rea
sons.
First, public demonstrations
such as marches, draft-card
burnings and vigils may show
strong student opposition to the
war. But they ignore the ease
with which student views are
deprecated. One reader wrote to
the Los Angeles Tunes last fall
to suggest that third-graders
don't tell their teachers how to
run things. Why then, she asked,
should college students?
Unfortunately, this attitude is
as pervasive as it is wrong. Hys
terical protest, apart from being
unbecoming a scholar, generates
a backlash by people who can
scoff at student opinion rather
than consider it.
Second, and I think more im
portantly, such protests do not
recognize their place in a uni
versity wishing to impart val
ues. Student objectors who ran
kle the public distort even

further its perception of the uni
versity's role.
Abberations to Discipline
When students picket and
march, they are not seen as the
manifestation of a strong pro
test undercurrent, but as ab
berations to be disciplined. We
can deplore this attitude, but it
is crucial that we recognize it.
Because the outside world mis
perceives the university, I sug
gest that many forms of protest
are actually harmful, however
fine their motivating goals and
beliefs. What is questionable is
not the right, but th? judicious
ness of exercising it.
This does not mean that the
protest should be watered down
to Doris Day movie specifica
tions. The issues involve human
lives, not lollipops. It suggests,
instead, that some of the most
physical means of demonstra
ting opposition to war are in
effective and harmful. Any pro
tester who conceives of himself
as a martyr should recognize
that his efforts amount to un
productive self-flagellation.
Those who oppose war in Viet
Nam are then caught in a di
lemma. Intellectual discussion
does not convince the public.
And publicity-getting pyrotech
nics offend it.. The only answer
I can suggest is an appeal ad
dressed to the knowledgeable.
Here we may commend teach
ins, even the lopsided ones. And
the Viet Nam Newsletter, if it
ever stops using all its space for
redundant articles from New
Republic, can be valuable. But
only the muted voice of reason,
which of necessity speaks softly,
can possibly be heard.
