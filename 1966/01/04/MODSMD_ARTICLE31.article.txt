## The 						President Of Enchilada Meets American Officialdom 
### 
When Washington receives a
head of state, many flowery
words are exchanged, and since
they are spoken in a diplomatic
tongue, one cannot be sure what
each party is really saying.
By a new method of extra
sensory perception I was able
to record not only the words but
the thoughts of the principals
involved.
The dialogue was between the
President of Enchilada and a

very high U. S. government offi
cial. Their thoughts are in
parentheses.
The President of Enchilada
spoke first. "I bring you warm
greetings from my country and
my people. I am happy to set
foot on the great and wonderful
United States and I am deeply
moved by the overwhelming re
ception I have received today."
(This is a reception? I had
more troops greet me in Zam
bia.)
"The United States is happy
to welcome the leader of the
free people of Enchilada. No
one admires more than we the
great strides you have made in
your country and the great con
tributions you have made for
peace and prosperity in our
time."
(I wonder how much dough
he's going to ask for?)
"We are a small country with
many problems besetting us.
We look to you, the most power
ful nation on the face of the
earth, to lend your full support
to resolving the differences be
tween us and the aggressive Up
per Tamale over our legitimate
rights to the Vale of Chili."
(This is your last chance. If
you don't give us the planes and
rockets we want, we know some
one who will.)
"I have visited your country
and I love your people. I even
met one of your sheepherders. I
know we can work toget her. We
both want the same things, so
we must find peaceful solutions
to all problems and that is the
task I have set above all others.
We desire to help you."
Footsie With Red China
(But if you play footsie with
Red Chin? once more, it's cur
tains for you and your crummy
friends.)
"Your country and your peo
ple have been most generous in
coming to the aid of little En
chilada and I would be the first
to admit it. My people look to
you for hope and encourage
ment in the dark days that lie
ahead. All we ask is your un
derstanding."
(And for you to stay the hell
out of Upper Tamale. We would
have had them licked if it
hadn't been for the tanks and
arms you sent them.)
"The United States is deeply
grieved by the tragic events that
have taken place between our
two dearest friends, Enchilada
and Upper Tamale. We must

bind the wounds and sit down
and talk out our differences.
For the only ones who will gain
by this dispute are the Commu
nists."
(You think they would have
something better to do than to
fight over a useless piece of real
estate.)
"My hopes and prayers have
always been to live with our
neighbors. We will pursue every
avenue of peace, no matter how
difficult or how trying these
negotiations will be."
A Squadron of B-52s
(Give me three squadrons of
B-52s and I'll settle the Upper
Tamale problem overnight.)
"But in exchange for our sup
port, Mr. President, we hope
you will support us in our en
deavors in Southeast Asia where
we are trying to find a just so
lution to a very difficult situa
tion."
(A lot you care about what's
happening in Viet Nam.)
"The United States problems
are our problems."
(You should have gotten out
of Viet Nam long ago.)
"I assure you, Mi*. President,
we will always be brothers, for
the things that bind us far out
weigh the things that pull us
apart."
(I hope he finishes soon so I
can get a nap before that damn
state dinner.)
"You have said the words that
have been on my lips."
(Boy, would I like to get a
nap before that damn state din
ner.)

For the only ones who will gain
by this dispute are the Commu
nists."
(You think they would have
something better to do than to
fight over a useless piece of real
estate.)
"My hopes and prayers have
always been to live with our
neighbors. We will pursue every
avenue of peace, no matter how
difficult or how trying these
negotiations will be."
A Squadron of B-52s
(Give me three squadrons of
B-52s and I'll settle the Upper
Tamale problem overnight.)
"But in exchange for our sup
port, Mr. President, we hope
you will support us in our en
deavors in Southeast Asia where
we are trying to find a just so
lution to a very difficult situa
tion."
(A lot you care about what's
happening in Viet Nam.)
"The United States problems
are our problems."
(You should have gotten out
of Viet Nam long ago.)
"I assure you, Mi*. President,
we will always be brothers, for
the things that bind us far out
weigh the things that pull us
apart."
(I hope he finishes soon so I
can get a nap before that damn
state dinner.)
"You have said the words that
have been on my lips."
(Boy, would I like to get a
nap before that damn state din
ner.)
When Washington receives a
head of state, many flowery
words are exchanged, and since
they are spoken in a diplomatic
tongue, one cannot be sure what
each party is really saying.
By a new method of extra
sensory perception I was able
to record not only the words but
the thoughts of the principals
involved.
The dialogue was between the
President of Enchilada and a

very high U. S. government offi
cial. Their thoughts are in
parentheses.
The President of Enchilada
spoke first. "I bring you warm
greetings from my country and
my people. I am happy to set
foot on the great and wonderful
United States and I am deeply
moved by the overwhelming re
ception I have received today."
(This is a reception? I had
more troops greet me in Zam
bia.)
"The United States is happy
to welcome the leader of the
free people of Enchilada. No
one admires more than we the
great strides you have made in
your country and the great con
tributions you have made for
peace and prosperity in our
time."
(I wonder how much dough
he's going to ask for?)
"We are a small country with
many problems besetting us.
We look to you, the most power
ful nation on the face of the
earth, to lend your full support
to resolving the differences be
tween us and the aggressive Up
per Tamale over our legitimate
rights to the Vale of Chili."
(This is your last chance. If
you don't give us the planes and
rockets we want, we know some
one who will.)
"I have visited your country
and I love your people. I even
met one of your sheepherders. I
know we can work toget her. We
both want the same things, so
we must find peaceful solutions
to all problems and that is the
task I have set above all others.
We desire to help you."
Footsie With Red China
(But if you play footsie with
Red Chin? once more, it's cur
tains for you and your crummy
friends.)
"Your country and your peo
ple have been most generous in
coming to the aid of little En
chilada and I would be the first
to admit it. My people look to
you for hope and encourage
ment in the dark days that lie
ahead. All we ask is your un
derstanding."
(And for you to stay the hell
out of Upper Tamale. We would
have had them licked if it
hadn't been for the tanks and
arms you sent them.)
"The United States is deeply
grieved by the tragic events that
have taken place between our
two dearest friends, Enchilada
and Upper Tamale. We must

bind the wounds and sit down
and talk out our differences.
For the only ones who will gain
by this dispute are the Commu

(You think they would have
