## Vietnam Poll Inaccurate In Reflecting Sentiment 
### 
Editor, The Daily
Your headline assertion, "Poll
shows 63'. < of Community Backs
the American Policy in Viet
nam," is clearly wrong. Of the
1512 persons interviewed 1361
were undergrads and only 151
were graduates and faculty.
Since, as you point out, support
for U. S. policy drops markedly
from freshman to graduates and
faculty, the actual percentage
of the Stanford community sup
porting U. S. policy is much less
than 63'/<.
Of the 12.216 undergrads,
grads, and faculty at Stanford,
IS 1 ",; ai"e undergrads, 13'. are
grads and 9 r /< faculty. If your
figures of 39' < and 14' < ap
proval among graduates and fac
ulty, respectively, held up for

samples of reasonable size, com
puting a weighted average sug
gests that only 49% of the Stan
ford academic community sup
ports the American Policy in
Vietnam.
Your unfortunate headline
gives, at best, a misleading im
pression of the sentiment here
at Stanford toward the Vietnam
involvement.

• Evils Of 'Groupism
Editor, The Daily
Stanford students last month
were fortunate enough to hear
Maxwell C. Rafferty, Califor
nia's Superintendent of Public
Instruction deride progressive
education and its attendant evil:
"groupism."
It is hardly surprising, in view
of his past gymnastics, that Dr.
Rafferty could, on the one hand
defend Education for the Indi
vidual and still, on the other
hand conduct a campaign to ban
the Dictionary of American
Slang and other "undesireable"
reading materials from Califor
nia high schools. "We don't
know how much of this modern
stuff is literature," said he, and
went on to endorse the time
tested favorites, his only cri
terion being apparently that all
sources should be well over a
hundred years old and generally
in favor of blood-and-guts indi
vidualism, provided, of course
that the sensitive are not ex
posed to indecorous language.
Dr. Rafferty wishes Califor
nia's students to "laugh with
Dickens, to weep with Thack
ery," but one must infer, not to
curse with Tennessee Williams
or to savor any of the naughty
words in Faulkner's works.
The good Superintendent is
the same man who said, con
cerning a topic no longer re
membered: "When you take off
this strait jacket, you introduce
a lot of wild cards into the game
on which we will have to ride
herd."
—Not a single dirty word in the
whole statement! If only the
average California high school
senior would aspire to such
heights of expression.
Let's all vote for Rafferty to
fight groupism, elevate virtue,
and stamp out nastiness.

Dr. Rafferty wishes Califor
nia's students to "laugh with
Dickens, to weep with Thack
ery," but one must infer, not to
curse with Tennessee Williams
or to savor any of the naughty
words in Faulkner's works.
The good Superintendent is
the same man who said, con
cerning a topic no longer re
membered: "When you take off
this strait jacket, you introduce
a lot of wild cards into the game
on which we will have to ride
herd."
—Not a single dirty word in the
whole statement! If only the
average California high school
senior would aspire to such
heights of expression.
Let's all vote for Rafferty to
fight groupism, elevate virtue,
and stamp out nastiness.

Your headline assertion, "Poll

Since, as you point out, support
for U. S. policy drops markedly
from freshman to graduates and
faculty, the actual percentage

Your unfortunate headline

• Evils Of 'Groupism
Editor, The Daily
Stanford students last month
were fortunate enough to hear
Maxwell C. Rafferty, Califor
nia's Superintendent of Public
Instruction deride progressive
education and its attendant evil:
"groupism."
It is hardly surprising, in view
of his past gymnastics, that Dr.
Rafferty could, on the one hand
defend Education for the Indi
vidual and still, on the other
hand conduct a campaign to ban
the Dictionary of American
Slang and other "undesireable"
reading materials from Califor
nia high schools. "We don't
know how much of this modern
stuff is literature," said he, and
went on to endorse the time
tested favorites, his only cri
terion being apparently that all
sources should be well over a
hundred years old and generally
in favor of blood-and-guts indi
vidualism, provided, of course
that the sensitive are not ex
posed to indecorous language.
Dr. Rafferty wishes Califor
nia's students to "laugh with
Dickens, to weep with Thack
