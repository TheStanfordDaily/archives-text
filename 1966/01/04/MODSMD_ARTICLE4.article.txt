# FIRST FOR CLUBS
## Breakers 'Pledges' Coed 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
A Stanford coed, Sheila McCarthy,
has joined the Breakers Eating Club
as an "associate member." A resident
of the Hoskins hi-rise apartments in
Escondido Village, she is the first
University-housed female to join an
eating club.
Another Stanford woman, 26-year
old Anya Peters, joined El Capitan
last fall, but she lives off-campus and
eats only lunches at the eating club.
Miss Hoskins, who moved to Hos
kins this quarter from the Union
Residence where she was president,
will eat both lunch and dinner at
Breakers.
She decided to eat there because
she has a number of friends in the
club and because it is half-way be
tween campus and the hi-rise apart
ments. "I don't have a bike or a car,"
she said.
"Also, I don't want to codk or play
house," the senior majoring in His

panic-American studies declared, "I
haveln't the time and I figure I will
be cooking for the rest of my life.
Why start now?" She said she ate her
first two meals at Breakers yesterday
and that the food was good.
But Miss McCarthy said there were
few Hoskins residents who share her
enthusiasm over the arrangement.
She knows of only two or three wom
en who are considering joining the
clubs.
No Interest Now
"At this point there is no interest,"
she said, "but maybe there will be
after a month of cooking."
Reportedly, at least three of the
seven eating clubs are interested in
recruiting the Hoskins residents. This
quarter 122 undergraduate women
moved into the freshly-built apart
ments. It is the only women's resi
dence where meals are not served.
The eating clubs have begun adver
tising for "coed associates," partly to
fill up vacancies in a few of the clubs.

They are distributing leaflets at Hos
kins stating that the new program
aims at "recreating the warm, infor
mal atmosphere" of the overseas cam
puses.
The leaflets state that "associate
members" will enjoy the advantages
of eating club members, but the pro
gram retains a "double standard."
Feminine members will not have to
pay social dues.

first two meals at Breakers yesterday
and that the food was good.
But Miss McCarthy said there were
few Hoskins residents who share her
enthusiasm over the arrangement.
She knows of only two or three wom
en who are considering joining the
clubs.
No Interest Now
"At this point there is no interest,"
she said, "but maybe there will be
after a month of cooking."
Reportedly, at least three of the
seven eating clubs are interested in
recruiting the Hoskins residents. This
quarter 122 undergraduate women
moved into the freshly-built apart
ments. It is the only women's resi
dence where meals are not served.
The eating clubs have begun adver
tising for "coed associates," partly to
fill up vacancies in a few of the clubs.

They are distributing leaflets at Hos
kins stating that the new program
aims at "recreating the warm, infor
mal atmosphere" of the overseas cam
puses.
The leaflets state that "associate
members" will enjoy the advantages
of eating club members, but the pro
gram retains a "double standard."
Feminine members will not have to
pay social dues.
