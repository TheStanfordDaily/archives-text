# Professional Radical To Lecture Tonight
## 
### 
A professional radical and a leader
of the militant poor will open the
Tuesday Evening Series tonight at
7:45 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium with
a speech entitled "Action for Equali
ty."
The man—sociologist Saul David
Alinsky—has been described by the
New York Times as "a major force
in the revolution of the powerless
people—indeed, as he is emerging as
a movement unto himself." Apparent
ly Syracuse University did not like
this movement: they dismissed him
last month as a consultant to their
anti-poverty training program.
Students and faculty members may
meet Alinsky at an informal recep

tion in Tresidder Union Large Lounge
at 4:15 today.
Although Alinsky is a graduate of
Hollywood High, his home town is
Chicago where he grew up, attended
the University of Chicago, and until
recently did most of his work or
ganizing the poor. Now he is branch
ing out; Rochester, Detroit, and Kan
sas City are a few of his targets.
A critic of President Johnson's nu
merous anti-poverty programs, Alin
sky himself spent most of his years
"as a little kid in the rear of my fa
ther's tailor shop. My idea of the
Great Society was to be able to go
into a bathroom without my father
shouting, 'A customer is waiting!'"
