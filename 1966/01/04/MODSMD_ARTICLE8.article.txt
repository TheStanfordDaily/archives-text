# Free University Of Palo Alto Started By Graduate Students
## 
### 
With fears of creeping "multi
versities" and time-honored criticism
of college administrations becoming
more vociferous on campuses across
the nation, a group of Stanford stu
dents may have come up with its own
solutions to the problem.
Their answer is the Free University
of Palo Alto (FUPA). The school will
not be free in a monetary sense,
though students will be asked to pay
only a small fee. The free stems from
the university's academic freedom
which is almost complete both for
students and teachers.
Presently FUPA has no place to
conduct classes, no money in the bank
and no formal structure. Many of the
teachers will be Stanford graduate
students, lecturing in their special
ities. However at FUPA, it will be the
students—and not the teachers —who
select the courses and the subject mat
ter to be taught. FUPA will teach a
course in any subject in which there
is sufficient interest.
Left-wing Interests
Although most of the proposed
course titles reflect the leanings of
instructor's interests, which are pre
dominately left-wing in nature, there
will be no limit to the variety of topics
which might be touched at FUPA.
One of the significant features of
the school is its desire to "blur" the
barrier between students and teachers.
On all major decisions students as
well as teachers will be allowed to

vote >rith majority rule deciding
policy.
Among the innovations that FUPA
will incorporate are:
• No prerequisites for courses.
• No grades.
• No entrance requirements.
• Teachers who will not teach but

prompt an interchange of ideas among
class members.
• Majority rule of teachers and
students on policy decisions.
• Unlimited range of studies.
Trade Tech?
Besides the Stanford students par
ticipating in the project, members of
the community have also volunteered
to teach courses. Roy Kepler, active in
Bay-area protest movements and the
owner of Kepler's book store, will
teach a course on "Non-violence and
Its Social Organization."
All subjects will not be of a strictly
academic nature. There are presently
plans to teach a course in welding and
one in interior decorating.
Under the unique arrangement
teachers may find themselves talking
to the blackboard if their words are
not of interest to the FUPA student
body.
Teachers Pay Fee
Similar to European universities,
FUPA will rate a teacher on the basis
of enrollment in his class. Yet even
the best drawing lecturers will not
receive a dime for their work and may
even be asked to pay an "affiliation
fee" for the privilege of airing their
thoughts.
For the present FUPA will be hold
ing night classes only. Although the
new school must compete with other
night schools it plans to draw a dif
ferent cross-section of students than
are usually interested in after dinner
education.
