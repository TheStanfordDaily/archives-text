tain Michael J. Quill was hustled off

to jail Tuesday, still voicing adamant
refusal to halt the four-day eitywide
transit strike. A short time later, he
was stricken ill and rushed to a hos
pital.
Deputy Jail Warden Milton Reiner
quoted Quill's doctor as saying the
president of the striking AFL - CIO

nation and one of the city's chief re
maining transportation arteries.
