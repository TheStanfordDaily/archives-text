# Stu-Fac Expands
## 
### 
The Student Faculty Board,
designed to bring students and
faculty mpmbers into closer
contact, will be holding inter
views during the next week for
new members for spring and
winter quarters.
Over the past year the Board
has greatly expanded its opera
tions to supplement past pro
grams. This winter six more
Student-Faculty Hostels have
been planned, the first for Jan.
14 with Dr. Nevitt Sanford. The
Board also hopes to arrange hos
tels with members of the Ad
ministration and Dean's Office
to discuss University planning
and policy.
Work has begun on The Stan
ford, Professor, a factual publi
cation about Stanford's faculty
and their various backgrounds.
Other programs the Board is
considering include the Gradu
ate School Forum, bringing the
deans of several graduate
schools to talk to interested stu
dents; Student-Faculty-Adminis
tration Luncheons; Alumni din
ners; In-residence seminars; and
a program with a representative
of the National Selective Service
Office to answer questions about
student draft status.
Students interested in apply
ing for a position on the Board
should pick up applications and
sign up for interviews in the
ASSU Otfiee or contact Chair
man Fred Fink at 322-0404.
