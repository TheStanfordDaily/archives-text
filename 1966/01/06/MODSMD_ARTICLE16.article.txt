# Indian Swimmers Travel North This Weekend To Meet Oregon
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity swimming
team opens what may be its
most successful season in years
with a road trip north to meet
Oregon and Oregon State this
weekend.
Oregon, second in the AAWU
behind Southern Cal last season,
has lost a number of its front
line competitors to graduation.
The Indians finished third in
1965. Coach Jim Gaughran has
lost conference butterfly cham
pion Ilkka Suvanto and sprinter
Mike Doscher. A raft of swim
mers from last year's hot frosh
squad will more than fill in the
front line slots and should stack
the line-up with a degree of
depth the Farm has not seen for
a long time.
Sophomore Standouts
Mike Wall, a member of the
1964 Olympic team, will be the
Indians' big gun in the distance
freestyle races. Wall toured Eu
rope with a selected group of
United States swimmers. Wall,

a familiar face in the finals of
national AAU meets for the last
several years, will have his first
chance at a NCAA meet this
spring.
Bob Momsen set the Stanford
pool record for 200 breaststroke
as a freshman last year. To fin
ish a fruitful summer season,
Momsen took fourth in the 200
meter breast in the outdoor AAU
nationals.
Charlie Burbach, a junior
transfer, will give the tribe a
potent 1-2 punch in the breast
stroke events and provide a de
pendable threat elsewhere -in the
lineup.
Gary Sheerer, who broke the
NCAA freshman 200 freestyle
record last year, will be an im
portant man in the Stanford
scoring column.
Frosh Record Breaker
Mark Parmely, who surpassed
the NCAA frosh 500 freestyle
mark along with Wall last year,
will be one to watch in the but

terfly, individual medley, and
freestyle races.
Mike Greene has proven him
self at the middle distance free
style races, and could be the key
to the success of the Card relays
this season. Gaughran looks par
ticularly at the 800 freestyle re
lay at the nationals.
Indian sprinters Bill Derrig,
Bill Meyer, and Craig Brown
will have to come through to
give the Indians a quick striking
threat.
Jim Laney, who won the con
ference 200 individual medley
crown last year, has just re
turned from the Austrian over
seas campus along with sopho
more butterflier Doug Miller. It
may take a while to get back
into form after the six month
respite.
Comebacks Crucial
Gaughran views Laney's and
Miller's comebacks as a crucial
factor in the latter season tilts
with a strong UCLA squad and
USC's NCAA champion team.

Bill Schubach, varsity cap
tain, last year finished the sea
son in a flurry, squeezing vital
conference meet points over to
the Indians, much to the sur
prise of the opposing coaches.
Gaughran is looking for a fast
season's start from the senior
backstroker.
Bill Freeman and Bill Kennedy
will handle the diving chores for
the Indians this season. Their
progress over the season could
help the Cards tremendously.
Bill Manoogian, a sophomore
butterflier, could open up new
lanes for the tribe.
use, UCLA Tough
Gaughran sees UCLA and nat
urally USC as the real foes in
the conference. Oregon will be
strong, but Stanford should ex
perience no such drubbing as
occurred up north last season.
OSU should pose no great prob
lem to the Indians. ,
Washington will probably give
the Tribe Its toughest races in
the early season. The Huskies
meet the Indians Friday, Jan.
14. Washington State and San
Jose State meet Stanford in a
double dual meet the following
Saturday.
Stanford's sizzling freshman
swimmers taste first blood Sat.,
Jan. 15, against San Jose State's
frosh.
