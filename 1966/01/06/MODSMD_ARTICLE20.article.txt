"We can't 'compete' numerically with other
universities, nor should we. We can 'compete,'
and shoidd, on the quality of education."
Professor Ernest I lilgard
Chairman, Executive Committee
of the Academic Council
In the last ten years the number of students
at Stanford has risen from some 8000 to nearly
11,300. Significantly, almost all of this increase
has taken place in the Graduate Division and
professional schools. Today, there are almost as
many graduate students as undergraduates, and
the end to this expansion is not in sight.
Undergraduate enrollment has been limited
by the restricted capacity of women's and fresh
men housing, with only the expanded overseas
campus system making room for increases in
the number of undergraduates. Graduate en
rollment is not similarly hindered. In financial
terms, it is cheaper to admit graduate students
since they do not have to be housed, fed and
regulated as does the undergraduate body.
However, there is a price tagâ€”a high one.
Graduate education requires more extensive
physical facilities and more intensive faculty
supervision and instruction. Thus, the cost of
educating a graduate student is, of necessity,
much higher than the comparative cost of un
dergraduate education.

To quote Professor Hilgard, "The University
seriously needs to consider how many graduate
students we want to have here. Stanford is catch
ing up but still has more to do, on the physical
end of things, for the number we now have en
rolled. If we continue on without a policy on
size, about the time we get caught up with our
size today we'll be in the midst of planning
another vast physical addition and rearrange
ment to cope with the size we have become."
PACE, as the professor indirectly noted, has
made its mark. During the first half of the 'Go's
the University grew as a financial entity by some
17 percent; in the latter part of this decade, the
growth rate is projected at less than one-third of
tliis figure. It will be, as one administrator put it,
a time of consolidation.
The key man in this consolidating process will
be the new provost, a post which has been
vacant since Fredrick Terman retired last
September. His function will be to oversee aca
demic affairs at the University, or, in pure power
terms, to have the major say in who gets what,
where and when in the various academic de
partments.
We would suggest that one of his first tasks
be that of achieving some semblance of stability
in graduate enrollment, so that the University
can concentrate entirely on the quality of its
academic product.
