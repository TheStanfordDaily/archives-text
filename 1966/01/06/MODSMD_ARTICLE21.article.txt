## A 						'Vicious Spiral' In Vietnam 
### 
On Monday morning we were
offered reports by two distin
guished newspapermen, each
citing official estimates of the
number of troops needed in
Vietnam. One of the reporters
said that the increase needed
would be from a strength of
200,000 to a strength of 300,000
men. The other said that "It is
estimated that at least 350,000
U. S. troops will be required and
perhaps 400,000 to 500,000."
This discrepancy may be due
to the fact that each of the re
porters was speaking about a
different period of time. I call
attention to it only because I be
lieve that the war has become
unpredictable, that the President
is caught in a vicious spiral. As
each succeeding prediction and
promise of the President's ad
visers has turned out to be
wrong, the only remedy they
have been able to offer the
President is that he should send
in more troops and do more
bombing. The President, pre
sumably because he could not
think of anything else to do, has
taken their advice and has been
conducting the war like a gam
bler who, when he loses one
round, doubles his bets in the
hope of recovering what he has
lost.
No Military Superiority
After a year of increasing es
calation, the area controlled by
the Viet Cong is larger today
than it was a year ago, and the

North Vietnamese have replied
to the bombing not by ceasing
to intervene in South Vietnam,
but by doing what it was plain
that they would do if we bombed
them—by sending In more and
more of their trained troops. The
result is that we do not have
now, and there is not in sight, a
decisive military superiority.
In order to break this vicious
spiral, the President will have to
begin by clearing up the confu
sion among his advisers about
our own war aims. There are
two basic questions which will
have to be answered before we
can be prepared to negotiate
peace. The fact that there is a
large faction which does not
wish to negotiate peace and is
expressing its views in the press
is proof enough of the confu
sion.
The first and the biggest ques
tion is whether or not we are
fighting to preserve an Ameri
can military lodgment on the
mainland of Asia.
The second, and closely re
lated, question is whether or not
we are prepared to negotiate
the peace with all our adver
saries, including the Viet Cong.
On both of these questions
there are deep differences of
opinion in the country, in Con
gress, and, I venture to say,
within the intimate circle of the
President's advisers. Unless
these differences are resolved,
we are not able to negotiate a

settlement of the war. For they
pertain to the fundamental is
sues about which the war is be
ing fought.
Disclaimers Discredited
On the face of the record the
President, Secretary Rusk and
Secretary McNamara have pub
licly disclaimed any intention of
establishing a permanent U. S.
military base in South Vietnam.
But these disclaimers are not be
lieved by our adversaries nor
even by many of our friends. For
the disclaimers are vitiated by
Secretary R us k's statements
that we shall not leave South
Vietnam until and unless the
government in Saigon has been
stabilized and its independence
is no longer in doubt. This con
dition of our military withdraw
al is tantamount to saying that
for the forseeable and indefinite
future we shall remain to pro
tect, to foster and to guard a
South Vietnamese government
which suits us. For there is no
prospect whatsoever that there
will be the kind of government
Secretary Rusk talks about if we
are not in military possession of
Saigon and some of the other
towns.
Almost certainly, I am con
vinced, the fundamental conflict
between China and the United
States is over our military pres
ence on the mainland of Asia.
Only a small minority among us
in this country have been willing
even to consider the question of

whether our military presence
on the Asian mainland should
be, needs to be and can be made
permanent. As one of this small
minority, I believe it a grave
mistake to attempt to make per
manent our military presence on
the Asian mainland. For I be
lieve that our being there is ab
normal — our military presence
was never conceived as part of
the national interest of the
United States. It is an accidental
and unplanned consequence of
the second world war. Making
this artificial and ramshackle
debris of the old empires perma
nent and committing our lives
and fortunes to its maintenance
means, I believe, unending war
in Asia.
