## Sex And The Mills Girl 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Wo would like to add to Laura
Beckhart's reply to the article
on Mills girls.
Come weekends, Mills girls
don their armor and prepare to
do battle with Stanford boys at
the typical Mills - Stanford ex
change. We hope against over
whelming odds to find an indi
vidual behind all those hands.
The Stanford schizophrenic is
well known on the Mills cam
pus. He comes to Mills (hopeful
of spending a Tom Jonesian
evening) as the hunter stalking
"fair" game. And if HE gets
shot down, he thinks WE are
too concerned with propriety.
Then there is the other—and
definitely more appealing—side
of the Stanford male's personali
ty; the one presented in normal
encounters. It would save much
time and many wounded egoes
if Stanford boys would forget
the exchange-oriented side of
their personalities and quit try
ing to use Mills as a proving

ground for their virility. And as
for conversation—it's rather dif
ficult to solve the problems of
the world with someone who has
had so much to drink that he
can hardly stand, let alone con
verse.
Mills is not an Eastern finish
ing school. But even if it were,
why should manners, poise, and
chivalry be submerged in a one
sexed society in which men are
men and the women are forced
to be masculine too? And you
ask why do we go to a girl's
school? So we can learn how to
contend with Stanford boys . . .
but a little boy is not God's gift
to women.

Editor, The Daily:
Humor is humor, but facts are
facts
Your page three cutline on the
new Graduate School of Busi
ness building is dead wrong in
saying that "money was largely
borrowed from Uncle Sam" to
finance its construction.
In very round figures, ap
proximately $1 million of the
building's $5 million cost comes
from a federal grant. The re
maining $4 million comes from
private sources.
