# B-52 RAIDS:
## A 						Way To Win The War Against Water Buffaloes 
### DEAN JAMISON 
"Aviation Week and Space
Technology" of 29 November
carries a special report on the
B-52 raids in South Vietnam. It
begins by asserting: "(The)
Boeing B-52F strategic bomber
is performing a unique tactical
role in the war in South Viet
nam, well beyond the capability
of the conventional strike fight
er. Its continuing use, coordi
nated with U. S. and South Viet
namese ground troops, could
have an increasingly adverse ef
fect upon the combat effective
ness of the Communist Viet
Cong."
Evidence presented in the ar
ticle fails to substantiate even
this carefully qualified asser
tion.

To date there have been over
80 strikes of from about 12 to
30 aircraft. Each aircraft carries
51 750 lb. general purpose
bombs. The bombs can be fused
to explode on contact or after
penetrating into the ground. For
surface fusing the diameter of
the blast effect is about 190 feet
in jungle terrain. Thus, a little
arithmetic shows that a 30 plane
strike would blast 1.7 square
miles of surface area, assuming
no overlap among bomb craters.
Most of the bombings occur in
the jungle covered Southern
Mountain Plateau that com
prises % of the land area of
South Vietnam. Bernard Fall in
forms us that the population
density in this region is often
fewer than five inhabitants per
square mile (The Two Vietnams,
p. 4); thus, if everyone inside
the blast area is killed and
everyone outside is not, a 30
plane raid might kill 8 or 9 of
the local populace.
More Cong Por Mile
Presumably the Air Force se
lects for its attention regions
with a suspected high density
of Viet Cong; wc might then ex
pect a somewhat greater num
ber of Communists to be killed
during a successful raid.
Evidence presented in Avia
tion Week corrborates the pre
ceeding qualitative estimate of
the anti-personnel efectiveness
of the raids. Aviation Week's
reporter inspected the scene aft
er a 12 bomber raid and was able
to discern 3 bodies from close
aerial inspection (in addition to
a destroyed building, a destroyed
hut, 3 damaged tunnels, and 4
dead water buffalo). The re
porter admits that: . . there
have been no reports of large
concentrations of Viet Cong hav
ing been destroyed or crippled
by the attacks."
In addition to people the
bombs destroy war material;
Aviation Week pictures a some
what damaged looking cache of
shovels and mentions a de
stroyed field hospital. It pre
sents no evidence, however, that
any appreciable quantity of sup
plies has been destroyed.
$10 Million for 100
In one month the Air Force
might launch 10 or 12 raids—
costing a total of well over $10
million—and expect to destroy
less than 100 Vietnamese with
their belongings. Why, then,
does the Air Force use the
bombers ?
A number of reasons seem
plausible:
• Every dead Viet Cong helps.
• The bombers help morale:
"U. S. Army advisers report that,
after a B-52 raid, the South
Vietnamese troops have ad
vanced against a Communist
stronghold without hesitation."
• The raids give SAC crews
combat experience.
• The raids enable the A i r
Force to evaluate the tactical
effectiveness of B-52s for sup
pressing other revolutions.
• Using strategic bombers
helps acclimatize people to esca
lation.
• Using strategic bombers is
an international show of force—
a public display, as it were, of
firm American manhood.
Most likely, I think, we should
view the current B-52 raids as
an escalation that didn't work
and as a predecessor to raids
that will work. For it only takes
one low cost, low yield nuclear
bomb to destroy 1.7 square miles
of earth and all its inhabitants.
