# Alinsky Hits Current Civil Rights Standstill
## 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
"The only worthwhile movement
lacking organization is a bowel move
ment." With these words, crusader
Saul Alinsky, who describes himself
as "an organization animal," startled
the overflow audience at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last night as he sharply
attacked the present standstill in the
civil rights revolution.
Alinsky, an active reformer for
equal opportunities for lower econ
omic and minority groups, fired
through a well-organized sermon
which outlined his ideas on the need
for organizations to act and to achieve
goals, specifically in the civil rights
cause. He climaxed his discussion by
predicting a change in the direction
of future movements.
Lack Of Planning
He felt that the past six months of
relative quiet in this area have been
caused by a lack of planning and need
for new tactics. The movements such
as Selma and Birmingham did not
have the power to compel the opposi
tion to keep their promises.
Organizations, as he had pointed
out in the first part of his speech,
are man's way of acting to acquire
reforms, a necessary weapon in this
cause. Without the power of a co
ordinated effort, all random attempts
are useless.

The Negro leadership, having
achieved certain victories, lacks a uni
fied direction, he said. He noted the
necessity for a broad master plan
which would cover all areas of need.
New tactics—actions which the oppo
sition (government, populace, and
other groups) do not expect— are
necesary for further progress. He be
lieves these "new" methods now being
devised will first be used in Rochester,
New York.
The development of the civil rights
struggle thus far has been the result
of a true revolution in thinking, he
said. Alinsky believes that two im
portant changes had to be achieved
before any progress could be made.
Equality Won
The idea that equal opportunity
could be given is erroneous according
to Alinsky; it must be won by those
who are suffering. The first change
came, he said, when the people in
volved confronted the true issues.
Most advances in this area until re
cently have been by-products of other
problems. To exemplify this, the
speaker uncovered the 1954 Supreme
Court decision to end segregation in
schools as a move to appease non
white foreign countries rather than
an effort to establish equal opportuni
ties at home. The issue of civil rights
now is being attacked directly, said
Alinsky.
