# ST. JOHN'S UNIVERSITY
## Teachers Walk Out 
### 
A teacher's union went on strike
yesterday at New York's St. John's
University in a dispute over academic
freedom and the role of the faculty in
policy making.
The union, the United Federation of
College Teachers (UFCT), called the
strike a complete success, claiming
that at least 200 of the 651 faculty
members at St. John's had honored
the picket lines. The University main
tained that the union's claim was
"absurd."
The union also announced it was
calling for an immediate investigation
into several areas of policy at St.
John's.
The unprecedented walkout was the
first formal strike in American his
tory by the members of a college
faculty. St. John's, one of the largest
Roman Catholic schools in the world,
has been the sight of a long-smolder
ing dispute over the role of the faculty

in the policy making of the univer
sity.
Picket lines appeared on St. John's
two campuses, in Brooklyn and in
Jamaica, at 6:30 a.m. E.S.T. The
strike, postponed one day because of
the New York City transit strike,
came in the wake of the firing of 31
teachers as part of the continuing dis
pute.
In a joint statement, Dr. Israel Ku
ger, UFCT president, and the Rev.
Peter O'Reilly, head of the UFCT
chapter at St. John's, said at least 200
faculty members had honored the
lines "and will not teach their classes."
The union said it had accepted an
offer from New York City Mayor
John V. Lindsay to appoint a mediator
in the dispute.
