## Effect Of Kennedy Death Studied 
### MILTINNIE WONG 
At the first of the Stanford Au
thor's Coffee Hour Series, Dr. Edwin
Parker, associate professor of com
munication at Stanford, spoke on
The Kennedy Assassination and The
American Public: Social Communica
tion and Crisis.
This book was compiled by 38 social
scientists and newsmen and is an in
tegrated collection of sociological re
search about the Kennedy assassina
tion, how people reacted, and how the
flow of information shaped this re
sponse.
The research showed that the na
tional tide of grief, shock and anger
that rolled over the country on No
vember 22, 1963, varied only in inten
sity from rich to poor, well-to poorly
educated, hcild to adult, and from Re
publican to Democrat.
The first and most common reac
tions were sorrow for Mrs. Kennedy
and the children, sorrow that such a
vital young man could be killed at the

height of his powers and anger that
someone could have committed such
a crime.
The second stage of the reaction
was concern about the future political
situation, the survey revealed, due to
the sudden loss of leadership. This
was closely followed by physical
symptoms — weeping, tenseness, fa
tigue, loss of appetite, and sleepless
ness. There were 15 symptoms noticed
and graded. Oddly enough, Dr. Parker
pointed out, the Republicans exceeded
the Democrats only in the reaction
symptom of getting drunk.
The third stage was marked by the
lessening of grief, and a national re
solve to become more tolerant and less
partisan.
More than 1300 persons were inter
viewed in the week following the
assassination, a feat itself remarkable
for the promptness with which the
researchers were able to organize and
begin work. Most of the people were
interviewed personally by trained per

sonnel who talked with cach person
for an hour. Many variables sueh as
sex, age, political preference, race,
residential location, and individual de
fense mechanisms were considered
and studied.
After the half-hour speech, Dr.
Parker invited discussion. Some of the
listeners questioned the effects of the
types of media that transported the
news, the uniformity of response, the
change of opinion concerning Ken
nedy's policies, and minority group
reactions—especially those of the Ne
gro. One student asked, "What moti
vated you to do this research?"
Dr. Parker answered, "After th e
initial shock of the event wore off,
following the emotional response, the
intellectual response was realized.
The relevancy of the behavioral sci
ence was most evident. The reactions
and responses of the people in the
aftermath of the evont are valuable
for comparing and abstracting in an
attempt to understand communica
tion."
