# Thelonious Monk And 'Jazz Casuals' Part Of Festivities
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
The Stanford Jazz Year swings into
the winter quarter with Thelonious
Monk and John Coltrane on Sunday,
Jan. 23. The 2 p.m. session is expected
to pack the 1,700 seat Memorial Audi
torium. Tickets are on sale at Tresid
der box office and going fast.
The Jazz Year got off to a success
ful start last fall with outdoor per
formances by Louis Armstrong, Duke
Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald. The
concerts, exhibits, lectures and films
were designed to introduce the Stan
ford community to the top stars of an
earlier era, Chairman Bale explained.
The current program will present the
top influences in the modern period.
At the opening concert, the audience
will hear Monk, who ranks with El
lington as the most important modern
jazz composer. Ho is a piano soloist
with a deep influence on the contem
porary scene. His group incorporates
the concepts Monk originated in the
early days of modern jazz and pro
jects them into today's music with
intensity, humor and swing.
Coltrane will join Monk on stage for
the first time anywhere. The tenor
saxophonist and his quintet will be
making their initial appearance west
of New York. In a recent Downbeat
readers' poll, Coltrane was named
jazzman of the year, tenor saxophon
ist of the year and record of the year.
He was also voted into the Jazz Hall
of Fame.
A unique experience in audience
artist communication will be initiated
by the Jazz Casual Series. The Friday
afternoon concerts will be hosted by
Ralph Gleason of the San Francisco
Chronicle. He will interview the art
ists and discuss their music during

the two hour concerts, beginning at
4 p.m.
The Casuals will be held in Tresid
der large lounge, with seating limited
to 350. Featured artists will be Jon
Hendricks, Archie Shepp and Denny
Zeitlin.
Hendricks, a jazz poet, once led the
Lambert jazz singing trio. Shepp is a
saxophonist in the field of experimen
tal jazz. A San Francisco psychia
trist, Zeitlin is a pianist whose group
also probes the field of experimental
jazz. Tickets for the informal concerts
are one dollar each.
The final major concert of the quar
ter will bring the Modern Jazz Quar
tet and Dizzy Gillespie to the campus.
The Quartet has been uniquely suc
cessful in combining compositional
jazz with improvisation, breaking the
restrictions of the bar structure. Gil
lespie is considered a virtuoso trum
pet soloist without peer.
He is considered one of the trio of
inventors of modern jazz—along with

Monk and Charles Parker. For the
past two decades he has led big bands
and small groups around the world
with the message of jazz.
The whole Jazz Year program is a
student run, non-profit program. Its
avowed purpose is to present an ex
tensive academic inquiry into this
element of the American cultural
heritage.
"The rock bottom prices for all our
events are made possible because we
made money on both fall concerts. We
are taking all the profits and plowing
them back into the series. Our first
concert will cost $7,000 but we will
make only $4,000 by selling out Mem
Aud. So actually the tickets this quar
ter are being subsidized," Bale said.
Gleason, consultant to the series,
will speak on the artists of the early
forties on Monday afternoon at 4:15 in
Tresidder large lounge. Later lectures
will feature eLonard Feather, author
of the "Encyclopedia of Jazz" and
John Lewis, director of the Modern
Jazz Quartet. The lectures are free.

will feature eLonard Feather, author
of the "Encyclopedia of Jazz" and
John Lewis, director of the Modern
Jazz Quartet. The lectures are free.
The Stanford Jazz Year swings into
the winter quarter with Thelonious
Monk and John Coltrane on Sunday,
Jan. 23. The 2 p.m. session is expected
to pack the 1,700 seat Memorial Audi
torium. Tickets are on sale at Tresid
der box office and going fast.
The Jazz Year got off to a success
ful start last fall with outdoor per
formances by Louis Armstrong, Duke
Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald. The
concerts, exhibits, lectures and films
were designed to introduce the Stan
ford community to the top stars of an
earlier era, Chairman Bale explained.
The current program will present the
top influences in the modern period.
At the opening concert, the audience
will hear Monk, who ranks with El
lington as the most important modern
jazz composer. Ho is a piano soloist
with a deep influence on the contem
porary scene. His group incorporates
the concepts Monk originated in the
early days of modern jazz and pro
jects them into today's music with
intensity, humor and swing.
Coltrane will join Monk on stage for
the first time anywhere. The tenor
saxophonist and his quintet will be
making their initial appearance west
of New York. In a recent Downbeat
readers' poll, Coltrane was named
jazzman of the year, tenor saxophon
ist of the year and record of the year.
He was also voted into the Jazz Hall
of Fame.
A unique experience in audience
artist communication will be initiated
by the Jazz Casual Series. The Friday
afternoon concerts will be hosted by
Ralph Gleason of the San Francisco
Chronicle. He will interview the art
ists and discuss their music during

the two hour concerts, beginning at
4 p.m.
The Casuals will be held in Tresid
der large lounge, with seating limited
to 350. Featured artists will be Jon
Hendricks, Archie Shepp and Denny
Zeitlin.
Hendricks, a jazz poet, once led the
Lambert jazz singing trio. Shepp is a
saxophonist in the field of experimen
tal jazz. A San Francisco psychia
trist, Zeitlin is a pianist whose group
also probes the field of experimental
jazz. Tickets for the informal concerts
are one dollar each.
The final major concert of the quar
ter will bring the Modern Jazz Quar
tet and Dizzy Gillespie to the campus.
The Quartet has been uniquely suc
cessful in combining compositional
jazz with improvisation, breaking the
restrictions of the bar structure. Gil
lespie is considered a virtuoso trum
pet soloist without peer.
He is considered one of the trio of
inventors of modern jazz—along with

Monk and Charles Parker. For the
past two decades he has led big bands
and small groups around the world
with the message of jazz.
The whole Jazz Year program is a
student run, non-profit program. Its
avowed purpose is to present an ex
tensive academic inquiry into this
element of the American cultural
heritage.
"The rock bottom prices for all our
events are made possible because we
made money on both fall concerts. We
are taking all the profits and plowing
them back into the series. Our first
concert will cost $7,000 but we will
make only $4,000 by selling out Mem
Aud. So actually the tickets this quar
ter are being subsidized," Bale said.
