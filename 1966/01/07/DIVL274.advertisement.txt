Montserrat Caballe...
The First RCA Victor Recording of the
Great Spanish Soprano
RCA Victor is exceedingly proud to announce a new association with
the great Spanish diva, Montserrat Caballt, as an exclusive Red Seal
artist. In this, her premiere RCA Victor recording, Miss Caball* offers
a selection of bel canto arias by Bellini and Donizetti, well known
for their intensely difficult coloratura demands. The collection includes
the aria, Com' 6 bello! Quale incanto, from Donizetti's "Lucrezl*
Borgia," a role which launched Miss Caballt's triumphant American
debut at Carnegie Hall in the American Opera Society production. Of
this performance, Winthrop Sargeant writes in The New Yorker, "The
quality of her voice is indescribably beautiful." Textpiece Included.
