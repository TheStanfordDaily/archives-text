# Blood Drives Assessed In ROTC Interview
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the second part
of an interview with Stanford ROTC instruc
tors and students concerning anti-war pro
testors. Those interviewed expressed a belief
in the right of those who oppose government
policy to protest, however they did have many
criticisms of the demonstrators.)

If the experts are as wrong in Vietnam as at
the Bay of Pigs, history may side with the
demonstrators, and"It may be a 100 years be
fore anyone can tell if we were right," admits
Colonel David Nanny, Professor of Military
Science.
He continued, "The demonstrators have
used emotional appeal, and have failed to offer
facts countering the experts. The greatest ac
complishment of the marchers is that it re
quires officials to make decisions on the basis
of fact. Public officials, in a democracy, should
be able to tell what they did and why."
The paradox is, if only experts can make
decisions, democracy is lost. If anyone can
make a decision, experts become irrelevant.

The basic problem of who in a democracy is
technically competent to make decisions is
unresolved.
So, even though the demonstrators are not
experts, they cannot, and, indeed, have not,
been dismissed. An election may change socie
ty's position, and the marchers become the ex
perts. If this makes democracy sound confus
ing, perhaps it is best to remember the obser
vation that democracy is the worst form of
government, except all others.
Blood Drives
Proponents and opponents of Vietnam policy
directly competed with each other by staging
blood drives. While there is evidence that each
blood drive was organized independently, the
result was a contest.
ROTC students and instructors had mixed
reactions. Jeff Grey, Walter Army Society
President, protested his group's blood drive
had really been planned much earlier in the
quarter. He "did not like reducing it to a blood
contest."

A bloodgiver, Grey felt students in general
found bloodgiving to be distasteful. He was
happy with the more than 250 pints collected.
"The blood drive will be on a continuing basis,
every quarter," he added.
Mike Boreing, an ROTC student, declared, "I
signed up to give blood to the Armed Forces
side, because they are my comrades in arms."
He added, "If I could give 2 pints, I would have
given to both sides."
Major William Hammill called the Walter
Army Society blood drive "a glimmer of
brightness amongst the darkness," because
this was one of the first pro-Vietnam policy
activities which appeared in the press.
Who Gets the Blood?
As to the Medical Aid Committee blood
drive, Hammill commented, "Americans are
big-hearted, but there would be no way to in
sure the blood would get to the North Viet
namese people."
ROTC student Alec Lewis echoed this view,
saying, "If you're going to donate blood, do it

through established organizations, like the Red
Cross."
Navy Capt. Brigham noted that blood for
the army was needed, and reported the local
chapter of the American Red Cross had been
asking for donations through newspapers. He
called the giving of blood "an effective demon
stration of loyalty."
"Tricky Tactics"
Commenting on the Medical Aid Committee,
Col. Nanney pointed out that the committee
had gotten publicity first, and then held the
blood drive. The Colonel called this reverse
tactic "tricky."
"I don't feel the Medical Aid Committee
blood drive was peculiar, or terrible, but it
doesn't seem right," said Doug Hansen, a first
year ROTC student. "I believe the constitution
protects the right to picket and protest, but
when we're almost in a state of war, I feel
there are minimum obligations, and it is not
right to give aid to what is really the enemy."
Hansen also felt the Walter Army Societv

blood drive was not really right, calling it "a
form of exhibitionism."
The diversity of opinions on the blood drives
shows there is more than one view even in the
army. Demonstrations and blood drives clearly
serve as publicity devices, but there are other
effects.
Mike Boreing said, "Demonstrations defi
nitely affect the morale of American troops in
Vietnam." Almost every person interviewed
made a similar statement.
American Demonstrations Misrepresented
The North Vietnamese government has used
American demonstrations as propaganda to
tell their own people the "wicked" U. S. gov
ernment will soon be overthrown. But do the
leaders believe their own propaganda?
A British correspondent, recently returned
from Hanoi, thinks this possible, but every
person interviewed claimed the North Viet
namese would "undoubtedly" recognize that a
majority of Americans supported their gov
ernment.

leaders believe their own propaganda?
A British correspondent, recently returned
from Hanoi, thinks this possible, but every
person interviewed claimed the North Viet
namese would "undoubtedly" recognize that a
majority of Americans supported their gov
ernment.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the second part
of an interview with Stanford ROTC instruc
tors and students concerning anti-war pro
testors. Those interviewed expressed a belief
in the right of those who oppose government
policy to protest, however they did have many
criticisms of the demonstrators.)

If the experts are as wrong in Vietnam as at
the Bay of Pigs, history may side with the
demonstrators, and"It may be a 100 years be
fore anyone can tell if we were right," admits
Colonel David Nanny, Professor of Military
Science.
He continued, "The demonstrators have
used emotional appeal, and have failed to offer
facts countering the experts. The greatest ac
complishment of the marchers is that it re
quires officials to make decisions on the basis
of fact. Public officials, in a democracy, should
be able to tell what they did and why."
The paradox is, if only experts can make
decisions, democracy is lost. If anyone can
make a decision, experts become irrelevant.

The basic problem of who in a democracy is
technically competent to make decisions is
unresolved.
So, even though the demonstrators are not
experts, they cannot, and, indeed, have not,
been dismissed. An election may change socie
ty's position, and the marchers become the ex
perts. If this makes democracy sound confus
ing, perhaps it is best to remember the obser
vation that democracy is the worst form of
government, except all others.
Blood Drives
Proponents and opponents of Vietnam policy
directly competed with each other by staging
blood drives. While there is evidence that each
blood drive was organized independently, the
result was a contest.
ROTC students and instructors had mixed
reactions. Jeff Grey, Walter Army Society
President, protested his group's blood drive
had really been planned much earlier in the
quarter. He "did not like reducing it to a blood
contest."

A bloodgiver, Grey felt students in general
found bloodgiving to be distasteful. He was
happy with the more than 250 pints collected.
"The blood drive will be on a continuing basis,
every quarter," he added.
Mike Boreing, an ROTC student, declared, "I
signed up to give blood to the Armed Forces
side, because they are my comrades in arms."
He added, "If I could give 2 pints, I would have
given to both sides."
Major William Hammill called the Walter
Army Society blood drive "a glimmer of
brightness amongst the darkness," because
this was one of the first pro-Vietnam policy
activities which appeared in the press.
Who Gets the Blood?
As to the Medical Aid Committee blood
drive, Hammill commented, "Americans are
big-hearted, but there would be no way to in
sure the blood would get to the North Viet
namese people."
ROTC student Alec Lewis echoed this view,
saying, "If you're going to donate blood, do it

through established organizations, like the Red
Cross."
Navy Capt. Brigham noted that blood for
the army was needed, and reported the local
chapter of the American Red Cross had been
asking for donations through newspapers. He
called the giving of blood "an effective demon
stration of loyalty."
"Tricky Tactics"
Commenting on the Medical Aid Committee,
Col. Nanney pointed out that the committee
had gotten publicity first, and then held the
blood drive. The Colonel called this reverse
tactic "tricky."
"I don't feel the Medical Aid Committee
blood drive was peculiar, or terrible, but it
doesn't seem right," said Doug Hansen, a first
year ROTC student. "I believe the constitution
protects the right to picket and protest, but
when we're almost in a state of war, I feel
there are minimum obligations, and it is not
right to give aid to what is really the enemy."
Hansen also felt the Walter Army Societv

blood drive was not really right, calling it "a
form of exhibitionism."
The diversity of opinions on the blood drives
shows there is more than one view even in the
army. Demonstrations and blood drives clearly
serve as publicity devices, but there are other
effects.
Mike Boreing said, "Demonstrations defi
nitely affect the morale of American troops in
Vietnam." Almost every person interviewed
made a similar statement.

American Demonstrations Misrepresented
The North Vietnamese government has used
American demonstrations as propaganda to
tell their own people the "wicked" U. S. gov
ernment will soon be overthrown. But do the
leaders believe their own propaganda?
A British correspondent, recently returned
from Hanoi, thinks this possible, but every
person interviewed claimed the North Viet
namese would "undoubtedly" recognize that a
majority of Americans supported their gov
ernment.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This Is the second part
of an interview with Stanford ROTC instruc
tors and students concerning anti-war pro
testors. Those interviewed expressed a belief
in the right of those who oppose government
policy to protest, however they did have many
criticisms of the demonstrators.)

If the experts are as wrong in Vietnam as at
the Bay of Pigs, history may side with the
demonstrators, and"It may be a 100 years be
fore anyone can tell if we were right," admits
Colonel David Nanny, Professor of Military
Science.
He continued, "The demonstrators have
used emotional appeal, and have failed to offer
facts countering the experts. The greatest ac
complishment of the marchers is that it re
quires officials to make decisions on the basis
of fact. Public officials, in a democracy, should
be able to tell what they did and why."
The paradox is, if only experts can make
decisions, democracy is lost. If anyone can
make a decision, experts become irrelevant.

The basic problem of who in a democracy is
technically competent to make decisions is
unresolved.
So, even though the demonstrators are not
experts, they cannot, and, indeed, have not,
been dismissed. An election may change socie
ty's position, and the marchers become the ex
perts. If this makes democracy sound confus
ing, perhaps it is best to remember the obser
vation that democracy is the worst form of
government, except all others.
Blood Drives
Proponents and opponents of Vietnam policy
directly competed with each other by staging
blood drives. While there is evidence that each
blood drive was organized independently, the
result was a contest.
ROTC students and instructors had mixed
reactions. Jeff Grey, Walter Army Society
President, protested his group's blood drive
had really been planned much earlier in the
quarter. He "did not like reducing it to a blood
contest."

A bloodgiver, Grey felt students in general
found bloodgiving to be distasteful. He was
happy with the more than 250 pints collected.
"The blood drive will be on a continuing basis,
every quarter," he added.
Mike Boreing, an ROTC student, declared, "I
signed up to give blood to the Armed Forces
side, because they are my comrades in arms."
He added, "If I could give 2 pints, I would have
given to both sides."
Major William Hammill called the Walter
Army Society blood drive "a glimmer of
brightness amongst the darkness," because
this was one of the first pro-Vietnam policy
activities which appeared in the press.
Who Gets the Blood?
As to the Medical Aid Committee blood
drive, Hammill commented, "Americans are
big-hearted, but there would be no way to in
sure the blood would get to the North Viet
namese people."
ROTC student Alec Lewis echoed this view,
saying, "If you're going to donate blood, do it

through established organizations, like the Red
Cross."
Navy Capt. Brigham noted that blood for
the army was needed, and reported the local
chapter of the American Red Cross had been
asking for donations through newspapers. He
called the giving of blood "an effective demon
stration of loyalty."
"Tricky Tactics"
Commenting on the Medical Aid Committee,
Col. Nanney pointed out that the committee
had gotten publicity first, and then held the
blood drive. The Colonel called this reverse
tactic "tricky."
"I don't feel the Medical Aid Committee
blood drive was peculiar, or terrible, but it
doesn't seem right," said Doug Hansen, a first
year ROTC student. "I believe the constitution
protects the right to picket and protest, but
when we're almost in a state of war, I feel
there are minimum obligations, and it is not
right to give aid to what is really the enemy."
Hansen also felt the Walter Army Societv

blood drive was not really right, calling it "a
form of exhibitionism."
The diversity of opinions on the blood drives
shows there is more than one view even in the
army. Demonstrations and blood drives clearly
serve as publicity devices, but there are other
effects.
