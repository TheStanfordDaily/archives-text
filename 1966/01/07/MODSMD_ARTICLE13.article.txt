Dr. Bruce Stocker, Guinness
Professor of Microbiology at the
University of London and spe
cialist in the field of bacterial
genetics, has been appointed
professor of medical microbio
logy at the Stanford University
School of Medicine. His appoint
ment became effective January
1.
"Dr. Stocker's background and
interests provide a felicitous
combination for the teaching
and research activities of the
medical microbiology depart
ment," noted Dr. Robert J. Glas
