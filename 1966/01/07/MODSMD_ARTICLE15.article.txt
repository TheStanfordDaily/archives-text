# Colleges Experiment With Liberal Grading Program
## 
### 
The possibility of completing
an entine undergraduate career
without ever attending classes
is being offered to 75 college
freshmen at Lake Forest College
this fall, according to the Col
lege Press Service.
The participants are free of
the usually required courses,
class attendance, grades and
credits. A national selection com
mittee picked the students, all
who had accelerated high school
preparation.
The experiment is being un
derwritten by a $325,000 Ford
Foundation grant.
"Students must pass compre
hensive exams in the humani
ties, social sciences and natural
sciences. They also must follow
a major program, which re
quires a research project and a
research paper to graduate, Wil
liam Bartlet, director of the
program, explained.
Bartlet says the program has
threo objectives:

• Without course require
ments, the student will be able
to follow the range of his own
abilities and interests;
• He will be able to participate
in more interdisciplinary study,
avoiding the barriers of formal
courses;
• Student-faculty relationship
should improve, as the elimina
tion of grading will correspond
ingly decrease a professor's
"monitoring" fuiiction.
Others Experiment
Other schools are also experi
menting with the standard grad
ing system.
The California Institute of
Technology faculty voted to drop
grades in freshman courses last
fall. The Cal Tech faculty said
this was to make the transition
between high school and college
a smoother one for entering stu
dents. Fresliman level courses
are now evaluated on a pass-fail
basis.

Dean of Freshmen Foster
Strong said: "What we are doing
dramatizes what we think stu
dents are here for. Ordinarily,
students feel the pressure to try
and get a B even though they
are not interested in the course.
Remove Pressures
"This is not the way a scholar
should feel. Adults who are suc
cessful don't work this way. We
want to take off the artificial
pressures and let these talented
kids develop as they would like
to develop," Strong said.
Courses are being conducted
as before: there are the same
assignments, quizzes and tests.
Tests are graded numerically. At
the end of the course, numerical
grades are used lo determine
whether Ihe student passes or
fails. Letter grades are neither
given to the students nor kept
by the professors.
The standard grading proce
dures are followed at Cal Tech
iri all courses above the fresh
man level.
According to Dean Strong the
system is undergoing a two-year
evaluation. The faculty will de
termine whether or not to con
tinue the program at the end of
this year.

Tests are graded numerically. At
the end of the course, numerical
grades are used lo determine
whether Ihe student passes or
fails. Letter grades are neither
given to the students nor kept
by the professors.
The standard grading proce
dures are followed at Cal Tech
iri all courses above the fresh
man level.
According to Dean Strong the
system is undergoing a two-year
evaluation. The faculty will de
termine whether or not to con
tinue the program at the end of
this year.
The possibility of completing
an entine undergraduate career
without ever attending classes
is being offered to 75 college
freshmen at Lake Forest College
this fall, according to the Col
lege Press Service.
The participants are free of
the usually required courses,
class attendance, grades and
credits. A national selection com
mittee picked the students, all
who had accelerated high school
preparation.
The experiment is being un
derwritten by a $325,000 Ford
Foundation grant.
"Students must pass compre
hensive exams in the humani
ties, social sciences and natural
sciences. They also must follow
a major program, which re
quires a research project and a
research paper to graduate, Wil
liam Bartlet, director of the
program, explained.
Bartlet says the program has
threo objectives:

• Without course require
ments, the student will be able
to follow the range of his own
abilities and interests;
• He will be able to participate
in more interdisciplinary study,
avoiding the barriers of formal
courses;
• Student-faculty relationship
should improve, as the elimina
tion of grading will correspond
ingly decrease a professor's
"monitoring" fuiiction.
Others Experiment
Other schools are also experi
menting with the standard grad
ing system.
The California Institute of
Technology faculty voted to drop
grades in freshman courses last
fall. The Cal Tech faculty said
this was to make the transition
between high school and college
a smoother one for entering stu
dents. Fresliman level courses
are now evaluated on a pass-fail
basis.

Dean of Freshmen Foster
Strong said: "What we are doing
dramatizes what we think stu
dents are here for. Ordinarily,
students feel the pressure to try
and get a B even though they
are not interested in the course.
Remove Pressures
"This is not the way a scholar
should feel. Adults who are suc
cessful don't work this way. We
want to take off the artificial
pressures and let these talented
kids develop as they would like
to develop," Strong said.
Courses are being conducted
as before: there are the same
assignments, quizzes and tests.

the end of the course, numerical
