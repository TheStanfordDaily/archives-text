LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
pace toward a quarter system
and all-year operation for the
State College System will be
quickened "if at all possible,"
says Chancellor Glenn S. Dum
ke.
Referring Wednesday to a Co
ordinating Council for Higher
Education request to speed up
conversion, Dumke said:
"We are trying to look into
this matter in a way that will
satisfy the coordinating council."
The council asked last month
for conversion to the quarter
system on all campuses by 1967
and to complete transition to
year-round operation by 1970-71.
The colleges had planned a more
leisurely transition. Dumke said.
"I personally feel that this re
quest was unreasonable," said
Dumke, "but we are studying it
to see what can be done."
