BOULDER. Colo iCPS — The
Roguits of the l'niviu>it\ of Colo
rado have been charged with \ 10-
•lating the VS. Constitution by
placing the Boulder chapter of
Sigma Chi fraternity on proba
tion.
The charge was made in a suit
fiit'd m the I .S. District Court of
Denver by a Denver attorney on
behalf of the National Sigma Chi
Fraternity, it- Boulder chapter,
and their respective corporate
structures.
The suit also requests that the
probation status of the chapter
be ruled "to be in excess ot the
defendant's jurisdiction, arbitrary
and capricious, unconstitutional
and void, and of no force and
effect."
The suit lists the following al
leged violations of the Constitu
tion:
• Denial of the right of ass
ociation. freedom of choice, free
dom of religion, freedom of
speech as guaranteed by the
First Amendment.
• Denial of freedom of con
tract under the Fifth Amend
ment.
• Denial of equal protection of
the law under the 14th Amend
ment.
o Denial of due process o?
law under the 14th Amend men:
Power Questioned
If a federal court finds that the
Regents cannot regulate Sinnu
Chi, it would seem logical, these
same observers say, that the Re
gents are without power to regu
late any aspect of the university
community except academic de
partments and the use of the
physical plant.
The implications of a Sigma
Chi victory might be broader
still. For currently Sigma Chi,
and other campus social organ'-
zations, have access to myriad
facilities—intramural fields, com
puter time, offices and meeting
rooms, the use of auditoriums—
on their campuses.
Sigma Chi also claims that the
probation lowered the value of
the house by $10,000 and reduced
the chapter's yearly income by
another $10,000.
Aside from testing the issues
involved directly in the proba
tion case, the suit raises a ques
tion seldom litigated—the exact
scope of authority of the govern
ing body of a state-supported in
stitution.

same observers say, that the Re
gents are without power to regu
late any aspect of the university
community except academic de
partments and the use of the
physical plant.
The implications of a Sigma
Chi victory might be broader
still. For currently Sigma Chi,
and other campus social organ'-
zations, have access to myriad
facilities—intramural fields, com
puter time, offices and meeting
rooms, the use of auditoriums—
on their campuses.
Sigma Chi also claims that the
probation lowered the value of
the house by $10,000 and reduced
the chapter's yearly income by
another $10,000.
Aside from testing the issues
involved directly in the proba
tion case, the suit raises a ques
tion seldom litigated—the exact
scope of authority of the govern
ing body of a state-supported in
stitution.
