THE (.'HAIRS will complete the bill. Both plays will run in Little
Theater through next Sunday. Novelist Hawkes, author of "The
Lime Twig" and other hooks will conduct an informal discussion
after the opening night performance.
FILMS
Friday's Tresidder film is THE JAZZ SINGER, the first talkie
ever made, starring A 1 Jolson. This is the first in a series of films
devoted to the American musical.
THE 400 BLOWS is Saturday's Tresidder offering. Directed by
Francois Trulfaut, it, too, is the first in a series, this one about
France's "New Wave" of experimental filmmakers. Future selec
tions will include ''Last Year at Marienbad" and"The Lovers."
Both the Friday and Saturday series show at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30.
The Sunday Flicks is a return engagement, THE BLOB. It's a
big piece of chewing gum, see, and they stick it on the screen. But,
it stars Steve McQueen, so it can't be all bad.
On Wednesday, the International Film Discussion series will
show KANAL, a Polish film.
The Beatles Triumphant are at the Bijou. It will be A HARD
DAY'S NIGHT to resist, what with John, George, Paul, and Ringo
crying HELP me make even more money for Queen and Country.
It will undoubtedly be a riotous evening.
The Fine Arts has THE LEATHER BOYS (see review on this
page). With it is THE PUMPKIN EATER, an unimpressive study
of a woman undergoing several emotional crises.
REPULSION, wherein a young woman commits some grisly
murders while mentally unhinged, is at the Guild. It was directed
by the same man who did the excellent movie "Knife in the Water."
CINCINNATI KID, a pretty pallid remake of "The Hustler," is
at the Paris. Joining it is BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING, the Otto
Preminger thriller about a disappearance, of all things.
The Park has DO NOT DISTURB, starring, of course, Doris Day,
and Frank Sinatra in ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS. The
hoods in question are Sinatra's Rat Pack (his friends), and a Doris
Day flick is a Doris Day flick. They are both sort of comedies; they
are also pretty awful.
The Stanford has THAT DARN CAT and CLARENCE THE
CROSS-EYED LION, or "Fun for the Kiddies but No One Else."
The cat is a Siamese who follows kidnappers followed by FBI men
who are allergic to cats and make fools of themselves, naturally.
The line to see it at Radio City Music Hall in New York is literally
miles long; why will remain one of the great mysteries of the
century.
And the Varsity is packing them right up to the rafters these
days with THUNDERBALL, which everybody knows is the latest.
James Bond epic. They seem to be getting epic-er and epic-er. Also
more gim-cracky. But The Daily will make sure next week and
report authoritatively.
OTHER
LEON FLEISHER, pianist, is the San Francisco Symphony's
guest artist on Wednesday evening. The program is William Schu
man's Eighth Symphony, which will have its West Coast Premiere,
the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, and Strauss' "Death and Trans
figuration."
On Monday afternoon at 4:15, RALPH GLEASON will lecture
on "The Evolution of Modern Jazz" in the Tresidder Union Large
Lounge.
On Tuesday at 4:15, Professor Rivers will discuss his new book
on the press, THE OPINIONMAKL'RS. in the Tresidder Lounge.

Series.
