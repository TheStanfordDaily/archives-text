# Convincing Performances In Uneven 'Leather Boys'
## 
### Roger McDaniel 
Sidney J. Furie, who did such
a fine job with "The Ipcress
File," has another film out and
it too shows him for the good
director he is. The cultural set
ting is that of English motor
cyclists, and it's called "The
Leather Boys."
The story centers on Reggie
Wilcox, played by Colin Camp
bell. He and Dot, his girl (Rita
Tushingham), get married be
cause they get tired of spending
some of their time out of bed.
But married life isn't all it's
cracked up to be. There are cans
to be opened and dishes to be
washed — and husbands and
wives to be put up with.
Until you can't stand it. Reg
gie's escape is through his mo
torcycle to Pete, a new friend,
and it's through their relation
ship that, the real problems
arise.
The marital relationship la
neither unique nor particularly
interesting. Both Reggie and
Dot are shown to be immature
and th is—especially regarding
Dot — is reinforced throughout
the film. She doesn't realize that
marriage involves responsibili
ties and demands certain
changes in behavior, and Reggie
is unable to talk meaningfully
to her to convince her of this.
Fine Job
Rita Tushingham does her us
ually fine job as the loud, self
centered, demanding sixteen
year-old wife so that it is no
strain to understand her hus
band's agonies. She stretches it
almost to the point of being too
much to believe, but she suc
cessfully stops short of that.
Director Furie builds up the
contrast, between Reggie's two
conflicting relationships very
clearly, but perhaps a bit too
much so. Reggie and Pete have
a far more compatible life to
gether than do Reggie and Dot.
As Reggie says, he can talk to
Pete easily, while his encounters
with Dot always end In anger
and yelling at one another.
Very close male-male relation
ships are often considered some
what suspect, but there is noth
ing physical between Reggie and
Pete. The film seems to go
slightly out of its way to show
this, however. It seems almost
as though Furie anticipates neg
ative reactions from the audi
ence and wants to leave no
doubt that there can he beauti
ful, satisfying (yet inoffensive)
relationships between men and,
by contrast with Reggie's mar
riage, that sometimes these are
preferable (among "normal"
people) to standard bisexual re
lationships.
The treatment of this is a
little too strong. The contrast
between the two relationships is
not subtle enough to seem less

like a rhetorical argument than
"a slire of life."
When the film is dealing with
its central subject—the relation
ships—it is very successful and
at times moving. The individual
scenes between Reggie and Dot
and between Reggie and Pete
are the best in the film.
The Race
But during the motorcycle
race in the middle of the film,
the subject gets lost in all those
wheels rolling over all that high
way. Though it sets up the cli
max of the film, too much time
is spent on this long and monot
onous setting of the redevelop
ment of Reggie and Dot's inter
est in one another.
Both Colin Campbell and Dud
ley Sutton as Pete give good,
convincing performances. Sut
ton's stands out, however. His
character is more interesting
and more complete and covers
a wider range of expression.
The music is usually properly
unobtrusive, but at the end of
the film, when Reggie must de
cide finally what he's to do, it
gushes with false sentimentality
and interferes with a serious
and moving scene.
"The Leather Boys" is not a
particularly subtle film, but it
treats an interesting and impor
tant problem professionally and
sympathetically. It is well worth
seeing.
