### TOM EDISON 
Stanford's boxing team, pre
paring for their first conference
match against the University of
California next Thursday, will
enter nine boxers in tomorrow
night's California Collegiate
novice boxing meet. The match
es will begin at 7:30 in Encina
Gym.
Stanford's Coach Ray Lunny
will be taking a long look at
each boxer tomorrow night hop
ing to be able to round out his
forces anticipating a tough five
game season this year.

Completing the five - game
schedule will be an additional
match with Cal and one each
with the 12th Naval District,
Chico State College, and the Uni
versity of Nevada. All but the
second Cal match and the single
with Nevada will be held at

Bellows' Only Veteran
Tomorrow's matches will fea
ture boxers who have had no
previous boxing experience.
Stanford's only returning vet
eran this year will be George
Bellows one of the mainstays
from last year's squad when he
fought in the 147-pound class.
George will be fighting in a
heavier division this year hav
ing put on a little weight com
plemented with a considerable
amount of strength. George will
definitely be the Card's top box
er this year.
Another hopefully bright spot
in Stanford's boxing hopes is
Delos Brown in the heavyweight
division. Brown, who has been
under the guidance of football
coach John Ralston for three
years, will be boxing for the
first time this year for the Stan
ford varsity. Lunny is so high
on Brown's boxing ability that
he has not been entered in the
novice match.
As Lunny phrased it,"He is
just too tough to fight Satur
day."
Besides the lack of experience
of Lunny's forces, Ray also ex
pressed concern over the ab
sence of varsity boxers in his
first three boxing divisions.
Stanford has always been weak
in the lighter divisions but this
year it is extremely bad.
Coach Lunny described the
importance of his lighter weight
boxers by stating that the only

time he has had a complete
team was in 1960 and that was
the year he won the conference.
Stanford will have to forfeit the
first three matches this year.
There will be a total of 18
matches in Saturday's meet
with Stanford boxers competing
in nine of them.

Stanford's only returning vet
eran this year will be George
Bellows one of the mainstays
from last year's squad when he
fought in the 147-pound class.
George will be fighting in a
heavier division this year hav
ing put on a little weight com
plemented with a considerable
amount of strength. George will
definitely be the Card's top box
er this year.
Another hopefully bright spot
in Stanford's boxing hopes is
Delos Brown in the heavyweight
division. Brown, who has been
under the guidance of football
coach John Ralston for three
years, will be boxing for the
first time this year for the Stan
ford varsity. Lunny is so high
on Brown's boxing ability that
he has not been entered in the
novice match.
As Lunny phrased it,"He is
just too tough to fight Satur
day."
Besides the lack of experience
of Lunny's forces, Ray also ex
pressed concern over the ab
sence of varsity boxers in his
first three boxing divisions.
Stanford has always been weak
in the lighter divisions but this
year it is extremely bad.
Coach Lunny described the
importance of his lighter weight
boxers by stating that the only

time he has had a complete
team was in 1960 and that was
the year he won the conference.
Stanford will have to forfeit the
first three matches this year.
There will be a total of 18
matches in Saturday's meet
with Stanford boxers competing
in nine of them.
Stanford's boxing team, pre
paring for their first conference
match against the University of
California next Thursday, will
enter nine boxers in tomorrow
night's California Collegiate
novice boxing meet. The match
es will begin at 7:30 in Encina
Gym.
Stanford's Coach Ray Lunny
will be taking a long look at
each boxer tomorrow night hop
ing to be able to round out his
forces anticipating a tough five
game season this year.

Completing the five - game
schedule will be an additional
match with Cal and one each
with the 12th Naval District,
Chico State College, and the Uni
versity of Nevada. All but the
second Cal match and the single
with Nevada will be held at
Stanford.
