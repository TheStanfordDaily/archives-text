# Postscript To PACE
## 
### 
One of the more intriguing—and welcome
benefits of the PACE program has been the
gradual, but clearly perceptible, transformation
of the faculty.
In part, of course, this was a planned trans
formation. PACE's primary objective was to up
grade the academic caliber of the University;
and with the promises of almost instantaneous
tenure, annual 5 percent salary increases, mod
erate climate, sabbaticals and periodical 'work
ing' vacations at the overseas campuses, the
University was markedly successful in its at
tempt to become a first-rate academic power.
Moreover, as the brilliant and aggressive
young — and not so young — emigres from the
East and Midwest moved in, they began to stim
ulate intellectual curiousity not only among
their students, but also among some of their
colleagues who had let early promise — and, in
some cases, achievement — gradually wither
away in what a San Francisco Examiner report
er once termed Stanford's "lotus pads of aca
deme." Some who had quit publishing and re
searching began to do so again; others stepped
aside for younger men. Academically, then, the
University has prospered from the PACE drive.
However, there was a price for this intellectual
infusion.
To the newly arrived professors, some of the
nuances of the "Stanford family tradition," which
the University is prone; to boast about even to

day in its official bulletins and—believe it or
not—football programs, appeared as useless
anachronisms. If he is a Jewish or Catholic pro
fessor, he doesn't go to a campus church; but ra
ther must drive off-campus; all because the
Trustees still feel bound by a 19th century in
terpretation of nonsectarianism.
If he is from Yale, or one of numerous other
institutions, where the liquor regulations are in
accordance with state law—or even more liberal
than state law—he will find that Stanford tradi
tion has consigned him to a never-ending intra
faculty struggle to requisition and stock a liquor
locker of his own. This is because the Stanfords
disapproved of die stronger spirits.
On issues that do not directly concern him,
such as social regulations, coed housing, judicial
reform and women's off-campus housing, he
probably wonders at the Administration's hesi
tancy when such diverse institutions as Reed al
low women complete freedom of residency, Wis
consin lets its 21-year old coeds live off-campus,
and UCLA sees nothing wrong with coeduca
tional dormitories.
Thus, when these 'out-bred' professors are
elected to responsible posts in the political liier
archy of the faculty, they do not feel bound by
the traditions, and for that reason Stanford —
which so eagerly seeks to become a respected
national university—will find that change is one
of the prices of excellence.

On issues that do not directly concern him,
such as social regulations, coed housing, judicial
reform and women's off-campus housing, he
probably wonders at the Administration's hesi
tancy when such diverse institutions as Reed al
low women complete freedom of residency, Wis
consin lets its 21-year old coeds live off-campus,
and UCLA sees nothing wrong with coeduca
tional dormitories.
Thus, when these 'out-bred' professors are
elected to responsible posts in the political liier
archy of the faculty, they do not feel bound by
the traditions, and for that reason Stanford —
which so eagerly seeks to become a respected
national university—will find that change is one
of the prices of excellence.
What hath PACE wrought?
One of the more intriguing—and welcome
benefits of the PACE program has been the
gradual, but clearly perceptible, transformation
of the faculty.
In part, of course, this was a planned trans
formation. PACE's primary objective was to up
grade the academic caliber of the University;
and with the promises of almost instantaneous
tenure, annual 5 percent salary increases, mod
erate climate, sabbaticals and periodical 'work
ing' vacations at the overseas campuses, the
University was markedly successful in its at
tempt to become a first-rate academic power.
Moreover, as the brilliant and aggressive
young — and not so young — emigres from the
East and Midwest moved in, they began to stim
ulate intellectual curiousity not only among
their students, but also among some of their
colleagues who had let early promise — and, in
some cases, achievement — gradually wither
away in what a San Francisco Examiner report
er once termed Stanford's "lotus pads of aca
deme." Some who had quit publishing and re
searching began to do so again; others stepped
aside for younger men. Academically, then, the
University has prospered from the PACE drive.
However, there was a price for this intellectual
infusion.
To the newly arrived professors, some of the
nuances of the "Stanford family tradition," which
the University is prone; to boast about even to

day in its official bulletins and—believe it or
not—football programs, appeared as useless
anachronisms. If he is a Jewish or Catholic pro
fessor, he doesn't go to a campus church; but ra
ther must drive off-campus; all because the
Trustees still feel bound by a 19th century in
terpretation of nonsectarianism.
If he is from Yale, or one of numerous other
institutions, where the liquor regulations are in
accordance with state law—or even more liberal
than state law—he will find that Stanford tradi
tion has consigned him to a never-ending intra
faculty struggle to requisition and stock a liquor
locker of his own. This is because the Stanfords
disapproved of die stronger spirits.
On issues that do not directly concern him,
such as social regulations, coed housing, judicial
reform and women's off-campus housing, he
probably wonders at the Administration's hesi
tancy when such diverse institutions as Reed al
