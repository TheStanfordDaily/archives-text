# Grad Student Ousted -For FUPA Activity?
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
A third year Stanford graduate stu
dent was dismissed from his teaching
job at Woodside Priory School for his
participation in the Free University of
Palo Alto.
Charle Li, who is working for his
doctorate in mathematics was notified
by officials of the school that he was
not to return to Woodside after the
Christmas vacation.
Shortly before school resumed, Li
was summoned to a meeting with
Headmaster Father Christopher. Li
was told that his association with
"left-wing radicals" could not be tol
erated by the school.
Contacted yesterday by The Daily,
Father Christopher refused to com
ment upon the dismissal of Li. How
ever he said that the school had re

tained the law firm O'Grady, Doll, and
Goodman.
Declined to Comment
James B. O'Grady declined to com
ment upon the dismissal. He said that
the dismissal was a matter "between
Mr. Li and the school."
Li told The Daily that the Catholic
boys' prep school had been pressured
by John Birchers for his removal. Ac
cording to Li, his associates with
FUPA and not his personal politics
was the reason for the dismissal.
School officials had been unaware
of Li's private activities prior to De
cember when his picture apepared in
the Palo Alto Times as one of the or
ganizers of the Free University. Wood
side had no knowledge of his partici
pation in various campus protest ac
tivities.
Li is a member of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam. He was
the organizer of the Stanford students
who picketed Maxwell Taylor's speech
at Foothill College.
Not the Cause
Li emphasized that his protest ac
tivities were not the cause of his re
moval and were still unknown to the
school.
Li is a member of the FUPA Steer
ing Committee. When the Free Uni
versity begins classes February 1, Li
is scheduled to teach a course on "The
Modern Revolution in China." Li re
fuses to label his personal politics, al
though he is against present Adminis
tration policy in Vietnam.
Although the school is under con
tractual obligation to retain Li, the
Stanford graduate student said that
he was not interested in a financial
settlement but would attempt to be
reinstated.
A Test Case
He views his dismissal as a test as
to just how free American education
is. Li has contacted the American
Civil Liberties Union and expects their
support in his fight for reinstatement.
In his position as calculus and algebra
teacher, Li said that his private opin
ions had absolutely no bearing upon
his work.
