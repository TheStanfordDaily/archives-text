## Nuclear War Games Ad 'Tastless' 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
The advertisement for Nuclear
War Games on page 3 of Wed
nesday's issue is the most taste
less advertisement that I have
ever seen. It might have been
remotely humorous if no such
game existed. But the fact that
the game does exist and is sell
ing only demonstrates the Amer
ican insensitivity to war.
It's all very nice to "destroy
your best friends" until you see
their guts blown all over some
white wall. It's all very nice to
dress up your little boys in
Christmas-new toy army outfits
until you realize that maybe in
ten years they'll be in fatigues
lying in some rice paddy with
out any head.
I can hardly believe that The
Daily is in such financial diffi
culty that it must support and
further American insensitivity
to reality by publishing such ad
vertisements.

Editor, the Daily:
The cardinal abuse of statis
tics is drawing conclusions from
an improper sample. In a public
opinion survey the sample
should always be selected in ad
vance on a random basis and
then followed up until answers
are obtained.
We refer to Monday's head
line: "Poll Shows 63% of Com
munity Backs American Policy
in Vietnam." Robert A. Bjork
pointed out in his letter the fol
lowing day that on the basis of
the data the figure should be
49%. However, it is impossible
to draw any meaningful figures
or inferences from a poll in
which the questionnaires were
indiscriminately handed out and
voluntarily handed in. You have
only a catalog of those who re
plied, and very often whether or
not a person hands in his ques
tionnaire is highly correlated
with how he feels about the is
sues involved, and whether or
not he ever saw the question

naire in this case will be cor
related with his particular posi
tion or habits, which might also
be correlated with his feelings.
We understand that the figure
of 63% has been broadcast on
nation-wide networks as repre
senting the Stanford communi
ty. It is unfortunate that those
who use statistics do not under
stand what procedures are sta
tistically sound. It is especially
unfortunate that the Political
Union should have made such a
mistake. We would be glad to
meet with the Political Union
before their next survey to dis
cuss sampling procedures.

• Liberals And KKK
Editor, the Daily:
The behavior of the liberal
community towards the investi
gation of the Ku Klux Klan by
the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee has been dis
gusting.
Many who call themselves Lib
erals have shown themselves in
their response to this investiga
tion to be far from liberal in
fact. Rather than speaking up
for the rights of Klan members
and decrying the investigation,
these people have refrained from
criticizing the investigation, us
ing rationalizations of the fol
lowing order: "President John
son was the one who urged the
investigation, and he's a Demo
crat; "Investigations of the
H. U. A. C. variety are unfair to
certain individuals, but, then
again, this investigation will
help the Civil Rights Movement"
(Notice the distinction they
make between the "Civil Rights
Movement" with capital letters
and "civil rights" with small let
ters); "Witch-hunting went out

with McCarthy, so we need not
fear H. U. A. C. turning around
and again taking a swipe at the
left."
Real liberals see through these
rationalizations.
I think that the H.U.A.C. in
vestigation, which to date has
been quite popular, (largely, I
think, because by holding the
K.K.K. responsible for the "Ne
gro Problem," people are able to
escape any kind of personal re
sponsibility for this problem)
could be made to be unpopular.
This could be done, I suggest, by
vocal denunciation in newspa
pers convinced that such is the
proper course of action (The
Washington Post, The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and the New York
Times would be likely candi
dates), as well as by vocal de
nunciation by prominent Civil
Rights leaders (whose past reti
cence makes them not wholly
worthy of that title.)
Denunciation by them would
be particularly effective, be
cause it has been against them
that the KKK has worked. It
would show that they are really
serious about civil liberties. If
they were to denounce the
H.U.A.C. for investigating the
K.K.K. and by so doing tram
pling on individual liberties,
they would certainly be listened
to attentively.

• Whose Union?
Editor, The Daily:
What is the purpose of Tre
sidder Memorial Union? Is it to
provide services for students, or
is it to provide an outlet for
various commercial ventures?
One might well be pardoned for
answering no, yes.
In contrast to Unions to be
found at many overseas univer
sities, the control of Union pol
icy is not vested firmly in those
who use it most, i.e., the stu
dents, though for the sake of
form they are given some say.
It is surely shameful too that
barbers' shop and Union shop

prices should be so much higher
than prices which can be ob
tained in nearby Palo Alto—off
campus.
Food prices have also been
compared unfavorably by some
students to those at other cam
puses.
What is the solution, or is
there none, or is it not worth
while trying to achieve one?

Re: the letter of December 1
which was signed by the Roble
Dollies. While the fact that 50
percen' of the girls in Robie Hall
remain in their rooms on Friday
and Saturday nights assiduously
studying Western Civ is prob
ably true, the Roble girls fail to
consider one very important
fact.
In th.. read world outside of
Stanford, at least 60% of the
girls at Roble would be found
seriously lacking in the qualities
which generally serve as mark
ers by which to judge sex appeal.
As a result a conservative 10
percent of the girls are finding
life in a university better than
former environs.
Therefore we feel that the Ro

congratulate the Frosh men
who are making life more liva

What is the purpose of Tre

One might well be pardoned for
answering no, yes.
In contrast to Unions to be

who use it most, i.e., the stu

It is surely shameful too that
barbers' shop and Union shop

than prices which can be ob

Food prices have also been

The cardinal abuse of statis

an improper sample. In a public

should always be selected in ad

We refer to Monday's head
line: "Poll Shows 63% of Com

in Vietnam." Robert A. Bjork
pointed out in his letter the fol
lowing day that on the basis of
the data the figure should be
49%. However, it is impossible
to draw any meaningful figures
or inferences from a poll in
which the questionnaires were
indiscriminately handed out and
voluntarily handed in. You have
only a catalog of those who re
plied, and very often whether or
not a person hands in his ques

with how he feels about the is
sues involved, and whether or
not he ever saw the question

naire in this case will be cor
related with his particular posi
tion or habits, which might also
be correlated with his feelings.
We understand that the figure
of 63% has been broadcast on
nation-wide networks as repre

Editor, the Daily:
The behavior of the liberal
community towards the investi
gation of the Ku Klux Klan by
the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee has been dis
gusting.
Many who call themselves Lib
erals have shown themselves in
their response to this investiga
tion to be far from liberal in
fact. Rather than speaking up
for the rights of Klan members
and decrying the investigation,
these people have refrained from
criticizing the investigation, us
ing rationalizations of the fol
lowing order: "President John
son was the one who urged the
investigation, and he's a Demo
crat; "Investigations of the
H. U. A. C. variety are unfair to
certain individuals, but, then
again, this investigation will
help the Civil Rights Movement"
(Notice the distinction they
make between the "Civil Rights
Movement" with capital letters
and "civil rights" with small let
ters); "Witch-hunting went out

with McCarthy, so we need not
fear H. U. A. C. turning around
and again taking a swipe at the
left."
Real liberals see through these
rationalizations.
I think that the H.U.A.C. in
vestigation, which to date has
been quite popular, (largely, I
think, because by holding the
K.K.K. responsible for the "Ne
gro Problem," people are able to
escape any kind of personal re

could be made to be unpopular.
This could be done, I suggest, by

• Liberals And KKK
Editor, the Daily:
The behavior of the liberal
community towards the investi
gation of the Ku Klux Klan by
the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee has been dis
gusting.
Many who call themselves Lib
erals have shown themselves in
their response to this investiga
tion to be far from liberal in
fact. Rather than speaking up
for the rights of Klan members
and decrying the investigation,
these people have refrained from
criticizing the investigation, us
ing rationalizations of the fol
lowing order: "President John
son was the one who urged the
investigation, and he's a Demo
crat; "Investigations of the
H. U. A. C. variety are unfair to
certain individuals, but, then
again, this investigation will
help the Civil Rights Movement"
(Notice the distinction they
make between the "Civil Rights
Movement" with capital letters
and "civil rights" with small let
ters); "Witch-hunting went out

with McCarthy, so we need not
fear H. U. A. C. turning around
and again taking a swipe at the
left."
Real liberals see through these
rationalizations.
I think that the H.U.A.C. in
vestigation, which to date has
been quite popular, (largely, I
think, because by holding the
K.K.K. responsible for the "Ne
gro Problem," people are able to
escape any kind of personal re
sponsibility for this problem)
could be made to be unpopular.
This could be done, I suggest, by
vocal denunciation in newspa
pers convinced that such is the
proper course of action (The
Washington Post, The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and the New York
Times would be likely candi
dates), as well as by vocal de
nunciation by prominent Civil
Rights leaders (whose past reti
cence makes them not wholly
worthy of that title.)
Denunciation by them would
be particularly effective, be
cause it has been against them
that the KKK has worked. It
would show that they are really
serious about civil liberties. If
they were to denounce the
H.U.A.C. for investigating the
K.K.K. and by so doing tram
pling on individual liberties,
they would certainly be listened
to attentively.

• Whose Union?
Editor, The Daily:
What is the purpose of Tre
sidder Memorial Union? Is it to
provide services for students, or
is it to provide an outlet for
various commercial ventures?
One might well be pardoned for
answering no, yes.
In contrast to Unions to be
found at many overseas univer
sities, the control of Union pol
icy is not vested firmly in those
who use it most, i.e., the stu
dents, though for the sake of
form they are given some say.
It is surely shameful too that
barbers' shop and Union shop

prices should be so much higher
than prices which can be ob
tained in nearby Palo Alto—off
campus.
Food prices have also been
compared unfavorably by some
students to those at other cam
puses.
What is the solution, or is
there none, or is it not worth
while trying to achieve one?

Editor, the Dally:
The advertisement for Nuclear
War Games on page 3 of Wed
nesday's issue is the most taste
less advertisement that I have
ever seen. It might have been
remotely humorous if no such
game existed. But the fact that
the game does exist and is sell
ing only demonstrates the Amer
ican insensitivity to war.
It's all very nice to "destroy
your best friends" until you see
their guts blown all over some
white wall. It's all very nice to
dress up your little boys in
Christmas-new toy army outfits
until you realize that maybe in
ten years they'll be in fatigues
lying in some rice paddy with
out any head.
I can hardly believe that The
Daily is in such financial diffi
culty that it must support and
further American insensitivity
to reality by publishing such ad
vertisements.

• Stats Men Aghast
Editor, the Daily:
The cardinal abuse of statis
tics is drawing conclusions from
an improper sample. In a public
opinion survey the sample
should always be selected in ad
vance on a random basis and
then followed up until answers
are obtained.
We refer to Monday's head
line: "Poll Shows 63% of Com
munity Backs American Policy
in Vietnam." Robert A. Bjork
pointed out in his letter the fol
lowing day that on the basis of
the data the figure should be
49%. However, it is impossible
to draw any meaningful figures
or inferences from a poll in
which the questionnaires were
indiscriminately handed out and
voluntarily handed in. You have
only a catalog of those who re
plied, and very often whether or
not a person hands in his ques
tionnaire is highly correlated
with how he feels about the is
sues involved, and whether or
not he ever saw the question

naire in this case will be cor
related with his particular posi
tion or habits, which might also
be correlated with his feelings.
We understand that the figure
of 63% has been broadcast on
nation-wide networks as repre
senting the Stanford communi
ty. It is unfortunate that those
who use statistics do not under
stand what procedures are sta
tistically sound. It is especially
unfortunate that the Political
Union should have made such a
mistake. We would be glad to
meet with the Political Union
before their next survey to dis
cuss sampling procedures.

• Liberals And KKK
Editor, the Daily:
The behavior of the liberal
community towards the investi
gation of the Ku Klux Klan by
the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee has been dis
gusting.
Many who call themselves Lib
erals have shown themselves in
their response to this investiga
tion to be far from liberal in
fact. Rather than speaking up
for the rights of Klan members
and decrying the investigation,
these people have refrained from
criticizing the investigation, us
ing rationalizations of the fol
lowing order: "President John
son was the one who urged the
investigation, and he's a Demo
crat; "Investigations of the
H. U. A. C. variety are unfair to
certain individuals, but, then
again, this investigation will
help the Civil Rights Movement"
(Notice the distinction they
make between the "Civil Rights
Movement" with capital letters
and "civil rights" with small let
ters); "Witch-hunting went out

with McCarthy, so we need not
fear H. U. A. C. turning around
and again taking a swipe at the
left."
Real liberals see through these
rationalizations.
I think that the H.U.A.C. in
vestigation, which to date has
been quite popular, (largely, I
think, because by holding the
K.K.K. responsible for the "Ne
gro Problem," people are able to
escape any kind of personal re
sponsibility for this problem)
could be made to be unpopular.
This could be done, I suggest, by
vocal denunciation in newspa
pers convinced that such is the
proper course of action (The
Washington Post, The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and the New York
Times would be likely candi
dates), as well as by vocal de
nunciation by prominent Civil
Rights leaders (whose past reti
cence makes them not wholly
worthy of that title.)
Denunciation by them would
be particularly effective, be
cause it has been against them
that the KKK has worked. It
would show that they are really
serious about civil liberties. If
they were to denounce the
H.U.A.C. for investigating the
K.K.K. and by so doing tram
pling on individual liberties,
they would certainly be listened
to attentively.

• Whose Union?
Editor, The Daily:
What is the purpose of Tre
sidder Memorial Union? Is it to
provide services for students, or
is it to provide an outlet for
various commercial ventures?
One might well be pardoned for
answering no, yes.
In contrast to Unions to be
found at many overseas univer
sities, the control of Union pol
icy is not vested firmly in those
who use it most, i.e., the stu
dents, though for the sake of
form they are given some say.
It is surely shameful too that
barbers' shop and Union shop

prices should be so much higher
than prices which can be ob
tained in nearby Palo Alto—off
campus.
Food prices have also been
compared unfavorably by some
students to those at other cam
puses.
What is the solution, or is
there none, or is it not worth
while trying to achieve one?
