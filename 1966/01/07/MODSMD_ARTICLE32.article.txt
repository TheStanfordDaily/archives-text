# The
						Hunter's Guide To Stanford 'Birds'

### BOB BJORING 
The emaciatcd secretaries at
the Bookstore this week were
inundated with questions as to
the location of text book sec
tions. After several days of such
treatment, they developed a su
perb technique for book location
that will serve even after the
rush for textbooks is over and
the rush to women begins again.
"Follow the girls," suggested
Susy Steno, secretary to the
Supplies Manager. "Behind every
stereotyped woman is a re
quired textbook." Miss Steno
then elaborated her theories.
'Psyched' Out
"Just yesterday, for instance,
I was working hard and, well
pretty hard, and anyway a girl
walked by with jet black eyes
staring straight ahead. I mean
the girl hadn't had a bite to eat
for days, and kept tapping her
fingers on a comb she was car
rying. Just then a student asked

me where the Psvoh books were,
so just as a joke I told him to
follow her. Well, he was just a
normal student, so of course he
didn't even stop to think, he just
followed the bird, and sure
enough, he ended up at the
Psych section."
Miss Steno was emphatic
about the 100% applicability of
the girls to majors correspond
ance, even in such large depart
ments as History and English.
"Of course the freshman women
are a problem, taking courses
like English 2 and Civ. That can
be overcome, though. Fresh
dollies are immediately identifi
able— they're just young and
spoiled looking, you know what
I mean, both ways."
"The English majors are the
real gas. All of them wear glass
es (all that reading, you know)
except a lot of the girls wear
the glasses just for looks. I sup
pose it's good to be the dirty,
intellectual type."
'Really Revolutionary'
Miss Steno felt that the situa
tion could be reversed, or as she
stated it, "... I mean if you
were one of those guys, you
know, you could kind of stand
around the Poli Sci shelves and
pick up a real revolutionary
type, really revolutionary."
She elaborated the point con
siderably. "Or say you're just a
regular guy and you want a nice
sweet girl who's, well, pretty
modest, then you can kind of go
to the music section and act as
if you know what you're doing.
I think they're the nicest, the
music majors. Then when they
ask for advice, you can start up
a conversation about Telemann
or someone."
Miss Steno just giggled when
she was asked about the natural
sciences; physics, chemistry,
geology, biology.
Classics Majors?
"Classics majors? Oh well, I
don't know. You expect to see
them walking around with the
Aeglogues running through old
weathered heads, but it's more
like Ovid, if you know what I
mean."
Anthropology students drew a
witty attack from Miss Steno
which cannot be set down in toto
here, but which included discus
sions of their "ethnicity" and
"those wild, wild field trips."
Miss Steno said that her "boss
(was) about to fry (her) hands
in library paste" unless she got
back to work, but she did answer
one last question.
"Well, if I were a boy here, I
guess the girls from any of the
departments would be all right.
If I were a man, of course . . ."
