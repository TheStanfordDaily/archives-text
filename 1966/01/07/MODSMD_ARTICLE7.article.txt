# Kadane Claims University Is 'Toying With Disaster'
## 
### 
"I have come to the conclusion, re
luctantly and with great sorrow, that
student power within the University,
to the extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat of dis
ruption of life on the campus and its
attendant bad publicity for the Uni
versity," LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane
declared last night in a "State of the
Legislature" address.
"For reasons I cannot fathom, the
University prefers to toy with dis
aster, and forces us into this role," he
told the gathered members of LASSU.
One Up, One Down
Following the speech, the Legisla
ture defeated a bill which would have
redistricted graduate representation
in LASSU, but passed another setting
procedures for the election of under
graduate representatives.
In addition, LASSU passed a resolu
tion, similar to one passed Dec. 2, ask
ing the Committee of Fifteen to rec
ommend "an appropriate and knowl
edgeable committee ... to make a
comprehensive study of Wilbur."
The original resolution had included
a clause, "Wilbur Faculty-Master Eric
Hutchinson has named an advisory
committee of faculty and staff mem
bers to study the entire Wilbur House
system."
It was deleated in the new resolu
tion, which was passed after ASSU
President Sandy Mackenzie told the
body that Hutchinson had informed
him that no such committee existed.
"It's nothing more than a very infor
mal committee which he has chosen to
advise him," said Mackenzie.
General Studies Representation
The President also told the Legisla
ture that Robert Walker, Chairman of
the General Studies Committee, has
asked for student representation on
the committee. Mackenzie said that
he is now seeking three qualified ap
pointees.
In his speech, Kadane criticized the
Committee of Fifteen for putting "its
seal of approval" on the closing of
Union Residence, and said:
"The fact that this is the only issue
that Committee has dealt with may
raise questions as to its value. Al
though I support the continuation of
the practice of having those closest to
the political situation—and hence busi
est—in our group of five, this should
surely be reviewed if the Committee
continues to be as disappointing as it
was this fall."
On to Education
Kadane went on to say that the rea
soh behind the Legislature's present
course of action is to "clear up a back
log of problems concerning rules, so
that we may get to the more impor
tant and fundamental issues of educa
tion.
"The rules shape notions of what
students are expected to be," he de
clared. "The changes we favor require

students to be sufficiently mature to
make their own decisions about how
they are to live.
"This is necessary if students are
to be challenged to decide what they
think and believe."
Progress
The speaker cited several issues on
which he felt progress was being
made:
On liquor, Kadane said that he
thought reform of the University's
policy was "long overdue." "It should
not be a major objective for us this
year," he explained. "It is, to quote
Sandy Mackenzie, 'stepping boldly in
to the 1930'5.' "
On judicial reform, he noted that
the problem is now being discussed
by a sub committee of the Committee
of 15, and that reform would require
Constitutional amendments to become
effective.
On the question of on-campus free
dom of worship, Kadane called atten
tion to a bill, presently in committee,
which would "create a conflict in law
between the ASSU and the University
on this issue," and said, "Early Board
of Trustees action is apparently ex
pected."
Kadane also noted other issues with
which the Legislature will be con
cerned during the remainder of the

year—open house hours, social regu
lations, the Wilbur system, compensa
tion from the University for copies of
The Daily presently delivered free to
faculty and staff.
Other Business
In other business the Legislature
postponed until its next meeting a
resolution abolishing "discriminatory
rates" allegedly charged by the Stan
ford Ski Club. The postponement was
granted because Ski Club members
were at Winter Carnival and unable
to present their case.
The graduate representation bill
would have had representatives elect
ed by departments instead of by
schools as is done now. It failed to
gain the needed two-thirds majority.
Discussion of the bill focused on mak
ing the body "more representative"
while retaining a feasible system.
Several Legislature members ex
pressed concern over "apathy*' of grad
uate students toward student govern
ment. The bill's opponents said the
proposed changes would not alleviate
this problem.
Insures Representation
The other representation bill revises
the By-Laws so that newcomers to
undergraduate residences in the fall
"may vote and may run for the Legis
lature seat."
