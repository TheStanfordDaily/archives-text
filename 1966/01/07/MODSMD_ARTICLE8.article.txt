# Rights Leader Cites Bogalusa Turmoil
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
"The soldiers in Vietnam are far
safer than the Negroes in Bogalusa,"
said A. Z. Young, president of the
Bogalusa Voters League, in a speech
sponsored by Stanford Friends of
SNCC yesterday afternoon in Tresid
der.
"I want my daughter and grand
children to live a good life, in Boga
lusa if they see fit," said Young, him
self a Negro. "I have dedicated my
self to stay in Bogalusa all the time
to fight this battle. I have made up
my mind. I'm not going to let my
daughter fight my battles; I'm going
to fight it myself.
"Conditions must be changed," he
went on. In Bogalusa, Louisiana, the
scene of "more marches than any
other city," one of the major
"changes" from the non-violence of
most Southern civil rights workers
was the formation of a militant anti-
Ku Klux Klan organization, the Dea
cons of Defence and Justice.
Forced to Arm
Bogosa's Negroes were "forced to
arm an organization," said Young, for
the Bogalusa area is a Klan "strong
hold." The Deacons were organized
after a series of CORE, Klan, and
Voters League demonstrations last
January, prompted mainly by Negro
dissatisfaction with local conditions.
Only a few Negro first grades and
high school students attend the city's
white schools —"this is what they call
integration"—and there has been a
great deal of recent controversy over
Bogalusa's "segregated" Crown-Zeller
bach paper mill.
Outside of Louisana, said Young,
"the policy of Crown-Zellerbach is not
one of segregation." But at the Boga
lusa plant, ho said, "they're working
slow, and very slow."
Integrate the Unions
The Voters League, having met un
successfully with Crown-Zellerbach
officials, believes that "the only way
to solve the problem is to integrate
the labor unions first." Young thinks
that alteration in the local mill's pol
icy would improve conditions
throughout the city.
Young gave his speech in Tresid
der's small lounge to an audience of
about 40. He was introduced by Kurt
Moses, a junior economics major who
spent Christmas vacation doing civil
rights work in the South.
A question period followed the talk,
during which Young described a ma
jor demonstration which will be held

on January 28, the anniversary of last
year's unsuccessful one-day trial test
of integration.
"Wo have some plans, and tney're
out of sight," he said. "On January
28 I intend to wear a KKK hood and
walk down the main street with it.
We'll wear their uniforms to show
them it's nothing but a sheet and a
hood."
Finance the Problem
"Registration," said Young later, "is
not a major problem in Bogalusa.
Right now, finance is the main prob
lem." Donations to the Voters League
wore solicited at the meeting, and
Moses reported that donation boxes
are now available in Rinconada and
Cedro Houses in Wilbur Hall. Young
was the luncheon guest of Madera
House yesterday.
Most questioners appeared sympa
thetic to Young's cause. One girl who
spoke with a marked Southern accent
did ask if perhaps Young was trying
to do too much too fast; he replied,
"If the time is not right now, it never
will be right.
"Wo are trying to help to build a
bigger and better United States," he
said; "to give all men in this com
munity a chance to live in a free and
democratic country."
