FOR ALL APPLICANTS:
When writing an agency about
application procedures, it is
strongly recommended that you
enclose Form 57, a federal serv
ice form which can be obtained
at the Post Office or at Encina.
Often this form is the only in
formation required by the
agency. If your academic record
is good, it would not hurt to
send a transcript along with the
form and your letter.
