CHALLENGE
To Members of The Physics
or any other departments of
the University.
Who feel that by training or
talents they are qualified to
pass upon the merits or de
merits of an original scientific
paper purporting to give plans
for a proposition designed to
the insulation of mass against
the forces of gravity.
An Example:
This challenger feels that
within the bounds of reasona
ble time and tests he can build
a train that would carry 20,000
tons of freight and that that
train and its freight could be
made so light that a simple 5
horse power motor could pull
that train and its cargo from
San Francisco to New York
with ease.
The train and cargo would
be weightless.
The track would act only to
keep the train and its cargo
over the area where it would
be weightless.
Another application of the
principles of this theory Indi
cates that mass can be insu
lated from gravity while it is
being raised from one height
to a higher one.
This opens the door to —per-
petual motion — the dream of
all scientists of all ages. These
things, Sirs, I have discovered
I can do.
I talked to one man on your
Physics department about
these plans—He went to th e
blackboard and gave a recita
tion of equations not related
to the proposals at hand,
"though he believed they
were."
"Your ideas are all wrong,"
he said.
The equations and the doc
tors thinking were totally un
related to what I had been try
ing to tell him. "He was not
equal."
No disrespect or slander is
directed to you in this chal
lenge.
It is the nature of people to
be wary of strangers with
strange ideas.
If it were not so every crack
pot on earth would gather a
sect of followers and true sci
ence would be stymied. But
some of us are possessed of so
much of the stuff nature is
made of that we refuse to fol
low the crowd. We take off on
a course dictated to us by our
own conscience.
One time in the billions of
these occasions a man appears
to be truly inspired by his
creator to seek truth. He pulls
away from the crowd and like
a lost child seeking to find its
parents he seeks the truths of
nature for he knows that that
is from where he was sprung.
There is a kinship between a
child seeking his parents and
a scientist seeking knowledge
of his environment. I was an
orphan and I have spent a life
time seeking knowledge of
both. I have dared to pull away
from the crowd.
I have dared to examine
mass man and his environ
ment. I have dared to formu
late ideas and opinions not
hereto believed possible by
mankind. I challenge the mem
bers of Physics or any mem
bers of other departments to
public debate on the merits or
demerits of my ideas.
I have been more or less just
sitting on these ideas for about
20 years because I had no
money to develop them into
working facts.
A visit to California and ex
posure to its smog combined
with my knowledge of prob
lems presented by atomic
waste have convinced me that
haste is essential to the well
being of life on earth as we
know it.
