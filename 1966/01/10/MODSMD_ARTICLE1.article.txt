# The
						Death And Several Lives Of Old Union

### HENRY ALLEY 
After five years of planning, the old Union
Residence will now become Stanford's new
students' services center.
The project, under the guidance of architect
Melton Pflueger and senior planner Everett
Swagert, will include basic changes in the old
Union's interior but little alteration in the
outside architecture. After the rooms are re
decorated, the building will receive an entirely
new set of furniture.
Although the completion date is indefinite,
Dean Winbigler recently informed The Daily
of the various offices the building will in
clude. On the first floor, the Registrar, Cash
ier, and Public Exercises Committee will have
rooms; on the second, Admissions and Finan
cial Aids; on the third, the Dean and the Asso
ciate Dean of Students.
Planning Phases
Long before students became aware of the
project, it had gone through a number of
planning phases. In 1948, the Registrar and

Cashier took separate buildings hut the Ad
ministration never forgot the convenience of
having them together.
Since 1960, Dean Winbigler has been study
ing plans that would bring all of the adminis
trative offices together. Gradually, phase after
phase was approved until the most decisive
action came last July.
In place of Union Residence, the project
proposed the Hoskins apartments. If this
high-rise house were to be completed, then the
university's residence capacity would be in
creased by forty. In July, when it was con
sidering the women students, the Admissions
office accepted forty additional transfers, and
thus the Administration had no choice but to
complete the plans.
Built 1922
What is "now called old Union was built in
1922 by the same architects who had designed
the Stanford Library and the San Francisco
City Hall. They planned the building so that
it would bridge two earlier structures: the

Women's Clubhouse and the first Stanford
Union.
This newly finished complex adopted the
ideals of past student bodies, Herbert Hoover's
class among them. Adding some principles of
its own, this union came up with two central
goals:
• To provide an atmosphere in which stu
dents, faculty and all could be comfortable;
• To offer students, despite the distance be
tween their residences, the chance to see each
other frequent lv.
In a 1922 issue of the old Stanford Illustra
ted Review, a young alumnus wrote, "At last
Stanford has what might be called a com
munity center. . . ."
Space Shortage
The Union served as a congregation spot for
a decade; then, during the years of 1932 and
1933, the University became pressed for room.
Consequently, it relocated the few graduate
men who were residing upstairs and trans
formed the building into a women's dormi
tory. During the intervening period of rela

tive calm that followed, the residence had a
chance to develop some traditions of its own.
Using the Union's precedent of unpressured
conversation, the occupants gave the building
an air of informality.
'Better Friends'
Even up to last year, residents experienced
this sort of atmosphere. "There were few so
cial pressures," said Evelyn Hutterer, one of
the 1965 members, "You didn't feel you had
to meet anyone and so you made all the better
friends." Too, while the residence's smallness
encouraged more personal contacts, its large
number of single rooms enabled residents to
have a greater amount of independence.
Thus, things were rather grim around Un
ion this Tuesday afternoon. The switchboard
operator, her face flushed, kept coming to the
locked entrance and telling visitors they could
only stay a minute, because the place was
closing for good. Inside, the ground floor was
quiet "like a morgue," she said. All tables
and chairs had been taken from the dining

room, and in the central lounge, cabinets and
reading stands were bare of all papers and
magazines.
Arched Windows
Despite the gloom, however, the lounge's
emptiness drew attention to things that never
would have caught attention otherwise:
arched windows that nearly touched the floor,
a magenta rug with an Oriental pattern, a
worn leather sofa, a gold-framed mirror, even
a print of a medieval household— a household
whose entranceways, in fact, matched the Un
ion windows.
At 4:30, the elderly operator reluctantly
asked everyone to go, she, too, had to leave.
In the anteroom to the lounge, the slim-legged
coffee table and chairs served as signs, as did
all the other articles. They are reminants of a
life which worked for a tension between two
poles, privacy and group liveliness. Even
though the symbols will not remain, the
achievement of their tension will be remem
bered.
