# Card Swimmers Capture Two In Rare Early Season Form
## 
### Wells Shoemaker 
Stanford's Indians made swim
ming a successful hunting foray
into the waterways of the Great
Northwest last weekend. The
tribe shot down the Oregon
Ducks, last year's AAWU run
ners-up, 65-30. Ditching the fowl
play, the Indians traveled to Cor
vallis where they speared the
OSU Beavers, 67-28.
Stanford opened the meet
with a win in 1 he medley
relay, as Bill Schubach, Bob
Momsen, Bill Manoogian, and
Mike Greene took the 400 yard
course in 3:49.6. The Ducks never
came close to the tribe after that
race.
Mike Wall and Gary Sheerer
plucked the first two places in
Cards a 15-1 lead. Oregon's
Greening won the 50 freestyle in
22.5 for the Duck's first individ
ual victory.
Parmely, Burbach Sweep
Mark Parmely and Charlie
Burbach led a 1-2 sweep of the
200 individual medley. Parmely
finished the mixed course in
2:05.6, an auspicious early-season
performance.
Bill Freeman surprised Eu
gene audience in the diving
event. Freeman accumulated
240.65 points to ace out Rick
Folensby, last year's AAWU 3
meter diving champion from
Oregon. Folensby had a 170.3
total.
Freeman's "big" dives were
his smoothly executed forward
3% somersault and his reverse
IV-2 somersault with 1 twists.
Oregon's Holding chugged to
a 2:04.8 timing for 200 butterfly
to tag down the Duck's second
event win. Close behind Holding
was Doug Miller, Stanford soph
omore. Miller finished in 2:06.1,
nearly his best time. Miller has
had a scant two weeks of work
after a six month rest in Ger
many.
Oregon swept the top two
places in the 100 freestyle. Bill
Schubach, Stanford varsity cap
tain, took the 200 backstroke in
2:13.0. Schubach, perennially a
late-season comer, has started
the year faster than ever before.
Wall Takes 500
Mike Wall and Mark Parmely
paced each other to an easy 1-2
score in the 500 freestyle. Wall's
winning time in the event was
5:13.3.
Oregon ran into a Stanford
wheelhouse in the 200 breast
stroke. Bob Momsen, who last
year tore up every Stanford
breaststroke record as a fresh
man, posted a meet record time
of 2:18.6. Charlie Burbach was
not far behind at 2:23.2.
Craig Brown, Bill Derrig, Mike
Greene, and Bill Meyer teamed
up to give the tribe a 3:24.0 time
and a win in the -100 freestyle
tandem. Meyer turned in a 49.7
split on the end of the relay to
hold a slight Stanford edge over
Oregon's Hess, the 100 freestyle
victor.
"Shape" Important Now
Since at this stage of the
swimming season, conditioning
is more important than a single
dual meet, the Indians did not
sprint down--slack off before
the meets in Oregon. Conse
quently times in the shorter

events may have suffered some
what.
Nevertheless, a number of per
formances over the weekend
bode well for the 1966 season.
Parmely, Schubach, Miller,
Momsen, Freeman, and Meyer
all did surprisingly well for the
first time out.
Oregon State's pool is 33%
yards long as opposed to the
standard length of 25 yards. In
a 200 yard race, a swimmer loses
two turns from his normal
amount. In certain events, like
the breaststroke, the reduced
number of turns can hurt a com
petitor's time a measureahle
amount.
Miller Flies
Doug Miller led the medley
relay to a win with a sparkling
54.6 butterfly leg. It was Miller's
best-ever 100 fly time.
Bob Momsen won the 200 free
style, with Mike Green close at
his heels. Bill Derrig took sec
ond in the odd-distance 66 yard
free behind OSU's Hucy.
The 266- 'i yard individual med
ley proved the most interesting
race of the day, as Gary Sheerer
touched out Mike Wall by .3 sec
ond in the unlikely event.
Bill Freeman once again won
the diving for the Cards.
Pramely, Again
Mark Parmely! who swam In
four different events over the
weekend, posted an OSU pool

reeord with a 2:06.fi effort for
200 yards butterfuly.
Bill Schubach took the back
stroke, and Charlie Burbach han
dled the 500 freestyle. Bob Mom
sen pulled out the breaststroke,
and the tribe easily won the free
style relay.
Stanford meets Washington
next Friday afternoon. Satur
day, the Indians meet Washing
ton State and San Jose in a dou
ble dual affair.
Also next Saturday, the Stan
ford frosh open their season
against San Jose.
The Papooses, with two World
record holders Dick Roth and
Luis Nicolao and High School
AU-Amerieans in more events
than you can count on all your
toes and your fingers should put
ori quite an exhibition.

54.6 butterfly leg. It was Miller's
best-ever 100 fly time.

style, with Mike Green close at
his heels. Bill Derrig took sec
ond in the odd-distance 66 yard

AU-Amerieans in more events
than you can count on all your

Stanford's Indians made swim
ming a successful hunting foray
into the waterways of the Great
Northwest last weekend. The
tribe shot down the Oregon
Ducks, last year's AAWU run
ners-up, 65-30. Ditching the fowl
play, the Indians traveled to Cor
vallis where they speared the
OSU Beavers, 67-28.
Stanford opened the meet
with a win in 1 he medley
relay, as Bill Schubach, Bob
Momsen, Bill Manoogian, and
Mike Greene took the 400 yard
course in 3:49.6. The Ducks never
came close to the tribe after that
race.
Mike Wall and Gary Sheerer
plucked the first two places in
Cards a 15-1 lead. Oregon's
Greening won the 50 freestyle in
22.5 for the Duck's first individ
ual victory.
Parmely, Burbach Sweep
Mark Parmely and Charlie
Burbach led a 1-2 sweep of the
200 individual medley. Parmely
finished the mixed course in
2:05.6, an auspicious early-season
performance.
Bill Freeman surprised Eu
gene audience in the diving
event. Freeman accumulated
240.65 points to ace out Rick
Folensby, last year's AAWU 3
meter diving champion from
Oregon. Folensby had a 170.3
total.
Freeman's "big" dives were
his smoothly executed forward
3% somersault and his reverse
IV-2 somersault with 1 twists.
Oregon's Holding chugged to
a 2:04.8 timing for 200 butterfly
to tag down the Duck's second
event win. Close behind Holding
was Doug Miller, Stanford soph
omore. Miller finished in 2:06.1,
nearly his best time. Miller has
had a scant two weeks of work
after a six month rest in Ger
many.
Oregon swept the top two
places in the 100 freestyle. Bill
Schubach, Stanford varsity cap

late-season comer, has started
the year faster than ever before.
Wall Takes 500
Mike Wall and Mark Parmely
paced each other to an easy 1-2
score in the 500 freestyle. Wall's
winning time in the event was
5:13.3.

breaststroke record as a fresh
man, posted a meet record time
of 2:18.6. Charlie Burbach was
not far behind at 2:23.2.
Craig Brown, Bill Derrig, Mike
Greene, and Bill Meyer teamed

and a win in the -100 freestyle
tandem. Meyer turned in a 49.7
split on the end of the relay to
hold a slight Stanford edge over
Oregon's Hess, the 100 freestyle
victor.
"Shape" Important Now
Since at this stage of the
swimming season, conditioning
is more important than a single
dual meet, the Indians did not
sprint down--slack off before
the meets in Oregon. Conse
quently times in the shorter

events may have suffered some
what.
Nevertheless, a number of per

bode well for the 1966 season.

after a six month rest in Ger
many.
Oregon swept the top two
places in the 100 freestyle. Bill
Schubach, Stanford varsity cap
tain, took the 200 backstroke in
2:13.0. Schubach, perennially a
late-season comer, has started
the year faster than ever before.
Wall Takes 500
Mike Wall and Mark Parmely
paced each other to an easy 1-2
score in the 500 freestyle. Wall's
winning time in the event was
5:13.3.
Oregon ran into a Stanford
wheelhouse in the 200 breast
stroke. Bob Momsen, who last
year tore up every Stanford
breaststroke record as a fresh
man, posted a meet record time
of 2:18.6. Charlie Burbach was
not far behind at 2:23.2.
Craig Brown, Bill Derrig, Mike
Greene, and Bill Meyer teamed
up to give the tribe a 3:24.0 time
and a win in the -100 freestyle
tandem. Meyer turned in a 49.7
split on the end of the relay to
hold a slight Stanford edge over
Oregon's Hess, the 100 freestyle
victor.
"Shape" Important Now
Since at this stage of the
swimming season, conditioning
is more important than a single
dual meet, the Indians did not
sprint down--slack off before
the meets in Oregon. Conse
quently times in the shorter

events may have suffered some
what.
Nevertheless, a number of per
formances over the weekend
bode well for the 1966 season.
Parmely, Schubach, Miller,
Momsen, Freeman, and Meyer
all did surprisingly well for the
first time out.
Oregon State's pool is 33%
yards long as opposed to the
standard length of 25 yards. In
a 200 yard race, a swimmer loses
two turns from his normal
amount. In certain events, like
the breaststroke, the reduced
number of turns can hurt a com
petitor's time a measureahle
amount.
Miller Flies
Doug Miller led the medley
relay to a win with a sparkling
54.6 butterfly leg. It was Miller's
best-ever 100 fly time.
Bob Momsen won the 200 free
style, with Mike Green close at
his heels. Bill Derrig took sec
ond in the odd-distance 66 yard
free behind OSU's Hucy.
The 266- 'i yard individual med
ley proved the most interesting
race of the day, as Gary Sheerer
touched out Mike Wall by .3 sec
ond in the unlikely event.
Bill Freeman once again won
the diving for the Cards.
Pramely, Again
Mark Parmely! who swam In
four different events over the
weekend, posted an OSU pool

reeord with a 2:06.fi effort for
200 yards butterfuly.
Bill Schubach took the back
stroke, and Charlie Burbach han
dled the 500 freestyle. Bob Mom
sen pulled out the breaststroke,
and the tribe easily won the free
style relay.
Stanford meets Washington
next Friday afternoon. Satur
day, the Indians meet Washing
ton State and San Jose in a dou
ble dual affair.
Also next Saturday, the Stan
ford frosh open their season
against San Jose.
The Papooses, with two World
record holders Dick Roth and
Luis Nicolao and High School
AU-Amerieans in more events
than you can count on all your
toes and your fingers should put
ori quite an exhibition.
Stanford's Indians made swim
ming a successful hunting foray
into the waterways of the Great
Northwest last weekend. The
tribe shot down the Oregon
Ducks, last year's AAWU run
ners-up, 65-30. Ditching the fowl
play, the Indians traveled to Cor
vallis where they speared the
OSU Beavers, 67-28.
Stanford opened the meet
with a win in 1 he medley
relay, as Bill Schubach, Bob
Momsen, Bill Manoogian, and
Mike Greene took the 400 yard
course in 3:49.6. The Ducks never
came close to the tribe after that
race.
Mike Wall and Gary Sheerer
plucked the first two places in
Cards a 15-1 lead. Oregon's
Greening won the 50 freestyle in
22.5 for the Duck's first individ
ual victory.
Parmely, Burbach Sweep
Mark Parmely and Charlie
Burbach led a 1-2 sweep of the
200 individual medley. Parmely
finished the mixed course in
2:05.6, an auspicious early-season
performance.
Bill Freeman surprised Eu
gene audience in the diving
event. Freeman accumulated
240.65 points to ace out Rick
Folensby, last year's AAWU 3
meter diving champion from
Oregon. Folensby had a 170.3
total.
Freeman's "big" dives were
his smoothly executed forward
3% somersault and his reverse
IV-2 somersault with 1 twists.
Oregon's Holding chugged to
a 2:04.8 timing for 200 butterfly
to tag down the Duck's second
event win. Close behind Holding
was Doug Miller, Stanford soph
omore. Miller finished in 2:06.1,
nearly his best time. Miller has
had a scant two weeks of work
after a six month rest in Ger
many.
