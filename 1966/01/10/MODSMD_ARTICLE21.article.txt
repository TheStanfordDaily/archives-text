# Card Ruggers Trounce Santa Clara Club, 41-0
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford Rugby team, lead
by the 26 point individual attack
of Mike Grace, easily handled the
Santa Clara Rugby Club, 41-0,
lor their opening win of the
year last Saturday.
The Indian ruggers were
never seriously threatened and
dominated the scrum and back
field play over the largely inex
perienced Santa Clara team.
Grace, a graduate student
from Australia, collected his 26
points on 2 tries, 4 conversions,
and 4 penalty kicks. All but one
of the penalty kicks were from
difficult angles.
Grace Opens Scoring -
Grace opened the scoring with
a short run, though the first
conversion attempt was wide. A
short time later he booted two
penalty kicks and Stanford had
an early 9-0 lead.
After the Stanford defense
had held one of the few Santa
Clara offensive attacks, the In
dians started on the move again
with David Mac Queen fielding
a fumbled pass to the Bronco
fullback. Mac Queen ran 20
yards before passing off to Bob
Newberry for the score.
HaJfttme—22-0
Grace made the conversion
and added a penalty kick to
make the halftime score 22-0.
The second half was much the
same story, but different Stan
ford players got into the scoring
act.
Chip Greening and Dave Mac
Queen scored a try apiece and
Bob Newberry collected two
more for a day's total of three
tries for nine points.

One of Newberry's tries pro
vided perhaps the best play of
the day when Newberry, after
taking a pass from Dave Evans,
chased two of his own kicks and
then fell on the ball in the end
zone for the score.
Game Ends on High Note
The game ended, almost on a
spectacular note for Stanford,
as Dave Mac Queen broke loose
for 50 yards before being
brought down by the Santa
Clara fullback. Mac Queen was
called for a "knock on" and the
game ended 41-0.
Coach Pete Kmetovic, though
happy with the game's outcome,
stated that, "It's hard to tell
much off a game like that. I was
real pleased with the perform
ance of the scrum, though we
are still experimenting in the
backfield.
"Mike Grace played a fine
game as did Andy Ovenstone, a

South African graduate student.
We will find out more next
week."
Peacock Gap Next Week
Next week the Indians will
battle against the Peacocke Gap
Rugby Club. Peacocke Gap,
judging by their excellent per
formance in the recent seven-a
side rugby tourney, should pre
sent the Indians with an experi
enced lineup.
The two JV games were also
decided early in the game. The
Stanford No. 1 JV defeated the
Santa Clara JV team handily
35-0.
However the Stanford No. 2
JV's ran into an experienced
team from the Berkeley Rugby
Club and dropped a 22-3 deci
sion.
Again next week, there will
be three rugby matches at Stan
ford with the varsity team
playing Peacocke Gap at 1:30
and the JV games following.

JV's ran into an experienced
team from the Berkeley Rugby
Club and dropped a 22-3 deci
sion.
Again next week, there will
be three rugby matches at Stan
ford with the varsity team
playing Peacocke Gap at 1:30
and the JV games following.
The Stanford Rugby team, lead
by the 26 point individual attack
of Mike Grace, easily handled the
Santa Clara Rugby Club, 41-0,
lor their opening win of the
year last Saturday.
The Indian ruggers were
never seriously threatened and
dominated the scrum and back
field play over the largely inex
perienced Santa Clara team.
Grace, a graduate student
from Australia, collected his 26
points on 2 tries, 4 conversions,
and 4 penalty kicks. All but one
of the penalty kicks were from
difficult angles.
Grace Opens Scoring -
Grace opened the scoring with
a short run, though the first
conversion attempt was wide. A
short time later he booted two
penalty kicks and Stanford had
an early 9-0 lead.
After the Stanford defense
had held one of the few Santa
Clara offensive attacks, the In
dians started on the move again
with David Mac Queen fielding
a fumbled pass to the Bronco
fullback. Mac Queen ran 20
yards before passing off to Bob
Newberry for the score.
HaJfttme—22-0
Grace made the conversion
and added a penalty kick to
make the halftime score 22-0.
The second half was much the
same story, but different Stan
ford players got into the scoring
act.
Chip Greening and Dave Mac
Queen scored a try apiece and
Bob Newberry collected two
more for a day's total of three
tries for nine points.

One of Newberry's tries pro
vided perhaps the best play of
the day when Newberry, after
taking a pass from Dave Evans,
chased two of his own kicks and
then fell on the ball in the end
zone for the score.
Game Ends on High Note
The game ended, almost on a
spectacular note for Stanford,
as Dave Mac Queen broke loose
for 50 yards before being
brought down by the Santa
Clara fullback. Mac Queen was
called for a "knock on" and the
game ended 41-0.
Coach Pete Kmetovic, though
happy with the game's outcome,
stated that, "It's hard to tell
much off a game like that. I was
real pleased with the perform
ance of the scrum, though we
are still experimenting in the
backfield.
"Mike Grace played a fine
game as did Andy Ovenstone, a

South African graduate student.
We will find out more next
week."
Peacock Gap Next Week
Next week the Indians will
battle against the Peacocke Gap
Rugby Club. Peacocke Gap,
judging by their excellent per
formance in the recent seven-a
side rugby tourney, should pre
sent the Indians with an experi
enced lineup.
The two JV games were also
decided early in the game. The
Stanford No. 1 JV defeated the
Santa Clara JV team handily
35-0.
However the Stanford No. 2
JV's ran into an experienced
team from the Berkeley Rugby
Club and dropped a 22-3 deci
sion.
