# Boxers Impressive In Opening Tourney
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Losing only one of nine fights,
Stanford's novice boxers showed
exceptional poise and excellent
potential in last Saturday's Cali
fornia Collegiate novice boxing
meet here at Stanford.
Before a near capacity crowd,
showing that interest Is still
alive in collegiate boxing, Stan
ford's boxers knocked out five
victories while fighting to a
draw in three bouts.
Especially potent for Stanford
were Jim Marlar, Tom Jenks,
and Dave Oswald.
Only One Card Loss
Stanford's only defeat was in
the 147-pound class which is the
lightest weight division that the
Indian's have a participant.
Stanford is void in the first
three weight divisions.
The Indian's had three entries
in the 156 class. All ended in a
draw. Jim Marlar's bout was a
highlight of the evening with
Marlar using his speed and size
very effectively. Not only did he
show fine offensive force with a
variety of punches, but his de
fensive moves were effective.
The decision in the bout did not
feflect the quality of Marlar's
boxing.
In the other two 156 bouts,
neither fighter did much to re
flect his abilities. Dan Cabrera's
bout was a free-swinger that
ended with both boxers too tired
to carry on any effective ma
neuvers.
The final 156 bout between
Bill Thomas from Stanford and
John Deacon from Nevada re
vealed two finely conditioned
boxers which if left to continue
would probably have shaped in
to a excellent boxer match. All
bouts lasted three rounds.
Price Comes Back
Although knocked down in the
second round, John Price carae
back in the 165-pound match to
win. Price's speed was too much
for his Chico State opponent as
he was able to move his foe at
will although his opponent was
stronger. TTie decision was close
but the final round won it for
Price.
John Merrill, also fighting in
the 165-pound division, garnered
Stanford's first unanimous de
cision. Although lacking any ac
countable boxing experience
Merrill showed lots of strength
and was able to overpower his
opponent though showing er
ratic boxing style at times.
Jenks Looked Good
With a previous knowledge of
boxing, Tom Jenks showed what
a little experience can do for a
boxer. Jenks' moves were pol
ished while revealing an aggres
sive style; he bobbed on defense
looking for an opening and then
c«me charging with a barrage
of well-aimed shots. Jenks, along
with Cal's Dave Archibald who
fought in the 165-pound class,
showed the most consistent box
ing during the entire three

hours of novice boxing. Jenks
won on an unanimous decision.
Dennis Hanson, although out
sized by his opponent, was defi
nitely quicker and stronger
then his Nevada foe and also
won an unanimous decision.
Hanson's first round was even
but he completely controlled the
second, knocking his opponent
down with a volley of blows to
the head.
The final bout of the evening
turned out to be the most color
ful with both boxers drawing
blood and a standing ovation
from the audience. Dave Os
wald, weighing 235, was hardly
hit in the first round revealing
a back-up style characteristic of
Muhammed Ali. The second
round was awarded to Oswald
who showed an aggressive style
that drew smiles from his 241-
pound opponent and also blood
from the Chico State boxer's
nose.
In the final round both con
testants opened up their styles
resulting in free swinging by
both. Although most of the
blows were only glancing, sev
eral shots were solid — sending
remnants of the bloody battle
over both boxers and the ring.
