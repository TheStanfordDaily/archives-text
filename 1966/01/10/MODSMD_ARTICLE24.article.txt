## Keep Jim Out Of Vietnam 
### 
Editor, Thei Daily:
I have been somewhat con
fused about our Vietnam policy.
I mean, one group says we are
defending the weak and stop
ping the spread of communism,
and another claims we are en
gaged in a policy of genocide
and are furthering communist
influence. Some say we are pro
tecting the "American way of
life" and others protest that we
are defacing it in support of the
war. Both sources seem equally
credible: "inhuman butchers and
killers of innocent women and
children" on the one hand, and
"unwashed, ungroomed, shells of
men on the verge of treason,"
on the other.
Well, this summer I asked my
friend Jim Trowbridge about
the whole mess, because he is a
storehouse of unintellectualized
intelligence, nonconformist no
bility, and easy going inno
cence; and is, in short, the only
person in the world that I would
rather be than myself. With a
characteristic shrug of his
sturdy shoulders, Jim quoted his
life motto: "You leave me alone,
and I'll leave you alone," and
then proceeded with his life pro
gram called The Great Sleep
(7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m.).
Anyhow, the other day I got

this card with Jim's handwriting
but signed, U5ri5814719 (roster
2-45-32), and so, at last I've
found an issue. T am an export
on the facts and values involved
in this situation, and I am sure
that "if you had access to the
information which I possess,"
you would join in the effort to
Keep Jim Out Of Vietnam.

• Stanford Women
Editor, The Daily
I would like to comment on
the continuing dialogue of re
crimination between S t a n 112 ord
men and women that appears
in your letter column. Reading
the same charges for the last
four years becomes tiring and I
have a few suggestions to offer
the participants before the next
volleys are exchanged.
• The boy-girl problems of
Stanford students are probably
caused as much by individual
personality difficulties as by
general personality traits or the
institutional arrangements. The
dialogue is carried on mainly in
terms of these latter two prob
lems and this serves to disguise
the first.
• The Myth of the Stanford
Woman is a very real thing, its

source lost in time and memory.
It arises, I think, more out of
male frustration and resentment
than female inadequacies. In
any event, it is irrelevant to the
debate, firstly because it offers
no solution to individual diffi
culties, and secondly because it
offers no basis for reform, since
present Stanford women are
chosen by some "reasonable"
criteria of the Admissions Of
fice, and not the Stanford men.
• Finally, in view of all this,
if the participants are compelled
to continue to engage in such
debates, I ask them to make
their contributions as interesting
(passionate) as possible. The
Daily has enough problems as it
is.

and another claims we are en
gaged in a policy of genocide
and are furthering communist
influence. Some say we are pro
tecting the "American way of
life" and others protest that we
are defacing it in support of the
war. Both sources seem equally
credible: "inhuman butchers and
killers of innocent women and
children" on the one hand, and
"unwashed, ungroomed, shells of
men on the verge of treason,"
on the other.
Well, this summer I asked my
friend Jim Trowbridge about
the whole mess, because he is a
storehouse of unintellectualized
intelligence, nonconformist no
bility, and easy going inno
cence; and is, in short, the only
person in the world that I would
rather be than myself. With a
characteristic shrug of his
sturdy shoulders, Jim quoted his
life motto: "You leave me alone,
and I'll leave you alone," and
then proceeded with his life pro
gram called The Great Sleep
(7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m.).
Anyhow, the other day I got

this card with Jim's handwriting
but signed, U5ri5814719 (roster
2-45-32), and so, at last I've
found an issue. T am an export
on the facts and values involved
in this situation, and I am sure
that "if you had access to the
information which I possess,"
you would join in the effort to
Keep Jim Out Of Vietnam.

• Stanford Women
Editor, The Daily
I would like to comment on
the continuing dialogue of re
crimination between S t a n 112 ord
men and women that appears
in your letter column. Reading
the same charges for the last
four years becomes tiring and I
have a few suggestions to offer
the participants before the next
volleys are exchanged.
• The boy-girl problems of
Stanford students are probably
caused as much by individual
personality difficulties as by
general personality traits or the
institutional arrangements. The
dialogue is carried on mainly in
terms of these latter two prob
lems and this serves to disguise
the first.
• The Myth of the Stanford
Woman is a very real thing, its

source lost in time and memory.
It arises, I think, more out of
male frustration and resentment
than female inadequacies. In
any event, it is irrelevant to the
debate, firstly because it offers
no solution to individual diffi
culties, and secondly because it
offers no basis for reform, since
present Stanford women are
chosen by some "reasonable"
criteria of the Admissions Of
fice, and not the Stanford men.
• Finally, in view of all this,
if the participants are compelled
to continue to engage in such
debates, I ask them to make
their contributions as interesting
(passionate) as possible. The
Daily has enough problems as it
is.
