## Protesting Profs In Two Wars 
### BY JIM SELNA 
One eminent Stanford professor summed
up American foreign policy this way: "The
best thing for the United States to do is to
put its feet in hot water and its head in
cold water."
That somewhat pungent analysis of the
United States' role in foreign affairs did
not come from any member of the current
crop of activist professors. Strangely
enough the speaker was not even thinking
about the Vietnam situation when he ad
dressed the student body.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first presi
dent, was "stumping the country for peace"
in the spring of 1917, and did not mince his
words when it came to saying what he
thought. However, Jordan was not the only
member of the faculty actively disputing
U. S. policy though campus reaction favored
meeting German aggression with force.
Dangerous To Tackle
Historical parallels are always dangerous
things to tackle. Generally their value falls
somewhere between two cliches: "History
repeats itself," and "Those who fail to learn
from the past are doomed to repeat Its er
rors." Despite these words of warning,
there are some startling parallels and con
trasts between campus reaction to the
Great War in Europe and reaction to the
present Vietnam conflict.
As students returned for the second se
mester in the winter of 1917. the United
States was still pursuing a policy of neu
trality, yet the war was beginning to in
vade the thinking of the student body. Per
haps it was not coincidence that the de
bating squad was making the front page of
The Daily Palo Alto (which became The
Stanford Daily in the 1930'5) with the
year's topic, "Resolved that the United
States should establish a system of compul
sory military service. . .
A Steady Stream
Stanford's participation in the Belgian
relief program brought a steady stream of
speakers to the campus who made the
world situation a major topic of discussion.

Though public opinion had outwardly
swung behind President Wilson after the
sinking of the Lusitania and the Laconia,
there were still some doubts in the academ
ic community. Jordan, Chancellor Emeri
tus, found himself clinging to the hope lor
peace and waging a verbal battle with
President Ray Lyman Wilbur in the head
lines of The Daily.
While Wilbur was telling the campus that
"if you want justice, you must enforce it,"
Jordan was trying to convince the student
body and the nation in his role as United
States' delegate to the Central Organization
for a Durable Peace that the severing of
diplomatic relations did not mean that hos
tilities must commence.
Strong- Reasons
With the change of a few names and
places Jordan's words might pass for those
of an SCVP speaker:
"There are strong reasons for not send
ing armed forces to another continent. The
confusion at home which war might, pro
duce is more to be dreaded than adventure
likely to overtake us on the outside. The
business of a republic is to see justice
among its own citizens, and war and social
progress do not go together."
Despite the similarity in sentiment to
both wars, the surprising fact is that the
most vocal demonstrators- both in the fac
ulty and in the student body were decidedly
for the war in 1917. Some spot comparisons
prove to be interesting:
• ROTC. The military training program
was started in the fall of the academic year
1916-17 and drew over two hundred. The
student body was actually quite pleased
and had been campaigning for military
training for several years.
Both the campus attitude and the enroll
ment in ROTC seem to have changed in the
past 50 years. What President Wilbur
termed "a chance to develop citizenship and
responsibilities necesary under a democrat-

ic government" excites a much smaller per
centage of the student body.
• Marches. One thousand students, half
the student body, marched down Market
street in San Francisco to send off members
of the Stanford Ambulance Corps on its
way to Europe. Not even today's protesters
can muster that much support.
• Administration policy. The Board of
Trustees as well as President Wilbur made
their support of US policy strong and vocal.
The Board of Trustees actually was afraid
of David Starr Jordan's effect upon the
University's image. In April 1917 they
made it clear that anti-war proponents
were speaking for themselves and not the
University. While allowing students and
faculty members to exercise their political
rights on campus without restriction, the
present Board of Trustees and University
Administration are keeping their opinions
about the war to themselves.
• Outlook. Though the activists of each
generation were on different, sides in the
present discussion, the student and faculty
members of both periods share a certain
malaise about the prospects of war. As
a recent grad who had been fighting in
France wrote the editor of The Daily, "I
wish this beastly war would soon be fin
ished." Though the results of a recent cam
pus survey show the majority of students
are in favor of the government's policy in
Vietnam, no quarter is advocating war for
its own, once thought glorious, sake. The
uneasiness is certainly much easier to see
among "the morally outraged," but it
seems to be shared by all.
War inevitably makes its mark on the
face of a college campus. The Great War
saw a change to the trimester system, a
patriotic upheaval, and the loss of Stanford
men in France. What the long run effects
of Vietnam will be, only time can tell. In
any event, the war has forced the aca
demic community — both students and
teachers —to analyze the values of the day
and the hopes of the future.
