# THE 						CAPITAL SCENE
## Kiss Me, Stupid-Or How To Fight 'Smooch Decay' 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
A Florida dentist "named Dr.
Doran D. Zimmer has dis
covered after a five - year re
search program that cavities
can be caused by kissing. The
results of his studies, which
were financed by a grant from
the United States Public Health
Service, has thrown the dental
profession into a tizzy and
could change the kissing habits
of the country.
It is too early to know what
effect the results will have on
kissing in the United States, but
a spot survey I made over the
week-end shows that people are
really worried about it.
Continue Kissing
I called my own dentist and
asked him if it was okay to con
tinue kissing now that the sci
entific facts had been estab
lished.

He replied, "It's all right to
go ahead providing you brush
your teeth before and after each
kiss."
I pointed out that 1 his might
cause some consternation in the
circles I travel in.
"It's your teeth," he said,
"and all I can do is warn you
of the consequences."
"Is there anything else I can
do?"
"The Eskimos rub no.ses and
their teeth are excellent. Have
you ever thought of that?"
"I did once, but I caught a
cold," I said,
After T hung up, I called a
teenage daughter of a friend of
mine and asked if the kids had
been affected by the news.
25% Fewer Cavities
"We had an experiment in our
class," she said. "Half the kids
necked and the other half
didn't, and the half that didn't
had 25 per cent fewer cavities
than the kids that did."
"Well, there's a lot to be said,
then, for not kissing," I told her.
"The kids that didn't neck
didn't have to go to the dentist
and that must have saved their
parents a lot of money."
"Not really. Because the kids
that didn't neck had to go to
psychiatrists instead."
I made another call to a tooth
paste manufacturer who said
that as soon as the news broke
his research people got on it
right away.
"We're working on a new
toothpaste for people who kiss a
lot but can only brush once a
day. It's called 'Lust' and the
minute your teeth come in con
tact with another person's teeth
it kills all the germs in both
your mouths."
Fight 'Smooch Decay'
"We're very high on it. Our
entire advertising campaign
next year is going to be to fight
'smooch decay.' "
I finally called someone con
nected with the government and
asked if they were going to pro
pose any legislation to prohibit
kissing in the United States.
"We can't stop Americans
from kissing," he said, "but we
think the government should at
least warn people what they're
getting into."
"Is there any truth to the ru
mor that the government will
demand warning labels on per
fumes that induce kissing?" I
asked him.
"It's being considered. We
would prefer to find something
to add to the drinking water
which could protect everybody.
But so far we haven't come up
with anything, so we'll have to
stick with an educational cam
paign. We believe that people
who have been kissing for
years won't be able to stop. But
perhaps those who are just
starting out will realize the
damage it can do to their teeth
and will take up cigarette smok
ing instead."

"It's being considered. We
would prefer to find something
to add to the drinking water
which could protect everybody.
But so far we haven't come up
with anything, so we'll have to
stick with an educational cam
paign. We believe that people
who have been kissing for
years won't be able to stop. But
perhaps those who are just
starting out will realize the
damage it can do to their teeth
and will take up cigarette smok
ing instead."
A Florida dentist "named Dr.
Doran D. Zimmer has dis
covered after a five - year re
search program that cavities
can be caused by kissing. The
results of his studies, which
were financed by a grant from
the United States Public Health
Service, has thrown the dental
profession into a tizzy and
could change the kissing habits
of the country.
It is too early to know what
effect the results will have on
kissing in the United States, but
a spot survey I made over the
week-end shows that people are
really worried about it.
Continue Kissing
I called my own dentist and
asked him if it was okay to con
tinue kissing now that the sci
entific facts had been estab
lished.

He replied, "It's all right to
go ahead providing you brush
your teeth before and after each
kiss."
I pointed out that 1 his might
cause some consternation in the
circles I travel in.
"It's your teeth," he said,
"and all I can do is warn you
of the consequences."
"Is there anything else I can
do?"
"The Eskimos rub no.ses and
their teeth are excellent. Have
you ever thought of that?"
"I did once, but I caught a
cold," I said,
After T hung up, I called a
teenage daughter of a friend of
mine and asked if the kids had
been affected by the news.
25% Fewer Cavities
"We had an experiment in our
class," she said. "Half the kids
necked and the other half
didn't, and the half that didn't
had 25 per cent fewer cavities
than the kids that did."
"Well, there's a lot to be said,
then, for not kissing," I told her.
"The kids that didn't neck
didn't have to go to the dentist
and that must have saved their
parents a lot of money."
"Not really. Because the kids
that didn't neck had to go to
psychiatrists instead."
I made another call to a tooth
paste manufacturer who said
that as soon as the news broke
his research people got on it
right away.
"We're working on a new
toothpaste for people who kiss a
lot but can only brush once a
day. It's called 'Lust' and the
minute your teeth come in con
tact with another person's teeth
it kills all the germs in both
your mouths."
Fight 'Smooch Decay'
"We're very high on it. Our
entire advertising campaign
next year is going to be to fight
'smooch decay.' "
I finally called someone con
nected with the government and
asked if they were going to pro
pose any legislation to prohibit
kissing in the United States.
"We can't stop Americans
from kissing," he said, "but we
think the government should at
least warn people what they're
getting into."
"Is there any truth to the ru
mor that the government will
demand warning labels on per
fumes that induce kissing?" I
asked him.
