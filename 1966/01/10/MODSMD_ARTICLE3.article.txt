polis, Minn., has sent Stanford a
check for $100,000 and the Continental
Grain Company of New York has
paid $20,000 with a pledge of $40,000
more toward the cost of renovating
the West Wing of Encina Hall for this

$800,000.
In a letter to other grain company
executives explaining the Cargill
Foundation's action, Vice-President
William R. Pearce of Cargill, Inc.,
said:
"The general assignment of the
Food Research Institute has been to
carry on fundamental research on eco
nomic questions concerning food in
this country and throughout the
world."
The aim of this research is not im
mediately and primarily the solving
of specific 'practical' problems, but

providing basic knowledge and under
standing that can point the way to
broad solutions to these problems. In
this effort the Institute has made a
truly remarkable contribution to the
understanding of the whole field of
commodity marketing.
"The practical appeal of the Insti
tute lies ill its complete independence
from government and farm organiza
tion influence and the high degree of
scholarship evidenced in its work. In
this respect (it is) almost unique."
