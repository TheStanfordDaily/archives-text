# Group Offers Self-Identity Symposium
## 
### 
A university-wide coed student
symposium, "A Deeper Look at Our
selves," will be held Sunday, January
23 at 5 p.m. in Dinkelspied Auditori
um. Sponsored by an ad hoc student
committee, the symposium will be
patterned after the AWS women's
symposium held last fall.
The basic idea behind the student
symposium is that most problems
facing each of us are not unique. In
dividual problems are variations of
the universal problems and questions
that everyone encounters.
Through self-questioning and group
dynamics, the symposium hopes to
bring each participant closer to the
goal of self-actualization. Self-aware
ness will bring clearer self-identity
and stronger interpersonal relation
ships.
Approximately 500 men and women
students, and 50 faculty couples will
attend an introductory program and
then go to faculty homes for smaller
dinner-discussion sessions.
In each group of 10 students, a man
and a woman will serve as Initiators
for discussion and guides to keep the
discussion within meaningful bounds.
Later in the quarter, the groups will
plan additional meetings at their own
convenience.
Sign-ups for students who wish to
participate in the symposium will be
held this week. The presidents of liv
ing groups, houses, and corridors
have been given sign-up sheets which
will be available through January 14.
Off-campus students may sign-up on
a list in the student activities office.

House or Steve West, Phi Delta Theta
