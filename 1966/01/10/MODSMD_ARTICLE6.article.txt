A nation-wide movement is being
aided by forces on the Stanford cam
pus, yet relatively few members of
the community are aware of the revo
lutionary headquarters. Polya, Spruce,
Redwood, Pine, and Cedar halls are
names indicate, comprise the refresh
ing and beautifully landscaped facili
ties of the Computation Center.
Established in March, 1953, as a
service organization which accommo
dated the entire Stanford Community,
the Center's present facilities, located
at the end of the Via Pueblo between
the Leland Stanford Museum and the
woman's gymnasium, were dedicated
in August, 1963.
These buildings house an IBM 7090
data processing system, a Burroughs
85000 computer, an extensive PDP-1
computing system connected to the
IBM 7090, six computer-controlled
teaching consoles, the offices for a
staff of fifty computer operators and
technical program advisors, and class
room space for Computer Science
courses.
What all this means is that the
Stanford communitv has the facilities

for practically instantaneous compila
tion of research data; a comprehen
sive problem-solving service; as the
Center bulliton states, a "vigorous
program of computer education;" and
extensive research and development
in the computer science field.
About 800 faculty and graduate
students in all departments are the
prime users of unsponsored or uni
versity-paid-for computer time. The
cost of the equipment and main
tenance is tremendous.
Associated centers, such as the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories, the
Stanford Research Institute, and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
pay $4 for each minute of computer
time, as does the United States gov
ernment, whose contracts sponsor
much of the Center's activities.
Research for the improvement of
computer design and technique is a
constant effort at the Computation
Center where members of the Com
puter Science faculty are nationally
recognized as leaders in the field.
One administrator at the Computa
tion Center noted that computers are
"quietly revolutionizing several
fields." The establishment of systems
of several small computer consoles
all in touch with a central computer
will enable computerized systems of
appliances in homes, banking from
the home by direct line with a con
sole, and shopping by computer.
The use of computer teachers in
schools is already a reality. A system
of time-sharing, employing one com
puter and one-hundred consoles, is a
major project at the Stanford Center
today.
Analysts suggest that the system
of time sharing may one day make it
practical to hook an operating room
to the computer through a time
shared console. Data taken during
surgery could be processed by the
computer, and results returned to the
surgeon during the course of the op
eration.
The use of computers to help de
sign better computers makes the com
puter science field one of unlimited
potentialities. In the near future, the
Computation Center at Stanford is
expecting the installation of a new
computer with five times the capabili
ty of the system now in use. Assistant
Director Robert Brader points out
that advances like this show that the
computer society "is really happen
ing, and is going to happen more and
more,"

ing and beautifully landscaped facili
ties of the Computation Center.
Established in March, 1953, as a
service organization which accommo
dated the entire Stanford Community,
the Center's present facilities, located
at the end of the Via Pueblo between
the Leland Stanford Museum and the
woman's gymnasium, were dedicated
in August, 1963.
These buildings house an IBM 7090
data processing system, a Burroughs
85000 computer, an extensive PDP-1
computing system connected to the
IBM 7090, six computer-controlled
teaching consoles, the offices for a
staff of fifty computer operators and
technical program advisors, and class
room space for Computer Science
courses.
What all this means is that the
Stanford communitv has the facilities

for practically instantaneous compila
tion of research data; a comprehen
sive problem-solving service; as the
Center bulliton states, a "vigorous
program of computer education;" and
extensive research and development
in the computer science field.
About 800 faculty and graduate
students in all departments are the
prime users of unsponsored or uni
versity-paid-for computer time. The
cost of the equipment and main
tenance is tremendous.
Associated centers, such as the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories, the
Stanford Research Institute, and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
pay $4 for each minute of computer
time, as does the United States gov
ernment, whose contracts sponsor
much of the Center's activities.
Research for the improvement of
computer design and technique is a
constant effort at the Computation
Center where members of the Com
puter Science faculty are nationally
recognized as leaders in the field.
One administrator at the Computa
tion Center noted that computers are
"quietly revolutionizing several
fields." The establishment of systems
of several small computer consoles
all in touch with a central computer
will enable computerized systems of
appliances in homes, banking from
the home by direct line with a con
sole, and shopping by computer.
The use of computer teachers in
schools is already a reality. A system
of time-sharing, employing one com
puter and one-hundred consoles, is a
major project at the Stanford Center
today.
Analysts suggest that the system
of time sharing may one day make it
practical to hook an operating room
to the computer through a time
shared console. Data taken during
surgery could be processed by the
computer, and results returned to the
surgeon during the course of the op
eration.
The use of computers to help de
sign better computers makes the com
puter science field one of unlimited
potentialities. In the near future, the
Computation Center at Stanford is
expecting the installation of a new
computer with five times the capabili
ty of the system now in use. Assistant
Director Robert Brader points out
that advances like this show that the
computer society "is really happen
ing, and is going to happen more and
more,"
A nation-wide movement is being
aided by forces on the Stanford cam
pus, yet relatively few members of
the community are aware of the revo
lutionary headquarters. Polya, Spruce,
Redwood, Pine, and Cedar halls are
names indicate, comprise the refresh
ing and beautifully landscaped facili
ties of the Computation Center.
