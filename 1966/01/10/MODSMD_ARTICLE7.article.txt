Jazz Programs
The format of these programs has
been to fntersperse performances by
jazz groups with intei-views by Glea
son of the leaders of the combos.
Gleason and Jazz Year director Rick
Bale decided in December to incorpo
rate this format into the current
Stanford project; thus, three artists
will participate in Jazz Casuals, to be

The programs, which Gleason will
host, will feature singer Jon Hend
ricks, former leader of the Lambert-
Hendricks-Ross trio (Jan. 14), Archie
Shepp (Feb. 4), and Denny Zeitlin
(Feb. 25).
In his talk today, Gleason will dis
cuss the great upheaval in jazz dur
ing the early 1940'5, pioneered by
Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk
(who will perform at Stanford Jan.
23), and Dizzy Gillespie (who will
perform here Feb. 13). He said he
plans to use many recordings, some
of them rare copies, as illustrations.
Admission to the lecture is free to
members of the Stanford community.
The admission charge to the Jazz
Casuals is $1, and tickets, on sale at
the Tresidder box office, are also lim
