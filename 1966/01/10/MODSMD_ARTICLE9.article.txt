Something: new in "Boat Cal" banners was demonstrated in Vienna last fall at
the famous Lippizaner Riding Academy. Left to right are Geoff Barnard, Jill
Tuffli, Janet Riedel, and Charles Herlands, all from Stanford In Austria at
Semmerinff. The picture was taken Oct. 31 just previous to a i>erformanee of
the world-famous trained horses. It was the frist time the Austrian government
had ever permitted the use of the horses for a "gag" picture.
