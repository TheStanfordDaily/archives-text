No Easy Way Out
No single pill cures all man's ills, no panacea of life has yet been found.
Death stalks us at every turn, and beneath the glitter of our modern world,
evil drags us down. From the time of birth we begin to die and the fruits of
death are reaped as we move along.
No bandwagon leaves for heaven, and there is no easy way out. Jesus
Christ said, "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is
easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by if are many. For the
gate is narrow, and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find
it are few."
The way of life, the one way out, is never "sound doctrine or right think
ing" or the church you go to Sunday morning. Jesus Christ said, "I am the way,
the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me. As He walked this
earth, the Lord Jesus was followed, at first, by a great throng, but one by one,
as His teachings became to hard to bear, He was forsaken, to die alone. And
He said to all, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and
take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will
lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it. For what does it
profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? For
whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be
ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and the holy
angels' " (Luke 9:23-26).
Becoming a Christian is a simple thing, Jesus Chris* is just a prayer away,
and He is known only by simple faith and trust. But, entering one s heart,
He brings His cross, and sooner or later changes must be made. Jesus Christ
does not set us free so we can any longer live our lives for ourselves and our
selfish ends, and so God can reproduce Himself in us, and claim us for His
own. The cross of Christ comes to slay sinners and end an old life. Th" death
of the cross is a hard, cruel death; pain and anguish mark its work.
Man's rebellion against a God of love dies in tortured anguish over many
years, God never saves a sinner s life, it is rebuilt from scratch.
But to die with Christ is to rise with Him, and to turn from God is to miss out
forever on life eternal. Disciplined by years of trial and suffering, the Apostle
Peter penned this reminder, "If the righteous man is saved only with great
difficulty, where shall the sinner and ungodly appear ... let those who suffer
according to God's will do right and entrust their souls to a faithful Creator."
In a world of inescapable realities why run from the cross? Why take the
easy road to hell? The way out is not easy, but Jesus Christ is an answer which
never fails and a Friend who never leaves.

No bandwagon leaves for heaven, and there is no easy way out. Jesus
Christ said, "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is
easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by if are many. For the
gate is narrow, and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find
it are few."
The way of life, the one way out, is never "sound doctrine or right think
ing" or the church you go to Sunday morning. Jesus Christ said, "I am the way,
the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me. As He walked this
earth, the Lord Jesus was followed, at first, by a great throng, but one by one,
as His teachings became to hard to bear, He was forsaken, to die alone. And
He said to all, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and
take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will
lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it. For what does it
profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? For
whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be
ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and the holy
angels' " (Luke 9:23-26).
Becoming a Christian is a simple thing, Jesus Chris* is just a prayer away,
and He is known only by simple faith and trust. But, entering one s heart,
He brings His cross, and sooner or later changes must be made. Jesus Christ
does not set us free so we can any longer live our lives for ourselves and our
selfish ends, and so God can reproduce Himself in us, and claim us for His
own. The cross of Christ comes to slay sinners and end an old life. Th" death
of the cross is a hard, cruel death; pain and anguish mark its work.
Man's rebellion against a God of love dies in tortured anguish over many
years, God never saves a sinner s life, it is rebuilt from scratch.
But to die with Christ is to rise with Him, and to turn from God is to miss out
forever on life eternal. Disciplined by years of trial and suffering, the Apostle
Peter penned this reminder, "If the righteous man is saved only with great
difficulty, where shall the sinner and ungodly appear ... let those who suffer
according to God's will do right and entrust their souls to a faithful Creator."
In a world of inescapable realities why run from the cross? Why take the
easy road to hell? The way out is not easy, but Jesus Christ is an answer which
never fails and a Friend who never leaves.

No Easy Way Out
No single pill cures all man's ills, no panacea of life has yet been found.
Death stalks us at every turn, and beneath the glitter of our modern world,
evil drags us down. From the time of birth we begin to die and the fruits of
death are reaped as we move along.
