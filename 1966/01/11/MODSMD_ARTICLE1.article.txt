## 
### The Associated Press 
TASHKENT, U.S.S.R.â€” An apparent
heart attack early today killed Lai
Bahadur Shastri, 61, prime minister
of India's 460 millions, a few hours
after he had signed a limited agree
ment with Pakistan to pull back their
opposing forces, eliminating most of
the after effects of the undeclared
war between their countries last Sep
tember.
The humbly-born, 5-foot-2, 110-
pound Shastri, who succeeded Jawa
haral Nehru 19 months ago, had suf
fered two previous heart attacks.
Died During Talks
Shastri died in a country villa he
was using outside Tashkent during
Soviet-sponsored talks with President
Mohammed Ayub Kahn of Pakistan.
Indian Foreign Minister Waran
Singh made the official announce
ment of Shastri's death, and aides
later gave details of his passing.
The body will be flown home later
Tuesday.
In New Delhi, Home Minister Gul
zarilal Nanda, 67, was sworn in as
prime minister. He had held the job
temporarily after Nehru's death.
World Leaders Comment
President Johnson in Washington
described Shastri's death as a
"grievous blow to the hopes of man
kind for peace and progress." Johnson
said Shastri had "proved a fitting suc
cessor to Pandit Nehru by holding
aloft the highest ideals of Indian de
mocracy."
(At Stanford, members of the Uni
versity's Indian Association met to
pass a condolence resolution. Speak

ers at the meeting were SIA President
B. S. V. Rao, Professor Kristian, Pro
fessor North, Mr. John Field.)
Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin,
Shastri's host in Tashkent, stood in
the foyer of the villa, hat in hand,
and called Shastri "a great humanist
of our time."
Cries For Doctor
About 1:20 a.m., they reported,
Shastri was seized with coughing
spells and stumbled from his bedroom
into the hallway crying, "Doctor, doc
tor."
The aides gave this description of
events that followed:
Shastri's personal staff, packing
their luggage for a planned departure
Tuesday for Kabul, Afghanistan, en
route to India, put the prime minister
back to bed and called his personal
physician, Dr. R. N. Chugh, who rush
ed to Shastri's bedside and examined
him. The doctor later reported that
at 1:32 he could feel no pulse.
The doctor then tried to revive
Shastri with mouth-to-mouth respira
tion but did not succeed. Aides said,
that within the next half hour, nearly
a dozen Soviet physicians arrived and
labored over Shastri, trying to re
vive him.
India's Defense Minister Y. B.
Chavan said Shastri "was in the best
of spirits" when he left a reception
given by Kosygin Monday night.
It was tentatively planned that
Shastri's body would be flown to
India at 9 a.m. in a Soviet plane.
There was an unconfirmed report that
Kosygin would fly to India in the
same plane.
