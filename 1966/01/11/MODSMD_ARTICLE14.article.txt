## 
### 
Dr. William Rivers, associate
professor of Stanford's Com
munication Department, will de
liver the second lecture of the
Stanford Author Series Tuesday
at 4:30 p.m. in the Tresidder
Small Lounge.
Author of "The Opinion
makers" published by Beacon
Press, Boston, last fall, Prof.
Rivers contends that Washing
ton news is "managed" long be
fore it gets to reporters and cor
respondents so that we live in a
"synthetic world."
Dr. Rivers hopes that his book
is exposing the need for hard
digging reporters. He declares
that the need for experts in gov

ernment who can write an inter
pretive story is greater than It
has ever been before.
He also asserts that some sec
tions of the press still Inject
their own bias into a story —
such as Time Magazine and
Drew Pearson — but the picture
is better now than it was 25
years ago.
Rivers, himself a Washington
correspondent ten years ago, re
flects the press scene in the na
tion's capital in "The Opinion
makers" with special attention
to Walter Lippman, James Res
ton, David Brinkley, the New
York Times, and the afore-men
tioned Time and Pearson.
