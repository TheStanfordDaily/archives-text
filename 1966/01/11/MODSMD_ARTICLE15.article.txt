# FIRST LEAGUE LOSS
## Tribe Rally Fails, 61-58 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Washington State was able to
rebuke a second half comeback
by Stanford last night and hang
on for a 61-58 AAWU victory. It
was the Tribe's first league set
back after an opening win Sat
urday over Washington.
The Indians got themselves in
trouble right at the outset when
they committed many turn
overs. After trailing 12-6, Stan
ford rallied to lead 17-16, and
that was the last time the In
dians had any advantage. The
Cougars pleased a very noisy
crowd by then outscoring Stan
ford 14-4 in the next five min
utes.
No Rebounds
Washington State, led by Jim
McKean, was controlling the re
bounds against the taller Stan
ford team. Stanford could not
get the ball inside and was
forced to take long shots. Art
Harris offset the numerous
turnovers by many steals which
percipitated fast breaks.
Bob Bedell was ineffective all
during the first half as he could
not hit on his long shots. And
with 3 minutes left in the half
Bedell collected his fourth foul,
which forced him to see only
limited action thereafter.
WSU led at halftime 37-29 and
much of the story of their lead
is seen in the rebounding re
sults. The Cougars controlled
the boards 24-15, while shoot
ing a torrid 50 per cent during
the first twenty minutes.
Washington State upped their
lead to 11 points at 41-30 shortly
after halftime, as Tommy Tom
mervick scored on two fast
breaks. But then the Indians be
gan their slow comeback. Ray
Kosanke came alive He began
scoring on short jumpers and
lay-ins, and Stanford ceased
throwing the ball away.
Kosanke Rallies
Stanford rolled up 13 points
to five for Washington State.
Kosanke was directly responsi
ble for ten of these points with
four baskets and an assist. Stan
ford then struggled to get any
closer. Washington State upped

the margin to eight at 53-45,
scoring on easy lay-ins.
Stanford bounced right back
with six consecutive points. Ko
sanke scored on a short jumper,
then hit two free throws. Har
ris cut the lead to two with
two free throws. Jim McKean
came back with a hook shot af
ter Kosanke had stuffed a lay
up attempt by Ray Stein. Har
ris pumped in a jump shot to
make the score 56-54. Bob Bedell
returned to action and almost
immediately fouled out with
only four points total. Following
a foul shot by WSU with 4:45
left, Stanford failed to score.
WSU Stall
Washington State then began
to stall. Harris was able to steal
a pass but missed the fast-break
lay-up. Harris fouled Jim Wer
ner, who converted two shots
to run the score to 59-54 with
1:20 remaining. Kosanke had a
shot blocked, but Howard Has
set stole a pass and scored to
narrow the lead to three points
with only 25 seconds left in the
game.
Rod Young fouled Tommer,-
vick, with 8 seconds to go, in a

desperate attempt to regain pos
session of the ball. But Tommer
vick thwarted that plan by
sinking both freethrows to give
Washington State a three point
lead at 61-jS. Stanford could do
nothing effective in the three
seconds left to them.
Frosh Data
Despite the publicity that
has been accorded Lew Alcindor
and his freshman teammates at
UCLA, the Stanford frosh cag
ers proved themselves as a
team to be reckoned with as
they defeated Moffett Field 94-
71, on Friday night and the San
Jose Frosh on Saturday 84-64.
Don Griffin was high for the
Papooses against Moffett as he
scorched the nets for 24 points.
The next evening it was Mai
McElwain's and Ed Martin's
turn for scoring honors as they
tallied 21 and 28 points, respec
tively.
The freshmen are now 4 0 for
the young season with two wins
over San Jose, one over Uni
versity of San Francisco and one
over Moffett. This weekend they
face Cal State at Hayward and
Menlo College
