# High Bonuses Now Getting Near Million
## 
### MIKE RATHET 
NEW YORK (AP) —It might
have cost National and Ameri
can Football league clubs in the
neighborhood of $25 million —
give or take a million or two
over the past few weeks to sign
college players in the high-pres
sure war for new talent.
There's no actual way of tell
ing how much the 24 clubs
spent, but if you can believe re
ports, the five-figure contract
has become commonplace, if it
isn't already on the way to be
coming obsolete.
At least 20 players are report
ed to have received contracts
calling for from $200,000 to
$700,000 —or a total of about $7
million, just under the going
rate for a new franchise com
plete with 32 veteran players.
And with the NFL and AFL
playing Break-the-Bank there's
no way to stop any player from
firing from the hip—even if it's
broken.
One young collegian Is sup
posed to have sat down in a
team's office and immediately
started haggling with the gen
eral manager over a $100,000
bonus.
The general manager, infuri
ated but smiling, told the player
he would get the bonus, but on
one condition. All he had to do
was walk over and put his name
on the contract lying on the
desk.
The player couldn't. Both of
his legs were in casts.
Donny Anderson of Texas
Tech, who signed with Green
Bay of the NFL for a contract
estimated at around $600,000 is
supposed to have turned down
Houston's offer of $887,000,
which included a $200,000 home
and $16,000 worth of furniture.
It was suggested at the time
that Anderson turned down
Houston because the furniture
was too cheap for the house.
But then, ever since the NFL
and AFL began battling over
the nation's top collegiants the
price has mushroomed. Joe Na
math's $400,000 was tops last
year but at least four players
may have exceeded that figure
this time around.

million, just under the going
rate for a new franchise com
plete with 32 veteran players.
And with the NFL and AFL
playing Break-the-Bank there's
no way to stop any player from
firing from the hip—even if it's
broken.
One young collegian Is sup
posed to have sat down in a
team's office and immediately
started haggling with the gen
eral manager over a $100,000
bonus.
The general manager, infuri
ated but smiling, told the player
he would get the bonus, but on
one condition. All he had to do
was walk over and put his name
on the contract lying on the
desk.
The player couldn't. Both of
his legs were in casts.
Donny Anderson of Texas
Tech, who signed with Green
Bay of the NFL for a contract
estimated at around $600,000 is
supposed to have turned down
Houston's offer of $887,000,
which included a $200,000 home
and $16,000 worth of furniture.
It was suggested at the time
that Anderson turned down
Houston because the furniture
was too cheap for the house.
But then, ever since the NFL
and AFL began battling over
the nation's top collegiants the
price has mushroomed. Joe Na
math's $400,000 was tops last
year but at least four players
may have exceeded that figure
this time around.
