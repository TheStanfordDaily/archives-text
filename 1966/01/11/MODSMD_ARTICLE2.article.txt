# Alumni Winds From Right Blow Criticism On Teacher
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
A controversy has erupted between
a conservative Stanford alumni group
and a liberal Stanford professor.
In a bulletin distributed to Stanford
alumni in November, the Winds of
Freedom Foundation criticized Dr.
Christian Bay of the Political Science
Department for "haranguing the stu
dents" at an anti-Vietnam War rally.
It citcd Bay's "public record" to
document his liberal beliefs and cen
sured Stanford for not accepting a
"scholar whose stature and convic
tions might add some balance to those
of Dr. Bay."
Blasts Socialist Doctrines
The Foundation, a Stanford alumni
association organized in July 1962, is,
according to its literature, "a group
who believe that the socialist doc
trines of 20th century 'liberalism' are
at variance with the United States
Constitution and at variance with the
Founding Grant of Stanford."

It says it prime purpose is "to ag
gregate funds for gifts to Stanford."
In a letter of Jan. 3 to Morton
D'Evelyn of Bakersfield, president of
the association. Bay replied to the
"criticism" of his views:
Encourages Reflection
"As a teacher, I am concerned in
the classroom with helping students
of all views to better articulate and
reflect on and perhaps modify their
own views.
"Outside the classroom, on the oth
er hand, I consider it my right and
duty to challenge my colleagues and
students, in public or in private, to
discussions of any and all important
public issues on which I find myself
in disagreement with them."
The political science professor, who
is also associated with the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems,
asked in his letter that his comments
be published "to allow your sub
scribers to read my reply to your al
legations," but he said yesterday he
had heard nothing from the Founda
tion.
Disappointed in Alumni
Asked about his reaction to the bul
letin. Bay replied, "If I have any re
action. it is that I am disappointed
that Stanford graduates are so un
educated about the political realities
of our time that they are not able to
distinguish between radical ideas and
subversive disloyalty."
The controversy brings to sharp
focus the question of what part alum
ni should play in determining the aca
demic policy of the university, in par
ticular. the question of hiring and fir
ing professors.
In the bulletin, the Foundation
stated. "While Stanford would not ac
cept in its political science depart
ment, professors of conservative con
victions, yet it did find a place for
Dr. Bay, whose viewpoint is certainly
subject to challenge."
Refusal of Gifts
On several occasions the University
has refused to accept gift offers from
the Foundation.
In June of 1964 the Board of Trus
tees refused $500 from the foundation,
adding that the organization had not
been nuthorized to solicit funds for
Stanford.
Earlier, on May 7. 1903, the Trus
tees refused gift offers from two in
dividual who stipulated the use of
funds be designated or approved by
♦he Winds of Freedom directors at a
later date.
The trustees at that time endorsed
an earlier policy statement that "The
board cannot surrender or divide the
responsibility and authority for con
trolling the University's affairs, in
cluding solicitation and acceptance of
gifts and the determination of their
use."
Alumni Rebuffed
In effect, therefore, the University
has tended to rebuff alumni force —at
least, the less-than-subtle, "strings-at
tached" kind even if backed by prom
ised funds, when they threaten to un
dermine the academic autonomy of the
University.
The professor caught up in the con
troversy, Christian Bay, is a Norwe
gian citizen who describes himself as
a "humanistic liberal."
He has been a frequent speaker at
Stanford and in this area against the
Vietnam War and on behalf of such
liberal groups as the Young People's
Socialist League and the National
Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy

a conservative Stanford alumni group
and a liberal Stanford professor.
In a bulletin distributed to Stanford
alumni in November, the Winds of
Freedom Foundation criticized Dr.
Christian Bay of the Political Science
Department for "haranguing the stu
dents" at an anti-Vietnam War rally.
It citcd Bay's "public record" to
document his liberal beliefs and cen
sured Stanford for not accepting a
"scholar whose stature and convic
tions might add some balance to those
of Dr. Bay."
Blasts Socialist Doctrines
The Foundation, a Stanford alumni
association organized in July 1962, is,
according to its literature, "a group
who believe that the socialist doc
trines of 20th century 'liberalism' are
at variance with the United States
Constitution and at variance with the
Founding Grant of Stanford."

It says it prime purpose is "to ag
gregate funds for gifts to Stanford."
In a letter of Jan. 3 to Morton
D'Evelyn of Bakersfield, president of
the association. Bay replied to the
"criticism" of his views:
Encourages Reflection
"As a teacher, I am concerned in
the classroom with helping students
of all views to better articulate and
reflect on and perhaps modify their
own views.
"Outside the classroom, on the oth
er hand, I consider it my right and
duty to challenge my colleagues and
students, in public or in private, to
discussions of any and all important
public issues on which I find myself
in disagreement with them."
The political science professor, who
is also associated with the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems,
asked in his letter that his comments
be published "to allow your sub
scribers to read my reply to your al
legations," but he said yesterday he
had heard nothing from the Founda
tion.
Disappointed in Alumni
Asked about his reaction to the bul
letin. Bay replied, "If I have any re
action. it is that I am disappointed
that Stanford graduates are so un
educated about the political realities
of our time that they are not able to
distinguish between radical ideas and
subversive disloyalty."
The controversy brings to sharp
focus the question of what part alum
ni should play in determining the aca
demic policy of the university, in par
ticular. the question of hiring and fir
ing professors.
In the bulletin, the Foundation
stated. "While Stanford would not ac
cept in its political science depart
ment, professors of conservative con
victions, yet it did find a place for
Dr. Bay, whose viewpoint is certainly
subject to challenge."
Refusal of Gifts
On several occasions the University
has refused to accept gift offers from
the Foundation.
In June of 1964 the Board of Trus
tees refused $500 from the foundation,
adding that the organization had not
been nuthorized to solicit funds for
Stanford.
Earlier, on May 7. 1903, the Trus
tees refused gift offers from two in
dividual who stipulated the use of
funds be designated or approved by
♦he Winds of Freedom directors at a
later date.
The trustees at that time endorsed
an earlier policy statement that "The
board cannot surrender or divide the
responsibility and authority for con
trolling the University's affairs, in
cluding solicitation and acceptance of
gifts and the determination of their
use."
Alumni Rebuffed
In effect, therefore, the University
has tended to rebuff alumni force —at
least, the less-than-subtle, "strings-at
tached" kind even if backed by prom
ised funds, when they threaten to un
dermine the academic autonomy of the
University.
The professor caught up in the con
troversy, Christian Bay, is a Norwe
gian citizen who describes himself as
a "humanistic liberal."
He has been a frequent speaker at
Stanford and in this area against the
Vietnam War and on behalf of such
