# Kadane's LASSU Address

(Editor's note: Reprinted below are excerpts

the Legislature" address delivered to the mem
bers of LASSU last Thursday.)
... The work of the legislature is not measured by
the number of bills and resolutions passed, nor is
its effectiveness measured by its procedure. Rath
er we must look to the substantive issues of wide
concern.
The issue which has been with us longest,
liquor, should be resolved this year. The desire
of the student body for a change in this policy
has been manifest for several years. The opening
of the Faculty Club and the successful experi
ment in Escondido Village point the way toward
bringing the rule into harmony with the mores
of our community. Such a step is long over-due,
and should not be a major objective for us this
year. It is, to quote Sandy MacKenzie, "stepping
boldly into the 1930'5". The Student Affairs and
Services Committee intends, as I understand it,
to bring a tentative proposal to the Committee of
Fifteen and other groups this quarter.
Judicial Reform
Judicial reform, especially the establishment
of a faculty-student appeals board, is being han
dled by a sub-committee of the Committee of 15.
It will require a Constitutional Amendment to
become effective. There are other areas of judi
cial reform, especially the relationship between
the lower councils and the Judicial Council, which
should be looked into; I hope the Legislature Ju
diciary Committee will do so.
The right of religious groups to organize and to
worship freely on campus was brought to the at
tention of the community by a Legislature com
mittee two years ago. Last quarter we passed a
resolution expressing our support for this prin
ciple. Early Board of Trustees action is apparent
ly expected. There is a bill in committee which
would create a conflict in law between the ASSU
and the University on this issue.
Open hours in dormitories have been the sub
ject of an extensive poll, which you carried out.
as part of a study by a subcommittee of our Stu
dent Affairs Committee. A report to the Legisla
ture is expected soon. After consultation of the
Student Affairs and Services Committee, it will
come back to the Legislature for enactment . . .
Compensation for staff and faculty copies of
The Daily is another issue being considered by a
subcommittee of the Committee of 15. However,
a favorable conclusion is not guaranteed, and it
may be financially necessary to withhold free
copies from non-students if some equitable ar
rangement cannot be reached.
Social Regulations
Social regulations for women have been a topic
of concern for some time. I am sure that the re
form of the Social Regulations Committee passed
last quarter will result in closer co-operation on
these problems. I hope that the Social Regulations
Committee will consider the fundamental ques
tions of what rules would contribute most to the
education and growth of undergraduate women
at Stanford. I am told that we can expect a report
toward the end of this quarter ...
In observing the progress of these issues, one
notices that their success depends frequently on
our relations with other constituencies. Hence a
few remarks on the other constituencies might be
appropriate.
One Or Two Constituencies?
The first question frequently asked is whether
the other constituencies are really one or two.
Increasingly, I am happy to say, the faculty has
been willing to be independent of the Administra
tion, and to voice opinions of its own. This de
velopment is vital to us as students, and to Stan
ford as a whole, since only from a faculty which
takes a sustained and long-run interest in the
education of its students can Stanford fulfill its
promise as an exciting, forward-looking intellec
tual institution.
Among the administrators, Dean Smith and
Dean Wert are the two I have dealt with most.
They are intelligent and far-sighted men, al
though it must be understood that on occasion

they are not in a position to speak for them
selves.
I have come to the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student power within the
University, to the extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat of disruption of
life on the campus and its attendant bad publici
ty for the University. I say "reluctantly" because
my personal preference is toward quiet negotia
tion and reason. I say "with great sorrow" be
cause it means that only sometimes is the right
decision made in the right way, and that the pos
sibility of misunderstanding is ever-present. For
reasons I cannot fathom, the University prefers
to toy with disaster, and forces us into this role.
Union Residence
For example, in the question of the closing of
Union Residence this fall, there never was, to the
best of my knowledge, a review of that decision
in which students participated. Despite avowals
that the Administration stands willing to discuss
anything, at any time, neither your officers, nor
the girls in Union, were permitted to examine in
full detail whether Union is suitable for the use
to which it will be put, whether the $1,100,000
being spent to renovate Union for these purposes
is money well-spent, and whether there were al
ternatives of greater benefit to the University.
It may be that the decisions made were the cor
rect ones, but they were made last spring with
out consultation, and, if they were reviewed this
fall, that review proceeded without a full hear
ing.
It saddens me that the Committee of Fifteen
put its seal of approval on this; however, the fac
ulty and administration were united in their oppo
sition to us. The fact that this is the only issue
that Committee has dealt with may raise ques
tions as to its value. Although I support the con
tinuation of the practice of having those closest
to the political situation—and hence busiest—in
our group of five, this should surely be reviewed
if the Committee continues to be as disappointing
as it was this fall.
The Consequences of Success
One of the most difficult and embarassing ques
tions to answer in politics is the consequences of
success. Suppose that we accomplish all, or al
most all, of the program we have developed this
year. Will this mean that, for lack of grievances,
the Legislature and the student movement will
die?
The reason for pursuing the issues we are is to
clear up a backlog of problems concerning rules,
so that we may get to the more important and
fundamental issues of education. It is hard to
ask a girl to challenge ideas in her courses if she
has to sign out to go to the library. It is hard to
ask a student to ask why of anything except why
there is supposed to be no liquor on campus. The
rules shape notions of what students are ex
pected to be. The changes we favor require stu
dents to be sufficiently mature to make their
own decisions about how they are to live. This
is necessary if students are to be challenged to
decide what they think and believe.
Issues of the Future
The issues of the future, then, are educational
ones. How can Stanford be a more exciting in
tellectual environment? Can "busywork" which
requires little thought, but many hours, be elimi
nated? Can the grading system be modified to
become the friend, rather than the enemy, of
real excitement from courses? These questions
are the sort I would expect to see debated here
next year if we are successful this year.
The Executive branch has made a commenda
ble start in this direction with its committees of
faculty and students in various departments. Per
haps we should also consider adding faculty ex
officio members to this body, of finding other
methods to increase communications with the
faculty.
It has often been said that Stanford is on the
edge of greatness. We are doing our best to im
prove the quality of education at Stanford. If
Stanford is to become a truly great educational
institution, it will be because you have made it so.

ciple. Early Board of Trustees action is apparent
ly expected. There is a bill in committee which
would create a conflict in law between the ASSU
and the University on this issue.
Open hours in dormitories have been the sub
ject of an extensive poll, which you carried out.
as part of a study by a subcommittee of our Stu
dent Affairs Committee. A report to the Legisla
ture is expected soon. After consultation of the
Student Affairs and Services Committee, it will
come back to the Legislature for enactment . . .
Compensation for staff and faculty copies of
The Daily is another issue being considered by a
subcommittee of the Committee of 15. However,
a favorable conclusion is not guaranteed, and it
may be financially necessary to withhold free
copies from non-students if some equitable ar
rangement cannot be reached.
Social Regulations
Social regulations for women have been a topic
of concern for some time. I am sure that the re
form of the Social Regulations Committee passed
last quarter will result in closer co-operation on
these problems. I hope that the Social Regulations
Committee will consider the fundamental ques
tions of what rules would contribute most to the
education and growth of undergraduate women
at Stanford. I am told that we can expect a report
toward the end of this quarter ...
In observing the progress of these issues, one
notices that their success depends frequently on
our relations with other constituencies. Hence a
few remarks on the other constituencies might be
appropriate.
One Or Two Constituencies?
The first question frequently asked is whether
the other constituencies are really one or two.
Increasingly, I am happy to say, the faculty has
been willing to be independent of the Administra
tion, and to voice opinions of its own. This de
velopment is vital to us as students, and to Stan
ford as a whole, since only from a faculty which
takes a sustained and long-run interest in the
education of its students can Stanford fulfill its
promise as an exciting, forward-looking intellec
tual institution.
Among the administrators, Dean Smith and
Dean Wert are the two I have dealt with most.
They are intelligent and far-sighted men, al
though it must be understood that on occasion

they are not in a position to speak for them
selves.
I have come to the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student power within the
University, to the extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat of disruption of
life on the campus and its attendant bad publici
ty for the University. I say "reluctantly" because
my personal preference is toward quiet negotia
tion and reason. I say "with great sorrow" be
cause it means that only sometimes is the right
decision made in the right way, and that the pos
sibility of misunderstanding is ever-present. For
reasons I cannot fathom, the University prefers
to toy with disaster, and forces us into this role.
Union Residence
For example, in the question of the closing of
Union Residence this fall, there never was, to the
best of my knowledge, a review of that decision
in which students participated. Despite avowals
that the Administration stands willing to discuss
anything, at any time, neither your officers, nor
the girls in Union, were permitted to examine in
full detail whether Union is suitable for the use
to which it will be put, whether the $1,100,000
being spent to renovate Union for these purposes
is money well-spent, and whether there were al
ternatives of greater benefit to the University.
It may be that the decisions made were the cor
rect ones, but they were made last spring with
out consultation, and, if they were reviewed this
fall, that review proceeded without a full hear
ing.
It saddens me that the Committee of Fifteen
put its seal of approval on this; however, the fac
ulty and administration were united in their oppo
sition to us. The fact that this is the only issue
that Committee has dealt with may raise ques
tions as to its value. Although I support the con
tinuation of the practice of having those closest
to the political situation—and hence busiest—in
our group of five, this should surely be reviewed
if the Committee continues to be as disappointing
as it was this fall.
The Consequences of Success
One of the most difficult and embarassing ques
tions to answer in politics is the consequences of
success. Suppose that we accomplish all, or al
most all, of the program we have developed this
year. Will this mean that, for lack of grievances,
the Legislature and the student movement will
die?
The reason for pursuing the issues we are is to
clear up a backlog of problems concerning rules,
so that we may get to the more important and
fundamental issues of education. It is hard to
ask a girl to challenge ideas in her courses if she
has to sign out to go to the library. It is hard to
ask a student to ask why of anything except why
there is supposed to be no liquor on campus. The
rules shape notions of what students are ex
pected to be. The changes we favor require stu
dents to be sufficiently mature to make their
own decisions about how they are to live. This
is necessary if students are to be challenged to
decide what they think and believe.
Issues of the Future
The issues of the future, then, are educational
ones. How can Stanford be a more exciting in
tellectual environment? Can "busywork" which
requires little thought, but many hours, be elimi
nated? Can the grading system be modified to
become the friend, rather than the enemy, of
real excitement from courses? These questions
are the sort I would expect to see debated here
next year if we are successful this year.
The Executive branch has made a commenda
ble start in this direction with its committees of
faculty and students in various departments. Per
haps we should also consider adding faculty ex
officio members to this body, of finding other
methods to increase communications with the
faculty.
It has often been said that Stanford is on the
edge of greatness. We are doing our best to im
prove the quality of education at Stanford. If
Stanford is to become a truly great educational
institution, it will be because you have made it so.

... The work of the legislature is not measured by
the number of bills and resolutions passed, nor is
its effectiveness measured by its procedure. Rath
er we must look to the substantive issues of wide
concern.
The issue which has been with us longest,
liquor, should be resolved this year. The desire
of the student body for a change in this policy
has been manifest for several years. The opening
of the Faculty Club and the successful experi
ment in Escondido Village point the way toward
bringing the rule into harmony with the mores
of our community. Such a step is long over-due,
and should not be a major objective for us this
year. It is, to quote Sandy MacKenzie, "stepping
boldly into the 1930'5". The Student Affairs and
Services Committee intends, as I understand it,
to bring a tentative proposal to the Committee of
Fifteen and other groups this quarter.
Judicial Reform
Judicial reform, especially the establishment
of a faculty-student appeals board, is being han
dled by a sub-committee of the Committee of 15.
It will require a Constitutional Amendment to
become effective. There are other areas of judi
cial reform, especially the relationship between
the lower councils and the Judicial Council, which
should be looked into; I hope the Legislature Ju
diciary Committee will do so.
The right of religious groups to organize and to
worship freely on campus was brought to the at

velopment is vital to us as students, and to Stan
ford as a whole, since only from a faculty which
takes a sustained and long-run interest in the
education of its students can Stanford fulfill its
promise as an exciting, forward-looking intellec
tual institution.
Among the administrators, Dean Smith and
Dean Wert are the two I have dealt with most.
They are intelligent and far-sighted men, al
though it must be understood that on occasion

they are not in a position to speak for them
selves.
I have come to the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student power within the
University, to the extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat of disruption of
life on the campus and its attendant bad publici
ty for the University. I say "reluctantly" because
my personal preference is toward quiet negotia
tion and reason. I say "with great sorrow" be
cause it means that only sometimes is the right
decision made in the right way, and that the pos
sibility of misunderstanding is ever-present. For
reasons I cannot fathom, the University prefers
to toy with disaster, and forces us into this role.
Union Residence
For example, in the question of the closing of
Union Residence this fall, there never was, to the
best of my knowledge, a review of that decision
in which students participated. Despite avowals
that the Administration stands willing to discuss
anything, at any time, neither your officers, nor
the girls in Union, were permitted to examine in
full detail whether Union is suitable for the use
to which it will be put, whether the $1,100,000
being spent to renovate Union for these purposes
is money well-spent, and whether there were al
ternatives of greater benefit to the University.
It may be that the decisions made were the cor
rect ones, but they were made last spring with
out consultation, and, if they were reviewed this
fall, that review proceeded without a full hear
ing.
It saddens me that the Committee of Fifteen
put its seal of approval on this; however, the fac
ulty and administration were united in their oppo
sition to us. The fact that this is the only issue
that Committee has dealt with may raise ques
tions as to its value. Although I support the con
tinuation of the practice of having those closest
to the political situation—and hence busiest—in
our group of five, this should surely be reviewed
if the Committee continues to be as disappointing
as it was this fall.
The Consequences of Success
One of the most difficult and embarassing ques
tions to answer in politics is the consequences of
success. Suppose that we accomplish all, or al
most all, of the program we have developed this
year. Will this mean that, for lack of grievances,
the Legislature and the student movement will
die?
The reason for pursuing the issues we are is to
clear up a backlog of problems concerning rules,
so that we may get to the more important and
fundamental issues of education. It is hard to
ask a girl to challenge ideas in her courses if she
has to sign out to go to the library. It is hard to
ask a student to ask why of anything except why
there is supposed to be no liquor on campus. The
rules shape notions of what students are ex
pected to be. The changes we favor require stu
dents to be sufficiently mature to make their
own decisions about how they are to live. This
is necessary if students are to be challenged to
decide what they think and believe.
Issues of the Future
The issues of the future, then, are educational
ones. How can Stanford be a more exciting in
tellectual environment? Can "busywork" which
requires little thought, but many hours, be elimi
nated? Can the grading system be modified to
become the friend, rather than the enemy, of
real excitement from courses? These questions
are the sort I would expect to see debated here
next year if we are successful this year.
The Executive branch has made a commenda
ble start in this direction with its committees of
faculty and students in various departments. Per
haps we should also consider adding faculty ex
officio members to this body, of finding other
methods to increase communications with the
faculty.
It has often been said that Stanford is on the
edge of greatness. We are doing our best to im
prove the quality of education at Stanford. If
Stanford is to become a truly great educational
institution, it will be because you have made it so.
(Editor's note: Reprinted below are excerpts
from the text of Speaker Jay Kadane's "State of
the Legislature" address delivered to the mem
bers of LASSU last Thursday.)
... The work of the legislature is not measured by
the number of bills and resolutions passed, nor is
its effectiveness measured by its procedure. Rath
er we must look to the substantive issues of wide
concern.
The issue which has been with us longest,
liquor, should be resolved this year. The desire
of the student body for a change in this policy
has been manifest for several years. The opening
of the Faculty Club and the successful experi
ment in Escondido Village point the way toward
bringing the rule into harmony with the mores
of our community. Such a step is long over-due,
and should not be a major objective for us this
year. It is, to quote Sandy MacKenzie, "stepping
boldly into the 1930'5". The Student Affairs and
Services Committee intends, as I understand it,
to bring a tentative proposal to the Committee of
Fifteen and other groups this quarter.
Judicial Reform
Judicial reform, especially the establishment
of a faculty-student appeals board, is being han
dled by a sub-committee of the Committee of 15.
It will require a Constitutional Amendment to
become effective. There are other areas of judi
cial reform, especially the relationship between
the lower councils and the Judicial Council, which
should be looked into; I hope the Legislature Ju
diciary Committee will do so.
The right of religious groups to organize and to
worship freely on campus was brought to the at
tention of the community by a Legislature com
mittee two years ago. Last quarter we passed a
resolution expressing our support for this prin
ciple. Early Board of Trustees action is apparent
ly expected. There is a bill in committee which
would create a conflict in law between the ASSU
and the University on this issue.
Open hours in dormitories have been the sub
ject of an extensive poll, which you carried out.
as part of a study by a subcommittee of our Stu
dent Affairs Committee. A report to the Legisla
ture is expected soon. After consultation of the
Student Affairs and Services Committee, it will
come back to the Legislature for enactment . . .
Compensation for staff and faculty copies of
The Daily is another issue being considered by a
subcommittee of the Committee of 15. However,
a favorable conclusion is not guaranteed, and it
may be financially necessary to withhold free
copies from non-students if some equitable ar
rangement cannot be reached.
Social Regulations
Social regulations for women have been a topic
of concern for some time. I am sure that the re
form of the Social Regulations Committee passed
last quarter will result in closer co-operation on
these problems. I hope that the Social Regulations
Committee will consider the fundamental ques
tions of what rules would contribute most to the
education and growth of undergraduate women
at Stanford. I am told that we can expect a report
toward the end of this quarter ...
In observing the progress of these issues, one
notices that their success depends frequently on
our relations with other constituencies. Hence a
few remarks on the other constituencies might be
appropriate.
One Or Two Constituencies?
The first question frequently asked is whether
the other constituencies are really one or two.
Increasingly, I am happy to say, the faculty has
been willing to be independent of the Administra
tion, and to voice opinions of its own. This de
velopment is vital to us as students, and to Stan

ternatives of greater benefit to the University.
It may be that the decisions made were the cor
rect ones, but they were made last spring with
out consultation, and, if they were reviewed this
fall, that review proceeded without a full hear
ing.
It saddens me that the Committee of Fifteen
put its seal of approval on this; however, the fac
ulty and administration were united in their oppo
sition to us. The fact that this is the only issue
that Committee has dealt with may raise ques
tions as to its value. Although I support the con
tinuation of the practice of having those closest
to the political situation—and hence busiest—in
our group of five, this should surely be reviewed
if the Committee continues to be as disappointing
as it was this fall.
The Consequences of Success
One of the most difficult and embarassing ques
tions to answer in politics is the consequences of
success. Suppose that we accomplish all, or al
most all, of the program we have developed this
year. Will this mean that, for lack of grievances,
the Legislature and the student movement will
die?
The reason for pursuing the issues we are is to
clear up a backlog of problems concerning rules,
so that we may get to the more important and
fundamental issues of education. It is hard to
ask a girl to challenge ideas in her courses if she
has to sign out to go to the library. It is hard to
ask a student to ask why of anything except why
there is supposed to be no liquor on campus. The
rules shape notions of what students are ex
pected to be. The changes we favor require stu
dents to be sufficiently mature to make their
own decisions about how they are to live. This
is necessary if students are to be challenged to
decide what they think and believe.
Issues of the Future
The issues of the future, then, are educational
ones. How can Stanford be a more exciting in
tellectual environment? Can "busywork" which
requires little thought, but many hours, be elimi
nated? Can the grading system be modified to
become the friend, rather than the enemy, of
real excitement from courses? These questions
are the sort I would expect to see debated here
next year if we are successful this year.
The Executive branch has made a commenda
ble start in this direction with its committees of
faculty and students in various departments. Per
haps we should also consider adding faculty ex
officio members to this body, of finding other
methods to increase communications with the
faculty.
It has often been said that Stanford is on the
edge of greatness. We are doing our best to im
prove the quality of education at Stanford. If
Stanford is to become a truly great educational
institution, it will be because you have made it so.
(Editor's note: Reprinted below are excerpts
from the text of Speaker Jay Kadane's "State of
the Legislature" address delivered to the mem
bers of LASSU last Thursday.)
... The work of the legislature is not measured by
the number of bills and resolutions passed, nor is
its effectiveness measured by its procedure. Rath
er we must look to the substantive issues of wide
concern.
The issue which has been with us longest,
liquor, should be resolved this year. The desire
of the student body for a change in this policy
has been manifest for several years. The opening
of the Faculty Club and the successful experi
ment in Escondido Village point the way toward
bringing the rule into harmony with the mores
of our community. Such a step is long over-due,
and should not be a major objective for us this
year. It is, to quote Sandy MacKenzie, "stepping
boldly into the 1930'5". The Student Affairs and
Services Committee intends, as I understand it,
to bring a tentative proposal to the Committee of
Fifteen and other groups this quarter.
Judicial Reform
Judicial reform, especially the establishment
of a faculty-student appeals board, is being han
dled by a sub-committee of the Committee of 15.
It will require a Constitutional Amendment to
become effective. There are other areas of judi
cial reform, especially the relationship between
the lower councils and the Judicial Council, which
should be looked into; I hope the Legislature Ju
diciary Committee will do so.
The right of religious groups to organize and to
worship freely on campus was brought to the at
tention of the community by a Legislature com
mittee two years ago. Last quarter we passed a
resolution expressing our support for this prin
ciple. Early Board of Trustees action is apparent
ly expected. There is a bill in committee which
would create a conflict in law between the ASSU
and the University on this issue.
Open hours in dormitories have been the sub
ject of an extensive poll, which you carried out.
as part of a study by a subcommittee of our Stu
dent Affairs Committee. A report to the Legisla
ture is expected soon. After consultation of the
Student Affairs and Services Committee, it will
come back to the Legislature for enactment . . .
Compensation for staff and faculty copies of
The Daily is another issue being considered by a
subcommittee of the Committee of 15. However,
a favorable conclusion is not guaranteed, and it
may be financially necessary to withhold free
copies from non-students if some equitable ar
rangement cannot be reached.
Social Regulations
Social regulations for women have been a topic
of concern for some time. I am sure that the re
form of the Social Regulations Committee passed
last quarter will result in closer co-operation on
these problems. I hope that the Social Regulations
Committee will consider the fundamental ques
tions of what rules would contribute most to the
education and growth of undergraduate women
at Stanford. I am told that we can expect a report
toward the end of this quarter ...
In observing the progress of these issues, one
notices that their success depends frequently on
our relations with other constituencies. Hence a
few remarks on the other constituencies might be
appropriate.
One Or Two Constituencies?
The first question frequently asked is whether
the other constituencies are really one or two.
Increasingly, I am happy to say, the faculty has
been willing to be independent of the Administra
tion, and to voice opinions of its own. This de
velopment is vital to us as students, and to Stan
ford as a whole, since only from a faculty which
takes a sustained and long-run interest in the
education of its students can Stanford fulfill its
promise as an exciting, forward-looking intellec
tual institution.
Among the administrators, Dean Smith and
Dean Wert are the two I have dealt with most.
They are intelligent and far-sighted men, al
though it must be understood that on occasion

they are not in a position to speak for them
selves.
I have come to the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student power within the
University, to the extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat of disruption of
life on the campus and its attendant bad publici
ty for the University. I say "reluctantly" because
my personal preference is toward quiet negotia
tion and reason. I say "with great sorrow" be
cause it means that only sometimes is the right
decision made in the right way, and that the pos
sibility of misunderstanding is ever-present. For
reasons I cannot fathom, the University prefers
to toy with disaster, and forces us into this role.
Union Residence
For example, in the question of the closing of
Union Residence this fall, there never was, to the
best of my knowledge, a review of that decision
in which students participated. Despite avowals
that the Administration stands willing to discuss
anything, at any time, neither your officers, nor
the girls in Union, were permitted to examine in
full detail whether Union is suitable for the use
to which it will be put, whether the $1,100,000
being spent to renovate Union for these purposes
is money well-spent, and whether there were al
ternatives of greater benefit to the University.
It may be that the decisions made were the cor
rect ones, but they were made last spring with
out consultation, and, if they were reviewed this
fall, that review proceeded without a full hear
ing.
