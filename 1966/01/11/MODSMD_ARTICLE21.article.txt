# STANFORD HISTORY
## A 						Good Demonstration Doesn't Have To Be Dull 
### BY STEVE GRUBER 
"There is enough suffering in
life without people tying boards
on their feet and sliding down
mountains"—Robert Benchley.
Now that Stanford's 579 th
Winter Carnival has come to its
"climax", it is time to study it in
relation to Stanford's history.
Danger On The Farm
There once was a time in Stan
ford history that students did
not have the money, the desire,
or the need to attend a Winter
Carnival. Danger and excitement
were easily accessible right here
on The Farm. The ASSU did not
have to invent a situation in
which students could risk their
lives. It is only the student who
is the result of the post-war baby
boom and all of his milquetoast
tendencies who needs to travel
250 miles to have fun.
The Stanford student of 1908
proved that all he required to
have a good time was a few dol
lars for liquor and a desire to
make an ass out of himself.
On March 12, 1908, the biggest
demonstration in Stanford his
tory was held. No one knows
exactly how it all started, but
according to Orrin L. Elliott in
Stanford University: The First
25 Years, "Early in the evening,
in one of the fraternities, some
excitable individual or individu
als, started a 'demonstration'
before one of the fraternity
houses."
'Pee-rade, pee-rade'
A crowd of about 350 persons
soon formed, shouting "pee-rade,
pee-rade." To the student of
1966, it must appear that this
crowd had lost its collective
mind. But, for reasons that can
not be explained in The Daily,
because it is allegedly a family
newspaper, there was a definite
significance to their chant.
The Pee-rade was the result of
the University prying into stu
dent affairs. President Jordan,
a strict teetotler, felt that an
absolute restriction of alcohol on
campus had to be put into effect.
He appointed an Executive Com
mittee, headed by Professor
Clark, to enforce all of the liquor
regulations. The students, rea
lizing that Stanford is hard to
handle without being properly
bombed, disregarded most of the
Committee's pronouncements.
The Committee attempted to put
even more stringent regulations
into effect, and its harshest
proclamation was published on
March 12.
To show their appreciation for
Professor Clark and his Commit
tee, the students marched from
the fraternities to Dr. Clark's
house. According to Elliott, "Ar
riving at the residence of Pro
fessor Clark, they repeatedly
called for the chairman. When
Mrs. Clark explained that Pro
fessor Clark was not at home
and requested the crowd to leave
the premises, there were further
irresponsible jeers, catcalls, and
insulting remarks."
A Riot of Sorts
It was at this time that the
name "pee-rade" began to take
on meaning. The students dis
graced Clark's front lawn and
marched to the Library where
further demonstrations were
held. They paraded around In
ner Quad and stopped in Memo
rial Court, where in 1908 the
Statue of the Stanfords was still
located. The statue provided an
excellent place for burning the
proclamation and making de

rogatory comments about the
Stanfords, Professor Clark, non
drinkers, and Stanford women.
Of course, all this frivolity
could not go unpunished. The
University suspended 41 stu
dents and added five units to
the graduation requirements of
36 others. Most students, how
ever, especially those who did
not get suspended, agreed that
the demonstration was worth
while. At least, the University
has not made any further at
tempts to regulate drinking on
campus.
Think of the 1908 Pee-Rade
the next time you travel to
Squaw Valley. You could be
leading demonstrations with a
real social significance.

Now that Stanford's 579 th
Winter Carnival has come to its
"climax", it is time to study it in
relation to Stanford's history.
Danger On The Farm
There once was a time in Stan
ford history that students did
not have the money, the desire,
or the need to attend a Winter
Carnival. Danger and excitement
were easily accessible right here
on The Farm. The ASSU did not
have to invent a situation in
which students could risk their
lives. It is only the student who
is the result of the post-war baby
boom and all of his milquetoast
tendencies who needs to travel
250 miles to have fun.
The Stanford student of 1908
proved that all he required to
have a good time was a few dol
lars for liquor and a desire to
make an ass out of himself.
On March 12, 1908, the biggest
demonstration in Stanford his
tory was held. No one knows
exactly how it all started, but
according to Orrin L. Elliott in
Stanford University: The First
25 Years, "Early in the evening,
in one of the fraternities, some
excitable individual or individu
als, started a 'demonstration'
before one of the fraternity
houses."
'Pee-rade, pee-rade'
A crowd of about 350 persons
soon formed, shouting "pee-rade,
pee-rade." To the student of
1966, it must appear that this
crowd had lost its collective
mind. But, for reasons that can
not be explained in The Daily,
because it is allegedly a family
newspaper, there was a definite
significance to their chant.
The Pee-rade was the result of
the University prying into stu
dent affairs. President Jordan,
a strict teetotler, felt that an
absolute restriction of alcohol on
campus had to be put into effect.
He appointed an Executive Com
mittee, headed by Professor
Clark, to enforce all of the liquor
regulations. The students, rea
lizing that Stanford is hard to
handle without being properly
bombed, disregarded most of the
Committee's pronouncements.
The Committee attempted to put
even more stringent regulations
into effect, and its harshest
proclamation was published on
March 12.
To show their appreciation for
Professor Clark and his Commit
tee, the students marched from
the fraternities to Dr. Clark's
house. According to Elliott, "Ar
riving at the residence of Pro
fessor Clark, they repeatedly
called for the chairman. When
Mrs. Clark explained that Pro
fessor Clark was not at home
and requested the crowd to leave
the premises, there were further
irresponsible jeers, catcalls, and
insulting remarks."
A Riot of Sorts
It was at this time that the
name "pee-rade" began to take
on meaning. The students dis
graced Clark's front lawn and
marched to the Library where
further demonstrations were
held. They paraded around In
ner Quad and stopped in Memo
rial Court, where in 1908 the
Statue of the Stanfords was still
located. The statue provided an
excellent place for burning the
proclamation and making de

rogatory comments about the
Stanfords, Professor Clark, non
drinkers, and Stanford women.
Of course, all this frivolity
could not go unpunished. The
University suspended 41 stu
dents and added five units to
the graduation requirements of
36 others. Most students, how
ever, especially those who did
not get suspended, agreed that
the demonstration was worth
while. At least, the University
has not made any further at
tempts to regulate drinking on
campus.
Think of the 1908 Pee-Rade
the next time you travel to
Squaw Valley. You could be
leading demonstrations with a
real social significance.
