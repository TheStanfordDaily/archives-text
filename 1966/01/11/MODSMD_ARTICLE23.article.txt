## Our 'Architectural Heritage' 
### 
Editor, The Daily
I would like to add a few com
ments to what already seems to
be a unanimous voice denounc
ing our "architectural heritage."
In the first place, in this dec
ade alone, Stanford will prob
ably add 5 to 10 times as much
building space as it did in the
last 70 years. With these build
ings Stanford could have set a
whole new architectural tradi
tion, leaving the Quad as a mon
ument to the 1890's. While the
Quad's Richardson Romanesque
is a fine example of its time,
one must remember that some
periods are not worth imitating.
And besides, its imitations here
could only be called abortive, at
best.
Let's face it, Stanford is as
ugly as a dirt road border town,
with none of the picturesque
quaintness. Walking down the
magnificent asphalt paths stun
ningly bordered in dirt and
brownstone, one can't help but
feel something might be sal
vaged if there were a better
utilization and landscaping of
the space between the barren
buildings.
However, in its usual way,
Stanford has risen to the occa
sion and fallen far short of
greatness. It has substituted pe
dantic repetition for imagina
tion and polemic rationalizations
for creativity. Until Stanford de
cides to be a leader and an inno
vator instead of a follower and
an imitator, it stands little
chance of solving its architectual
problems, much less its more Im
portant academic ones.

• Beal Rebutted
Editor, The Daily:
If Professor Charles A. Beal's
letter of Jan. 6 is meant to be
a defense of "conventional sex
mores" it must be termed inade
quate. He states that there are
"sound medical arguments for
chastity" but chooses, evidently,
not to state them and produces
in their stead only some rather
weak and muddled arguments.
The argument that if a man
really loves a woman he will
wait until after marriage to
make love to her will only seem
persuasive to those who have
already accepted Professor
Beal's conclusion, i.e. that "real
love" respects the conventional
view—sex only after marriage.
The second argument, that the
premarital sex partners might
find each other incompatible
seems actually to lead away
from the conclusion that Pro
fesor Beal wants to draw. It is
certainly easier on both parties
if they discover this incompati
bility before going through all
the social and legal involve
ments of a wedding than after.
When Professor Beal says
that the woman might suffer
guilt feelings and thus invalidate
this premartial "test of compati
bility" he is probably right, but
this hardly shows that premar
tial sex is wrong. It is absurd

to think that all premartial sex
need be engaged in as a "test
of compatibility." Sex is an out
growth of love and when pre
martial sex occurs in this way
the question of compatibility has
already been decided.
Professor Beal's final argu
ment is that one can not offer
as a reason for engaging in pre
martial sex the supposed fact
that sexual satisfaction will be
increased after marriage. But
even if this is true it only shows

premartial sex to be wrong if
performed for this reason. And
I have already agreed to this on
other grounds. Sex should he an
outgrowth of love.
Professor Beal offers argu
ments only against the most mi
nor and unconvincing arguments
in favor of sexual freedom.
Against the most important ar
gument in its favor, that sex is
a natural outgrowth of love and
a pleasurable activity, he says
nothing.
