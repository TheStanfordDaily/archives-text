# FBI Counterspy To Talk
## 
### 
Mrs. Marion Miller, an F. 8.1, coun
terspy, will speak this afternoon at
4:15 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
This quarter's AWS Guest-in-resi
dence, Mrs. Miller and her husband
Paul served the government as mem
bers of the American Communist
Party in Los Angeles from 1950 to
1955.
The FBI first enlisted the service of
Mrs. Miller when she reported a com
munist-front organization operating
in the Los Angeles area to them. Her
husband also volunteered to join the
Communist underground to learn its
inner workings.
Threats and Pressures
For five years the couple carried on
their espionage work, although they

received "no financial compensation
and many threats to themselves and
pressures on their children.
For her service to her country, Mrs.
Miller has received many awards and
medals for patriotism and bravery, in
cluding personal commendations from
President Eisenhower and J. Edgar
Hoover.
But this acclaim came with a high
price. After her appearance before the
Subversive Activities Control Board in
Washington, D. C., Communists flood
ed her neighborhood with a "newslet
ter" castigating her "informer" role.
Slander Letter
The letter contained no reference to
the Communist Party, nor to her serv

ice to the F. 8.1. When close friends
and neighbors failed to understand the
nature of this letter, the Millers agreed
to tell the Los Angeles Examiner their
story.
In addition to her Dinkelspiel lecture
on "My Days as a Counterspy," Mrs.
Miller Will discuss "Communism—lts
Effects on American Youth" in the
Magnolia (Lagunita) Lounge after
dinner tonight.
As a dinner guest at Branner Wed
nesday, she will speak on governmen
tal investigation of subversive organi
zations. She will conclude her visit
with an address on "What It Means to
Love Your Country—True Patriotism"
at Alondra (Florence Moore) Thurs
day evening.


Mrs. Marion Miller
