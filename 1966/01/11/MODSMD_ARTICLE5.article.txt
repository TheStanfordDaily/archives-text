# POLICY CHANGE
## Free Computer Time Cut 
### 
A recent change in government pol
icy has eliminated free use of compu
ter time at the Stanford Computation
Center.
In the past, the government, the
Center's chief supporter, has been
paying for more computer time than
it has actually been using. The Cen

ter has been allocating the extra time
to "unsponsoral users" whose compu
ter time is not paid for by an outside
agency. Many faculty members en
gaged in research and grad students
working on their dissertations are in
this category.
Government auditors and university

controllers have just finished a study
of the finances of the Computation
Center. The auditors announced that
henceforth the government will only
pay for the time that it actually uses.
Unsponsored users no longer will
have access to free computer time.
Outside Agencies Unaffected
Computer time used for student in
struction and time paid for by outside
agencies, such as the Ford Founda
tion, will probably not be affected by
the change in policy.
Prof. Edward Fcigenbaum, director
of the Center, said that "the Center
deplores this situation," but that the
problem is now also occurring at every
other university with computer facili
ties. The result is widespread conster
nation among graduate students, and
nationwide concern by computer sci
entists because of the loss of computer
time for needy users. Prof. Feigen
baum termed the situation "a national
scandal."
The University is taking immediate
measures to raise funds to support
computer research. The Center has
already received $25,000 from Stan
ford's general fund. However, with
the high cost of computer time, this
is not nearly enough.
Urpes Protest
Prof. Feigenbaum suggested that
grad students with pressing needs
should go to their department heads
or school deans to request any other
available funds. He also suggested
that any student wishing to seriously
protest the government auditors' deci
sion might send a letter to President
Johnson or his Congressman.
