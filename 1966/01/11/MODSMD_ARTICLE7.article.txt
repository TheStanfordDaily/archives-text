# Squaw Valley Houses Indoor, Outdoor Blasts
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
With used tow tickets dangling for
lornly fmm their parkas, some 800
tired skiers returned to their classes
yesterday.
Skis, long underwear, boots, poles,
and stretched-out stretch pants were
stored away as Winter Carnival 1966
became a weekend that was. The an
nual affair was held last Friday
through Sunday at Squaw Valley's
Olympic Village.
760 ski club members registered for
two nights' lodging, two breakfasts,
dinner and entertainment Saturday
night. Approximately 50 other Stan
ford skiers stayed elsewhere, but
joined in many of the carnival festivi
ties.
Co«><l Housing:
Loaded in cars and four chartered
buses, ski-toting enthusiasts poured
into Squaw all day Friday. One of the
first tilings new carnival goers dis
covered was the coed housing situa
tion.
"I was panic-stricken when I went
to take a shower and heard boys'
voices in the hall," stated one Fresh
man maiden, "but after I got used to
it, it was great!" "The only way to live

—they ought to try it in the dorms!"
declared one Wilburite.
Though few lodgers admitted get
ting much sleep, most agreed that hav
ing girls' and boys' rooms in the same
part of the chalet added greatly to the
informal atmosphere of the weekend
and provided partners for days on the
slopes.
Poor Conditions
A sudden rain storm last Wednesday
and high winds made snow conditions
less than desirable. Many of the chair
lifts at Squaw Valley were closed until
Saturday afternoon because of the
hazardous wind gusts. These adversi
ties failed to discourage most skiers,
however, as they flocked to the open
runs.
"The snow was terrible, and I fell
down a lot, but it was the greatest
weekend I've ever spent,'' summed up
one slightly bruised beginner. "K.T.-
22 is nothing but a legend, even when
it is icey," explained another, newly
confident, goggled expert.
Other daytime activities included
the tauted beer slalom in which racers
were required to chug a can of beer
per gate, a giant slalom for experi

enced skiers interested in trying out
for the Stanford ski team, ice skating,
swimming in the heated pool, and to
boggoning.
Evening Recreation
Evening recreation was not lacking
with the Invaders playing for Friday
night's dance, and"The Coasters" of
"Poison Ivy" fame featured with "The
Ethix" on Saturday.
" 'The Coasters' were wasted, hut I
thought the dances were cool because
they were so hang loose," one socialite
evaluated.
Vandalism
Ski Club officers termed the week
end a success with surprisingly few
injuries. The only criticism they had
of the Stanford group was the van
dalism that occurred in some cha
teaux. "Windows were kicked in, one
room was shovelled full of snow, and
light bulbs were snatched Pranks like
that don't help Stanford's reputation
too much," a Ski Club Ex. Comm
member said
Stiff, red nosed skiers traded their
Sea and Ski for Bon Gay and dusted
off the books with sighs of "back to
reality" as the weekend extension to
Christmas vacation ended.
