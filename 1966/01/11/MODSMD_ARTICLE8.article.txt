# Sterling Will Probe 'State Of University'
## 
### 
In his annual convocation speech
today, Stanford President Wallace
Sterling will discuss the problem of
maintaining internal university cohe
sion under the pressure of external
involvement.
This "State of the University" ad
dress will begin at 11 a.m. in Memo
rial Auditorium. The registrar's office
has announced that all undergraduate
classes scheduled at that time have
been cancelled for the convocation.
Graduate classes will be dismissed at
the discretion of the instructor.
Robert Wilhelm, chairman of the
convocation, said at least 45 houses
would hold special dinner and discus
sion programs tonight to discuss the

President's speech and general ques
tions about the University with facul
ty and staff members.
After Dinner Talks
Wilhelm said students in houses not
involved in the discussion program
could attend the after-dinner talks in
other houses.
Presidents of participating houses
will attend a special luncheon with
President Sterling immediately after
the convocation. This luncheon is
sponsored by the Stanford Associates,
an alumni group.
Last year the convocation, annually
sponsored by Stanford Today and To
