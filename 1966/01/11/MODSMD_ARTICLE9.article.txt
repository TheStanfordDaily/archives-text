# Critic Relates Birth Of Jazz
## 
### GORDON STRAUSS 
Charlie Parker and his influence on
contemporary jazz was the central
topic of yesterday's Jazz Year lecture
by Ralph J. Gleason. He was intro
duced by Stanford Jazz Year director
Richard Bale, who prefaced his intro
duction with the announcement that
tickets for the Thelonious Monk-John
Coltrano concert were sold out.
Following the statement that mod
ern jazz first came into existence with
Charlie Parker, Gleason proceeded to
explain how and why modern jazz
evolved.
"From 1930 to 1945 the big bands
were popular," he commented, "and
the jazz which they played was pri
marily dance music with it 4/4 time
and the drummer emphasizing the
second and fourth beats so the people
would know when to move their feet.
Solos were not unheard of, but they
had to be kept within the framework
of the melody."
Hard Times
According to Gleason, those musi
cians who wanted to improvise and
experiment were forced to join small
groups and play where ever they
could find someone to hire them.
"Dizzy Gillespie was fired from one
big band during this time," Gleason
grinned," for playing what the leader
called 'the wrong notes.'" Gleason
compared Parker's influence on mod
ern jazz to that of Louis Armstrong
on swing jazz.
Gleason mentioned that one of the
most important steps in creating a
new kind of jazz was "to make the
bass player, rather than the drummer,
the custodian of the main beat."
"When Gillespie had his own band,
he did a lot of the arranging, and be
cause he was a trumpeter, he often
gave the brass sections many long and
difficult parts. After three or four
numbers their lips would get tired
but because it was a dance band, they
couldn't just stop playing. In order to
let the brass section rest, the rhythm
section (piano ( bass, vibes, and
drums) began doing numbers by
themselves.
"John Lewis was Gillespie's piano
player, and the original Modern Jazz
Quartet was simply the rhythm sec
tion from Gillespie's band."
