Counterfeit Christians
All that glitters is not gold, all that sounds good is not the truth. No prankish
imp with horns and long tail, the god of this world is a master of deceit and
an angel of light. Jesus Christ called the devil "Hie father of lies" and "a
murderer from the beginning" (Joh 8:44). The arch fiend of history counterfeits
truth and duplicates doctrine, with cunning skill enslaving men's minds today
as he always has.
The strongest words of warning found anywhere in Holy Scripture are di
rected towards counterfeit. Christians ond false teachers, who say they're
sound, but aren't. Jesus Christ said, "Beware of false prophets, who come to
you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them
by their fruits'' {Matthew 6:15). And Peter, the Apostle, writes, "... many
will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be
reviled. And in their greed .they will exploit you with false words; from of
old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been
asleep . . . these are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm; for them
the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved forever . . . they promise free
dom but are themselves slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man,
to that he is enslaved" (2 Peter 2), Christ's servant, Jude, calls false teachers,
"ungodly persons who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and
deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" (Jude 4).
To set the record straight, a Christian is someone who has met Jesus
Christ personally and received Him as Lord. Scholarly, learned, theological
Nicodemus was told by Jesus Christ, "Unless a man is born again (born
spiritually, regenerated), he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3). Counter
feit Christians are a dime a dozen, and false teachers flood the market. But
why buy goods that never fit swallow patent medicine that can not cure.
God is available today. He is neither dead nor remote. You may go to Him
directly, non-stop, in faith and prayer to find out for yourself. You ought not
even to take our word for it, it's your life that matters most. "He who believes
in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has the testimony within himself . . . and this
is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life and this life is in his Son. He
who has the Son has life, he who has not the Son of God has not life" (I John
5:10-12).

Counterfeit Christians
All that glitters is not gold, all that sounds good is not the truth. No prankish
imp with horns and long tail, the god of this world is a master of deceit and
an angel of light. Jesus Christ called the devil "Hie father of lies" and "a
murderer from the beginning" (Joh 8:44). The arch fiend of history counterfeits
truth and duplicates doctrine, with cunning skill enslaving men's minds today
as he always has.
The strongest words of warning found anywhere in Holy Scripture are di
rected towards counterfeit. Christians ond false teachers, who say they're
sound, but aren't. Jesus Christ said, "Beware of false prophets, who come to
you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them
by their fruits'' {Matthew 6:15). And Peter, the Apostle, writes, "... many
will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be
reviled. And in their greed .they will exploit you with false words; from of
old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been
asleep . . . these are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm; for them
the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved forever . . . they promise free
dom but are themselves slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man,
to that he is enslaved" (2 Peter 2), Christ's servant, Jude, calls false teachers,
"ungodly persons who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and
deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" (Jude 4).
To set the record straight, a Christian is someone who has met Jesus
Christ personally and received Him as Lord. Scholarly, learned, theological
Nicodemus was told by Jesus Christ, "Unless a man is born again (born
spiritually, regenerated), he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3). Counter
feit Christians are a dime a dozen, and false teachers flood the market. But
why buy goods that never fit swallow patent medicine that can not cure.
God is available today. He is neither dead nor remote. You may go to Him
directly, non-stop, in faith and prayer to find out for yourself. You ought not
even to take our word for it, it's your life that matters most. "He who believes
in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has the testimony within himself . . . and this
is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life and this life is in his Son. He
who has the Son has life, he who has not the Son of God has not life" (I John
5:10-12).
