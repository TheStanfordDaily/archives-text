Wallace Sterling has been
President of Stanford University
for the last 16 of his 59 years.
During those years, it is said
(and fact bears out the legend)
Stanford moved slowly but sure
ly from the brink of certain fis
cal disaster to the precarious
edge of academic greatness on
which she seems to be tottering
today.
Even Sterling's most vocal de
tractors (and there are some)
admit a casual relationship;
through a hard-headed drive for
bigger b u il d in g sand better
brains, Stanford's fifth President
has pulled the university up by
its bootstraps into the clear, calm
air of prosperity and prestige.
Like Tycoon Stanford
It is difficult—though certain

ly not impossible — to quarrel
with such success; and Sterling's
achievement, clearly measured
in dollars and cents, has gar
nered a fair share of unmitigat
ed praise and/or grudging ad
miration.
Time Magazine's back-handed
judo of November 9, 1962, is typ
cal, in its evaluation if not in its
irreverence: "What has largely
saved Stanford is its fifth Presi
dent; J. E. Wallace Sterling...
a Canadian-born historian who
looks like a heavyweight Jimmy
Durante, sounds like Edward R.
Murrow, and thinks like Tycoon
Stanford...."
Sterling was appointed to the
Stanford presidency on Novem
ber 19, 1949, to succeed Donald
B. Tresidder, who had died sud
denly some nine months previ
ous at the age of 53. Reportedly,
his selection was in part the re
sult of the Trustees' determina
tion to act in deference to the
faculty, who for some time had
been demanding a man of aca
demic orientation at the Stan
ford helm.
Chautauqua Show
The son of an admittedly im
poverished Methodist minister,
Sterling worked his way
through the University of Toron
to—pitching hay, stringing tele
phone lines, working construc
tion, selling furniture polish and,
at one point, so the story goes,
serving as advance man for a
Chautauqua show.
After a brief flirtation with
professional coaching, cut short
by depression economics, Ster
ling and his wife Ann migrate' l

to California, and Stanford,
where he worked as a research
assistant in Hoover Tower and
taught Western Civilization. He
received his Ph.D. in 1938.
Later in his career, Sterling
rose to an endowed professor
ship at the California Institute
of Technology, where he also
demonstrated considerable ad
ministrative ability. At the time
of his appointment, he was Di
rector of the Huntington Li
brary and Art Galley in San Ma
rino, California.
It All Adds Up
Evident implicit in extant Dail
ies from the period suggests that
Stanford, at the time of Ster
ling's inauguration in 1949, was
immeasurably less turbulent and
less academic than its present
day counterpart—indeed almost
pastoral in mood. If Sterling was
the man to change all this, it
was not manifest in his initial
statements, which were, at least,
benign in character.
A Daily of November, 1948,
recorded the president-elect's
comments after witnessing Stan
ford in a losing Big Game effort:
"Spirit has a great deal to do
with winning, in athletic games
or in life.... And Stanford has
a spirit that gets into your
blood. You know, I don't think
I've ever seen it adequately de
scribed in print, but you know
what it is—the family-like living,
the Honor Code, the friendly fac
ulty-student relations, and the
democratic student government
—well, it all adds up to Stan
ford."
What didn't add up to Stan
ford, or anything else for that
matter, were the institution's fi
nances; and Sterling began to
organize his forces. Some years
later, in a 1960 interview for the
Saturday Evening Post, he sum
marized his approach with ad
mirable frankness: "The first
year after I came back (to as
sume the presidency) I didn't
know what it was all about....
Then I realized that what you
need to a get a university roll
ing is dollars, and the way to
attract dollars is to get some
shows going...."
Those in the know indicate
that a "show" is administration
slang for a research project of
impressive scholarship — and,
hopefully, prize-winning results
and donation-drawing publicity.
In any case, under Sterling's
leadership, augmented by the
imagination and initiative of
some of his more energetic asso
ciates, the "shows" have been
many and successful.
A Few Statistics
A few statistics are impres
sive in this regard: The last dec
ade and a half at Stanford has
seen the creation of undergradu
ate campuses in France, Italy,
and Germany; construction of a
$21 million Medical Center; and
the start of a $114 million two
mile linear accelerator (SLAC).
Professorial ranks have dou
bled since 1949, while enroll
ment, now stabilized near the
10,000 mark, has risen by about
2,000 — mainly at the graduate
level.
Private gifts to the university
have totaled nearly $200 million
since 1949, with the capstone
achievement coming last Decem
ber: Stanford went over the top
(three months ahead of sched
ule) in its PACE (a Plan of Ac
tion for a Challenging Era)
Fund-Raising drive, garnering
over $75 million in matching
money for an unprecedented $25
million grant from the Ford
Foundation.
The Physical Toll
Fifteen years of feverish activ
ity as Stanford's First Salesman
have left their scars. The physi
cal toll is evident in Sterling's
hulking frame; he has aged mea
surably in his job.
Neither has his public image
entirely escaped the onslaughts
of time. It is axiomatic that
great men are greatly criticized,
and, in 1964, the chinks in the
presidential armor seem all too
apparent to a few.
In stature (6'2", 215 lbs.), and
in authority, S t e r 1 ing is a
dominant figure; and Stanford's
last decade has been peculiarly
his own.
His decisions are by no means
solitary (for, as we are told,

"The University is run by dis
cussion") but neither do they
seem to be debatable.
His personal firmness (occa
sionally referred to more strong
ly as stubbornness) and his pref
erence for "gradualism" have in
evitably moulded the administra
tive process in his own image.
Immovable Object
In a Saturday Evening Post
article of 1962, one unnamed ad
ministrative official is credited
with the following evaluation:
"He seems to use his size to be
gentle, but if he thinks you are
wrong, he can be the most mon
olithic, immovable object you
can encounter. He put me in my
place with his little lecture on
gradualism, which is the art of
doing easily tomorrow what
could be done today only over
a dead body."
An anonymous faculty mem
ber, quoted in an article from
the January 13, 1964 issue of the
San Jose News, commented in
like terms: "Wally is unpredict
able. ... He will listen to all the
advice without committing him
self, then do it is own unortho
dox way."
Periferally, it might be added
that both evaluations end with
the sentiment that "... the most
unfair thing he does is to be
right most of the time."
Quite obviously, no adminis
tration is a one man affair. On
the other hand, Stanford's ad
ministrative structure is clearly
built by and around its mam
moth chief executive.
In recent years especially, the
resultant over-centralization of
authority (and the ambiguities,
inefficiences, and even inequi
ties, that such centralization
may occasion) have invited spo
radic but serious criticisms
which to date have seemingly
gone unanswered.
An Ordinary Guy
Sterling's personal qualities
and unfortunately the limita
tions of time and opportunity
deny most students access to
these qualities are reportedly
those of great charm and hu
mour. Typical evaluations of the
man stress his "complete lack of
pretense"—"the least pompous
president who ever wore a cap
and gown."
Indeed, Sterling once defined
himself in the phrase "I'm just
an ordinary guy." (Time, No
vember 29, 1948.)
Undeniably, however, there
are those who rather resent "or
dinariness"—and its implied de
nial of egg-headedness—in the
president of an academic institu
tion. These detractors often aim
their barbs at the aphorisms
which not infrequently creep
into Sterling's otherwise grand
eloquent public oratory.
A case in point is Sterling's
favorite and oft' quoted maxim:
"If a man isn't something of a
radical when he's 20, there's
something wrong with his heart.
If he isn't something of a con
servative at 40, there's some

thing wrong with his head...
In at least one juncture, Ster
ling is rumoured to have said
that his philosophy of education
"was not to have a philosophy
of education."
This remark, or rather, the
suspicion that such a remark
might represent the President's
view, has occasioned a continu
um of disconcerted rumblings—
emanating primarily from a vo
cal student minority.
Arrogant, I'm Afraid
Criticism from the student
side of the university fence has
not gone unnoticed or even unre
turned. Witness a fairly recent
interview with the San Jose
News during which Sterling
capped an otherwise lauditory
estimate of the current student
generation with the observation,
"But they're all so rebellious
and, I'm afraid, somewhat arro
gant They're also in such a
hurry...
Sterling's speed to the Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow as
sembly last winter was appar
ently an attempt at a more seri
ous rebuttal. He spoke at length
of his philosophy of the role of
the university in a changing so
city, stressing what he considers
to be the crucial social contest
between the forces of individual
ism and organization.
According to Sterling, the
most pressing challenge facing
modern society revolves around
the effective harnessing of com
plexity—complexity which tends
to overwhelm and stereotype hu
man efforts.
Several months after his ST&T
speech, in March, Sterling under
went major surgery to correct
a chronic abdominal condition
which had disabled him periodi
cally throughout the year.
Predictably, his illness precipi
tated some incautious rumours
to the effect that his retirement
was imminent. Rumour was met
with official, emphatic, even im
passioned, denial.
And, in fact, Sterling has not
retired.
He has recuperated, recovered,
and "recharged his battery";
and the beginning of this Fall
Quarter sees him returned to
active duty.
1976
Barring catastrophe, the nor
mal age for the retirement of
university presidents is 70. That
would put the end of the Ster
ling Era at 1976.
The primary values of that era
are already apparent. "Gradual
ism," plus guts, has been profit
able, in both material and hu
man terms.
And profit is not to be ignored.
Thus, it does not seem unrea
sonable to suggest that Stan
ford will continue, pursuing
such goals, in such manner, as
she has for the past 15 years.
In any case, power once as
sumed is not easily laid aside;
and, so far, neither Sterling nor
the Trustees seem eager that it
should be.
