# Millers Describe Communists As Counterspies See Them
## 
### LINDSAY MERRYMAN 
Yesterday afternoon in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, an audience of
200, possibly expecting a James
Bond tale of espionage, were
told by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mil
ler that anyone can be a spy,
under the right circumstances.
Mr. Miller, who like his wife,
is a former FBI counterspy, be
gan with a half hour of back
ground facts. A poster artist
himself, he first was approached
by Communists before World
War II to "be a leader when the
time came."
He accepted, as did his wife
later, with the sole purpose of
acting as FBI undercover
agent. As an organizational sec
retary, he learned much. "You
good people don't know what
hate is. unless you're Commu
nist," he commented.
When he met his wife they
both moved to Los Angeles.
"But," said Miller, "fate had
other things in store for us."
Mrs. Miller was eontartod by a

suspicious sounding Committee
for the Protection of F or e i g n
Born Citizens."
Mrs. Miller joined for the
FBI because "the death of a
neighborhood boy seemed to
make immediate the problem of
Communism." Said Miller: "We
know. The Communists want to
infiltrate everywhere." .He also
said that Communism is "part
of an international criminal con
spiracy that plans to take over
the world."
