# Frosh Swimmers Boiling Over
## Daily Sports 
### Wells Shoemaker 
The hottest group of swim
mers ever to hit the Encina
Pools at one time, Stanford's
freshman team, opens its season
this Saturday afternoon against
the San Jose State frosh.
The Papooses, with world rec
ord holders Dick Roth and Luis
Nieolao and High School All-
Americans in some 24 events,
have "national" written all over
them. s
The frosh have a powerhouse
in every event. Most notable is
the 200 individual medley event
where the freshmen had 100 hon
ors in the All-American listings
â€”with the number 1, 2, 3, and 5
men in the country.
Both Olympic Champ
Dick Roth set the world 400
meter individual medley record
when he won the Olympics in
1964. Roth, who was named
"World Swimmer of 1965" by

Swimming World magazine, has
made high school All-American
sometime in his high school ca
reer in every event except the
50 freestyle, the medley relay,
and diving.
Roth won the 400 meters in
dividual medley at the World
Student Games in Budapest last
summer, and just recently won
the same event at the Hall of
Fame International swimming
meet in Fort Lauderdale. His
3:49.3 for 400 freestyle topped
the high schools in the county
last year.
Luis Nieolao has recorded the
world's fastest time for 100 me
ters butterfly. Nieolao was both
indoor and outdoor AAU 100 fly
champ last year.
Nieolao, a native of Argentina,
won both the 100 and 200 meters
butterfly at the Hall of Fame
meet, beating Olympic champion
Kevin Berry of Australia.

Nieolao, who was the high
scorer on the frosh water polo
team last season, specializes in
butterfly, but handles each of
the other strokes with equal
alacrity.
Siebert All-Around Threat
Pete Siebert, a graduate of
Palo Alto high school, was an
All-American in the 100 yards

backstroke, 100 butterfly, 200 in
dividual medley, and both free
style and medley relays. Siebert
was second in the butterfly
(52.9), and third in the individ
ual medley (2:01.4).
Siebert, who was the freshman
water polo team captain last

fall, looms as a threat no matter
where he swims.
Morgan Manning made All-
American honors in the individ
ual medley, the 100 freestyle and
the 400 freestyle at Arcadia High
School last year. Manning tied
for the nation's top honor in the
100 with a 47.8 performance.
Bob Hart, currently down with
mononuncleosis, will boost the
frosh when he returns. Hart was
second in the country in the 200
IM at 2:00.5, .2 second behind
Roth. His All-American 55.1
backstroke time is far below the
existing freshman records.
Hart made All-American selec
tion in the 400 freestyle as well
as the 200 freestyle relay.
Quick Sprinters
Phil Brown's 21.9 freestyle
performance earned him fourth
place All-American honors last
year. Brown also placed highly
among the All-Americans in the
100 freestyle sprint.
Jeff Hammett also was among
the county's top All-American
100 freestylers last year. Ham
mett, Brown, and Manning
should put quite a zip into the
Indian sprints this season.

Paul Meyer joins a quick field
of 200 freestylers as a 1965 All-
American.
Steve Falus has already dem
onstrated his ability to handle
the 200 breaststroke event. Falus
may give Bob Momsen's 2:20
freshman record a hard push
this season.
Tom Jamison will give the
Tribe an added boost in the mid
dle distance freestyle events.
Kee Key Performer
Bill Kee beat the existing
Stanford frosh record for 100
backstroke loading off the med
ley relay at the Varsity-Frosh
meet last fall. Kee could develop
into a potent Indian swimmer
swimming contrary to the cus
tomary bottoms-up attitude.
With this impressive array of
talent to work with, and with
the bright prospects of this
year's varsity, Coach Jim Gaugh
ran can look forward to sunny
days in the Encina Pool.
Freshmen cannot compete in
the NCAA championships, but it
is probable that Stanford will
send a team to the Indoor AAU's
this spring.
