# NCAA Reapproves 2-Platoon Football
## 
### 
Unlimited substitution received
a pat on the back while the Uni
versity of Houston got a kick in
the pants at the 60th annual con
vention of the National Colle
giate Athletic Association being
held in Washington this week.
Although only 24 of the 3,000
delegates present voted on the
matter, New Mexico University's

proposal to return to one-pla
toon football was decisively de
feated.
A key committee of the Amer
ican Football Coaches Associa
tion voted 23-1 that no major
changes should be made in the
1965 regulations.
The only way the decision can
be reversed is for the Rules Com
mittee, which is a subsidiary of
the NCAA, to countermand the
decision at their meeting in New
Orleans next month.
Ex-Stanford coach Jack Cur
tice, who is head of the Rules
Committee, told a news confer
ence that he feels that unlimited
substitution has been well ac
cepted and a rule change is un
necessary for two or three years.
Houston Hurt
Houston was slapped severely
by the NCAA's Rules Infraction
Committee. The Texas school is
on three years probation for re
current disregard of accepted
NCAA recruiting, financial aid,
and football practice methods.
Houston will be bared from
appearing in post-season football
games or on NCAA-sponsored
television during the three year
probationary period.
Vice President Hubert Humph
rey attended the session until he
was called away to head the U.S.
delegation to New Delhi and In
dian Prime Minister Shastri's fu
neral.
