Five.members of the 1965
Stanford track team were select
ed as Ail-Americans in a recent
poll for their outstanding effort
throughout the '65 season.
Chosen to this select group
were Bob Stoecker in the discus
and Eric Frische, Dale Rubin,
Bob Mclntyre, and Larry Que
stad in the 440 relay. The latter
four set a world record in the
relay with a time of 39.7 seconds.
Last season the Cards finished
fourth in the AAWU in regular
conference meets, but finished
a disappointing 21st in the
NCAA tournament.
A highlight of this meet was
the outstanding performance of
Stoecker. He won first place
with a heave of 183-7%, his best
effort of the season.
The 440 relay team finished
sixth in the meet and Larry Que
stad, running the 100, also gar
nered a sixth place.
