# HEADQUARTERS HERE:
## 'Dialogue' Due In March 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A scholarly journal on Mormon
thought and culture will begin publi
cation here in March under the editor
ship of a Stanford professor and a
graduate student, working with a staff
of Stanford students.
Dialogue, A Journal of Mormon
Thought, billed as the only indepen
dent Mormon publication, is the brain
child of Eugene England, a graduate
student in English, and Wesley John
son. assistant professor of history.
England is from Salt Lake City and
Johnson from Arizona. Both young
men were born into the Mormon
church.
Besides holding the posts of co-man
aging editors of the new publication,
England and Johnson are founders of
Stanford's Dialogue Club, whose 25
members have been meeting since Oc
tober to explore "the relationship of
religion and culture."
The magazine's prospectus states
that the editors "desire to give expres
sion to the variety of Mormon cul
ture," particularly with a "spirited ex
change of opinion through editorials
and letters to the editors."
Dialogue, which has no connection

with Stanford University, will be pub
lished quarterly in Utah by the Dia
logue Foundation, Inc. A board of
editors, composed of 22 prominent
Mormons throughout the country, will
sponsor the operation.
Not 'Liberal/ But...
Although Dialogue is officially nei
ther a conservative nor a liberal jour
nal, it is one sign of restlessness
among liberal intellectuals of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (LDS). The church was found
ed 137 years ago by Joseph Smith,
who claimed to have received "Golden
Plates" from the angel Moroni, set
ting down some basic tenets of the
faith. Mormons considered Smith the
restorer of the true Gospel of Christ,
which was diluted after Christ's death.
Mormons do not consider themselves
Protestants.
The brochure introducing Dialogue,
which was mailed to 6,000 prominent
Mormons in November, says the mag
azine will "present voices that ask
faith to ground itself in reason ..
The Mormon church, headed by 92-
year-old president, David O. McKay,
whose word is religious law for
Saints, is a wealthy and fast-growing
institution with extensive realty, in
surance and journalistic holdings. Its
membership has increased 159 per
cent since 1940 through vigorous mis
sionary work here and abroad.
Discrimination
The LDS is one of the few religions
with an official policy of discrimina
tion against Negroes, who may join
the church but not become priests, or
church officers, as may all other male
members. It is estimated that only
about 200 of the 2.3 million Mormons
are Negroes.
Managing editor England stresses
that Dialogue, which is intended to
provide a variety of viewpoints, will
initially take no editorial stand on the
Negro issue. He mentioned, however,
that the second issue of Dialogue will
contain an article by a Morman branch
president describing his experiences
as a freedom rider.
The key goal of Dialogue is merely
to stimulate debate on all aspects of
Mormonism and Christianity. England
says that "One of the things we want
is a place where outside theologians
can enter into a discussion with those
in our church."
The first issue will demonstrate this

inter-faith dialogue with a book re
view by Stanford's Robert McAfce
Brown and a history of early Mor
monism by Mario DePhillis, both non-
Mormans.
"It is an advange both to us and
the church," England says.
Other articles in Dialogue, which
will strive for "the form and quality
of an academic journal with the inter
est and creativity of a feature maga
zine," will include:
• Assessments of Mormon culture
by Leonard Arrington, James Hazel
tine, George Boyd and others.
• A first-hand report on the White
House Fellows by Edward Firmage,
with special attention to his activities
in civil rights and anti-poverty
programs.
• A triple book review of Dr.
Sterling McMurrin's The Theo
logical Foundations of the Mor
mon Religion by Robert McAfee
Brown, Richard Anderson of
Brigham Young University and
David Bennett of the University
of Utah.
• A clinical psychologist's per
sonal explanation of the mean
ing of the Christian faith.
• Stanford history student
Philip Starr's debut in a section
called "Student Voices."
Drawings, illustrations and
other articles, essays and re
views will fill out the 120 pages
of the first Dialogue. Initial cir
culation will be 1,000 at a yearly
subscription rate of $6.
England says Dialogue is the
"first independent publication to
deal with Mormon thought that
we know about." The church it
self currently publishes Im
provement Era, its official or
gan, and Instructor, a scholarly
magazine designed for Mormon
teachers.
"It is an.advantage both to us
and the church," England says,
"to publish independently. In
structor has a specific purpose,
and does a fine job in its own
way."
Church 'Receptive'
Although there has been no
comment from church officials
on Dialogue's publication plans,
England believes the church is
"receptive" to the idea because
of subscription requests received
from top officials.
The LDS is tightly knit and
centralized with a rigorous dog

ma, but England thinks it is well
suited for the free discussion
Dialogue aims to provide. "One
of the church tenets is continual
revelation," he says. "Man's very
relation to God is a dialogue. In
this sense the church is very
open."
Advisory editors to the new
quarterly will be Dr. Lowell
Bennlon, a professor at the Uni
versity of Utah, and Dr. Leon
ard Arrington, an economic his
torian at Utah State University.
Both are respected intellectual
leaders of the liberal Mormon
element. The board of editors,
all described as "practicing Mor
mons," has seven members from
Utah, which is the historical and
geographic center of Brigham
Young's church. Dow Woodward
of Stanford's Biochemistry De
partment is a board member.
The Stanford-based staff of
Dialogue, drawn partly from the
Dialogue club, includes Frances
Menlove, manuscripts editor; Jo
seph Jeppson, notes and com
ments editor; Paul Salisbury,
publication editor; Edward
Geary, copy editor; Ralph Han
sen, assistant book review edi
tor; Clayne Robison, financial
coordinator; Robert Griffin,
Kenneth Handley, James Mar
shall and Sterling Sessions, fi
nancial committee.
Also, Mary L. Bradford, Shir
ley Griffin, Nancy Lund, Ralph
Pringle, Kent .Robson, Brent
Rushford, George A. Smith 111,
Phillip Smith and Ann Vest, edi
torial associates; and Carol Gar
rick, Lani Midgley, Bonnie Nib
ley, Margot Noall, Christie Red
ford, Ellen Robson and Gay
Parker, editorial assistants.

of the first Dialogue. Initial cir
culation will be 1,000 at a yearly
subscription rate of $6.
England says Dialogue is the
"first independent publication to
deal with Mormon thought that
we know about." The church it
self currently publishes Im
provement Era, its official or
gan, and Instructor, a scholarly
magazine designed for Mormon
teachers.
"It is an.advantage both to us
and the church," England says,
"to publish independently. In
structor has a specific purpose,
and does a fine job in its own
way."
Church 'Receptive'
Although there has been no
comment from church officials
on Dialogue's publication plans,
England believes the church is
"receptive" to the idea because
of subscription requests received
from top officials.
The LDS is tightly knit and
centralized with a rigorous dog

ma, but England thinks it is well
suited for the free discussion
Dialogue aims to provide. "One
of the church tenets is continual
revelation," he says. "Man's very
relation to God is a dialogue. In
this sense the church is very
open."
Advisory editors to the new
quarterly will be Dr. Lowell
Bennlon, a professor at the Uni
versity of Utah, and Dr. Leon
ard Arrington, an economic his
torian at Utah State University.
Both are respected intellectual
leaders of the liberal Mormon
element. The board of editors,
all described as "practicing Mor
mons," has seven members from
Utah, which is the historical and
geographic center of Brigham
Young's church. Dow Woodward
of Stanford's Biochemistry De
partment is a board member.
The Stanford-based staff of
Dialogue, drawn partly from the
Dialogue club, includes Frances
Menlove, manuscripts editor; Jo
seph Jeppson, notes and com
ments editor; Paul Salisbury,
publication editor; Edward
Geary, copy editor; Ralph Han
sen, assistant book review edi
tor; Clayne Robison, financial
coordinator; Robert Griffin,
Kenneth Handley, James Mar
shall and Sterling Sessions, fi
nancial committee.
Also, Mary L. Bradford, Shir
ley Griffin, Nancy Lund, Ralph
Pringle, Kent .Robson, Brent
Rushford, George A. Smith 111,
Phillip Smith and Ann Vest, edi
torial associates; and Carol Gar
rick, Lani Midgley, Bonnie Nib
ley, Margot Noall, Christie Red
ford, Ellen Robson and Gay
Parker, editorial assistants.
A scholarly journal on Mormon
thought and culture will begin publi
cation here in March under the editor
ship of a Stanford professor and a
graduate student, working with a staff
of Stanford students.
Dialogue, A Journal of Mormon
Thought, billed as the only indepen
dent Mormon publication, is the brain
child of Eugene England, a graduate
student in English, and Wesley John
son. assistant professor of history.
England is from Salt Lake City and
Johnson from Arizona. Both young
men were born into the Mormon
church.
Besides holding the posts of co-man
aging editors of the new publication,
England and Johnson are founders of
Stanford's Dialogue Club, whose 25
members have been meeting since Oc
tober to explore "the relationship of
religion and culture."
The magazine's prospectus states
that the editors "desire to give expres
sion to the variety of Mormon cul
ture," particularly with a "spirited ex
change of opinion through editorials
and letters to the editors."
Dialogue, which has no connection

with Stanford University, will be pub
lished quarterly in Utah by the Dia
logue Foundation, Inc. A board of
editors, composed of 22 prominent
Mormons throughout the country, will
sponsor the operation.
Not 'Liberal/ But...
Although Dialogue is officially nei
ther a conservative nor a liberal jour
nal, it is one sign of restlessness
among liberal intellectuals of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (LDS). The church was found
ed 137 years ago by Joseph Smith,
who claimed to have received "Golden
Plates" from the angel Moroni, set
ting down some basic tenets of the
faith. Mormons considered Smith the
restorer of the true Gospel of Christ,
which was diluted after Christ's death.
Mormons do not consider themselves
Protestants.
The brochure introducing Dialogue,
which was mailed to 6,000 prominent
Mormons in November, says the mag
azine will "present voices that ask
faith to ground itself in reason ..
The Mormon church, headed by 92-
year-old president, David O. McKay,
whose word is religious law for
Saints, is a wealthy and fast-growing
institution with extensive realty, in
surance and journalistic holdings. Its
membership has increased 159 per
cent since 1940 through vigorous mis
sionary work here and abroad.
Discrimination
The LDS is one of the few religions
with an official policy of discrimina
tion against Negroes, who may join
the church but not become priests, or
church officers, as may all other male
members. It is estimated that only
about 200 of the 2.3 million Mormons
are Negroes.
Managing editor England stresses
that Dialogue, which is intended to
provide a variety of viewpoints, will
initially take no editorial stand on the
Negro issue. He mentioned, however,
that the second issue of Dialogue will
contain an article by a Morman branch
president describing his experiences
as a freedom rider.
The key goal of Dialogue is merely
to stimulate debate on all aspects of
Mormonism and Christianity. England
says that "One of the things we want
is a place where outside theologians
can enter into a discussion with those
in our church."
The first issue will demonstrate this

inter-faith dialogue with a book re
view by Stanford's Robert McAfce
Brown and a history of early Mor
monism by Mario DePhillis, both non-
Mormans.
"It is an advange both to us and
the church," England says.
Other articles in Dialogue, which
will strive for "the form and quality
of an academic journal with the inter
est and creativity of a feature maga
zine," will include:
• Assessments of Mormon culture
by Leonard Arrington, James Hazel
tine, George Boyd and others.
• A first-hand report on the White
House Fellows by Edward Firmage,
with special attention to his activities
in civil rights and anti-poverty
programs.
• A triple book review of Dr.
Sterling McMurrin's The Theo
logical Foundations of the Mor
mon Religion by Robert McAfee
Brown, Richard Anderson of
Brigham Young University and
David Bennett of the University
of Utah.
• A clinical psychologist's per
sonal explanation of the mean
ing of the Christian faith.
• Stanford history student
Philip Starr's debut in a section
called "Student Voices."
Drawings, illustrations and
other articles, essays and re
views will fill out the 120 pages

culation will be 1,000 at a yearly
subscription rate of $6.

Although there has been no
comment from church officials
on Dialogue's publication plans,
England believes the church is
"receptive" to the idea because
of subscription requests received
from top officials.
The LDS is tightly knit and
centralized with a rigorous dog

ma, but England thinks it is well
suited for the free discussion
Dialogue aims to provide. "One
of the church tenets is continual
revelation," he says. "Man's very
relation to God is a dialogue. In
this sense the church is very
open."
Advisory editors to the new
quarterly will be Dr. Lowell
Bennlon, a professor at the Uni
versity of Utah, and Dr. Leon
ard Arrington, an economic his
torian at Utah State University.
Both are respected intellectual
leaders of the liberal Mormon
element. The board of editors,
all described as "practicing Mor
mons," has seven members from
Utah, which is the historical and
geographic center of Brigham
Young's church. Dow Woodward
of Stanford's Biochemistry De
partment is a board member.

A scholarly journal on Mormon
thought and culture will begin publi
cation here in March under the editor
ship of a Stanford professor and a
graduate student, working with a staff
of Stanford students.
Dialogue, A Journal of Mormon
Thought, billed as the only indepen
dent Mormon publication, is the brain
child of Eugene England, a graduate
student in English, and Wesley John
son. assistant professor of history.
England is from Salt Lake City and
Johnson from Arizona. Both young
men were born into the Mormon
church.
Besides holding the posts of co-man
aging editors of the new publication,
England and Johnson are founders of
Stanford's Dialogue Club, whose 25
members have been meeting since Oc
tober to explore "the relationship of
religion and culture."
The magazine's prospectus states
that the editors "desire to give expres
sion to the variety of Mormon cul
ture," particularly with a "spirited ex
change of opinion through editorials
and letters to the editors."
Dialogue, which has no connection

with Stanford University, will be pub
lished quarterly in Utah by the Dia
logue Foundation, Inc. A board of
editors, composed of 22 prominent
Mormons throughout the country, will
sponsor the operation.
Not 'Liberal/ But...
Although Dialogue is officially nei
ther a conservative nor a liberal jour
nal, it is one sign of restlessness
among liberal intellectuals of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (LDS). The church was found
ed 137 years ago by Joseph Smith,
who claimed to have received "Golden
Plates" from the angel Moroni, set
ting down some basic tenets of the
faith. Mormons considered Smith the
restorer of the true Gospel of Christ,
which was diluted after Christ's death.
Mormons do not consider themselves
Protestants.
The brochure introducing Dialogue,
which was mailed to 6,000 prominent
Mormons in November, says the mag
azine will "present voices that ask
faith to ground itself in reason ..
The Mormon church, headed by 92-
year-old president, David O. McKay,
whose word is religious law for
Saints, is a wealthy and fast-growing
institution with extensive realty, in
surance and journalistic holdings. Its
membership has increased 159 per
cent since 1940 through vigorous mis
sionary work here and abroad.
Discrimination
The LDS is one of the few religions
with an official policy of discrimina
tion against Negroes, who may join
the church but not become priests, or
church officers, as may all other male
members. It is estimated that only
about 200 of the 2.3 million Mormons
are Negroes.
Managing editor England stresses
that Dialogue, which is intended to
provide a variety of viewpoints, will
initially take no editorial stand on the
Negro issue. He mentioned, however,
that the second issue of Dialogue will
contain an article by a Morman branch
president describing his experiences
as a freedom rider.
The key goal of Dialogue is merely
to stimulate debate on all aspects of
Mormonism and Christianity. England
says that "One of the things we want
is a place where outside theologians
can enter into a discussion with those
in our church."
The first issue will demonstrate this

inter-faith dialogue with a book re
view by Stanford's Robert McAfce
Brown and a history of early Mor
monism by Mario DePhillis, both non-
Mormans.
"It is an advange both to us and
the church," England says.
Other articles in Dialogue, which
will strive for "the form and quality
of an academic journal with the inter
est and creativity of a feature maga
zine," will include:
• Assessments of Mormon culture
by Leonard Arrington, James Hazel
tine, George Boyd and others.
• A first-hand report on the White
House Fellows by Edward Firmage,
with special attention to his activities
in civil rights and anti-poverty
programs.

Sterling McMurrin's The Theo
logical Foundations of the Mor
mon Religion by Robert McAfee

A scholarly journal on Mormon
thought and culture will begin publi
cation here in March under the editor
ship of a Stanford professor and a
graduate student, working with a staff
of Stanford students.
Dialogue, A Journal of Mormon
Thought, billed as the only indepen
dent Mormon publication, is the brain
child of Eugene England, a graduate
student in English, and Wesley John
son. assistant professor of history.
England is from Salt Lake City and
Johnson from Arizona. Both young
men were born into the Mormon
church.
Besides holding the posts of co-man
aging editors of the new publication,
England and Johnson are founders of
Stanford's Dialogue Club, whose 25
members have been meeting since Oc
tober to explore "the relationship of
religion and culture."
The magazine's prospectus states
that the editors "desire to give expres
sion to the variety of Mormon cul
ture," particularly with a "spirited ex
change of opinion through editorials
and letters to the editors."
Dialogue, which has no connection

with Stanford University, will be pub
lished quarterly in Utah by the Dia
logue Foundation, Inc. A board of
editors, composed of 22 prominent
Mormons throughout the country, will
sponsor the operation.
Not 'Liberal/ But...
Although Dialogue is officially nei
ther a conservative nor a liberal jour
nal, it is one sign of restlessness
among liberal intellectuals of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (LDS). The church was found
ed 137 years ago by Joseph Smith,
who claimed to have received "Golden
Plates" from the angel Moroni, set
ting down some basic tenets of the
faith. Mormons considered Smith the
restorer of the true Gospel of Christ,
which was diluted after Christ's death.
Mormons do not consider themselves
Protestants.
The brochure introducing Dialogue,
which was mailed to 6,000 prominent
Mormons in November, says the mag
azine will "present voices that ask
faith to ground itself in reason ..
The Mormon church, headed by 92-
year-old president, David O. McKay,
whose word is religious law for
Saints, is a wealthy and fast-growing
institution with extensive realty, in
surance and journalistic holdings. Its
membership has increased 159 per
cent since 1940 through vigorous mis
sionary work here and abroad.
Discrimination
The LDS is one of the few religions
with an official policy of discrimina
tion against Negroes, who may join
the church but not become priests, or
church officers, as may all other male
members. It is estimated that only
about 200 of the 2.3 million Mormons
are Negroes.
Managing editor England stresses
that Dialogue, which is intended to
provide a variety of viewpoints, will
initially take no editorial stand on the
Negro issue. He mentioned, however,
that the second issue of Dialogue will
contain an article by a Morman branch
president describing his experiences
as a freedom rider.
The key goal of Dialogue is merely
to stimulate debate on all aspects of
Mormonism and Christianity. England
says that "One of the things we want
is a place where outside theologians
can enter into a discussion with those
in our church."
The first issue will demonstrate this

inter-faith dialogue with a book re
view by Stanford's Robert McAfce
Brown and a history of early Mor
monism by Mario DePhillis, both non-
Mormans.
"It is an advange both to us and
the church," England says.
Other articles in Dialogue, which
will strive for "the form and quality
of an academic journal with the inter
est and creativity of a feature maga
zine," will include:
• Assessments of Mormon culture
by Leonard Arrington, James Hazel
tine, George Boyd and others.
• A first-hand report on the White
House Fellows by Edward Firmage,
with special attention to his activities
in civil rights and anti-poverty
programs.
• A triple book review of Dr.
Sterling McMurrin's The Theo
logical Foundations of the Mor
mon Religion by Robert McAfee
Brown, Richard Anderson of
Brigham Young University and
David Bennett of the University
of Utah.
• A clinical psychologist's per
sonal explanation of the mean
ing of the Christian faith.
• Stanford history student
Philip Starr's debut in a section
called "Student Voices."
Drawings, illustrations and
other articles, essays and re
views will fill out the 120 pages
of the first Dialogue. Initial cir
culation will be 1,000 at a yearly
subscription rate of $6.
England says Dialogue is the
"first independent publication to
deal with Mormon thought that
we know about." The church it
self currently publishes Im
provement Era, its official or
gan, and Instructor, a scholarly
magazine designed for Mormon
teachers.
"It is an.advantage both to us
and the church," England says,
"to publish independently. In
structor has a specific purpose,
and does a fine job in its own
way."
Church 'Receptive'
Although there has been no
comment from church officials
on Dialogue's publication plans,
England believes the church is
"receptive" to the idea because
of subscription requests received
from top officials.
The LDS is tightly knit and
centralized with a rigorous dog

ma, but England thinks it is well
suited for the free discussion
Dialogue aims to provide. "One
of the church tenets is continual
revelation," he says. "Man's very
relation to God is a dialogue. In
this sense the church is very
open."
Advisory editors to the new
quarterly will be Dr. Lowell
Bennlon, a professor at the Uni
versity of Utah, and Dr. Leon
ard Arrington, an economic his
torian at Utah State University.
Both are respected intellectual
leaders of the liberal Mormon
element. The board of editors,
all described as "practicing Mor
mons," has seven members from
Utah, which is the historical and
geographic center of Brigham
Young's church. Dow Woodward
of Stanford's Biochemistry De
partment is a board member.
The Stanford-based staff of
Dialogue, drawn partly from the
Dialogue club, includes Frances
Menlove, manuscripts editor; Jo
seph Jeppson, notes and com
ments editor; Paul Salisbury,
publication editor; Edward
Geary, copy editor; Ralph Han
sen, assistant book review edi
tor; Clayne Robison, financial
coordinator; Robert Griffin,
Kenneth Handley, James Mar
shall and Sterling Sessions, fi
