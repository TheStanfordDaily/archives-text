# HEADQUARTERS HERE:
## 'Dialogue' Due In March 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A scholarly journal on Mormon
thought and culture will begin publi
cation here in March under the editor
ship of a Stanford professor and a
graduate student, working with a staff
of Stanford students.
Dialogue, A Journal of Mormon
Thought, billed as the only indepen
dent Mormon publication, is the brain
child of Eugene England, a graduate
student in English, and Wesley John
son. assistant professor of history.
England is from Salt Lake City and
Johnson from Arizona. Both young
men were born into the Mormon
church.
Besides holding the posts of co-man
aging editors of the new publication,
England and Johnson are founders of
Stanford's Dialogue Club, whose 25
members have been meeting since Oc
tober to explore "the relationship of
religion and culture."
The magazine's prospectus states
that the editors "desire to give expres
sion to the variety of Mormon cul
ture," particularly with a "spirited ex
change of opinion through editorials
and letters to the editors."
Dialogue, which has no connection

with Stanford University, will be pub
lished quarterly in Utah by the Dia
logue Foundation, Inc. A board of
editors, composed of 22 prominent
Mormons throughout the country, will
sponsor the operation.
Not 'Liberal/ But...
Although Dialogue is officially nei
ther a conservative nor a liberal jour
nal, it is one sign of restlessness
among liberal intellectuals of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (LDS). The church was found
ed 137 years ago by Joseph Smith,
who claimed to have received "Golden
Plates" from the angel Moroni, set
ting down some basic tenets of the
faith. Mormons considered Smith the
restorer of the true Gospel of Christ,
which was diluted after Christ's death.
Mormons do not consider themselves
Protestants.
The brochure introducing Dialogue,
which was mailed to 6,000 prominent
Mormons in November, says the mag
azine will "present voices that ask
faith to ground itself in reason ..
The Mormon church, headed by 92-
year-old president, David O. McKay,
whose word is religious law for
Saints, is a wealthy and fast-growing
institution with extensive realty, in
surance and journalistic holdings. Its
membership has increased 159 per
cent since 1940 through vigorous mis
sionary work here and abroad.
Discrimination
The LDS is one of the few religions
with an official policy of discrimina
tion against Negroes, who may join
the church but not become priests, or
church officers, as may all other male
members. It is estimated that only
about 200 of the 2.3 million Mormons
are Negroes.
Managing editor England stresses
that Dialogue, which is intended to
provide a variety of viewpoints, will
initially take no editorial stand on the
Negro issue. He mentioned, however,
that the second issue of Dialogue will
contain an article by a Morman branch
president describing his experiences
as a freedom rider.
The key goal of Dialogue is merely
to stimulate debate on all aspects of
Mormonism and Christianity. England
says that "One of the things we want
is a place where outside theologians
can enter into a discussion with those
in our church."
The first issue will demonstrate this

inter-faith dialogue with a book re
view by Stanford's Robert McAfce
Brown and a history of early Mor
monism by Mario DePhillis, both non-
Mormans.
"It is an advange both to us and
the church," England says.
Other articles in Dialogue, which
will strive for "the form and quality
of an academic journal with the inter
est and creativity of a feature maga
zine," will include:
• Assessments of Mormon culture
by Leonard Arrington, James Hazel
tine, George Boyd and others.
• A first-hand report on the White
House Fellows by Edward Firmage,
with special attention to his activities
