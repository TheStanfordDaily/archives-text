# Learning At Stanford
## 
### 
"The current era of rapid change, the current
magnitude and variety of demands for univers
ity services at home and abroad, the numbers
and needs of students—these combine to produce
for the university greater problems of internal
cofarion and of appropriate response to society's
needs." President J. E. Wallace Sterling, 1966
In discussing Stanford's "appropriate re
sponse" to what he perceives as the conflicting
needs of the campus community and the sur
rounding society, President Sterling yesterday
demonstrated anew that his philosophy of edu
cation—and of the students role in that process
has been only slightly modified by the events
of last year.
On the positive side there was the welcome
acknowledgment that such community problems
as the size of the student body, the academic
curriculum and teaching methods should be re
examined. We can only applaud his announce
ment that a subcommittee of the Committee on
University Policy has been appointed to study
the growing problem of "quantity vs. quality" in
the Stanford education process, his suggestion
that new programs in interdisciplinary instruc
tion are needed "to complement the tendency
toward increased specialization or fragmenta
tion of knowledge by reaching for new ways of
trying to integrate or synthesize knowledge,"
and—most importantly—his acknowledgment
that students should participate in this process.
However, this much-needed commitment to
introspection—and to the right of students to
participate in it—was, as always, tempered by
a patronizing attitude toward student govern
ment and a somewhat disturbing definition of
what is education—"the enterprise of learning."
It is technically correct to restate the proposi
tion that "student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the Trustees"
since "in the last analysis, the responsibility for
the performance, program and welfare of the
University rests with the Trustees, because it is
placed there by law." We do not question the
legal right of the Trustees to make the final de
cisions. What we do question is the mechanism
of decision-making by which the Trustees make
their rulings. In practice, these decisions result
from recommendations by the President to the
Board. The President, in making recommenda
tions, is not required to follow—or even permit
student participation. Thus, the student body,

far from being allowed "sole jurisdiction over
student affairs and conduct" as an outraged
Legislature demanded last year in the wake of
the Dean Allen affair, is not even guaranteed
access to the decision-making process.
This denial of the right to access can have
only one result: those who reject the premise
that they are not sufficiently mature to learn
self-regulation—since to admit this would be to
acknowledge that they are not mature enough
to decide what they should think and believe—
must, as Speaker Jay Kadane told the Legisla
ture last Thursday night, conclude that "student
power in the University ... is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the campus
and its attendant bad publicity for the Univers
ity."
One can learn by sitting in, but it would be
more preferable if one could learn by partaking
more fully in the process of self-regulation and
self-government.
On the issue of the University vis. a vis. soci
ety, President Sterling demonstrated a certain
misunderstanding—we think—of what 20th Cen
tury education is all about. To contend that "the
greatest contribution faculty can make both
directly to their students and directly or indi
rectly to pressing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus," to urge that uni
versities retain " 'an inner city' which is calmer
and more contemplative than the storms which
swirl about it . . . where the enterprise of learn
ing is given primacy" is, indeed, to opt for a
safeguarded autonomy—a sterile autonomy.
"The enterprise of learning"—and teaching
is based on the conflict of ideas, of theories and
realities. To rephrase President Sterling's meta
phor, one does not learn all that there is to know
in the eye of the hurricane. Those professors who
take leaves of absence to serve on commissions
and agencies of the government, those students
and professors who forsake academia for Missis
sippi, tutorials at Ravenswood, protests for or
against the war in Vietnam, etc.; these people
are learning and teaching as much, and as well,
as those who never leave this relatively homo
geneous community.
As the President concluded, "today's learning
will go far to govern tomorrow's action." But
to define "learning" as a "moral commitment" to
an "inner city" of isolated reflection and limited
conflict is to be, at best, incomplete.

toward increased specialization or fragmenta
tion of knowledge by reaching for new ways of
trying to integrate or synthesize knowledge,"
and—most importantly—his acknowledgment
that students should participate in this process.
However, this much-needed commitment to
introspection—and to the right of students to
participate in it—was, as always, tempered by
a patronizing attitude toward student govern
ment and a somewhat disturbing definition of
what is education—"the enterprise of learning."
It is technically correct to restate the proposi
tion that "student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the Trustees"
since "in the last analysis, the responsibility for
the performance, program and welfare of the
University rests with the Trustees, because it is
placed there by law." We do not question the
legal right of the Trustees to make the final de
cisions. What we do question is the mechanism
of decision-making by which the Trustees make
their rulings. In practice, these decisions result
from recommendations by the President to the
Board. The President, in making recommenda
tions, is not required to follow—or even permit
student participation. Thus, the student body,

far from being allowed "sole jurisdiction over
student affairs and conduct" as an outraged
Legislature demanded last year in the wake of
the Dean Allen affair, is not even guaranteed
access to the decision-making process.
This denial of the right to access can have
only one result: those who reject the premise
that they are not sufficiently mature to learn
self-regulation—since to admit this would be to
acknowledge that they are not mature enough
to decide what they should think and believe—
must, as Speaker Jay Kadane told the Legisla
ture last Thursday night, conclude that "student
power in the University ... is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the campus
and its attendant bad publicity for the Univers
ity."
One can learn by sitting in, but it would be
more preferable if one could learn by partaking
more fully in the process of self-regulation and
self-government.
On the issue of the University vis. a vis. soci
ety, President Sterling demonstrated a certain
misunderstanding—we think—of what 20th Cen
tury education is all about. To contend that "the
greatest contribution faculty can make both
directly to their students and directly or indi
rectly to pressing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus," to urge that uni
versities retain " 'an inner city' which is calmer
and more contemplative than the storms which
swirl about it . . . where the enterprise of learn
ing is given primacy" is, indeed, to opt for a
safeguarded autonomy—a sterile autonomy.
"The enterprise of learning"—and teaching
is based on the conflict of ideas, of theories and
realities. To rephrase President Sterling's meta
phor, one does not learn all that there is to know
in the eye of the hurricane. Those professors who
take leaves of absence to serve on commissions
and agencies of the government, those students
and professors who forsake academia for Missis
sippi, tutorials at Ravenswood, protests for or
against the war in Vietnam, etc.; these people
are learning and teaching as much, and as well,
as those who never leave this relatively homo
geneous community.
As the President concluded, "today's learning
will go far to govern tomorrow's action." But
to define "learning" as a "moral commitment" to
an "inner city" of isolated reflection and limited
conflict is to be, at best, incomplete.
"The current era of rapid change, the current
magnitude and variety of demands for univers
ity services at home and abroad, the numbers
and needs of students—these combine to produce
for the university greater problems of internal
cofarion and of appropriate response to society's
needs." President J. E. Wallace Sterling, 1966
In discussing Stanford's "appropriate re
sponse" to what he perceives as the conflicting
needs of the campus community and the sur
rounding society, President Sterling yesterday
demonstrated anew that his philosophy of edu
cation—and of the students role in that process
has been only slightly modified by the events
of last year.
On the positive side there was the welcome
acknowledgment that such community problems
as the size of the student body, the academic
curriculum and teaching methods should be re
examined. We can only applaud his announce
ment that a subcommittee of the Committee on
University Policy has been appointed to study
the growing problem of "quantity vs. quality" in
the Stanford education process, his suggestion
that new programs in interdisciplinary instruc
tion are needed "to complement the tendency
toward increased specialization or fragmenta

tions, is not required to follow—or even permit
student participation. Thus, the student body,

far from being allowed "sole jurisdiction over
student affairs and conduct" as an outraged
Legislature demanded last year in the wake of
the Dean Allen affair, is not even guaranteed
access to the decision-making process.
This denial of the right to access can have
only one result: those who reject the premise
that they are not sufficiently mature to learn
self-regulation—since to admit this would be to
acknowledge that they are not mature enough
to decide what they should think and believe—
must, as Speaker Jay Kadane told the Legisla
ture last Thursday night, conclude that "student
power in the University ... is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the campus
and its attendant bad publicity for the Univers
ity."
One can learn by sitting in, but it would be
more preferable if one could learn by partaking
more fully in the process of self-regulation and
self-government.
On the issue of the University vis. a vis. soci
ety, President Sterling demonstrated a certain
misunderstanding—we think—of what 20th Cen
tury education is all about. To contend that "the
greatest contribution faculty can make both
directly to their students and directly or indi
rectly to pressing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus," to urge that uni
versities retain " 'an inner city' which is calmer
and more contemplative than the storms which
swirl about it . . . where the enterprise of learn
ing is given primacy" is, indeed, to opt for a
safeguarded autonomy—a sterile autonomy.
"The enterprise of learning"—and teaching
is based on the conflict of ideas, of theories and
realities. To rephrase President Sterling's meta
phor, one does not learn all that there is to know
in the eye of the hurricane. Those professors who
take leaves of absence to serve on commissions
and agencies of the government, those students
and professors who forsake academia for Missis
sippi, tutorials at Ravenswood, protests for or
against the war in Vietnam, etc.; these people
are learning and teaching as much, and as well,
as those who never leave this relatively homo
geneous community.
As the President concluded, "today's learning
will go far to govern tomorrow's action." But
to define "learning" as a "moral commitment" to
an "inner city" of isolated reflection and limited
conflict is to be, at best, incomplete.
