## Vietnam And The LBJ Trail 
### 
Men of goodwill everywhere
arc* to find i iust solution
!o <he Viet N~m problem. Many
pe-'co pirns have boon proposed
T'io la!ct comes from my frood
friond. N. K. Hopkins, who lives
in Chaumont, France.
Hopkins points out that the
1954 Geneva agreements call for
free e'ections in both halves of
Viet Nam. The elections were to
decide whether the South should
go Ho or remain Nhu and
whether the North should stay
Ho or go go.
For some reason the elections
were never held.
Now one of Ho's conditions
for a peace settlement is to ini
tiate the 1954 Geneva agree
ments. It is time, Hopkins be
lieves, to take him up on it.
The next time Ho screams for
elections we should agree. The
only thing we must insist on,
though, is that there be complete
freedom of ballot.
Of course, in the elections, we
would lose South Viet Nam. We
knew all along we would.
But we would win in the
North. The people who have
been living under Ho would cer
tainly vote him out in an honest
election, just as the people in

the Sou + h would figure anything
they got wnild be better than
w'"it thev have now.
Therefore. Ho would move his
government to Saigon and Gen
his troops, and
the current South Vietnamese
Premier would fro to Hanoi.
What Ho would inherit in the
South would be refugees, reli
gious strife, and a war-torn
economy.
While we, on the other hand,
in the North would get an indus
trialized, underpopulated, de
viced, and thoroughly pacified
country.
Not only that, but in North
Viet Nam we would be virtually
surrounded by Communist coun
tries, so we could easily make it
into a showcase for capitalism
and a bastion for democracy.
North Viet Nam would be a new
symbol for the free world.
Besides, we would have a bor
der near the heart of China,
which would make our espion
age easier, and Hanoi could be
come a new listening post for
the West. And with North Viet
Nam as a base, Chiang Kai
shek's return to the mainland
would be that much nearer.
Ho, on the other hand, would
find himself with millions of un

empToved guerrillas which he
wuld trv to send North. But
the people in the North know
what it to b've under Ho. so
they would reieet him. The
guerrilla*: would then return to
to demand pensions and
'and. Put the Southern economy
wouldn't be able to take it. so
the guerrillas would revolt
against Ho, and we would sup
port them, sending Â«;unnlies and
advisers along the newly opened
T BJ Trail.
If everything goes according
to the script. Ho wou*d coon ask
us to take over South Viet Nam
a<*ain. something we would re
fuse to do.
Ho would then become furious
with China for advising him in
the first place to agree to the
elections, and he would throw in
his lot with the Russians who
could not refuse to give him fi
nancial assistance. But the cost
of rebuilding the South would
be so great that the Soviets
would find themselves in an eco
nomic crisis, and they would
have to postpone their timetable
for a Communist takeover of
the world.
Thus we would kill three birds
with one stone. And Arthur
Goldberg could then come home.
