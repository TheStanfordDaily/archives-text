# Growers, Union Split On Farm Labor Supply
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
Representatives of growers and
farm workers in California agricul
ture disagreed sharply in a Political
Union debate last night on the avail
ability of domestic farm workers. But
both sides emphasized the importance
of the end of the Bracero importation
to the state's economy.
Palmer Mendelson, president of a
large central valley produce firm,
said that in his experience there
"simply aren't enough domestics, no
matter what wage we offer." He
claimed the industry lost $10 million
last year because of labor costs.
The grower blamed Labor Secretary
Willard Wertz for ending the program
which allowed the importation of
Mexican nationals to work on Califor
nia farms. "He made decisions on the
advice of a few professors that I
wouldn't have made after 40 years in
the business."
Mrs. Anne Draper, secretary of Cit
izens for Farm Labor, answered by
charging that the growers are "sub
verting the will of Congress by get
ting workers into the country under
immigration laws." She claimed the

growers would have no trouble get
ting help if they offered "decent work
ing conditions and higher wages."
"The growers exploited the poor
Mexican to enrich their corporations.
It's just not true that Americans
won't do stoop 1a bo r," she said.
"Americans will do anything if you
pay them enough. The only problem is
that these businessmen have refused
to make farm work attractive to do
mestic workers."
Mrs. Draper called for the termina
tion of all foreign workers in the
United States, saying that "the three
per cent last year was three per cent
too many."
Questions from the audience fol
lowed the debate. Both participants
tried to support their conclusions with
statistics that contradicted one anoth
er and could not be substantiated.
The principal point of disagreement
was whether the end of the Bracero
program had actually hurt the agri
cultural industry.
No direct reference was made to
the recent grape workers strike in the
Delano area.
