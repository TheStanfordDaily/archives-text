# Sterling Asks 'Identity' To Protect University
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
Stanford President Wallace Sterling
said yesterday that universities should
"retain an identity" apart from the
rest of society.
Addressing the annual Stanford To
day and Tomorrow convocation in Me
morial Auditorium, Sterling said the
University's involvement with public
issues and problems "has long since
torn the ivy from towers and trans
formed their once cloistered ways.
"Yet, in my view, they will serve
society best if they can retain an iden
tity and an internal cohesion apart
from the commercial, industrial, so
cial and governmental institutions
which society has created."
Using a phrase from John Gardner,
Sterling said universities should re
tain an "inner city" which is "calmer
and more contemplative that the
storms which swirl about it . .
Pursuing this theme, he acknowl
edged the advantages of sabbatical
leaves for faculty but said the great
est contribution faculty can make
both to their students and to pressing
public problems is "to be on the job
on their own campus."
Comments on Structure
The grey-haired Stanford president,
who has held the office since 1949,
also commented on the University's
structure and organization.
Student government, he said, has
not been static. "Its Constitution has
changed more than once, and I dare
say it will change again."
"If the student body as a whole

thinks it is not being well represented
through its government and that it is
time for a change," he added, "it is
fitting that they (the students) take
the initiative."
Sterling emphastzed, however, that

student government derives its au
thority only from the Board of Trus
tees.
"Student government at Stanford
derives its befng by delegation from
the Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University joined
representatives in recommending its
establishment to the Trustees."
Citing enrollment growth at Stan
ford in the past decade, particularly

in numbers of graduates, Sterling
said a plan was under discussion to
improve the quality of teaching by
providing more faculty time for the
same number of students.
"The quality of education, it would
seem to me, is dependent upon the
quality of faculty and the quality of
students in a given institution, and
how that institution arranges to bring
the one to bear on the other," he said.

the Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University joined
representatives in recommending its
establishment to the Trustees."
Citing enrollment growth at Stan
ford in the past decade, particularly

in numbers of graduates, Sterling
said a plan was under discussion to
improve the quality of teaching by
providing more faculty time for the
same number of students.
"The quality of education, it would
seem to me, is dependent upon the
quality of faculty and the quality of
students in a given institution, and
how that institution arranges to bring
the one to bear on the other," he said.
Stanford President Wallace Sterling
said yesterday that universities should
"retain an identity" apart from the
rest of society.
Addressing the annual Stanford To
day and Tomorrow convocation in Me
morial Auditorium, Sterling said the
University's involvement with public
issues and problems "has long since
torn the ivy from towers and trans
formed their once cloistered ways.
"Yet, in my view, they will serve
society best if they can retain an iden
tity and an internal cohesion apart
from the commercial, industrial, so
cial and governmental institutions
which society has created."
Using a phrase from John Gardner,
Sterling said universities should re
tain an "inner city" which is "calmer
and more contemplative that the
storms which swirl about it . .
Pursuing this theme, he acknowl
edged the advantages of sabbatical
leaves for faculty but said the great
est contribution faculty can make
both to their students and to pressing
public problems is "to be on the job
on their own campus."
Comments on Structure
The grey-haired Stanford president,
who has held the office since 1949,
also commented on the University's
structure and organization.
Student government, he said, has
not been static. "Its Constitution has
changed more than once, and I dare
say it will change again."
"If the student body as a whole

thinks it is not being well represented
through its government and that it is
time for a change," he added, "it is
fitting that they (the students) take
the initiative."
Sterling emphastzed, however, that

student government derives its au
thority only from the Board of Trus
tees.
"Student government at Stanford
derives its befng by delegation from
the Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University joined
representatives in recommending its
establishment to the Trustees."
