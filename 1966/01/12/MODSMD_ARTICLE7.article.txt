# Meal Transfer Plan Allows Free Guests
## 
### 
A new meal transfer program for
University dining halls begins today,
permitting students to invite dinner
guests to their dorms without paying
for the extra meal or signing in the
guest in advance.
The new plan, which applies to all
dining rooms operated by the Uni
versity Food Service, including En
cina Commons and the Row Houses,
was devised by John McCarthy for
the Residential Education Commis
sion in response to student requests.
A quota of "eligible guests" will be
established for each living group.
Eligible guests are other board-pay
ing students, and theoretically, since
these students have already paid for
meals in their own residences, a rough
evening-out process will occur.
Group Vote
All University living groups in
volved have voted to participate in
the exchange program. Participation
is optional.
Each house will establish a guest
quota by subtracting the average
number of resident diners from the
number of available seats in the din

ing room. Sign-in sheets for each meal
will be posted prior to the day on
which the meal is to be served, but
residents are not required to sign-in
guests.
Once the quota for a meal has been
filled, additional guests will not be
seated. Some arrangements may be
made to send overflow to other dining
rooms.
Regular Charge
For non-eligible guests, the regular
rate will be charged. These guests —
such as students not paying board
or parents—must be signed in on the
quota sheet.
In order to identify students as
persons eligible to participate, meal
identification cards will be used. New
identification cards will be issued to
women.
The Residential Education Commis
sion, composed of representatives
from the University Food Services,
students appointed by the ASSU
president, and members of the staffs
of the Dean of Students and Under
graduate Education, will evaluate the
program as it precedes.
