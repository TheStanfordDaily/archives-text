# Exerpts From President Sterling's Convocation Address
## 
### 
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to

command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at

structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa

its population than has any
other nation.

physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re

sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or

to produce for the university of

learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.

today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.

... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on

dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time

they shbuld take the initiative.

physical plant. Presentations of

these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres

dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi

is somewhat limited, despite ex

gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years

ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val

every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa

ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the

rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.

to produce for the university of

ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
the President of the University
joined students representatives
in recommending it to the Trus
tees. Student government has
not been static. Its Constitution
h»s changed more than once,
and I daresav it will change
again. Its leadership has been
various, ranging from the self
serving politician type to those
whose judgment and perform
ance won widespread respect
throughout the whole Univer
sity community. But regardless
of its competence, it derives its
being from the Trustees, who
have—to date at least —acted on
recommendation of the Presi
dent of the University. Initia
tive for changes in the Consti
tution under which student gov
ernment onerates has, historical
ly, come from the students, and
they have sought advice from
faculty, usually in the School of
Law and in the Political Science
Department, and from Univer
sity officers. All this has been
precedent to any recommenda
tion made by the President to
the Trustees. And I would sug
gest that this procedure has
merit. If the student body as a
whole thinks that it is not being
well represented through its
government and that it is time
for a change, it is fitting that
they shbuld take the initiative.
On matters affecting the phy
sical and fiscal development of
the Universitv there is also con
sultation. Students serve on
committees having to do with
undergraduate housing: faculty
serve on committees having to
do with land development and
physical plant. Presentations of
the financial situation of the
University are made to the
Committee on University Policy
— which is composed of the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty, the Deans of the
schools and the senior adminis
trative officers of the Univer
sity; this Committee recom
mends priorities among com
peting University needs, and
these priorities serve as guide
lines in budget making. Com
parable presentations have been
made to what is called the Pres
ident's Student Advisory Com
mittee. which includes the Presi
dent of the student body and the
Speaker of the Legislature,
among others; but my experi
ence is that the student span of
attention to these fiscal matters
is somewhat limited, despite ex
cathedra statements to the con
trary.
So. in the formulation of the
President's recommendations to
the Trustees, faculty and stu
dents participate, both formally
and informally—and in some
very important particulars, very
extensively. This is not to say
that such participation cannot
be improved—even within the
limits of time now given to such
participation—and time is a
precious commodity. But in the
last analysis, the responsibility
for the performance, program
and welfare of the University
rests with the Trustees, because
it is placed there by law.
Now let me speak in a broad
er context. The university as an
institution has been going
through a period of critical re
view during the past decade or
more, and the range and inten
sity of this review have in
creased during the past three or
four years.
In nation after nation around
the world, the university as an
institution is under review, not
least of all because national so
cieties have been placing great
er demands upon it—nor is the
situation in this country an ex
ception.
International agencies are also
involved. Just one illustration.
Last September, UNESCO or
ganized a World Congress of
Ministers of Education. The
Congress met in Teheran. Its
subject was illiteracy . . . The

implication is clear that the gov
ernments they serve and the uni
versities in their respective
countries are expected to attack
this problem. In addition to il
literacy there are problems of
food supply, population increase,
revision of legal systems, and
in some countries such as our
own, air and water pollution,
urban renewal, etc. Efforts to
find solutions to these tenacious
and vexatious problems are in
volving universities in some way
or other. There can be no doubt
that the services of universities
are under the increasing de
mands imposed by problems
such as these. And this at a time
when they are also under the
pressures of numbers from
"more and more young people
(who) . . . want the education
that opens doors to the good
life. (Perkins, mss. The Univer
sity in Transition, p. 22.)
The Brontosaurus Projection
In a recent series of lectures
at Princeton, President Perkins
of Cornell has depicted some of
the anxieties about the future
of the university which have re
ceived considerable publicity.
The first is known as the Bron
tosaurus Projection. It is attrib
utable to Dr. George Beadle, No
bel Laureate in Biology and
President of the University of
Chicago. It suggests that growth
is out of hand. Growing in body
size faster than it is growing in
mind and spirit, "the university
is doomed to repeat the sad his
tory of the prehistoric monsters
who are presumed to have emit
ted great noises but few con
structive comments."
A second is known as the
Caretaker's Daughter projec
tion. and is, so far as I know,
without specific authorship, un
less that of President Perkins.
It asks, in effect, "Who takes
care of the caretaker's daughter
when the caretaker's busy tak
ing care?" With faculty mem
bers commuting to do good off
campus, with "students out look
ing for their lost identities" and
with university presidents en
gaged in the extractive industry
of fund raising—who is taking
care of the universitv?
A third is called the Kent
Projection:
There was a young lady from
Kent
Who said that she knew what
it meant
When men took her to dine,
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what it meant —but
she went!
A fourth has been called the
Constructive Chaos projection
and is attributable to President
Kerr of California. The sugges
tion advanced is that institution
al opportunism has merit, even
though it produces imbalance
and places institutional integ
rity in some jeopardy; that
what may apepar to be chaotic
responses to opportunity—such
as government - sponsored re
search or extensive faculty con
sulting what — is in fact con
structive because it counteracts
institutional parochialism and
stimulates creativity.
These four projections, Presi
dent Perkins points out, express
four anxieties about the future
of the university: "The fear of
uncontrolled growth—the Bron
tosaurus Projection. The fear of
loss of direction — the Care
taker's Daughter Projection.
The fear of loss of principles—
the Lady from Kent. And . . .
the fear that the university will
be too rigid in an era of rapid
change" — The Constructive
Chaos Projection. (Perkins,
mss., pp. 23-25).
Let me add a fifth projection
of a different character and ex
pressed much earlier than any
of the first, four. I mentioned it
from this platform a few years
ago. Its author is George Bern
ard Shaw, who was certainly
not opposed to social change but
who was al?o concerned for val
ues of knowledge and learning
which might get pushed aside
in the rough and tumble of
every day living. The university
in Shaw's view can stand "for
the posterity that has not vote
and the tradition that never had
any . . . for the great abstrac
tions. for the eternal against the
expedient."
The current era of rapid
change, the current magnitude
and variety of demands for uni
versity services at home and
abroad, the numbers and needs
of students—all these combine

to produce for the university of
today greater problems of in
ternal cohesion and of appropri
ate response to society's
needs . . .
The quality of education, it
would seem to me, is dependent
upon the quality of faculty and
the quality of students in a
given institution, and how that
institution arranges to bring the
one to bear on the other.
Over the course of history, the
U. S. has offered more educa
tion to a higher percentage of
its population than has any
other nation.
The Modern World
I have referred to a series of
lectures given recently by Pres
ident Perkins of Cornell. In
those lectures, he asks a ques
tion which many others have
long had in mind: "Can the uni
versity keep pace with the mod
ern world, let alone bear the
torch that lights the way?"
(Perkins, mss., p. 22.) Please
note that the question involves
universities!
The answer to that question
in this country, especially if it
is to be an affirmative answer,
will depend in part, if not in
large measure, on what society
does to make use of its junior
colleges and its many four-year
colleges. The problem involved
here is too large and complex
for discussion this morning, but,
believe me, it exists. And the
answer will depend also on how
each university addresses itself
and responds to the question—
for every university must re
spond.
How should Stanford respond?
Stanford, like most other uni
versities, must realize, as I think
it does, that it cannot do every
thing. It must be selective in
what it undertakes, and its se
lection must relate to its actual
and potential resources and how
these resources are deployed and
employed. There is understand
able and commendable interest
within the University to have it
involve itself in a broad spec
trum of problems which torment
the world — problems of illitera
cy, population and food supply,
disease, poverty, the blight of
cities, war and peace. In terms
of this involvement, to what de
gree should Stanford expect its
faculty to concentrate on mak
ing contributions to solutions of
these problems through teaching
and research, and to what de
gree should it grant leaves of
absence to its faculty so that
they can serve on commissions
and agencies of government,
both national and international?
I would point out that univer
sity involvement in world prob
lems by numerous and extended
faculty leaves of absence would
tend to frustrate the desire of
many faculty and students for
closer faculty - student relations,
and to introduce additional in
terruptions and adjustments in
teaching and research at both
undergraduate and graduate
levels. While I would urge the
advantages of sabbatical leave
for faculty members as an op
portunity to refresh themselves
and deepen their wells of
knowledge, and while I recog
nize the genuine value in pers
pective and experience to a fac
ulty member, and through him
to the University, of a leave of
absence for public service, I
would contend that the greatest
contribution faculty can make
both directly to their students
and directly or indirectly to pres
sing public problems is to be on
the job at their own campus.
Problem of Size
A university like Stanford
must also consider the problem
of size—not only in terms of
utilizing to the best advantage
the financial resources at its
command, or in terms of its se
lection of academic undertak
ings, but also in terms of its
sense of community. So far as
I am aware, no one has yet pro
duced a generally accepted defi
nition of "optimum size," but
surely each university is entitled
to work out for itself such a def
inition. During the past decade,
Stanford's enrollment growth
has been chiefly at the graduate
level. The question has now been
posed: Has this growth gone far
enough? Would not undergradu
ate and graduate teaching be
made more productive by at
tempting, through faculty addi
tions, to provide more faculty
time for essentially the same
number of students? The Com

mittee on University Policy had
a recent discussion of the prob
lem of size at it relates to the
quality of Stanford's academic
program, the resources in hand
or in sight, the competing de
mands on these resources, the
attendant physical problems of
traffic and parking, and that im
portant though intangible some
thing called a se"nse of communi
ty. A smaller committee is to be
appointed to address itself to
this matter and to produce ideas
and recommendations for fur
ther and more broadly-based
consideration.
And it is time, I think, for
Stanford to engage in another
intensive review and evaluation
of its undergraduate program.
It is 10 years since such a re
view was undertaken. Revisions
were made as a result, and fur
ther revisions have been made
since. But the sum-total of these
revisions could stand evaluation.
Such evaluation should pay at
tention to changes that have
been made in high school curri
cula as these affect the prepa
ration of students for under
graduate study, and how this
preparation affects student op
portunities for advanced place
ment. The evaluation should try
to take into account the avail
ability of new knowledge and
how it can be woven into courses
and curricula. It is not enough,
I submit, for an instructor to
communicate new knowledge
simply by updating his notes,
important as this is. I'm wonder
ing if we do not need in any
program of instruction to com
plement the tendency toward in
creased specialization or frag
mentation of knowledge by
reaching for new ways of trying
to integrate or synthesize knowl
edge. If the historic phrase "lib
eral education" has meaning to
day, surely this meaning resides
somewhere in programs which
produce relationships among the
increasing number of specializa
tions. To review and evaluate
undergraduate education within
some such frame of reference
will not be easy, but I suggest
that Stanford should seriously
consider doing so. Among other
things, the exercise would pro
vide, it seems to me, ample op
portunity for students seriously
to come to grips with what I re
gard as the central business of
the University.
The Pinnacle
Universities stand, or should
stand, at the pinnacle of any ed
ucational system. They are the
institutions which combine the
quest for new knowledge with
teaching and training at under
graduate and graduate levels, a
very few at the graduate level
only. Their involvement with
public issues and problems has
long since torn the ivy from
their towers and transformed
their once cloistered ways. Yet,
in my view, they will serve so
ciety best If they can retain an
identity and an internal cohe
sion which somehow sets them
apart from the commercial, in
dustrial, social and government
al institutions which society has
created; if they can retain, in
John Gardner's phrase, "an in
ner city" which is calmer and
more contemplative than the
storms which swirl about it,
where the value of discussion is
measured not by volume but by
information and knowledge, and
where the enterprise of learning
is given primary. Here is a
moral commitment that Is wor
thy of any university and any
of its members. Each of us at
Stanford would do well to ask
himself whether or not he has
made that commitment, and, if
so, how seriously. For today's
learning will go far to govern
tomorrow's action. I do not
know of any university — cer
tainly in the United States —
which is not beset by multiple
problems. Nor do I know of any
which is trembling on the brink
of disaster. I do not know of
any which is not concerned to
enhance its capacity to improve
teaching and research, nor of
any which does not recognize
and greatly appreciate that it
combines within its community
both the experience of age and
the eager challenge of youth.
Relative to what they have been
in the past, almost all our uni
versities are stronger today than
heretofore and have more to of
fer to both faculty and students.
This is true of Stanford today.
May it also be true of Stanford
tomorrow.
