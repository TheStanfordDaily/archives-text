# Exerpts From President Sterling's Convocation Address
## 
### 
... I suppose that every individual
member of a university community
sees the university through his own
eyes and perceives it in the light of
his own knowledge, however extensive
or limited, and of his own interests,
however broad or narrow. I suppose,
too, that the various groups of the
university may view the university
variously: the students, the faculty,
the Schools and Departments, the aca
demic and administrative officers, the
Trustees, the alumni and indeed even
the general public. Of these groups,
it is highly probable that the faculty,
officers and Trustees have more
knowledge of the whole university
than has any of the other groups.
This is so because they have and will
continue to have more experience
with and responsibility for the univer
sity's policies and programs. . . .
Let me begin by speaking once
again—because I have done it several
times to earlier student generations
and briefly—about the structure of
this University. Later I should like to
speak in a broader context about uni
versities.
Board of Trustees
The authority under which Stanford
University operates derives by Char
ter from the State of California and
is vested in a Board of Trustees. The
basis of this Charter is the Founding
Grant and its Amendments which

were executed in the lifetimes of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Twice since
then the Trustees have sought a
court decree to amend the Grant.
They were successful in both cases.
The legal and constitutional authority
under which Stanford, then, operates
is vested in this Board of Trustees,
which meets monthly, except in
August...
The President of the University is
appointed by the Trustees ...
He is responsible to the Trustees
for the programs and operations of
the University. In the discharge of
this responsibility he recommends to
the Trustees appointments of Univer
sity faculty and officers, academic
curricula and degrees, matters of fac
ulty and administrative organization,
matters affecting student organiza
tion, activities and conduct, matters
concerned with the use and develop
ment of University land and build
ings, and, of course, the annual
budget.
In the formulation of these recom
mendations, the President does not
act in solitary confinement —although
there are times when that condition
has its attractions. A recommendation
for a faculty appointment begins in
the appropriate Department and us
ually involves a national search; de
partmental recommendations are re
viewed by the Dean of the School,
then by an elected Faculty Commit
tee of 7 called the Advisory Board,
and finally by the President...
Student Government
Student government at Stanford de
rives its being by delegation from the
Trustees. It began years ago when
