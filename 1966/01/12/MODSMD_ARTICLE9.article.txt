# Rivers Attacks Slanted News

### BOB FISHMAN 
Communications department profes
sor William P. Rivers charged today
that "government officials who can
rationalize all misrepresentations as
action in the public interest" are a
leading source of slanted and distort
ed news.
Speaking under the auspices of the
Stanford Author's Coffee Hour, Pro
fessor Rivers discussed topics from
his recently published book, The Opin
ion Makers.
In addition to public officials, Pro
fessor Rivers listed publishers and the
"newspaper elite" as major influences
on the news. He identified the "elite"
as "men like Walter Lippmann and
James Reston who write better than
the others, and whose research and
phrases are freely borrowed." Conse
quently, says Rivers, "we have over
600 active reporters in Washington,
but .far fewer original opinions."
As for publishers, Rivers main
tained that their influence on the
news has been overrated. "Publishers
do not understand the complexity of
Washington reporting." He also stated
that "publishers have no control over
'stars' like Reston who can get a job
with any paper."
Discarding stories of a "news man
agement conspiracy," Rivers empha
sized that much distortion can be
traced to the "personal prejudices of
reporters at work."
