## 
### 
Students interested in learn
ing more about the civil rights
movement and gaining an activi
ty credit in the process are need
ed to work on KZSU's Project
South. Since last quarter, six
students who spent last summer
in the South have been directing
the editing and analysis of more
than 300 hours of interviews
with civil rights leaders and
workers, mass meetings and
"action" tapes recorded in Mis
sissippi, Louisiana, Alabama,
Georgia, and North Carolina.
A series of radio programs for
national distribution will be pro
duced. No experience is neces
sary for students wishing to
help, although some typing abil
ity is useful.
Interested students should
call the Project South Office at
extension 4002 or come by the
office in Room 592-R, on the top
floor of the Old Union's North
Wing, above the Nitery.
