## ROMAN IN THE GLOAMIN' 
### (By the author of "Rally Round the Flag, Boys!", "Dobie Gillis," etc 
Now as the end of the first semester draws near, one fact
emerges clearly: you are all going to flunk out of school.
There are two things you can do about it. First, you can
marry money. (I don't mean you marry the money itself; I
mean you marry a person who has money. Weddings be
tween people and currency have not been legal anywhere in
the United States since the Smoot-Hawley Act. Personna®
Stainless Steel Blades, on the other hand, are legal every
where and are, indeed, used with great pleasure and satis
faction in all fifty states of the Union and Duluth. I bring
up Personna Stainless Steel Blades because this column is
sponsored by the makers of Personna Stainless Steel Blades,
and they are inclined to get edgy if I omit to mention their
product. Some of them get edgy and some get double-edgy
because Personna Blades come both in Injector style and
Double Edge style.)
But I digress. I was saying you can marry money but, of
course, you will not because you are a high-minded, clean
living, pure-hearted, freckle-faced American kid. Therefore,
to keep from flunking, you must try the second method:
you must learn how to take lecture notes.
According to a recent survey, eleven out of ten American
undergraduates do not know the proper way to take lecture
notes. To illustrate this appalling statistic, let us suppose
you are taking a course in history. Let us further suppose
the lecturer is lecturing on the ruling houses of England.
You listen intently. You write diligently in your notebook,
making a topic outline as you have been taught. Like this:
I. House of Plantagenet. ________

11. House of Lancaster.
111. House of York.

Then you stop. You put aside your pen. You blink back
a tear, for you cannot go on. Oh, yes, you know very well
that the next ruling house is the House of Tudor. The trou
ble is you don't know the Roman numeral that comes after
111.
It may, incidentally, be of some comfort to learn that
you are not the only people who don't know Roman numer
als. The fact is, the Romans never knew them either. Oh, I
suppose they could tell you how much V or X were or like
that, but when it came to real zingers like LXI or MMC,
they just flang away their styluses and went downtown to
have a bath or take in a circus or maybe stab Caesar a few
times.
You may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous
numerals when the Arabs had such a nice, simple system.
Well, sir, the fact is that Emperor Vespasian tried like crazy
to buy the Arabic numerals from Suleiman The Magnificent,
but Suleiman wouldn't do business—not even when Vespa
sian raised his bid to 100,000 gold piastres, plus he offered
to throw in the Colosseum, the Appian Way, and Techni
color.
So Rome stuck with Roman numerals—to its sorrow, as
it turned out. One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny got
to arguing about how much is CDL times MVIX. Well, sir,
pretty soon everyone in town came around to join the has
sle. In all the excitement, nobody remembered to lock the
north gate and—wham! before you could say ars longa—in
rushed the Gotlis, the Visigoths, and the Green Bay Packers!
Well, sir, that's the way the empire crumbles, and I di
gress. Let's get back to lecture notes. Let's also say a word
about Burma Shave®. Why? Because Burma Shave is made
by the makers of Personna Blades who, it will be recalled,
are the sponsors of this column. They are also the sponsors
of the ultimate in shaving luxury. First coat your kisser
with Burma Shave, regular or menthol—or, if you are the
devil-may-care sort, some of each. Then whisk off your stub
ble with an incredibly sharp, unbelievably durable Personna
Blade, Injector or Double Edge—remembering first to put
the blade in a razor. The result: facial felicity, cutaneous
cheer, epidermal elysium. Whether you shave every day,
every 111 days, or every VII, you'll always find Personna
and Burma Shave a winning combination.
