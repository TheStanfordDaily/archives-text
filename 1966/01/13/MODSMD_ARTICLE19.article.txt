Sandy Koufax, the sensational
southpaw pitcher, who over
whelmed opposing batters while
setting a major league strikeout
record, was the overwhelming
choice Tuesday as the Male Ath
lete of the Year for 1965 in The
Associated Press year-end poll.
The 30-year-old Los Angeles
Dodgers' star collected 224 first
place votes in the balloting by
33 sports writers and sportcast
ers.
On a basis of three points for
a first-place vote, two for sec
ond and one for third, Koufax
had 778 points. Rill Bradley,
Princeton basketball star, was a
distant second with 153 points
and South Africa's Gary Player,
winner of the U. S. Open golf
title, was third with 152 points.
Outstanding In '63
Koufax also was named the
outstanding male athlete in
19G3. The only others to be cho
sen twice were tennis star Don
Budge in 1937 and 1938 and golf
er Byron Nelson in 1944 and
1945. The AP poll originated in
1931.
Koufax struck out 382 batters
last season, topping the mark of
348 established by Cleveland's
Bob Feller in 1946. The Dodger
left-hander won 26 games and
lost eight, and led the National
League in earned run average

for the fourth consecutive year
with 2 04. He also pitched his
fourth no-hit game, another ma
jor league record.
Koufax, a Brooklyn native
and Studio City. Calif., resident,
won two World Series games, in
cluding the seventh in which he
shut out Minnesota 2-0 and
struck out 10 members of the
hard-hitting Twins. He 1 was voted
the Cy Young Award as the ma
jors' outstanding pitcher.
Bradley a Standout
Bradley, a standout during the
regular season, sparked Prince
ton the NCAA semifinals before
the Tigers bowed to Michigan.
In his farewell college appear
ance, he set an NCAA tourna
ment record by scoring 58 points
against Wichita.
Bradley finished his career
with 2,530 points, fourth highest
on the all-time list of major-col
lege scorers. During the 1964-65
campaign, he averaged 30.5
points for 29 games and finished
third in scoring.
Player, in becoming the first
foreigner in 45 years to win the
U. S. title, joined Gene Sarazen
and Ben Hogan as the only golf
ers to make a career sweep of
the sport's four major events â€”
the U. S. and British Opens, the
Masters and the PGA. Last year,
he also won the World Series of
Golf and World Match Play
Tournament.
