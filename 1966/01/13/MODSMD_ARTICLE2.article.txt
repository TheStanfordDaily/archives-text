# Students Will Picket In The Grape Boycott
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
Plans for Stanford participation—in
the form of picket lines—in a nation
wide boycott of grape products from
the Delano area will be discussed at
an open meeting in Tresidder Room
270 at 4:15 today.
The Canterbury Foundation, the
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM), and Stanford Friends of
SNCC will sponsor the meeting.
Three Stores
The Stanford group is one of many
throughout the nation picketing and
leafleting grocery and liquor stores in
an effort to stop the purchase of De
lano grapes and Schenley wines and
liquors.
Local establishments tentatively
scheduled to be picketed tomorrow
and Saturday are the liquor Store at
Rickey's Hyatt House, the U-Save
Liquor Store, and possibly Ernie's—
all on El Camino Real.
"This is not a boycott of these
stores, but only of Schenley products
and table grapes," emphasized junior
Brian Packham, who is directing the
project in the Stanford area. Schenley
farms are among those being struck
in the Delano area.
Several local stores have already
agreed to remove the products from
their shelves in cooperation with the
boycott, Peckham said.
UCCM has sent weekly contingents
to Delano to observe and participate
in a grape-pickers' strike against

gfowers in the area since the begin
ning of the school year. Canterbury
and UCCM also sponsored a work
project over Christmas vacation which
included support for the strike in
both the Bay Area and Delano.
Since last summer, as many as 3000
grape pickers in Tulare and Kern
Counties in California's Central Valley
have been on strike in demand of
higher wages and a union contract.
Two unions, the Agricultural Work
ers' Organizing Committee, a predomi
nantly Filippino group affiliated with
AFL-CIO, and the Farm Workers' As
sociation, an independent organization
whose membership is mainly Mexi
can-American, have led the effort.
Strikebreakers
Growers in the area refused to rec
ognize the pickers' demands, and im
ported strikebreakers. As a conse
quence, the autumn crop was harvest
ed per usual. The present boycott is
an effort to affect the growers at the
retail level.
The situation has received national
attention as the largest agricultural
strike since the 1930'5.
According to Peckham, picketing
will begin at 2 p.m. Friday, and will
continue until 8 p.m. If enough people
are willing to participate, pickets will
also work the same hours Saturday,
he said.
The meeting today "is planned to
provide information on the boycott
to anyone who wishes to participate,"
Peckham concluded.
