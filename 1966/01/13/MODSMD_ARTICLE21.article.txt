# Dean Wert's Resignation
## 
### 
The impending resignation of Robert J. Wert
from his posts of dean of undergraduate educa
tion and vice-provost can either mark the end
of an all-too-brief era in student-administration
communication or lead to a continuation and ex
pansion of this policy
We did not—and do not—always agree with
Dean Wert, especially in his handling of the
Union closure and the Faculty Master plan at
Wilbur; however, he—unlike many of his prede
cessors and contemporaries—was willing to dis
cuss and negotiate problems that concerned
students. His work on the lengthy and complex
judicial reform question is exemplary of this
type of concern. He opposed much, but at least
granted his opponents due recognition as intelli
gent and sincere people, which is enough to set
him aside from many in the administration. And
it should be noted, as LASSU Speaker Jay Ka
dane did recently, that Dean Wert—like Associ
ate Dean of Students Joel Smith—is, on occasion,
"not in a position to speak for himself."
Indeed, we think those miscues which the
Dean was largely responsible for during his
tenure as Stanford's first Dean of Undergraduate
Education resulted in part from the dual nature
of his job. For lie was not only assigned the task
of making innovations in the field of undergrad
uate education, he was also asked to retain his
post as Vice-Provost. Indeed since Frederick
Terman s retirement last September, his job has
been enlarged still further to include the Pro
vost's function of chairing a staff which regulates
faculty appointments and department expendi
tures.

This dual role sometimes led to decisions that
—especially in the case of the Faculty Master
plan—were hastily made without any student
consultation. When the Dean could concentrate
much time and effort on a problem—such as
freshman curriculum reform and the judicial
competence bill—the results, though not entirely
satisfying to many student leaders, were notable.
In picking Dean Wert's successor, we would
suggest that President Sterling give some con
sideration to re-evaluating the nature of the job.
Although we do not often find ourselves opting
for an increase in the administrative bureau
cracy, we think it might be wisest to establish
the deanship of undergraduate education as a
separate, full-time job.
Moreover, we would hope that Dean Wert's
successor would continue and expand the pres
ent philosophy of undergraduate education—at
least as it is practiced in the Dean's office—in
that it acknowledges and endorses the concept
of ed ucational value in non-classroom, even non
campus, activities. This belief—a welcome devia
tion from the administration's autonomous 'inner
city syndrome—has led the Dean to undertake
such projects as obtaining a grant from the
Carnegie Foundation to subsidize a work-study
project in the surrounding community.
If the new dean of undergraduate education
expands these commitments—to honest negotia
tion and continued and enlarged communica
tion with students—then Dean Wert's tentative
efforts will have marked a beginning and not
an end to a temporary phase of administration
cooperation.
