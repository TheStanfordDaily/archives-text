# KADANE'S COROLLARY:
## A 						Mythology Of Student Power 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
The drousing legislators hardly noticed
last week, but Speaker of LASSU Jay Ka
dane was making some important and dis
turbing assertions in his "State of the
Legislature" address. Said Kadane:
"I have eome to the conclusion, reluctant
ly and wit h great sorrow, that student
power within the University, to the extent
that we have power, is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the
campus and its attendant bad publicity for
the University. . . . For reasons I cannot
fathom, the University prefers to toy with
disaster, and forces us into this role."
The first thing to be said about Mr. Ka
dane's dramatic assertion is that it is
wrong, dangerously wrong. To state that
student power is based "ultimately on the
threat of disruption of life on the campus
and its attendant bad publicity" is to dis
tort the truth and to traffic all too heavily
in the kind of irresponsible fuzzy-minded
ness for which the newest generation of
student activists is well noted.
No Ultimate' Power
The source of Mr. Kadane's "great sor
row," it seems, is bis long-awaited realiza
tion of the fundamental fact that students
have no "ultimate" power in the Univer
sity. As President Sterling wisely empha
sized in Tuesday's convocation address,
they cannot influence University policy or
gain reforms without the consent of the
administration and, "ultimately," the Board
of Trustees, which has final responsibility
for all the affairs of the University.
Because of this fact of life, Mr. Kadane
has concluded, the only way for students to
exert any ultimate power is to blackjack
the administration into submission with
threats of "bad publicity." He is talking, of
course, about the kinds of tactics used in
the deliberately premature release of the
Crowe-Halverson report and, in the ex
treme case, about the threat of sit-ins like
those at Berkeley last year.
Mr. Kadane's errors are manifest, and it
is most alarming that he himself, an intel
ligent and able leader, does not see them.
His basic failure is in ignoring the fact that
student power, while not "ultimate," is
nevertheless considerable. The role of stu
dent government is constantly increasing

and the student viewpoint is given ever
more weight. That power has grown, not
according to the weight of the students'
bludgeon, but according to their ability to
convince the administration and faculty
that they will use it wisely and responsibly.
In the area of reform, Mr. Kadane fur
ther ignores the fact that many of the ma
jor reforms of the past few years have
come from the vigorous and responsible
presentation of valid arguments by student
leaders to the administration. In short, stu
dents can get reform under the present sys
tem.
The Banana-Republic Model
But Mr. Kadane is impatient with this
process, and he yearns for a university in
which students should have real power in
determining University policy, all on sort
of a banana-republic model in which stu
dents could overrule the judgments of a
cowed administration and, if necessary, the
turncoat faculty.
I suggest that this thinking is wholly im
practical. It can best be analyzed, I think,
as an exercise in applied mythology, for
Mr. Kadane. like most student leaders, gets
led astray by two disturbingly prevalent
myths about student government and the
University.
The first myth, served up for our general
consumption every spring in the student
body elections, is that students have a right
to an equal say in the running of the Uni
versity.
This myth of student "co-equality" is a
product of self-infatuation on the part of
student leaders. The plain fact is that stu
dents have neither the expertise nor the
interest to be given any ultimate responsi
bility in most areas of administration pol
icy. We have considerable difficulty just
running the student government and the
many political organizations, where the
constant turnover of leadership leads to
chaos enough.
Advice Still Needed
This is not to say that students' advice
on matters affecting students should not be
sought. It should indeed, and perhaps even
more than it is now, as President Sterling
admitted in yesterday's address. The per
spective gained by such advice can be in
valuable, and administrators universally

recognize this. But to give students the
kind of ultimate power which Mr. Kadane
seems to be seeking is impractical. It would
be pure folly.
But Mr. Kadane, in his frustration at be
ing "forced into his role" of threatening
disruption of campus life, stumbles on an
other myth, the myth that the administra
tion is some sort of anti-student conspiracy.
Administrators, and particularly the Board
of Trustees, he argues, "prefer to toy with
disaster ..." by refusing to see the stu
dent viewpoint.
No one will deny that administrators
sometimes do not take sufficient time to
understand student feelings—as apparently
in the case of Union residence. But neither
do students try to understand the practical
matters which often force certain univer
sity policy decisions, matters of finance,
space requirements, and, yes, public or
alumni opinion: matters which, whether we
like it or not, simply cannot be ignored. A
greater effort at understanding on the part
of both students and administrators would
undoubtedly have most salutary results.
Administrators Not Ogres
But administrators, despite shortcomings,
are not ogres as some would have us be
lieve. Far from considering students as a
"necessary evil," as The Daily actually edi
torialized last year, they are by and large
reasonable men trying to do a job for stu
dents in the best way they can. They have
proven more than willing to listen to the
student viewpoint when it is put before
them in a responsible manner.
This mythology of the persecuted stu
dent and the unyielding, unreasonable ad
ministration is one of the most unfortunate
developments of the new activism. But the
Kadane corrollary—that threats of disrup
tion are the only way to reform —is more
disturbing still. These tactics may well foroe
reform—coercion has a remarkable history
of success in the world—but only at the
price of future ill will between students and
administration. Such mutual distrust leads
to the kind of "lack of communication" and,
in the end. lack of progress, which Mr. Ka
dane himself is the first to deplore.
If the student viewpoint is to continue to
be heard, and once heard, taken seriously,
then this sort of thinly - veiled blackmail
must be brought to an end.
The drousing legislators hardly noticed

dane was making some important and dis
turbing assertions in his "State of the

"I have eome to the conclusion, reluctant

campus and its attendant bad publicity for
the University. . . . For reasons I cannot

dane was making some important and dis
turbing assertions in his "State of the
Legislature" address. Said Kadane:
"I have eome to the conclusion, reluctant
ly and wit h great sorrow, that student
power within the University, to the extent
that we have power, is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the
campus and its attendant bad publicity for
the University. . . . For reasons I cannot
fathom, the University prefers to toy with
disaster, and forces us into this role."
The first thing to be said about Mr. Ka
dane's dramatic assertion is that it is
wrong, dangerously wrong. To state that
student power is based "ultimately on the
threat of disruption of life on the campus
and its attendant bad publicity" is to dis
tort the truth and to traffic all too heavily
in the kind of irresponsible fuzzy-minded
ness for which the newest generation of
student activists is well noted.
No Ultimate' Power
The source of Mr. Kadane's "great sor
row," it seems, is bis long-awaited realiza
tion of the fundamental fact that students
have no "ultimate" power in the Univer
sity. As President Sterling wisely empha
sized in Tuesday's convocation address,
they cannot influence University policy or
gain reforms without the consent of the
administration and, "ultimately," the Board
of Trustees, which has final responsibility
for all the affairs of the University.
Because of this fact of life, Mr. Kadane
has concluded, the only way for students to
exert any ultimate power is to blackjack
the administration into submission with
threats of "bad publicity." He is talking, of
course, about the kinds of tactics used in
the deliberately premature release of the
Crowe-Halverson report and, in the ex
treme case, about the threat of sit-ins like
those at Berkeley last year.
Mr. Kadane's errors are manifest, and it
is most alarming that he himself, an intel
ligent and able leader, does not see them.
His basic failure is in ignoring the fact that
student power, while not "ultimate," is
nevertheless considerable. The role of stu
dent government is constantly increasing

and the student viewpoint is given ever
more weight. That power has grown, not
according to the weight of the students'
bludgeon, but according to their ability to
convince the administration and faculty
that they will use it wisely and responsibly.
In the area of reform, Mr. Kadane fur
ther ignores the fact that many of the ma
jor reforms of the past few years have
come from the vigorous and responsible
presentation of valid arguments by student
leaders to the administration. In short, stu
dents can get reform under the present sys
tem.
The Banana-Republic Model
But Mr. Kadane is impatient with this
process, and he yearns for a university in
which students should have real power in
determining University policy, all on sort
of a banana-republic model in which stu
dents could overrule the judgments of a
cowed administration and, if necessary, the
turncoat faculty.
I suggest that this thinking is wholly im
practical. It can best be analyzed, I think,
as an exercise in applied mythology, for
Mr. Kadane. like most student leaders, gets
led astray by two disturbingly prevalent
myths about student government and the
University.
The first myth, served up for our general
consumption every spring in the student
body elections, is that students have a right
to an equal say in the running of the Uni
versity.
This myth of student "co-equality" is a
product of self-infatuation on the part of
student leaders. The plain fact is that stu
dents have neither the expertise nor the
interest to be given any ultimate responsi
bility in most areas of administration pol
icy. We have considerable difficulty just
running the student government and the
many political organizations, where the
constant turnover of leadership leads to
chaos enough.
Advice Still Needed
This is not to say that students' advice
on matters affecting students should not be
sought. It should indeed, and perhaps even
more than it is now, as President Sterling
admitted in yesterday's address. The per
spective gained by such advice can be in
valuable, and administrators universally

recognize this. But to give students the
kind of ultimate power which Mr. Kadane
seems to be seeking is impractical. It would
be pure folly.
But Mr. Kadane, in his frustration at be
ing "forced into his role" of threatening
disruption of campus life, stumbles on an
other myth, the myth that the administra
tion is some sort of anti-student conspiracy.
Administrators, and particularly the Board
of Trustees, he argues, "prefer to toy with
disaster ..." by refusing to see the stu
dent viewpoint.
No one will deny that administrators
sometimes do not take sufficient time to
understand student feelings—as apparently
in the case of Union residence. But neither
do students try to understand the practical
matters which often force certain univer
sity policy decisions, matters of finance,
space requirements, and, yes, public or
alumni opinion: matters which, whether we
like it or not, simply cannot be ignored. A
greater effort at understanding on the part
of both students and administrators would
undoubtedly have most salutary results.
Administrators Not Ogres
But administrators, despite shortcomings,
are not ogres as some would have us be
lieve. Far from considering students as a
"necessary evil," as The Daily actually edi
torialized last year, they are by and large
reasonable men trying to do a job for stu
dents in the best way they can. They have
proven more than willing to listen to the
student viewpoint when it is put before
them in a responsible manner.
This mythology of the persecuted stu
dent and the unyielding, unreasonable ad
ministration is one of the most unfortunate
developments of the new activism. But the
Kadane corrollary—that threats of disrup
tion are the only way to reform —is more
disturbing still. These tactics may well foroe
reform—coercion has a remarkable history
of success in the world—but only at the
price of future ill will between students and
administration. Such mutual distrust leads
to the kind of "lack of communication" and,
in the end. lack of progress, which Mr. Ka
dane himself is the first to deplore.
If the student viewpoint is to continue to
be heard, and once heard, taken seriously,
then this sort of thinly - veiled blackmail
must be brought to an end.
The drousing legislators hardly noticed
last week, but Speaker of LASSU Jay Ka
dane was making some important and dis
turbing assertions in his "State of the
Legislature" address. Said Kadane:
"I have eome to the conclusion, reluctant

campus and its attendant bad publicity for

"I have eome to the conclusion, reluctant
ly and wit h great sorrow, that student
power within the University, to the extent
that we have power, is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the
campus and its attendant bad publicity for
the University. . . . For reasons I cannot
fathom, the University prefers to toy with
disaster, and forces us into this role."
The first thing to be said about Mr. Ka
dane's dramatic assertion is that it is
wrong, dangerously wrong. To state that
student power is based "ultimately on the
threat of disruption of life on the campus
and its attendant bad publicity" is to dis
tort the truth and to traffic all too heavily
in the kind of irresponsible fuzzy-minded
ness for which the newest generation of
student activists is well noted.
No Ultimate' Power
The source of Mr. Kadane's "great sor
row," it seems, is bis long-awaited realiza
tion of the fundamental fact that students
have no "ultimate" power in the Univer
sity. As President Sterling wisely empha
sized in Tuesday's convocation address,
they cannot influence University policy or
gain reforms without the consent of the
administration and, "ultimately," the Board
of Trustees, which has final responsibility
for all the affairs of the University.
Because of this fact of life, Mr. Kadane
has concluded, the only way for students to
exert any ultimate power is to blackjack
the administration into submission with
threats of "bad publicity." He is talking, of
course, about the kinds of tactics used in
the deliberately premature release of the
Crowe-Halverson report and, in the ex
treme case, about the threat of sit-ins like
those at Berkeley last year.
Mr. Kadane's errors are manifest, and it
is most alarming that he himself, an intel
ligent and able leader, does not see them.
His basic failure is in ignoring the fact that
student power, while not "ultimate," is
nevertheless considerable. The role of stu
dent government is constantly increasing

and the student viewpoint is given ever
more weight. That power has grown, not
according to the weight of the students'
bludgeon, but according to their ability to
convince the administration and faculty
that they will use it wisely and responsibly.
In the area of reform, Mr. Kadane fur
ther ignores the fact that many of the ma
jor reforms of the past few years have
come from the vigorous and responsible
presentation of valid arguments by student
leaders to the administration. In short, stu
dents can get reform under the present sys
tem.
The Banana-Republic Model
But Mr. Kadane is impatient with this
process, and he yearns for a university in
which students should have real power in
determining University policy, all on sort
of a banana-republic model in which stu
dents could overrule the judgments of a
cowed administration and, if necessary, the
turncoat faculty.
I suggest that this thinking is wholly im
practical. It can best be analyzed, I think,
as an exercise in applied mythology, for
Mr. Kadane. like most student leaders, gets
led astray by two disturbingly prevalent
myths about student government and the
University.
The first myth, served up for our general
consumption every spring in the student
body elections, is that students have a right
to an equal say in the running of the Uni
versity.
This myth of student "co-equality" is a
product of self-infatuation on the part of
student leaders. The plain fact is that stu
dents have neither the expertise nor the
interest to be given any ultimate responsi
bility in most areas of administration pol
icy. We have considerable difficulty just
running the student government and the
many political organizations, where the
constant turnover of leadership leads to
chaos enough.
Advice Still Needed
This is not to say that students' advice
on matters affecting students should not be
sought. It should indeed, and perhaps even
more than it is now, as President Sterling
admitted in yesterday's address. The per
spective gained by such advice can be in
valuable, and administrators universally

recognize this. But to give students the
kind of ultimate power which Mr. Kadane
seems to be seeking is impractical. It would
be pure folly.
But Mr. Kadane, in his frustration at be
ing "forced into his role" of threatening
disruption of campus life, stumbles on an
other myth, the myth that the administra
tion is some sort of anti-student conspiracy.
Administrators, and particularly the Board
of Trustees, he argues, "prefer to toy with
disaster ..." by refusing to see the stu
dent viewpoint.
No one will deny that administrators
sometimes do not take sufficient time to
understand student feelings—as apparently
in the case of Union residence. But neither
do students try to understand the practical
matters which often force certain univer
sity policy decisions, matters of finance,
space requirements, and, yes, public or
alumni opinion: matters which, whether we
like it or not, simply cannot be ignored. A
greater effort at understanding on the part
of both students and administrators would
undoubtedly have most salutary results.
Administrators Not Ogres
But administrators, despite shortcomings,
are not ogres as some would have us be
lieve. Far from considering students as a
"necessary evil," as The Daily actually edi
torialized last year, they are by and large
reasonable men trying to do a job for stu
dents in the best way they can. They have
proven more than willing to listen to the
student viewpoint when it is put before
them in a responsible manner.
This mythology of the persecuted stu
dent and the unyielding, unreasonable ad
ministration is one of the most unfortunate
developments of the new activism. But the
Kadane corrollary—that threats of disrup
tion are the only way to reform —is more
disturbing still. These tactics may well foroe
reform—coercion has a remarkable history
of success in the world—but only at the
price of future ill will between students and
administration. Such mutual distrust leads
to the kind of "lack of communication" and,
in the end. lack of progress, which Mr. Ka
dane himself is the first to deplore.
If the student viewpoint is to continue to
be heard, and once heard, taken seriously,
then this sort of thinly - veiled blackmail
must be brought to an end.
The drousing legislators hardly noticed
last week, but Speaker of LASSU Jay Ka
dane was making some important and dis
turbing assertions in his "State of the
Legislature" address. Said Kadane:
"I have eome to the conclusion, reluctant
ly and wit h great sorrow, that student
power within the University, to the extent
that we have power, is based ultimately
on the threat of disruption of life on the
campus and its attendant bad publicity for
the University. . . . For reasons I cannot
fathom, the University prefers to toy with
disaster, and forces us into this role."
The first thing to be said about Mr. Ka
