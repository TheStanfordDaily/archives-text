# Most Would Prefer War Against Poverty Than VC

### MARK SAPIR 
At registration for the winter
quarter th e Freedom Draft
Movement of the SCPV conduct
ed a poll on the war in Vietnam
and its relationship to the draft.
The poll was constructed to
measure response to the position
of the anti-draft group while
also attempting to get a "fair
cross section" of opinion on the
war.
The Freedom Draft Movement
is opposed not to all war per se
but to this war and to an Ameri
can foreign policy which seeks
to dictate to other nations how
they will run their affairs, to
other peoples what they must
believe, and to Americans what
they must die for.
Poll Results
The results of their poll along
with FDM comments were re
leased by the group and are ex
cerpted below. 1500 question
naires were distributed by hand
to men only. 640 were returned
by Thursday January 6. The bal
lot consisted of four opinion

questions and three information
questions and an introduction
asking for comments and an
swers "regardless of your
views."
The information section asked
whether students were under
graduate or graduate students,
whether they were classified
1-A, and in which state their
Draft Board was located. Of 314
undergrads, 165 are from Cali
fornia Draft Boards. 28 of these
students (17%) are classified 1-A
and at least 10% more have not
yet been classified this year. Of
the California undergraduates
those who support American
policy in Vietnam have about 2
times the incidence of 1-As.
Graduate students from Califor
nia are only slightly worse off
with 12 1-As out of 66 men
(18%). There are 1-As on cam
pus from most of the major
states in the country.
Bare Plurality
The opinion section results
were as follows:
1) Do you oppose United
States policies in South Viet
nam?
yes: 291 (46%) no: 302 (47%)
some: 29 (5%).
2) Do you support military
conscription?
yes: 400 (63%) no: 205 (32%)
sometimes included with yes.
3) Do you agree with us that
it is undemocratic for our gov
ernment to assume the right to
use a person to implement a for
eign policy with which he is in
basic moral and or political dis
agreement?
yes: 235 (37%) no: 318 (48%).
4) Do you believe you would
be better serving democracy by
a) fighting in Vietnam; b) us
ing your talents toward the de
velopment and implementation
of political, social, and economic
progress here or abroad.
a) 78 (12%) b) 439 (69%) both
(7%) neither (5%).
It is apparent that many peo
ple who oppose American inter
vention still support the need for
a draft at least under certain
conditions. Question 3 was in
terpreted in many different
ways and a significant number
of people could not or would not
answer (15%).
'Undemocratic' Intentional
The use of the word undemo
cratic to describe American for
eign policy and its relation to
the draft age male was intention
al. The FDM is aware that a
democracy is governed by th e
will of the majority. What we
are suggesting in No. 3 is that
this concept of social organiza
tion breaks down when the so
called majority (i.e. the Admin
istration) believes it can commit
individuals to give their lives
for principles which are person
ally alien. This seems to us to be
just as accurately described to
talitarian as democratic. Of
course daily decisions must be
made by the government with
out consulting the people, but
not decisions regarding the sac
rifice of life (yours or ours).
Question 4 also raised some
eyebrows, but the results are
quite unusual. About 60% of
those who do not, and all of
those who do oppose the war
would rather let other people
do the fighting while they are
doing something more construc
tive.
