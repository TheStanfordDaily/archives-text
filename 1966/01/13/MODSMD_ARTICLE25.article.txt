## 'Inner City' Reform 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The year I left the multiver
sity, a few students had a great
dream: we could have a voice in
our academic lives if only we
organized. If we learned to talk
their language, we could make
the faculty and administration
respond to our needs. We could
improve the advising system,
c h a n g e curriculum require
ments, even criticize and alter
the courses. The plan died with
our graduation, but the prob
lems, which were common to all
students, remained to cause un
rest.
I was surprised by the vigor
and self-consciousness of Stan
ford students, who in one year
ousted a dean, liberalized wom
en's rules, and reformed the
judicial structure. But I suggest
that these efforts, which tacitly
accept the classic division of life
into the classroom and the extra
curricular, are misguided. It is
to swallow the sop and leave the
meal.
"I've learned more outside of
class than in" is nearly a tru
ism, for things extra-curricular
are more important in a stu
dent's life than his classes.
Whatever maturity we achieve
is no fault of the faculty. So
that, when something seems
wrong, it is natural to look for
causes outside the classroom.
But this is to solve the wrong
problem. It is the classroom, the
curriculum, the faculty, which
are the cause.
To the extent that the locus
of our lives is outside the class
room, the educators have failed,
pretending that the search for
knowledge can be divorced from
the search for values. I think
this abdication of responsibility
the heart of the Berkeley
protests: I think it is the cause
of dissatisfaction here. I am
equally convinced that the im
petus for improvement must
come from the students.
This letter is in response to
Jay Kadane's address to LASSU.
His goals were wrong, for he
sought causes outside the class
room. Instead of bringing beer
on campus, students should
work to involve themselves in
the direction of their education,
to make the classroom a m or e
meaningful experience, respon
sive to their needs. While an im
possible goal at the multiversity,
the dream could be realized here;
the lesson of last year is that
anything can be had merely by
threatening the sanctity of the
inner city with the glare of pub
lic attention.

Editor, The Daily:
You have done a real service
by publishing Joe Rosenbloom's
article on right wing alumni crit

ieism of Dr. Christian Bay. It is
important for students to be
aware that the administration is
always being subjected to pres
sures of this sort.
I would like to go on record
as being most appreciative, out
of my own experience, of th e
way in which the Stanford ad
ministration has ensured the
right of full freedom of expres
sion and action to its faculty.
There have been a number of oc
casions since I joined the faculty
when the administration has
been importuned to get rid of
religion professors who take
stands on public issues. Whether
the irate letter centered on Prop
osition 14. or the Delano strike,
or civil rights, or defending stu
dent demonstrations, or picket
ing, or going to jail, or being
"suspiciously friendly" to Ro
man Catholics, I have never
once felt the hint of a sugges
tion from the a d m in is t ration
that it would be "better for the
University" if we stopped or lim
ited whatever involvement we
felt was proper. The fact that
such letters usually are accom
panied by the withdrawal of fi
nancial support of the university
makes the administration's stand
the more significant.
But it should also be recorded
that there are many more alum
ni than the irate ones — Stan
ford graduates who fully believe
that the right of dissent is a pre
cious right that the university
must not only protect but active
ly foster.
The basic issue, of course, is
that the presentation of conflict
ing points of view is the very
life-blood of a university, and
that the moment one subscribes
to the notion that all should
think alike, he has ceased to
think about a university and has
started thinking about a propa
ganda mill. Thus if people want
to be disturbed about Stanford,
let them not be disturbed that it
employs a man like Dr. Bay who
speaks out against the views of
the political establishment, but
that there are not more of us
who raise our voices in the forth
right way he does. I do not hap
pen to share all of his views on
Vietnam, but in my own think
ing about Vietnam I am glad
he is around to disturb what
otherwise might become a com
placent and static analysis of
that tragic situation.
Those who would curtail the
public exchange of opinion that
Stanford fosters, do not demon
strate to me a clear conviction
that they have the truth others
need. Rather, they display a
frantic fear that they may be
wrong and that therefore they
would prefer not to be disturbed
by possible alternatives.

accept the classic division of life
into the classroom and the extra

to swallow the sop and leave the
meal.
"I've learned more outside of
class than in" is nearly a tru
ism, for things extra-curricular
are more important in a stu
dent's life than his classes.
Whatever maturity we achieve
is no fault of the faculty. So
that, when something seems
wrong, it is natural to look for
causes outside the classroom.
But this is to solve the wrong
problem. It is the classroom, the
curriculum, the faculty, which
are the cause.
To the extent that the locus
of our lives is outside the class
room, the educators have failed,
pretending that the search for
knowledge can be divorced from
the search for values. I think
this abdication of responsibility
the heart of the Berkeley
protests: I think it is the cause
of dissatisfaction here. I am
equally convinced that the im
petus for improvement must
come from the students.
This letter is in response to
Jay Kadane's address to LASSU.
His goals were wrong, for he
sought causes outside the class
room. Instead of bringing beer
on campus, students should
work to involve themselves in
the direction of their education,
to make the classroom a m or e
meaningful experience, respon
sive to their needs. While an im
possible goal at the multiversity,
the dream could be realized here;
the lesson of last year is that
anything can be had merely by
threatening the sanctity of the
inner city with the glare of pub
lic attention.

You have done a real service
by publishing Joe Rosenbloom's
article on right wing alumni crit

ieism of Dr. Christian Bay. It is
important for students to be
aware that the administration is
always being subjected to pres
sures of this sort.
I would like to go on record
as being most appreciative, out
of my own experience, of th e
way in which the Stanford ad
ministration has ensured the
right of full freedom of expres
sion and action to its faculty.
There have been a number of oc
casions since I joined the faculty
when the administration has
been importuned to get rid of
religion professors who take
stands on public issues. Whether
the irate letter centered on Prop
osition 14. or the Delano strike,
or civil rights, or defending stu
dent demonstrations, or picket
ing, or going to jail, or being
"suspiciously friendly" to Ro
man Catholics, I have never
once felt the hint of a sugges
tion from the a d m in is t ration
that it would be "better for the
University" if we stopped or lim
ited whatever involvement we
felt was proper. The fact that
such letters usually are accom
panied by the withdrawal of fi
nancial support of the university
makes the administration's stand
the more significant.
But it should also be recorded
that there are many more alum
ni than the irate ones — Stan
ford graduates who fully believe
that the right of dissent is a pre
cious right that the university
must not only protect but active
ly foster.
The basic issue, of course, is
that the presentation of conflict
ing points of view is the very
life-blood of a university, and
that the moment one subscribes
to the notion that all should
think alike, he has ceased to
think about a university and has
started thinking about a propa
ganda mill. Thus if people want
to be disturbed about Stanford,
let them not be disturbed that it
employs a man like Dr. Bay who
speaks out against the views of
the political establishment, but
that there are not more of us
who raise our voices in the forth
right way he does. I do not hap
pen to share all of his views on
Vietnam, but in my own think
ing about Vietnam I am glad
he is around to disturb what
otherwise might become a com
placent and static analysis of
that tragic situation.
Those who would curtail the
public exchange of opinion that
Stanford fosters, do not demon
strate to me a clear conviction
that they have the truth others
need. Rather, they display a
frantic fear that they may be
wrong and that therefore they
would prefer not to be disturbed
by possible alternatives.

The year I left the multiver
sity, a few students had a great
dream: we could have a voice in
our academic lives if only we
organized. If we learned to talk
their language, we could make
the faculty and administration
respond to our needs. We could
improve the advising system,
c h a n g e curriculum require
ments, even criticize and alter
the courses. The plan died with
our graduation, but the prob
lems, which were common to all
students, remained to cause un
rest.
I was surprised by the vigor
and self-consciousness of Stan
ford students, who in one year
ousted a dean, liberalized wom
en's rules, and reformed the
judicial structure. But I suggest
that these efforts, which tacitly

the search for values. I think
this abdication of responsibility
the heart of the Berkeley
protests: I think it is the cause
of dissatisfaction here. I am
equally convinced that the im
petus for improvement must
come from the students.
This letter is in response to
Jay Kadane's address to LASSU.
His goals were wrong, for he
sought causes outside the class
room. Instead of bringing beer
on campus, students should
work to involve themselves in
the direction of their education,
to make the classroom a m or e
meaningful experience, respon
sive to their needs. While an im
possible goal at the multiversity,
the dream could be realized here;
the lesson of last year is that
anything can be had merely by
threatening the sanctity of the
inner city with the glare of pub
lic attention.

You have done a real service
by publishing Joe Rosenbloom's
article on right wing alumni crit

ieism of Dr. Christian Bay. It is
important for students to be
aware that the administration is
always being subjected to pres
sures of this sort.
I would like to go on record
as being most appreciative, out
of my own experience, of th e
way in which the Stanford ad
ministration has ensured the
right of full freedom of expres
sion and action to its faculty.
There have been a number of oc
casions since I joined the faculty
when the administration has
been importuned to get rid of
religion professors who take
stands on public issues. Whether
the irate letter centered on Prop
osition 14. or the Delano strike,
or civil rights, or defending stu
dent demonstrations, or picket
ing, or going to jail, or being
"suspiciously friendly" to Ro
man Catholics, I have never
once felt the hint of a sugges
tion from the a d m in is t ration
that it would be "better for the
University" if we stopped or lim
ited whatever involvement we
felt was proper. The fact that
such letters usually are accom
panied by the withdrawal of fi
nancial support of the university
makes the administration's stand
the more significant.
But it should also be recorded
that there are many more alum
ni than the irate ones — Stan
ford graduates who fully believe
that the right of dissent is a pre
cious right that the university
must not only protect but active
ly foster.
The basic issue, of course, is
that the presentation of conflict
ing points of view is the very
life-blood of a university, and
that the moment one subscribes
to the notion that all should
think alike, he has ceased to
think about a university and has
started thinking about a propa
ganda mill. Thus if people want
to be disturbed about Stanford,
let them not be disturbed that it
employs a man like Dr. Bay who
speaks out against the views of
the political establishment, but
that there are not more of us
who raise our voices in the forth
right way he does. I do not hap
pen to share all of his views on
Vietnam, but in my own think
ing about Vietnam I am glad
he is around to disturb what
otherwise might become a com
placent and static analysis of
that tragic situation.
Those who would curtail the
public exchange of opinion that
Stanford fosters, do not demon
strate to me a clear conviction
that they have the truth others
need. Rather, they display a
frantic fear that they may be
wrong and that therefore they
would prefer not to be disturbed
by possible alternatives.

The year I left the multiver
sity, a few students had a great
dream: we could have a voice in
our academic lives if only we
organized. If we learned to talk
their language, we could make
the faculty and administration
respond to our needs. We could
improve the advising system,
c h a n g e curriculum require
ments, even criticize and alter
the courses. The plan died with
our graduation, but the prob
lems, which were common to all
students, remained to cause un
rest.
I was surprised by the vigor
and self-consciousness of Stan
ford students, who in one year
ousted a dean, liberalized wom
en's rules, and reformed the
judicial structure. But I suggest
that these efforts, which tacitly
accept the classic division of life
into the classroom and the extra
curricular, are misguided. It is
to swallow the sop and leave the
meal.
"I've learned more outside of
class than in" is nearly a tru
ism, for things extra-curricular
are more important in a stu
dent's life than his classes.
Whatever maturity we achieve
is no fault of the faculty. So
that, when something seems
wrong, it is natural to look for
causes outside the classroom.
But this is to solve the wrong
problem. It is the classroom, the
curriculum, the faculty, which
are the cause.
To the extent that the locus
of our lives is outside the class
room, the educators have failed,
pretending that the search for
knowledge can be divorced from
the search for values. I think
this abdication of responsibility
the heart of the Berkeley
protests: I think it is the cause
of dissatisfaction here. I am
