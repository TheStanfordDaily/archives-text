# Grads Favor Small Firms

### MARSHA ROOD 
Not all Stanford Business School
graduates are looking for employment
in General Electric or U. S. Steel.
Fifty second-year men in the Business
School are eager for opportunities to
think big with small business.
As Daniel Alper of the School says,
"I am looking for a company which
will permit me to express my own
opinions frankly and let me exercise
my own initiative. I am anxious to
avoid the formal organizational set-up
which characterizes larger compa
nies."
Two second-year students in the
Masters in Business Administration
(MBA) program have formed the
Small Business Placement Committee
to seek jobs in which they can use a
variety of the skills and techniques
they've learned at school. In large
businesses usually the skills asked for
are only in one functional area.
Premium on Initiative
According to Leonard Theran, head
of the Stanford Student Small Busi
ness Committee, the companies sought
by the group have relatively small
management teams with a few func

tional specialists. They place a premi
um on initiative and individual contri
bution.
To achieve their objectives the stu
dents have developed a program which
seeks to inform potential employers
of the MBA students' interest in small
business managemgent, to create an
awareness in the business community
of the value of the students, and to
provide an avenue of communication
between these two groups.
In the past, students have found it
difficult to find positions in small
firms. According to W. L. Lane, direc
tor of business placement for the Uni
versity, smaller companies find it dif
ficult to spend time to carry out exten
sive college recruiting programs.
About 400 companies come to Stan
ford each year to interview 200 busi
ness school graduates, but few are
small or even medium-size.

Statistics show that most of the
Stanford Business School's 1965 class
went to work for companies with over
1,000 employees and 50 per cent joined
companies of over 15.000. The trend
toward big companies is increasing
yearly. Despite the trend, a sizeable
number of the 1966 class has indicated
a preference for smaller companies if
the right job can be found.
Harvard was first to form a com
mittee to promote interest in small
business. Stanford followed seven
years later, and these organizations
are the only two in the country.
Prospective employers interested in
contacting these students should write

About 400 companies come to Stan
ford each year to interview 200 busi
ness school graduates, but few are
small or even medium-size.

Statistics show that most of the
Stanford Business School's 1965 class
went to work for companies with over
1,000 employees and 50 per cent joined
companies of over 15.000. The trend
toward big companies is increasing
yearly. Despite the trend, a sizeable
number of the 1966 class has indicated
a preference for smaller companies if
the right job can be found.
Harvard was first to form a com
mittee to promote interest in small
business. Stanford followed seven
years later, and these organizations
are the only two in the country.
Prospective employers interested in
contacting these students should write

Not all Stanford Business School
graduates are looking for employment
in General Electric or U. S. Steel.
Fifty second-year men in the Business
School are eager for opportunities to
think big with small business.
As Daniel Alper of the School says,
"I am looking for a company which
will permit me to express my own
opinions frankly and let me exercise
my own initiative. I am anxious to
avoid the formal organizational set-up
which characterizes larger compa
nies."
Two second-year students in the
Masters in Business Administration
(MBA) program have formed the
Small Business Placement Committee
to seek jobs in which they can use a
variety of the skills and techniques
they've learned at school. In large
businesses usually the skills asked for
are only in one functional area.
Premium on Initiative
According to Leonard Theran, head
of the Stanford Student Small Busi
ness Committee, the companies sought
by the group have relatively small
management teams with a few func

tional specialists. They place a premi
um on initiative and individual contri
bution.
To achieve their objectives the stu
dents have developed a program which
seeks to inform potential employers
of the MBA students' interest in small
business managemgent, to create an
awareness in the business community
of the value of the students, and to
provide an avenue of communication
between these two groups.
In the past, students have found it
difficult to find positions in small
firms. According to W. L. Lane, direc
tor of business placement for the Uni
versity, smaller companies find it dif
ficult to spend time to carry out exten
sive college recruiting programs.
