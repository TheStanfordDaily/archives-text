Room and board rates are probably
going up next year, according to an
announcement in the new University
Bulletin.
Dwight Adams, University Business
manager, said the increase would be
the first for student residences in four
years.
Present room and board bills are
$1020 per year, with a breakdown of
$420 for room, $600 for board. Adams
said the last increase was in 1962,
when room and board was $915.
"Compared to other colleges and
universities," said Adams, "we are
generally in a higher echelon in costs.
We are toward the top for private in
stitutions, although many others are
higher."
Last year tuition was increased
$150. Adams said the University us
ually increased bills every other year,
alternating between increases in tui
tion and in room and board.
Normally, room and hoard would
have been raised two years ago, but
costs were held down and an increase
was unnecessary. Adams could make
no predictions how much next year's
increase would be.
