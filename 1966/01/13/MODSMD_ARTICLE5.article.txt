present post through the end of the
current academic year.
He told The Daily last night that
"the pending retirement from active
teaching of Prof. William Cowley, who
was my major professor, creates an
opportunity for me to carry on his
work. It's difficult to choose between
the excitement of administrative work
and the satisfaction of studying and
teaching and writing. I've tried to
combine the two, but it's not easy.
"Higher education needs more
analysis and criticism; it needs more
appraisal and interpretation. After 15
years, mainly in administrative work,
I've decided to contribute more broad
ly to the field of higher education and
to teach the Stanford students who
will want to study that field.
"As a Stanford faculty member, I
shall hope to continue serving the
University in every way possible."
Wert also announced that he would
be resigning his post as vice-provost,
which he has held since 1959. Since
there is no Provost at present, Wert
is currently chairing the Provost's
committee, which regulates faculty
appointments and department curri

cula.
Wort was appointed (loan in 1963
and has served as vice-provost sincc
1959. Ho also holds a position as pro
fessor in the School of Education, du
ties to which ho will devote a larger
share of his attention in the future.
Commenting on his request, Presi
dent Sterling said: "I am grateful to
Professor Wert for his work and ac
complishments as dean of undergrad
uate education and as chairman of the
committee on undergraduate educa
tion. I am also gratified that his ex
perience and knowledge will continue
to be available to his colleagues, and
T extend to him every good wish as he
directs more of his time and attention
to the important field of higher educa
tion."
During his two years as undergrad
uate dean, Wert has strengthened liai
son among all those concerned with
undergraduate life at Stanford and
worked for "constant, pervasive, rela
tively small-scale testing and ap
praisal of new ideas," in his own
words.
Several of these have sought to in
tegrate dormitory and extracurricular
student life with the academic pro
gram of the University. The experi
mental teaching of Western Civiliza
tion courses in freshman living units,
the faculty master plan for Wilbur
Hall, and planning for Stanford's first
coeducational living units are ex
amples.
Working in close cooperation with

faculty committees, Wert also has
helped organize the first undergradu
ate special courses, taught by faculty
from the law, business and medical
schools; inaugurated the freshman
seminar program; and developed a
proposal seeking to integrate class
room instruction with field work in
areas of social concern.
Wert told The Daily, "I've been
privileged to work closely with Pres
ident Sterling, first as his assistant
and next as a University offieer. The
day to day association with him and
with his staff has been an exceptional
educational experience. More than
that, it has shown me that imagina
tive leadership can be combined with
humor, warmth and friendship."

Dean Wert has taught seminars for
Ph.D. candidates in the humanities
and currently is teaching a seminar
in higher education for undergraduate
students. During the past year he has
worked intensively with students, fac
ulty'and fellow University officers in

ROBERT J. WERT
Robert J. Wert, 43, Stanford's first
dean of undergraduate edueation, has
requested to be relieved of his office
in order to have more time for leach
ing and research in higher education,
President Wallace Sterling disclosed
yesterday.
No definite time has been set for the
change, but Wert will remain in his
present post through the end of the
current academic year.
He told The Daily last night that
"the pending retirement from active
teaching of Prof. William Cowley, who
was my major professor, creates an
opportunity for me to carry on his
work. It's difficult to choose between
the excitement of administrative work
and the satisfaction of studying and
teaching and writing. I've tried to
combine the two, but it's not easy.
"Higher education needs more
analysis and criticism; it needs more
appraisal and interpretation. After 15
years, mainly in administrative work,
I've decided to contribute more broad
ly to the field of higher education and
to teach the Stanford students who
will want to study that field.
"As a Stanford faculty member, I
shall hope to continue serving the
University in every way possible."
Wert also announced that he would
be resigning his post as vice-provost,
which he has held since 1959. Since
there is no Provost at present, Wert
is currently chairing the Provost's
committee, which regulates faculty
appointments and department curri

cula.
Wort was appointed (loan in 1963
and has served as vice-provost sincc
1959. Ho also holds a position as pro
fessor in the School of Education, du
ties to which ho will devote a larger
share of his attention in the future.
Commenting on his request, Presi
dent Sterling said: "I am grateful to
Professor Wert for his work and ac
complishments as dean of undergrad
uate education and as chairman of the
committee on undergraduate educa
tion. I am also gratified that his ex
perience and knowledge will continue
to be available to his colleagues, and
T extend to him every good wish as he
directs more of his time and attention
to the important field of higher educa
tion."
During his two years as undergrad
uate dean, Wert has strengthened liai
son among all those concerned with
undergraduate life at Stanford and
worked for "constant, pervasive, rela
tively small-scale testing and ap
praisal of new ideas," in his own
words.
Several of these have sought to in
tegrate dormitory and extracurricular
student life with the academic pro
gram of the University. The experi
mental teaching of Western Civiliza
tion courses in freshman living units,
the faculty master plan for Wilbur
Hall, and planning for Stanford's first
coeducational living units are ex
amples.
Working in close cooperation with

faculty committees, Wert also has
helped organize the first undergradu
ate special courses, taught by faculty
from the law, business and medical
schools; inaugurated the freshman
seminar program; and developed a
proposal seeking to integrate class
room instruction with field work in
areas of social concern.
Wert told The Daily, "I've been
privileged to work closely with Pres
ident Sterling, first as his assistant
and next as a University offieer. The
day to day association with him and
with his staff has been an exceptional
educational experience. More than
that, it has shown me that imagina
tive leadership can be combined with
humor, warmth and friendship."

Dean Wert has taught seminars for
Ph.D. candidates in the humanities
and currently is teaching a seminar
in higher education for undergraduate
students. During the past year he has

ROBERT J. WERT
Robert J. Wert, 43, Stanford's first
dean of undergraduate edueation, has
requested to be relieved of his office
in order to have more time for leach
ing and research in higher education,
President Wallace Sterling disclosed
yesterday.
No definite time has been set for the
change, but Wert will remain in his
present post through the end of the
current academic year.
He told The Daily last night that
"the pending retirement from active
teaching of Prof. William Cowley, who
was my major professor, creates an
opportunity for me to carry on his
work. It's difficult to choose between
the excitement of administrative work
and the satisfaction of studying and
teaching and writing. I've tried to
combine the two, but it's not easy.
"Higher education needs more
analysis and criticism; it needs more
appraisal and interpretation. After 15
years, mainly in administrative work,
I've decided to contribute more broad
ly to the field of higher education and
to teach the Stanford students who
will want to study that field.
"As a Stanford faculty member, I
shall hope to continue serving the
University in every way possible."
Wert also announced that he would
be resigning his post as vice-provost,
which he has held since 1959. Since
there is no Provost at present, Wert
is currently chairing the Provost's
committee, which regulates faculty
appointments and department curri

cula.
Wort was appointed (loan in 1963
and has served as vice-provost sincc
1959. Ho also holds a position as pro
fessor in the School of Education, du
ties to which ho will devote a larger
share of his attention in the future.
Commenting on his request, Presi
dent Sterling said: "I am grateful to
Professor Wert for his work and ac
complishments as dean of undergrad
uate education and as chairman of the
committee on undergraduate educa
tion. I am also gratified that his ex
perience and knowledge will continue
to be available to his colleagues, and
T extend to him every good wish as he
directs more of his time and attention
to the important field of higher educa
tion."
During his two years as undergrad
uate dean, Wert has strengthened liai
son among all those concerned with
undergraduate life at Stanford and
worked for "constant, pervasive, rela
tively small-scale testing and ap
praisal of new ideas," in his own
words.
Several of these have sought to in
tegrate dormitory and extracurricular
student life with the academic pro
gram of the University. The experi
mental teaching of Western Civiliza
tion courses in freshman living units,
the faculty master plan for Wilbur
Hall, and planning for Stanford's first
coeducational living units are ex
amples.
Working in close cooperation with

faculty committees, Wert also has
helped organize the first undergradu
ate special courses, taught by faculty
from the law, business and medical
schools; inaugurated the freshman
seminar program; and developed a
proposal seeking to integrate class
room instruction with field work in
areas of social concern.
Wert told The Daily, "I've been
privileged to work closely with Pres
ident Sterling, first as his assistant
and next as a University offieer. The
day to day association with him and
with his staff has been an exceptional
educational experience. More than
that, it has shown me that imagina
tive leadership can be combined with
humor, warmth and friendship."
Seminar Teacher
Dean Wert has taught seminars for
Ph.D. candidates in the humanities
and currently is teaching a seminar
in higher education for undergraduate
students. During the past year he has
worked intensively with students, fac
ulty'and fellow University officers in
a substantial revision of the student
judicial system.
Wert was a member of the Califor
nia Master Plan Survey Team for
higher education in 1959-60. He served
five years on the California Coordi
nating Council for Higher Education,
including the presidency of this group
from 1960 to 1963. H ewas vice-chair
man of the American Council on Edu
cation during 1963. He is a trustee of
Mills College and Menlo School and
College and is currently Chairman of
the Board of the Education Testing
