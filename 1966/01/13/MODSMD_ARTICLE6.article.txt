# A 						RECORD HIGH
## Membership Of I-Club Increases 
### 
One campus organization which has
had a phenomenal rate of growth
since last spring is the International
Club, more familiarly known as the

I • Club, located between Florence
Moore and the Faculty Club.
Last spring the I-Club's members
numbered approximately 350, largely
foreign students. Because of the en
thusiasm with which this year's di
verse program has been carried out,
the club has attracted enough "new
members to bring its present member
ship to more than 700.
According to the president, Alain
Berdugo, a graduate student from
Morocco, the club's purposes are two
fold: to make foreign students feel
more at home on campus, and to en
courage associations among American
students and foreign students.
"The name sometimes stops people,"
he says. Du Pare went on to say that
last year, when the T-Club's member
ship was roughly half its present num
ber, he was disturbed because foreign
students often lived off campus and
tended to associate mostly with stu
dents of their own nationality. "Stu
dents began to criticize the U. S. They
were displeased with their stay here."
he said. "I asked them if Ihcy had met
many American students, and they
said 'no'."
Du Pare feels that the I-Club has
done much during the last quarter to
help nationality groups to associate

with many different kinds of people.
To encourage social interchange, the
I-Club is now helping to sponsor a va
riety of activities open to any inter
ested students, foreign or American.
Deodat Agpo, the I-Club's treasurer
from Ghana, emphasizes that the I-
Center is open to everyone: "Th is
place is not meant only for foreign
students."
