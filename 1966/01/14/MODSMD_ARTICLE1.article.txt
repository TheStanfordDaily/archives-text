# 'Risers' Offer New Way Of Life
## 
### SUE WICKIZER News Editor 
The migration from Union Resi
dence to Hoskins House has become
more than just a survival plan for
most Union women. They are finding
themselves challenged by the added
responsibility and independence in a
normal life situation.
As one ex-Unionite explained, "There
is an assumption at Hoskins that you
are a human being. It is a way of life
not dictated by the structure of the
university and takes away the obvious
ivory towerness."
However, girls from Union refuse
to compare their old life with life at
Hoskins. "This is joyous living," one
woman said, "but it doesn't negate
our efforts to remain in Union. These
are two different ways of life and
can't be compared."
The normalness of life at Hoskins
fascinates most Union girls. There is
an adventure in "facing your own cas
serole," "discovering a cheese grader
exists," and "preparing a candlelight
dinner."
Regular People
Yet it is more than just "playing
house" which challenges them. It is
the feeling of being a member of the

world outside, rather than living in
a sheltered community.
"I like being in the world of regu
lar people," one girl said. "It is a
chance to find out what it is to live."
"You aren't being taken care of,"
another ex-Unionite explained. "It
makes one feel less like a little girl."
Instead of a retreat from university
life, for most Union girls Hoskins of
fers a very real context into which
university lifr* fits. One woman de
scribed it as "the flowering of the
individual which we have long been
fighting for."
More Perspective
"When I was at Union," a senior
who had almost moved to Lagunita,
commented, "I got sucked into the
whirlpool of interests and concerns
on campus. Now I find my activities
much more something I choose to do.
I have more of a sense of perspec
tive."
"One can impress oneself so
much more on one's surroundings,"
another senior said. "You surround
yourself with the things you love and
you know this is your place."
Union girls also find some lighter
virtues to the good life at Hoskins—
such as the time saved walking from

Union to Tresidder, the instant study
break provided w h en washing the
dishes, and the comforting sight of
recognizing exactly what one is eat
ing.
Paradoxically, most Unionites
moved to Hoskins reluctantly expect
ing the lesser of two evils.
"I felt it would be going back to my
freshman year if I moved into another
dorm from Union," one junior said.
Comparison Difficult
"I would have been more unhappy
in another dorm," a second Unionite
commented. "I would have compared
it constantly to Union. This is dissim
ilar enough so that I can't make a
comparison."
And there are drawbacks to life at
Hoskins. The initial cost is more than
living in a campus dorm. One student
estimated that she and her roommate
will each spent $."S0 to furnish their
apartment.
The rent for an apartment is $40
more a quarter than the room bill for
a dormitory. And as one girl frankly
admits, "The apartments are not
worth $120 a month. I feel like a slum
landlord on the eighth floor. They
are constructed like a tenement, there
are kids playing in the street, and
low-rise barracks which spread out
below."
Although the view is inspiring if
one doesn't look straight down, and
each apartment is equipped with a

balcony, a junior pointed out that the
ceiling didn't quite meet the walls
and tiien knocked on the walls to pro
duce a reverberating echo.
'Apartnientalized'
Distance from campus is also a
problem. Although it can be solved
by hitchhiking, as one girl does, or
by a love for walking, most admitted
that life could be a real problem with
out a car.
Perhaps the major drawback of
Hoskins is its "apartmentalized" at
mosphere. According to a senior. "We
lack a community between people."
"People no longer just casually
drop by," another student said. "There
is some running back and forth, but
only with people who were close to
begin with."
The women from Union are living
on the top three floors of Hoskins,
and most agree that they have a good
deal of contact with one another.
They admit though that it could be
very isolated living, especially for
"people who a r e oblivious to their
surroundings."
However, Union girls gave Hoskins
more of a plus rating than any other
campus dormitory. They were unani
mous in their agreement that Hos
kins provides a needed alternative to
Stanford women's housing. Most ex
pressed the hope that Hoskins would
be only the half-way house between
dormitory and off-campus living.

comparison."
And there are drawbacks to life at
Hoskins. The initial cost is more than
living in a campus dorm. One student
estimated that she and her roommate
will each spent $."S0 to furnish their
apartment.
The rent for an apartment is $40
more a quarter than the room bill for
a dormitory. And as one girl frankly
admits, "The apartments are not
worth $120 a month. I feel like a slum
landlord on the eighth floor. They
are constructed like a tenement, there
are kids playing in the street, and
low-rise barracks which spread out
below."
Although the view is inspiring if
one doesn't look straight down, and
each apartment is equipped with a

balcony, a junior pointed out that the
ceiling didn't quite meet the walls
and tiien knocked on the walls to pro
duce a reverberating echo.
'Apartnientalized'
Distance from campus is also a
problem. Although it can be solved
by hitchhiking, as one girl does, or
by a love for walking, most admitted
that life could be a real problem with
out a car.
Perhaps the major drawback of
Hoskins is its "apartmentalized" at
mosphere. According to a senior. "We
lack a community between people."
"People no longer just casually
drop by," another student said. "There
is some running back and forth, but
only with people who were close to
begin with."
The women from Union are living
on the top three floors of Hoskins,
and most agree that they have a good
deal of contact with one another.
They admit though that it could be
very isolated living, especially for
"people who a r e oblivious to their
surroundings."
However, Union girls gave Hoskins
more of a plus rating than any other
campus dormitory. They were unani
mous in their agreement that Hos
kins provides a needed alternative to
Stanford women's housing. Most ex
pressed the hope that Hoskins would
be only the half-way house between
dormitory and off-campus living.
The migration from Union Resi
dence to Hoskins House has become
more than just a survival plan for
most Union women. They are finding
themselves challenged by the added
responsibility and independence in a
normal life situation.
As one ex-Unionite explained, "There
is an assumption at Hoskins that you
are a human being. It is a way of life
not dictated by the structure of the
university and takes away the obvious
ivory towerness."
However, girls from Union refuse
to compare their old life with life at
Hoskins. "This is joyous living," one
woman said, "but it doesn't negate
our efforts to remain in Union. These
are two different ways of life and
can't be compared."
The normalness of life at Hoskins
fascinates most Union girls. There is
an adventure in "facing your own cas
serole," "discovering a cheese grader
exists," and "preparing a candlelight
dinner."
Regular People
Yet it is more than just "playing
house" which challenges them. It is
the feeling of being a member of the

world outside, rather than living in
a sheltered community.
"I like being in the world of regu
lar people," one girl said. "It is a
chance to find out what it is to live."
"You aren't being taken care of,"
another ex-Unionite explained. "It
makes one feel less like a little girl."
Instead of a retreat from university
life, for most Union girls Hoskins of
fers a very real context into which
university lifr* fits. One woman de
scribed it as "the flowering of the
individual which we have long been
fighting for."
More Perspective
"When I was at Union," a senior
who had almost moved to Lagunita,
commented, "I got sucked into the
whirlpool of interests and concerns
on campus. Now I find my activities
much more something I choose to do.
I have more of a sense of perspec
tive."
"One can impress oneself so
much more on one's surroundings,"
another senior said. "You surround
yourself with the things you love and
you know this is your place."
Union girls also find some lighter
virtues to the good life at Hoskins—
such as the time saved walking from

Union to Tresidder, the instant study
break provided w h en washing the
dishes, and the comforting sight of
recognizing exactly what one is eat
ing.
Paradoxically, most Unionites
moved to Hoskins reluctantly expect
ing the lesser of two evils.
"I felt it would be going back to my
freshman year if I moved into another
dorm from Union," one junior said.
Comparison Difficult
"I would have been more unhappy
in another dorm," a second Unionite
commented. "I would have compared
it constantly to Union. This is dissim

an adventure in "facing your own cas
serole," "discovering a cheese grader
exists," and "preparing a candlelight
dinner."
Regular People
Yet it is more than just "playing
house" which challenges them. It is
the feeling of being a member of the

world outside, rather than living in
a sheltered community.
"I like being in the world of regu
lar people," one girl said. "It is a
chance to find out what it is to live."
"You aren't being taken care of,"
another ex-Unionite explained. "It
makes one feel less like a little girl."
Instead of a retreat from university
life, for most Union girls Hoskins of
fers a very real context into which
university lifr* fits. One woman de
scribed it as "the flowering of the
individual which we have long been
fighting for."
More Perspective
"When I was at Union," a senior
who had almost moved to Lagunita,
commented, "I got sucked into the
whirlpool of interests and concerns
on campus. Now I find my activities
much more something I choose to do.
I have more of a sense of perspec
tive."
"One can impress oneself so
much more on one's surroundings,"
another senior said. "You surround
yourself with the things you love and
you know this is your place."
Union girls also find some lighter
virtues to the good life at Hoskins—
such as the time saved walking from

Union to Tresidder, the instant study
break provided w h en washing the
dishes, and the comforting sight of
recognizing exactly what one is eat
ing.
Paradoxically, most Unionites
moved to Hoskins reluctantly expect
ing the lesser of two evils.
"I felt it would be going back to my
freshman year if I moved into another
dorm from Union," one junior said.
Comparison Difficult
"I would have been more unhappy
in another dorm," a second Unionite
commented. "I would have compared
it constantly to Union. This is dissim
ilar enough so that I can't make a
comparison."
And there are drawbacks to life at
Hoskins. The initial cost is more than
living in a campus dorm. One student
estimated that she and her roommate
will each spent $."S0 to furnish their
apartment.
The rent for an apartment is $40
more a quarter than the room bill for
a dormitory. And as one girl frankly
admits, "The apartments are not
worth $120 a month. I feel like a slum
landlord on the eighth floor. They
are constructed like a tenement, there
are kids playing in the street, and
low-rise barracks which spread out
below."
Although the view is inspiring if
one doesn't look straight down, and
each apartment is equipped with a

balcony, a junior pointed out that the
ceiling didn't quite meet the walls
and tiien knocked on the walls to pro
duce a reverberating echo.
'Apartnientalized'
Distance from campus is also a
problem. Although it can be solved
by hitchhiking, as one girl does, or
by a love for walking, most admitted
that life could be a real problem with
out a car.
Perhaps the major drawback of
Hoskins is its "apartmentalized" at
mosphere. According to a senior. "We
lack a community between people."
"People no longer just casually
drop by," another student said. "There
is some running back and forth, but
only with people who were close to
begin with."
The women from Union are living
on the top three floors of Hoskins,
and most agree that they have a good
deal of contact with one another.
They admit though that it could be
very isolated living, especially for
"people who a r e oblivious to their
surroundings."
However, Union girls gave Hoskins
more of a plus rating than any other
campus dormitory. They were unani
mous in their agreement that Hos
kins provides a needed alternative to
Stanford women's housing. Most ex
pressed the hope that Hoskins would
be only the half-way house between
dormitory and off-campus living.
The migration from Union Resi
dence to Hoskins House has become
more than just a survival plan for
most Union women. They are finding
themselves challenged by the added
responsibility and independence in a
normal life situation.
As one ex-Unionite explained, "There
is an assumption at Hoskins that you
are a human being. It is a way of life
not dictated by the structure of the
university and takes away the obvious
ivory towerness."
However, girls from Union refuse
to compare their old life with life at
Hoskins. "This is joyous living," one
woman said, "but it doesn't negate
our efforts to remain in Union. These
are two different ways of life and
can't be compared."
