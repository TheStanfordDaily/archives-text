### 
The Undergraduate Drama
Group will meet for the first
time this quarter on Sunday eve
ning at 7:30 in the Nitery Thea
ter, according to Dave Shook
hoff, student adviser to the
group.
The experimental group, un
der Professor Larry Friedland
er, began last quarter as a non
credit. freshman seminar on
play-reading. "From this point,
the size and program were ex
panded to include all undergrad
uate and a variety of dramatic
experiences," said Shookhoff, a
senior who is majoring in
Speech and Drama.
Shookhoff added that the pro
gram for winter quarter would

be determined by the members
of the group. "A nucleus of in
terested students can start with
improvisations; then scenes or
impromptu skits, and possibly
perform certain short plays."
Professor Friedlander said
that the group was open to all
undergraduates and did not re
quire any past experience. He
feels that this seminar will pro
vide an outlet of expression for
interested people who lack the
time to be in regular production.
"Through e x p e ri mentation
with the different kinds of dra
matic experiences, an individual
has the opportunity to explore
himself and has an avenue for
creative self-expression."
