# Ansermet, Suisse Romande To Appear At '66 Festival
## 
### 
The 1966 Stanford Summer
Festival of the Arts, planned for
the seven weeks between June
22 and August 6, will take as its
theme "Twentieth Century Inno
vations." It will focus on the im
portant changes in style and
form within the arts during the
period 1900-1939.
As in the past, Summer Festi
vals will feature at least one
"first" in the music world. This
year L'Orchestre de la Suisse
Romande will make its first
(and exclusive) American ap
pearance under the baton of its
world-famous conductor, Ernest
Ansermet.
"No other orchestra and no
other conductor," Virgil Whita
ker, Festival director, comment
ed, "fit our theme so perfectly.
This group has continually dis
tinguished itself for brilliant per-

formances of the 20th century
repertory, not to mention the
fact that it premiered many of
the outstanding works from this
period."
This year's Festival hopes to
strike a more even balance be
tween music and drama than in
past years, when the themes
were Shakespeare and the Mo
zart era. The visual arts and
film will also be emphasized.
Still being planned for the

Festival are appearances by an
American dramatic company
performing selections from the
repertory of the theme period,
vocal and instrumental soloists,
a string quartet, and possibly a
ballet company.
The Festival has made a ten
tative agreement with Brazilian
born pianist Bruno-Leonardo
Gelber, who has received excel
lent reviews in Europe and who
will be making his American de
but. He will perform one concert
with L'Orchestre de la Suisse
Romande and two solo concerts.
Third Season
This will be the Summer Fes
tivals' third season. The Festi
val was generated by the $100,-
000 gift of an anonymous donor
and is now supported by Stan
ford funds as well as by other
gifts to the University.
Each of Stanford's humanities
departments contributes in some
measure to the Festival pro
gram. All offer courses, insti
tutes, or workshops developing
their particular aspect of each
Festival theme.
