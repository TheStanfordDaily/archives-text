## 'Thunderball' No Blunderbuss 
### CURT KECK 
Take an lan Fleming best
seller, stir in spoonfuls Harry
Saltzman and Albert R. Brocco
li humor, bake in a four dimen
sional, ultra- violet electron
smasher. When done, sprinkle
generously with Sean Connery
and buxom bust-fulls of good
ness and you have a record
breaking sellout at the theatres.
That is the recipe likely to sky
rocket. Thunderball to the top of
moviedom's profit chart.
Thunderball is a sensational
success, not a terribly erudite
dish that we Stanford students
like to think we diet exclusively
on, but a success at any rate.
The movie's merit rests entirely
on three unbeatable commodi
ties: girls, music, and the Bond
syndrome. The female rapport
with Bond's virility and his im

age are solf-explanatory. When
considering that almost GO% of
the film was shot under water,
the music becomes the most im
portant factor in keeping the
plot alive and interesting. The
audience's attention could have
gone under for that fatal third
time had not John Barry com
posed a brilliant score.
Prelude
Carrying over from Goldfin
g-er's sensational prelude to its
main plot, Thunderball opens
with James Bond, killer by pro
fession and lover by leisure,
slugging a veiled widow in the
jaw. She turns out to be one of
the master-minds of SPECTRE,
the most vicious ring that Bond
has ever faced.
The plot, one which Fleming
was sued for stealing from an
associate, revolves around SPEC

TRE's scheme to blackmail Eng
land and the United States to
the monumental sum of 280
million dollars. SPECTRE, with
the help of plastic surgeons, cya
nide bullets, and a four-muzzled
bazooka mounted on a motorcy
cle, manages to steal a NATO
jet with two atomic bombs
aboard.
Naturally a few people get up
set about the situation, the
President of the United States
and England's Prime Minister
for example, so America's CIA
and the British 00-Section is
alerted. James Bond takes off
to Nassau foil the sinister de
signs of the plotters.
The Blob
To make a long synopsis
short, as I'm sure that most
everyone has seen the movie,
Emilio Largo, chief blob to
blunt Bond's foil, finagles 007
into some relatively unbelievea
ble situations, that is taking into
account the average Stanford
ite's experience quotient with an
international crime syndicate.
The actual dialogue of Thun
derball is Ihe most disappoint
ing facet of the movie. Although
more than half of the filming
was done underwater and, con
sequently, speaking lines were
somewhat hard to cast and
Bond's occasional puns glitter in
dullness of dialogue, Thunder
ball is different than its pred
ecessors in that guns, gimmicks,
and torso gyrations supplant
the previous Bond adventures'
acting finesse.
The Score
No review of Thunderball
could be complete with out an
unofficial score box listing of
James Bond's heroics in the
deadly murk of the sea. Emilio
Largo sets off from his cruiser
with a gang of thirteen frogmen
(dressed in marracombo black).
At the end of the encounter
with the NATO frogmen
(dressed in pretty pastels),
Bond single-handedly wipes out
ten villians and has seven as
sists.

on three unbeatable commodi
ties: girls, music, and the Bond
syndrome. The female rapport
with Bond's virility and his im

age are solf-explanatory. When
considering that almost GO% of
the film was shot under water,
the music becomes the most im
portant factor in keeping the
plot alive and interesting. The
audience's attention could have
gone under for that fatal third
time had not John Barry com
posed a brilliant score.
Prelude
Carrying over from Goldfin
g-er's sensational prelude to its
main plot, Thunderball opens
with James Bond, killer by pro
fession and lover by leisure,
slugging a veiled widow in the
jaw. She turns out to be one of
the master-minds of SPECTRE,
the most vicious ring that Bond
has ever faced.
The plot, one which Fleming
was sued for stealing from an
associate, revolves around SPEC

TRE's scheme to blackmail Eng
land and the United States to
the monumental sum of 280
million dollars. SPECTRE, with
the help of plastic surgeons, cya
nide bullets, and a four-muzzled
bazooka mounted on a motorcy
cle, manages to steal a NATO
jet with two atomic bombs
aboard.
Naturally a few people get up
set about the situation, the
President of the United States
and England's Prime Minister
for example, so America's CIA
and the British 00-Section is
alerted. James Bond takes off
to Nassau foil the sinister de
signs of the plotters.
The Blob
To make a long synopsis
short, as I'm sure that most
everyone has seen the movie,
Emilio Largo, chief blob to
blunt Bond's foil, finagles 007
into some relatively unbelievea
ble situations, that is taking into
account the average Stanford
ite's experience quotient with an
international crime syndicate.
The actual dialogue of Thun
derball is Ihe most disappoint
ing facet of the movie. Although
more than half of the filming
was done underwater and, con
sequently, speaking lines were
somewhat hard to cast and
Bond's occasional puns glitter in
dullness of dialogue, Thunder
ball is different than its pred
ecessors in that guns, gimmicks,
and torso gyrations supplant
the previous Bond adventures'
acting finesse.
The Score
No review of Thunderball
could be complete with out an
unofficial score box listing of
James Bond's heroics in the
deadly murk of the sea. Emilio
Largo sets off from his cruiser
with a gang of thirteen frogmen
(dressed in marracombo black).
At the end of the encounter
with the NATO frogmen
(dressed in pretty pastels),
Bond single-handedly wipes out
ten villians and has seven as
sists.
Take an lan Fleming best
seller, stir in spoonfuls Harry
Saltzman and Albert R. Brocco
li humor, bake in a four dimen
sional, ultra- violet electron
smasher. When done, sprinkle
generously with Sean Connery
and buxom bust-fulls of good
ness and you have a record
breaking sellout at the theatres.
That is the recipe likely to sky
rocket. Thunderball to the top of
moviedom's profit chart.
Thunderball is a sensational
success, not a terribly erudite
dish that we Stanford students
like to think we diet exclusively
on, but a success at any rate.
The movie's merit rests entirely
on three unbeatable commodi
ties: girls, music, and the Bond
syndrome. The female rapport
with Bond's virility and his im

age are solf-explanatory. When
