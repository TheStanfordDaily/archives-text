## Thoughts Upon A Chappie 
### MARSHA ROOD MARSHA COOK 
Even though this is the enter
tainment. section of the paper,
a note on the Chappie has long
been coming.
Unwittingly the Chappie is.
The Daily's criticism of the
Chappie is certainly not new to
the Stanford Community. For
a change here are a few sugges
tions to save the Chappie from
again ruining itself in the next
issue.
The Chappie has been publish

ing third-rate humor, featuring
in detail the physical function
ings of the body. But can we
build quality humor exclusively
around the armpit? the navel?
Surely the Chappie staff can rise
higher.
A Pause to Refresh
Can we lift the Chappie from
the bowels of mankind to sharp,
incisive humor? We stoop not to
hurt but to help.
This Stanford is no mean in
stitution. It is separated from
the rest of society by its tradi
tions and high standards of qual
ity, as President Sterling said
Tuesday. Because Stanford is ab
normal, concentrating sharp
analysis on its ridiculous aspects
would be welcome to the mem
bers of the community.
In sum, the Chappie needs to
concentrate more skillfully on
Stanford and less emphatically
on hormones.
Allow us to illustrate:
• Transform the Chappie's
Old Boy into The Turkey.
• Western Civ classes, senior
colloqs, "the seminar," all use
the same approach: group dis
cussion. Amazing and absurd are
the depths to which students
will go to say SOMETHING or
smoke SOMETHING or write
SOMETHING or develop THAT
look of intelligent intensity to
make them appear as if they

know what is going on. What
could be better for a cartoon
story?
Cartoons
® As for cartoons, who are
better subjects than the cashiers
in the bookstore? the hashers
in the union?
• We've long needed a parody
of LASSU.
• The creeping plague of Stan
ford anonymity might be best
illustrated by showing someone
lying on a table in the Union
having an epileptic fit, while
everyone else remains in the
womb of his group discussing
the Ira Sandperl and Joan Bacz
lecture on "Love of Humanity."
• Parodies on Lectures, char
acterizations of popular profes
sors (At home scenes, e.g., Otis
Pease taking the family to Edy's
for a cone)...
• Little quirks about the uni
versity — remodeling the back
door and underneath the stair
way in the main library.
• Stanford is moving all over
the world: Stanford-in Florence,
Stanford-in-Tours . . . why not
imagine the ultimate, Stanford
in-Gilroy.
• Titles: "Finally someone no
ticed I was new," "Being medi
ocre and wallowing in it.""The
in-group of the out-crowd," "Ec
stasy over third class mail,"
"For heaven's sake — we both
like the same things with equal
\ rit < .nsjty
While These suggestions may
not be the "ultimate" in humor,
the material for perceptive work
is certainly there. We sincerely
hope the next issue is Stanford.
