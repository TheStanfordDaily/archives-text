CHAIRS, also a two character play.

DON .JUAN, at Marines' Memorial Theater in San Francisco. It
plays Wednesday through Sunday evenings, with a Saturday mati
nee.
The Tangent is presenting George Bernard Shaw's DON JUAN

Saturday evenings their Improvisational Theater will continue to
improvise and all.
Tab Hunter and Lynn Bari are whooping it up in Neil Simon's

FILMS
Tresidder continues its Friday series on the American musical
this evening with 42nd STREET.
Saturday's New Wave film is SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER.
Both films are shown at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30 p.m.
The Sunday Flick is KISS ME, STUPID, in which Kim Novak
has a thing about being kissed by oafs. The flicks also features
clever lantern slide comments in reply to the audience's pre show
cheers. Everyone is waiting for the rumored Flash Gordon serial,
but so far it hasn't materialized. Oh, well, maybe next quarter...
HELP! said the Beatles. We are trapped behind the screen at the
Bijou, and it looks like we'll never get out. Please come and rescue
us, or it'll be another HARD DAY'S NIGHT tonight again.
The Fine Arts has Rita Tushingham in THE LEATHER BOYS,
a bittersweet tale of love among the motorcycles. Its potentially
explosive material is sensitively handled. With "Boys" is Michael
Caine in ZULU. Caine was the reluctant agent in "The Ipcress File"
some time ago.
The Guild still has REPULSION, which they would do well to get
rid of. It is the most revolting film in recent memory, about a men
tally disturbed girl who is rather hard on the man who genuinely
loves her. With it is SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS, a British
comedy.
The Paris has Rod Steiger in A TIME OF INDIFFERENCE,
dealing with marital letdowns, and an early Rita Tushingham film,
A TASTE OF HONEY.
The Park has DO NOT DISTURB, Doris Day's newest film, which
means that is exactly like all the others, and there have been in
numerable, namely a complete waste of time. The co-feature is an
equally big waste, Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack in ROBIN AND
THE SEVEN HOODS.
THAT DARN CAT is still at the Stanford, along with CLAR
ENCE, THE CROSS-EYED LION. Animal films for non-intellects.
THUNDERBALL is at the Varsity. Need we say more?
