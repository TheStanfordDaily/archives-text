# WSU, SJS Saturday; Freshmen Make Debut
## Daily Sports 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's swimming Indians
carry a 20 season record into
a heavy schedule this weekend.
The Indians host a tough Wash
ington team today at 3:30 in the
En c in a Pool. Tomorrow, the
Cards face San Jose State and
Washington State in a double
dual affair starting at 2:00.
Stanford's red hot freshman
contingent draws first blood this
Saturday when San Jose State's
frosh go against the incredible
wave. The Stanford frosh. with
two world record holders and
high school AU-Americans in
some 24 events, should have a
chance of winning the meet.
Stanford stroked past Oregon
and Oregon State last weekend.
The Tribe handled Oregon 65-30
in its first meet of the season,
then throttled the Beavers, 67-
28, to end a spotless road trip.
Washington and Washington
State should give the Indians a
rougher struggle. USC, defend
ing NCAA champion, nudged
the Huskies 51-13 in a meet last
weekend. Th e victory margin
was less than one relay's worth.
Cougars Tough. Too
Washington State fell to the
Trojans, 54-40, after putting up
a hard fight. If comparative
scores have any indicative value,
the Indians should have their
hands full this weekend.
San Jose State has always
been tough in the shorter races,
with general strength in the
stiffer events.
Washington relies on Tim
Roark and A 1 d y Meinhart for
the big points. Roark and Mein
hart, between them, can cover
just about every event except
the diving.
Roark might show up in the
100, 200, or 500 free, the 200 in
dividual medley, or the 200 fly.
Meinhart covers the same
events, and can also put in im
pressive performances at the
backstroke and breaststroke
races.
Roark and Meinhart will have
a rough race or two if they hope
to come out of today's meet with
scalps intact.
Wateh Out For Wall
Mike Wall heads the Card dis
tance freestylers. Wall will prob
ably take on all comers in the
200 and 500 freestyle races this
afternoon.
Wall, who traveled to Tokyo
with the United States Olympic
team, won the 1500 meters free
style at the Wo r 1 a Student
games in Budapest last summer.
Mark Parmely, a jack of all
strokes, usually paces Wall
down to the finish line in dis
stance races. Parmely also tacks
down first places in the 200 in
dividual medley, and 200 butter
fly-
Parmely can be counted on to
come through with a snappy
sprint in a relay, and at times
might go behind Bill Schubach
in the backstroke.
Sheerer Brute Force
Gary Sheerer bettered the

NCAA freshman 200 freestyle
record last season, and remains
a tough man to pass at that dis
tance. Sheerer can be called upon
for a top performance in the 500
free and the 200 IM, but his val
ue tomorrow will probably show
up on one 100 yard leg of the
freestyle relay.
Bob Mom sen, who placed
fourth in the outdoor AAU 200
meters breaststroke last season,
is the Tribe's big breaststroke
threat. Washington State's
Browning turned in a 1:17.5 time
against USC. Momsen, whose
best so far this season is 2:18.6
will have to hustle this Satur
day.
Bill Schubach, varsity captain,
is the tribe's backstroke threat.
Schubach won the 200 back in
both meets last weekend, and

will try to equal that achieve
ment today and tomorrow. Sehu
bach loads off the medley relay
with a 100 backstroke log.
Laney's Here Again
Jim Laney, working back into
shape after six months in Ger
many, was the conference 200 in
dividual medley champion last
year. Lancy also is a top sprint
er, and will probably see one
fourth of the freestyle relay
from a damp viewpoint.
Doug Miller turned in two out
standing butterfly times last
weekend. Miller will take butter
fly in 200 and 100 yard doses
tomorrow.
Bill Manoogian is a man to be
contended with at 100 yards but
terfly.
Bill Meyer is sitting on top
of the Tribe sprinters at 100
yards freestyle. Meyer will have
to turn a 49.0 or better today
to beat Roark, if Roark swims
there. Meyer also goes in the 50
freestyle sprint.
Derrig Handles 50
Bill Derrig, a junior, is the
Card's quickest man at 50 free
style. Derrig will be taking a
long, hard look at the 22.0 mark
this afternoon.
Craig Brown and Ken Berg
quist round out the Indian
strength in the sprints.
Charlie Burbach swims breast
stroke with Momsen, giving the
Cards a sturdily supported
breaststroke event. Burbach also
puts in a stiff 200 individual
medley when the occasion calls.
Mike Greene can be counted
on for a quick 200 freestyle
when the necessity arrives.
Saturday's meet with San Jose
and Washington State will be
run as a double dual meet. Com
petitors from all three teams
will swim at once, but the meet
will b escored as though there
were three separate dual meets
being swum.
