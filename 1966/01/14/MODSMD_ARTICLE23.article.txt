Meet a group of young Boston bankers.
Thev are executixes of I lie First National
Bank of Boston, New England's oldest
and largest. They're men on the move . . .
sharp, talented, aggressive and making
a good place in the business.
A short time ago they were doing some
soul-searching, too. "Graduation, and
then what?"
Quite honestly many of these men
never thought about banking. One of
them majored in Spanish — he's now a
credit man with our South American

operation where the language comes in
handy. Another studied Geography and
Geology; todady, he's an Operations Offi
cer in our highly specialized electronic
data processing complex.
At The FIRST, we look for diverse
educational backgrounds. Specifically,
we want men of flexibility Who can meet
the demands of unusual and challenging
situations.
If you are looking toward a career in a
growth business, take a good hard look

at The FIRST. We have the opportunities
. . . we'll even make a position for the
right man.
One of our Personnel Officers will be
on campus Friday, Jan. 21st. We suggest
that you contact your Placement Bureau
to set up an interview. If you'd like to
get a headstart, write to our Mr. Emory
Mower, The First National Bank of Bos
ton, 67 Milk Street, Boston. He'll be glad
to send you a special booklet about work
ing at The FIKST,
