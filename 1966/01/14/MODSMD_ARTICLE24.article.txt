# USC, UCLA Dribble Into Farm
## SUBJUGATE THE SOUTH! Get Two! 
### Joe Hernandez 
Six AAWU teams are current
ly tied for second place with
UCLA one game ahead of the
pack so technically the cham
pionship is as much Stanford's
as anyone else's. The Indians
will have to prove that to USC
and UCLA this weekend in an
early season basketball show
down.
Each school has 12 league
games left out of the 14 that
each team plays.
Trojans First
Stanford will face a good and
sometimes outstanding USC
squad Friday night in the Pa
vilion. Saturday afternoon at
2:30 the Tribe will tangle with
UCLA in a contest telecast on
channel 2.
Coach Howie Dallmar's In
dians are slowed slightly by in
juries, but with 6'7" Jack Gilbert
as his sixth man, Dallmar won't
have to sit up nights worrying.
Regular center Rich Baker has a
slightly pulled hamstring mus
cle and will not be able to start,
but he will definitely see action.
Gilbert is averaging 6.6 points
per contest playing part-time.
The impressive statistics about
him are his shooting percent
ages. He has made 63% of his
45 field goal attempts and 73%
of his freethrows.
Block Buster
Much of Stanford's success
against USC will depend on how
their big center, 6'9" John Block,
does. His best effort and Troy's
biggest win was a 32 point out
put against Vanderbilt. USC
won, 74-72.
Block's only weakness is that
he tires easily. If the game turns
into a runner's game, it will
give Stanford .an advantage.
Besides Block who averages
20.6, the Trojahs h av e a fast
guard in Harvey Dillon. He
scores 13.6 points per game and
is a good ball-handler.
USC has defeated some good
teams in Cincinnati, Kansas, and
Vanderbilt among their eight
victims. Two of their five losses
have come at the hands of
UCLA, Stanford's Saturday foe.
Five Veterans
Although the Bruins lost Gail
Goodrich and Keith Erickson
from last year's team, five of
the top seven players have re
turned and the current number
one guard is a sophomore.
Edgar Lacey, Doug Mcintosh,
and Mike Lynn are pretty well

set along the front line so that
leaves Coach John Wooden three
fine guards to work with.
Kenny Washington after be
ing the best sixth man in col
lege basketball for two years
has earned a starting spot.
Freddie Goss who made sec
ond team all-league last year has
recovered from back ailment,
and UCLA has not lost any of
their last six games which is
just how long he has been back.
Wooden then has to decide
what to do with sophomore Mike
Warren who was the top scorer
on the team while Goss was re
cuperating. His answer has been
to make Goss the sixth man.
UCLA's top six men are all av
eraging in double figures. Stan
ford has three men in double
figures.
Swiftest Bruins
The Bruins are admittedly the
quickest team on the coast and
for that matter in the nation.
Therefore if the Tribe can't run
with them, they must resort to
other tactics. Stanford has a
height advantage and will have

to control both backboards to
stay with the Bruins. Even if
the Indians have the same shoot
ing percentage as UCLA, they
will lose.
The reason being that UCLA
in getting the ball downcourt
quickly and taking a shot at the
first opening. Stanford plays for
the good shot, thus, leaving
them 20 or 30 shots behind
UCLA in attempts. Â»
As an added bonus, often the
more shots attempted, the more
free throws attempted.
Another problem is UCLA's
press.
With Howard Hassen to re
place one of the forwards and
Bawer and guard Rod Young on
the bench, Stanford should not
falter because of tired muscles.
If the Indians can control the
boards and either take more
shots or outs hoot UCLA in
terms of percentages, then a win
is very possible. Against USC
the tribe can win if they play
up to their potential and stop
John Block.


Gary* Petersmeyer, tongue-in-cheek sophomore
guard, drives toward two points. Petersmeyer will
start opposite sophomore guard Art Harris when
Stanford faces a dangerous USC quintet, tonight.
