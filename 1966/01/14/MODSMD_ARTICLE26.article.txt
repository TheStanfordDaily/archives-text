# ARIZONA ST. POSSIBLY No. 1
## Gymnasts Meet Powerful ASU 
### HUGH WEST 
With a powerful Arizona
State team facing him this Sat
urday, Stanford gymnastics
coach John Gilmore finds him
self thfe Victim of a perenrtial
scourge of Stanford gymnastics
teams: lack of bodies.
After a successful 6-2 season
last year, Indian gymnastics
fortunes seemed cm the upswing,
but most of Gilmore's hopefuls
for this year have managed to
abscond to distant places.
John Retternich, a steady Ail-
Around performer last year
tucked his skis under his arm
and is now in Stanford-in-Aus
tria. He will not be able to per
form for the gymnasts until
next season.

Last year's top two ringmen
plus a transfer hopeful from the
Air Force Academy have not re
turned to school.
The new NCAA rules, which
now emphasize depth, have com
pounded Gilmore's problem,
though he admits the new rules
are bettor than last year's. Pre
viously, college gymnastic
teams scored by placement, as
in swimming or track, 6 points
being awarded for a first, 4 for
a second, and so on.
This year, the NCAA has
switched to the Olympic system,
whereby the raw performance
scores (on a scale of 10) of a
team's top three men in an
event are totaled. That means
that each event, is worth a pos
sible 30 points and a meet a
possible 210.
For Gilmore, who cannot fill
all events Avith even three of the
alloted four competitors, this
system presents something of a
problem.

The Arizona State team which
Stanford will meet for the first
time in history Saturday after
noon has a potential national
champion In every event. They
have already beaten a strong
UCLA outfit 185-183, an average
team score of 8.8. Preliminary
NCAA statistics show Arizona
State with the nation's fourth
ranked Ail-Around man, the
fourth-ranked side-horse man,
the number-one man in the par
allels with a 9.6, and three ring
men over 9.4.
Leading the Stanford squad
will be Bob Cook, a returnee
from last year's squad. Cook
will go all six events, and has
already scored more than 40
points in the All-Aroimd in early
season tournaments. Last
spring, Cook placed third in the
national YMCA horizontal bar
competition.
Free-Ex Best,
Newcomers Tom Boyce and
Pete Gibson join Cook in the
Free Exercise, which shapes up

as the Indian's best event. Ted
Anstedt will work with Boyce
and Pete Pansing in the Tram
poline, and Bill Fisher will join
the varsity after a year with the
Frosh in Horizontal Bar, Long
horse and Rings.
Despite somewhat gloomy pic
ture for the Stanford team It
self, the Farm will still be the
site for some outstanding gym
nastics shows. Gilmore plans to
place some of his outstanding
freshmen and some national
champion grad students as exhi
bition competitors in the meets.
The AAWU being the toughest
gymnastics conference in the
country. Stanford's opponents
will be top-notch. California and
UCLA, pre-season favorites for
the NCAA championships, along
with Arizona State, both will
make trips to Stanford.
The meet Saturday is at
1:30 p.m. in Encina gym.
