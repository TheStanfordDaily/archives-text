# Support The Boycott
## 
### 
Today's boycott against the salt; of Schenley
products at three local liquor stores is an ex
cellent example of the type of social action in
which we feel the campus should be involved.
Sponsored by the United Campus Christian Min
istry, the Canterbury Foundation, and Stanford
Friends of SN'CC, it is a respectable, construc
tive project which certainly should not upset
the Keep-Stanford s-Name-Cloan theorists.
The reasoning behind the boycott is sound.
Since last summer, as many as 3000 grape pick
ers—mostly Filippino- and Mexican-Americans
—have been on strike against growers in Cali
fornia's Central Valley in an effort to gain a
minimal standard of living and decent working
conditions.
The growers have been steadfast. Early in the
strike, they refused to negotiate with the two
unions representing the pickers, and instead
imported scab labor into the area from as far
away as Texas to Harvest the grapes. In addition,
the growers resorted to such tactics as spraying
pickets with sulphur and hiring armed guards
to keep strikers from Routing "Huelga!' to the
se; tlvs in the fields.
Hut the strike went op. With the help of
church groups and labor unions from the Bay
Area, Detroit, and elsewhere, the pickers have
persisted, determined to succeed and committed
to the philosophy of nonviolence.
Today's boycott is an atempt to extend the
pickers' cause from the fields into the markets
by putting pressure on the Delano growers at
the retail level. Like the strike, it provides
strongly committed students—such as those from
the UCCM who have made weekly trips to De
lano since the beginning of the school year—
the opportunity to participate directly through
picketing. Unlike the strike, it provides others,
sympathetic with the plight of the grape pickers
and yet not willing to involve themselves in di
rect action, a chance to express their
simply by not buy ing Schenley wines, bourbons,
and blends.
The boycott has been organized with care. A
representative of the Farm Workers Association,
one of the two striking unions, talked to local
liquor store owners explaining the FWA's posi
tion and asking the owners to remove Schenley
products from their shelves and not reorder

tliern. Those who did not see the FW'A's position
were visited a second time. The list was nar
rowed to three—Rickey's Hyatt House, the U-
Save Liquor Store, and Cessano's.
Moreover, the picketing will be orderly. The
pickets have been instructed to silence, and
have been told to attempt no secondary boy
cotts. At their own suggestion, they will dress
neatly. Customers will not be asked not to go
into the stores in question, but rather will be
requested simply to buy non-Schenley products.
In short, we see the boycott as a worthy and
respectable cause.
And, not to leave the faculty and administra
tion out of it, may we suggest that Stanford's
upper echelons check those hard-won liquor
lockers of theirs in the Faculty Clubhouse to find
out just which brands they are consuming?
After all, Jane herself had an aversion to the
juice of certain grapes. j IIU
