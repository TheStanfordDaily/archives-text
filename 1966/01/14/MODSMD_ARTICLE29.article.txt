# Wilbur What?

Whatever happened to the Wilbur system
re-evaluation?
Last month, the Legislature reacted to Wilbur
Faculty Master Erie Hutchinson's self-appointed
evaluation committee of "old friends" by re
questing that the Committee of 15 name a more
appropriate student - faculty - administration
body to make this important study.
However, the wheels of the bureaucracy are
just barely turning. The problem deserves im
mediate considerationâ€”since such important
issues as sponsor selection must be decided soon
or the whole process will be subject to the
whims of the "autonomous" Faculty Master.
Indeed, this autonomy needs to be discussed at
length also. At the present, though, the Legisla
ture's request is on the Committee of 15's
"agenda", with no meetings of the full commit
tee planned.
\As we understand, several high administrators
would prefer to see the whole issue ignored, in
hopes that the problem will just go away.
It vyon't.
