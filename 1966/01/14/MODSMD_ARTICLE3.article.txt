# Volunteer Pickets Aid Delano Farm Strikers
## 
### JACK TRINKLEIN 
At a recruiting session held yester
day in Tresidder, 15 Stanford stu
dents volunteered to serve as pickets
for the Farm Workers Association in
their attempt to enforce a boycott of
three local liquor stores.
The three student organizations
who organized Thursday's meeting
have also declared their support of
the current grape pickers strike in
Delano.
The Canterbury Foundation, the
United Christian Ministry, and the
Stanford Friends of the Student Non
violent Coordinating Committee said
that the picketing is aimed only at
the purchase of Delano grapes and
Schenley wines and liquors.
Pickets at Rickey's Hyatt House,
U-Savc, and Cessano's Liquor Stores
are scheduled from 2:00-8:00 p.m. to
day and tomorrow. Called "consumer
information lines," the pickets will
try to dissuade prospective customers
from buying Schenley products by
distributing information on the Dela
no strike. Schenley farms are among
those being struck in Delano.
Grapes Unidentifiable
The boycott against Schenley retail
outlets was decided upon because
Schenley as a brand name is easy to
identify, and because of its involve
ment in the grape workers strike, said
Jack Yharre, bovcott co-ordinator for
the peninsula. "The grapes themselves
would be hard to identify." he added.
Among the brands boycotted are:
Roma, Cresta Blanca, and Dubonnet
wines; I. W. Harper, Ancient Age,
J. W. Dant, and Old Charter bour
bons; Dewar's White Label, 0.F.C.,
Melrose Diamond 12, MacNaughton,
Order of Merit, and Long John blends.

"We plan on putting economic pres
sure on the Schenley Corporation be
cause this is what Schenley under
stands," Ybarre said. "We are going
to go all over the peninsula — one
liquor store after another. This is
just a beginning."
The boycott in this area has been
going on since Decembr 24. Since
its declaration it has spread across
the country and has had remarkable
success, according to Ybarre.
Several local stores already have
agreed to remove Schenley products
from their shelves, Brian Pickham,
project coordinator, informed the
group.
Avoid Police
Picket behavior in order to avoid
incidences with the police was empha
sized by Ybarre. He told the group
of around 25 students that they
should engage in no conversation
while picketing. If questions come up
they should be referred to the group
captain. No secondary boycotts—the
stoppage of delivery to the stores —
will be allowed. Finally, no one is to
attempt to prevent employees from
carrying out their employer's orders.
Ybarre closed with the comment,
"They have the money and power, but
they are few and we are many."
Beginning Monday the three organi
zations will be sponsoring a fund
drive for the strikers on White Plaza,
with a table set up for that purpose.
On January 20 the FWA Mime
Troupe from Delano will perform in
Room 281 of Tresiddor at 4:15 p.m.

try to dissuade prospective customers
from buying Schenley products by
distributing information on the Dela
no strike. Schenley farms are among
those being struck in Delano.
Grapes Unidentifiable
The boycott against Schenley retail
outlets was decided upon because
Schenley as a brand name is easy to
identify, and because of its involve
ment in the grape workers strike, said
Jack Yharre, bovcott co-ordinator for
the peninsula. "The grapes themselves
would be hard to identify." he added.
Among the brands boycotted are:
Roma, Cresta Blanca, and Dubonnet
wines; I. W. Harper, Ancient Age,
J. W. Dant, and Old Charter bour
bons; Dewar's White Label, 0.F.C.,
Melrose Diamond 12, MacNaughton,
Order of Merit, and Long John blends.

"We plan on putting economic pres
sure on the Schenley Corporation be
cause this is what Schenley under
stands," Ybarre said. "We are going
to go all over the peninsula — one
liquor store after another. This is
just a beginning."
The boycott in this area has been
going on since Decembr 24. Since
its declaration it has spread across
the country and has had remarkable
success, according to Ybarre.
Several local stores already have
agreed to remove Schenley products
from their shelves, Brian Pickham,
project coordinator, informed the
group.
Avoid Police
Picket behavior in order to avoid
incidences with the police was empha
sized by Ybarre. He told the group
of around 25 students that they
should engage in no conversation
while picketing. If questions come up
they should be referred to the group
captain. No secondary boycotts—the
stoppage of delivery to the stores —
will be allowed. Finally, no one is to
attempt to prevent employees from
carrying out their employer's orders.
Ybarre closed with the comment,
"They have the money and power, but
they are few and we are many."
Beginning Monday the three organi
zations will be sponsoring a fund
drive for the strikers on White Plaza,
with a table set up for that purpose.
On January 20 the FWA Mime
Troupe from Delano will perform in
Room 281 of Tresiddor at 4:15 p.m.
At a recruiting session held yester
day in Tresidder, 15 Stanford stu
dents volunteered to serve as pickets
for the Farm Workers Association in
their attempt to enforce a boycott of
three local liquor stores.
The three student organizations
who organized Thursday's meeting
have also declared their support of
the current grape pickers strike in
Delano.
The Canterbury Foundation, the
United Christian Ministry, and the
Stanford Friends of the Student Non
violent Coordinating Committee said
that the picketing is aimed only at
the purchase of Delano grapes and
Schenley wines and liquors.
Pickets at Rickey's Hyatt House,
U-Savc, and Cessano's Liquor Stores
are scheduled from 2:00-8:00 p.m. to
day and tomorrow. Called "consumer
information lines," the pickets will
try to dissuade prospective customers
from buying Schenley products by
distributing information on the Dela
no strike. Schenley farms are among
those being struck in Delano.
