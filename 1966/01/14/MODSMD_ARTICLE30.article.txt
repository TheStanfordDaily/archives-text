# THE 						ORGAN GRINDER
## LASSU's Communal Adulation 
### BY MIKE COUZENS 
Rounds of mutual congratulation among
student leaders tend to inflate the sense
they have of their own importance. In the
rarefied air of Legislature meetings, this
can sometimes assume the proportions of
communal adulation.
Criticism of Legislature for being "un
representative" only manifests in words an
undercurrent of reaction to this' self-en
forced mystique. Legislature is not a pri
vate club, and until some members recog
nize their roles as elected servants, it will
tend to be an impotent abstraction from
student life.
Ski Club Discrimination
Last Thursday legislation was introduced
to eliminate ski club price discrimination
against nonmembers. All ski club members
had left for their winter frolic, and none
was available to defend his organization.
Debate on the subject ranged from fatu
ous to arrogant. One member expressed
amazement that the skiers had not left
people behind to defend them in the delib
erations of the evening.
Someone even asked how long in advance
the winter carnival had been planned.
Surely 800 people and The Coasters —
could have waited a week to accommodate
LASSU's pleasure!
Was there no lesson to be drawn from
last year's Stickney affair? Legislature can
no more ask Adrian Stickncv to come be

fore it and tell why his restaurants dis
criminate than it can conjure up a voice
out of the whirlwind. Not once was it al
leged last week that the ski club business
was urgent.
This attitude has also led to constant
mistrust of committees — even standing
ones with experienced members. Curious
that members who in small groups are to
be treated with suspicion Cfin gather toge
ther for, pronouncements to, be taken ox
cathedra. " „
Stage or Platform? N
The same attitude can be seen in .mem
bers who use the Legislature floor a«. a
stage rather than a platform. They r£s
iterate what has already been said—with
the only purpose, apparently, of showing
other members their erudition.
Recommendations on The Daily were
made unanimously by a subcommittee of
Publications Board last quarter. They were
also unanimously approved by Pub Board
itself, and by finance committee. But in the
protracted floor debate, someone had a
long list of questions.
Could it be that he was only flouting his
expertise? A phone call to the Daily editor
would have saved the time of 100 legisla
tors. And a legislator should not consider
his responsibilities to begin and end in
meetings, stage front, under the big top.
Finallv, the attitude was manifest in Jav

Kadane's "State of the Legislature" ad
dress. He argued: "to the extent that we
have power, it is based ultimately on the
threat of disruption of life on the cam
pus . . What, then, empowers him to say
that "Dean Smith and Dean Wert are the
two I have dealt with the most. They are
intelligent and far-sighted men, although
it must be understood that on occasion they
are not in a position to speak for them
selves?"
Dissapating Rapport
Such an evaluation is inappropriate for
the floor of Legislature. Whether accurate
or "not, it is a type of expression which dis
sipates rapport built with the greatest care.
It is not the place of the speaker to publicly
examine the motives of the men with whom
he must deal.
Central to the problem, I believe, is a
confusion between "power" and effective
ness. Legislators who are there to exorcise
power overrate their own importance. Rut
legislators who make themselves knowl
edgeable can earn support from their con
stituents and decision-making influence
from the University.
Recognizing such a role, students can
make the great contributions of which they
are capable. And administrators who recog
nize the motives for their action will wel
come their new influence.

protracted floor debate, someone had a
long list of questions.
Could it be that he was only flouting his
expertise? A phone call to the Daily editor
would have saved the time of 100 legisla
tors. And a legislator should not consider
his responsibilities to begin and end in
meetings, stage front, under the big top.
Finallv, the attitude was manifest in Jav

Kadane's "State of the Legislature" ad
dress. He argued: "to the extent that we
have power, it is based ultimately on the
threat of disruption of life on the cam
pus . . What, then, empowers him to say
that "Dean Smith and Dean Wert are the
two I have dealt with the most. They are
intelligent and far-sighted men, although

Dissapating Rapport
Such an evaluation is inappropriate for
the floor of Legislature. Whether accurate
or "not, it is a type of expression which dis
sipates rapport built with the greatest care.
It is not the place of the speaker to publicly
examine the motives of the men with whom
he must deal.
Central to the problem, I believe, is a
confusion between "power" and effective
ness. Legislators who are there to exorcise
power overrate their own importance. Rut
legislators who make themselves knowl
edgeable can earn support from their con
stituents and decision-making influence
from the University.
Recognizing such a role, students can
make the great contributions of which they
are capable. And administrators who recog
nize the motives for their action will wel
come their new influence.
Rounds of mutual congratulation among
student leaders tend to inflate the sense
they have of their own importance. In the
rarefied air of Legislature meetings, this
can sometimes assume the proportions of
communal adulation.
Criticism of Legislature for being "un
representative" only manifests in words an
undercurrent of reaction to this' self-en
forced mystique. Legislature is not a pri
vate club, and until some members recog
nize their roles as elected servants, it will
tend to be an impotent abstraction from
student life.
Ski Club Discrimination
Last Thursday legislation was introduced
to eliminate ski club price discrimination
against nonmembers. All ski club members
had left for their winter frolic, and none
was available to defend his organization.
Debate on the subject ranged from fatu
ous to arrogant. One member expressed
amazement that the skiers had not left
people behind to defend them in the delib
erations of the evening.
Someone even asked how long in advance
the winter carnival had been planned.
Surely 800 people and The Coasters —
could have waited a week to accommodate
LASSU's pleasure!
Was there no lesson to be drawn from
last year's Stickney affair? Legislature can
no more ask Adrian Stickncv to come be

fore it and tell why his restaurants dis
criminate than it can conjure up a voice
out of the whirlwind. Not once was it al
leged last week that the ski club business
was urgent.
This attitude has also led to constant
mistrust of committees — even standing
ones with experienced members. Curious
that members who in small groups are to
be treated with suspicion Cfin gather toge
ther for, pronouncements to, be taken ox
cathedra. " „

The same attitude can be seen in .mem

stage rather than a platform. They r£s

the only purpose, apparently, of showing
