## 'Mulers' And Academia 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a newcomer to this cam
pus I would like to commend
AWS, the organization that in
troduced the Muler family of
count ersps in Dinkelspiel on
Tuesday. There are several rea
sons why I feel that this partic
ular program deserves com
ment; first because it fulfilled
the classical function of teach
ing and delighting, and second
ly. because the Mulers succeed
ed in kicking the academic mind
into a realization of the
thoughts, methods, and process
es of a group whose very exist
ence is a danger to the values
of an academic community. The
subject of the Muler's dis
courses was ostensibly the Com
munist Party and the role of
the Muler's as counterspys for
the Federal Bureau of investiga
tion.
Mr. Muler began his speech
with the statement, "As a boy

I was blessed with a wonderful
father who taught me to love
this wonderful country." Then
he went on to relate the tale of
the dung of subversion which
fertilized the wife's ulcers and
bloomed into hospitalization.
Imprecating the insidious inter
national conspiracy of Commu
nists which orders the move
ment from Moscow, Mr. Muler
concluded that "Communism is
not a normal way of life."
Yes, Mr. Muler did teach and
delight us. Delight flowed from
the disparity between the
strength of Mr. Muler's patriot
ism and the weakness of his in
tellectual, or at least empirical,
approach. Mr. Muler did not in
terject one example of Commu
nist subversion in this country.
"Communism teaches you to
hate" claimed Mr. Muler, and
perhaps it does, for his hatred
of communism was evident.
Mrs. Muler did not explain why
ence to remember only one thing
if they somehow managed to
forget his discussion of Commu
nist Party Types: "Communism
is an evil way of life." And yet
Mrs. Muler did not explain why
communism is evil, or show us
any fact, and instances of com
munism being evil in this coun
try. What she did urge was an
unquestioning obedience to law
and order, the government, and
especially the investigatory arm
â€”HUAC. Mrs. Muler's belief in
the innate goodness in Our Gov
ernment was paralleled only by
her belief in God.
If Mr. Muler delighted, and
Mrs. Muler taught us about her
fear of communism, the com
bined efforts of the Mulers ad
ministered the kick that shocks
the mind of the academic com
munity. There is in this country
an emotional segment whose
thought is based on fear rather
than evidence, whose actions
and methods ignore the empiri
cal approach to decision-making,
and that group includes the
Muler's and their encouraging
friends, the FBI and the Ameri
can Legion, both of which deco
rated Mrs. Muler. Any group
that refuses to acknowledge
fact is certainly antithetical to
an academic community, as the
search for truth is the vocation
of such a community.
It is for this reason that I wish
to commend AWS for allowing
us to witness a specimen of the
group which by practice op
poses what we hold invaluable.
