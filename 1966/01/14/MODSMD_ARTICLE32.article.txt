## End Of The LBJ Consensus 
### 
The return of Congress marks
the end of the period in which
the President has had the un
questioning support of some 60
to 70% of the people.
It has always been remarka
ble, as in law and public morals
it has been unseemly, that this
country should be committed to
a war which has never been ex
plained except in resounding
generalities and has never been
debated seriously. This surrepti
tious war has been feasible be
cause the people are disposed to
trust the President and to as
sume that in a question of war
and peace in a distant continent
he is in a position to know more
than they do.
Prospects Vs. Results
But now there is a new ele
ment in the situation. His con
duct of the war has been tested
for a year on the battlefields of
Southeast Asia. What the pub
lic has been told about the
strategy and the prospects of
this war is now being measured
by the actual results, which the
people are beginning to find out
about.
The crucial turning point has
come with the publication of the
report which contains the find
ings of five senators, led by
Sen. Mike Mansfield and includ
ing Sens. Aiken, Muskie, Boggs
and Inouye. Here for the first
time we have a report on the
war which is responsible, in
formed and trustworthy. Except
for the reports of a few enter
prising and independent news
papermen, the American public
has had to depend on informa
tion made available in official
briefings in Saigon and Wash
ington.
The contradictions between
the briefings and the facts, as
they have gradually become visi
ble, has undermined public con

fidence. The grim truth is that
by conducting the war furtively
there has developed, as Ambas
sador Arthur Goldberg con
fessed only the other day, a cri
sis of credibility.
Debate Needed
People do not know what to
believe about what they hear
from the White House, the State
Department, the Pentagon and
the public relations officers in
Saigon. The only way to restore
confidence in the truthfulness of
officials is by subjecting the
exercise to a thorough public
debate. Kor such a debate the
Mansfield report—which ought
to have very much wider publi
cation than it has yet had—sup
plies the material for opening
the debate.
The main proposition which
needs to be debated, and denied
by theadministration if it can
deny it, is the findings of the
Mansfield report that:
"The large-scale introduc
tion of U. S. forces and their
entry into combat has blunted
but not turned back the drive
of the Viet Cong. The latter
have responded to the in
creased American role with a
further strengthening of their
forces by local recruitment in
the South and reinforcements
from the North and a general
stepping up of military activi
ty. As a result the lines re
main drawn in South Vietnam
In substantially the same pat
tern as they were at the out
set of the increased U. S. com
mitment."
After a year of escalated war,
the results have brought the sen
ators to this reassertion of the
classical American doctrine
about Asian wars:
"If present trends continue,
there is no assurance as to
what ultimate increase in
American military commit
ment will be required before
the conflict is terminated. For
the fact is that under present
terms of reference, and as the
war has evolved, the question
is not one of applying in
creased U. S. pressure to a
defined military situation, but
rather of pressing against a
military situation which is, in
effect, open ended."
Open-ended War
This is simply another state
ment in Ihe concrete terms of
the war in Southeast Asia, of
the doctrine which has until re
cently been American military
doctrine—that the United States
should not engage in a land war
on the Asian continent because
such a war will be. as the Mans
field report calls it, "open end

ed." For there will always be
more Asians in Asia than there
can be Americans.
Our people are coming to
realize that the war is open
ended, that no matter how many
troops we put ashore there will
always be enough troops on the
other side to keep the war going.
Since this means that a nego
tiated peace cannot be the kind
of dictated peace which Sen.
Everett iDrksen is still dream
ing about, the President is find
ing himself under heavy pres
sure to bomb and blockade Ha
noi and Haiphong and thus make
a quick, clean end of it. On the
subject of victory through air
power, the American people
have been dangerously misin
formed. ,
I say dangerously because the
advocates of bigger bombing do
not seem to realize how vulner
able are Saigon and the other
ports to reprisals. In the con
gested cities and harbors which
we hold there are the makings of
another Pearl Harbor, and none
of us would discount the danger.
There cannot be much doubt
that this is one of the subjects
that the Soviets' Alexander Shel
epin has been discussing in Ha
noi.

this war is now being measured
by the actual results, which the
people are beginning to find out
about.
The crucial turning point has
come with the publication of the
report which contains the find
ings of five senators, led by
Sen. Mike Mansfield and includ
ing Sens. Aiken, Muskie, Boggs
and Inouye. Here for the first
time we have a report on the
war which is responsible, in
formed and trustworthy. Except
for the reports of a few enter
prising and independent news
papermen, the American public
has had to depend on informa
tion made available in official
briefings in Saigon and Wash
ington.
The contradictions between
the briefings and the facts, as
they have gradually become visi
ble, has undermined public con

fidence. The grim truth is that
by conducting the war furtively
there has developed, as Ambas
sador Arthur Goldberg con
fessed only the other day, a cri
sis of credibility.
Debate Needed
People do not know what to
believe about what they hear
from the White House, the State
Department, the Pentagon and
the public relations officers in
Saigon. The only way to restore
confidence in the truthfulness of
officials is by subjecting the
exercise to a thorough public
debate. Kor such a debate the
Mansfield report—which ought
to have very much wider publi
cation than it has yet had—sup
plies the material for opening
the debate.
The main proposition which
needs to be debated, and denied
by theadministration if it can
deny it, is the findings of the
Mansfield report that:
"The large-scale introduc
tion of U. S. forces and their
entry into combat has blunted
but not turned back the drive
of the Viet Cong. The latter
have responded to the in
creased American role with a
further strengthening of their
forces by local recruitment in
the South and reinforcements
from the North and a general
stepping up of military activi
ty. As a result the lines re
main drawn in South Vietnam
In substantially the same pat
tern as they were at the out
set of the increased U. S. com
mitment."
After a year of escalated war,
the results have brought the sen
ators to this reassertion of the
classical American doctrine
about Asian wars:
"If present trends continue,
there is no assurance as to
what ultimate increase in
American military commit
ment will be required before
the conflict is terminated. For
the fact is that under present
terms of reference, and as the
war has evolved, the question
is not one of applying in
creased U. S. pressure to a
defined military situation, but
rather of pressing against a
military situation which is, in
effect, open ended."
Open-ended War
This is simply another state
ment in Ihe concrete terms of
the war in Southeast Asia, of
the doctrine which has until re
cently been American military
doctrine—that the United States
should not engage in a land war
on the Asian continent because
such a war will be. as the Mans
field report calls it, "open end

ed." For there will always be
more Asians in Asia than there
can be Americans.
Our people are coming to
realize that the war is open
ended, that no matter how many
troops we put ashore there will
always be enough troops on the
other side to keep the war going.
Since this means that a nego
tiated peace cannot be the kind
of dictated peace which Sen.
Everett iDrksen is still dream
ing about, the President is find
ing himself under heavy pres
sure to bomb and blockade Ha
noi and Haiphong and thus make
a quick, clean end of it. On the
subject of victory through air
power, the American people
have been dangerously misin
formed. ,
I say dangerously because the
advocates of bigger bombing do
not seem to realize how vulner
able are Saigon and the other
ports to reprisals. In the con
gested cities and harbors which
we hold there are the makings of
another Pearl Harbor, and none
of us would discount the danger.
There cannot be much doubt
that this is one of the subjects
that the Soviets' Alexander Shel
epin has been discussing in Ha
noi.
The return of Congress marks
the end of the period in which
the President has had the un
questioning support of some 60
to 70% of the people.
It has always been remarka
ble, as in law and public morals
it has been unseemly, that this
country should be committed to
a war which has never been ex
plained except in resounding
generalities and has never been
debated seriously. This surrepti
tious war has been feasible be
cause the people are disposed to
trust the President and to as
sume that in a question of war
and peace in a distant continent
he is in a position to know more
than they do.

Debate Needed
People do not know what to
believe about what they hear
from the White House, the State
Department, the Pentagon and
the public relations officers in
Saigon. The only way to restore
confidence in the truthfulness of
officials is by subjecting the
exercise to a thorough public
debate. Kor such a debate the
Mansfield report—which ought
to have very much wider publi
cation than it has yet had—sup
plies the material for opening
the debate.
The main proposition which
needs to be debated, and denied
by theadministration if it can
deny it, is the findings of the
Mansfield report that:
"The large-scale introduc
tion of U. S. forces and their
entry into combat has blunted
but not turned back the drive
of the Viet Cong. The latter
have responded to the in
creased American role with a
further strengthening of their
forces by local recruitment in
the South and reinforcements
from the North and a general
stepping up of military activi
ty. As a result the lines re
main drawn in South Vietnam
In substantially the same pat
tern as they were at the out
set of the increased U. S. com
mitment."
After a year of escalated war,
the results have brought the sen
ators to this reassertion of the
classical American doctrine
about Asian wars:
"If present trends continue,
there is no assurance as to
what ultimate increase in
American military commit
ment will be required before
the conflict is terminated. For
the fact is that under present
terms of reference, and as the
war has evolved, the question
is not one of applying in
creased U. S. pressure to a
defined military situation, but
rather of pressing against a
military situation which is, in
effect, open ended."
Open-ended War
This is simply another state
ment in Ihe concrete terms of
the war in Southeast Asia, of
the doctrine which has until re
cently been American military
doctrine—that the United States
should not engage in a land war
on the Asian continent because
such a war will be. as the Mans
field report calls it, "open end

ed." For there will always be
more Asians in Asia than there
can be Americans.
Our people are coming to
realize that the war is open
ended, that no matter how many
troops we put ashore there will
always be enough troops on the
other side to keep the war going.
Since this means that a nego
tiated peace cannot be the kind
of dictated peace which Sen.
Everett iDrksen is still dream
ing about, the President is find
ing himself under heavy pres
sure to bomb and blockade Ha
noi and Haiphong and thus make
a quick, clean end of it. On the
subject of victory through air
power, the American people
have been dangerously misin
formed. ,
I say dangerously because the
advocates of bigger bombing do
not seem to realize how vulner
able are Saigon and the other
ports to reprisals. In the con
gested cities and harbors which
we hold there are the makings of
another Pearl Harbor, and none
of us would discount the danger.
There cannot be much doubt
that this is one of the subjects
that the Soviets' Alexander Shel
epin has been discussing in Ha
noi.
The return of Congress marks
the end of the period in which
the President has had the un
questioning support of some 60
to 70% of the people.
It has always been remarka
ble, as in law and public morals
it has been unseemly, that this
country should be committed to
a war which has never been ex
plained except in resounding
generalities and has never been
debated seriously. This surrepti
tious war has been feasible be
cause the people are disposed to
trust the President and to as
sume that in a question of war
and peace in a distant continent
he is in a position to know more
than they do.
Prospects Vs. Results
But now there is a new ele
ment in the situation. His con
duct of the war has been tested
for a year on the battlefields of
Southeast Asia. What the pub
lic has been told about the
strategy and the prospects of
this war is now being measured
by the actual results, which the
people are beginning to find out
about.
The crucial turning point has
come with the publication of the
report which contains the find
ings of five senators, led by
Sen. Mike Mansfield and includ
ing Sens. Aiken, Muskie, Boggs
and Inouye. Here for the first
time we have a report on the
war which is responsible, in
formed and trustworthy. Except
for the reports of a few enter
prising and independent news
papermen, the American public
has had to depend on informa
tion made available in official
briefings in Saigon and Wash
ington.
The contradictions between
the briefings and the facts, as
they have gradually become visi
ble, has undermined public con

fidence. The grim truth is that
by conducting the war furtively
there has developed, as Ambas
sador Arthur Goldberg con
fessed only the other day, a cri
sis of credibility.
