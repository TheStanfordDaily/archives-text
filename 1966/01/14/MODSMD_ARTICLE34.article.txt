## HUAC Vs. Credit Union 
### PELL FENDER 
There are two ways to formu
late the Great Society: one is to
wage war, thereby preserving
the Great Society as well as
forcing it upon others, and the
other is to continue the splendid
performance of the House Un-
American Activities Committee.
The House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee, unlike such
financial frivolities as the War
on Poverty, costs very little to
run. Equally, there is support
from both sides of the Political
continuum for its endeavors, es
pecially since the House Un-
American Activities Committee
picks on a scapegoat that every
one can hate, like The Klan.
Just recently, Ronnie Reagan
has patted himself on the back
(and threatened himself with
political annihilation) by sug
gesting a similar investigation
of the John Birch Society.
Stanford Un-Americanism
But un-Amerieanism on the
national scale is far removed
from Stanford. Few of us are
aware of the recent investiga
tion of a campus organization
which, as was obvious to anyone
who saw its advertisement in
The Daily, severely threatens
everyone in the Stanford com
munity.
The scene is a small office in
the bureaucratic confines of a
great university, a credit union.
Seated across from its manager
is a man in a three-piece suit,
with pencil and notebook in
hand.
"You are the manager of this
establishment, I presume."
"Well, I'm just a small cog
in a big wheel, but I manage
the Stanford Branch; yes, that's
right."
"Are you responsible for the
ad that appeared in The Daily a
few days ago?"

"Why, yes."
"Then you won't mind ex
plaining a few of the things in
that add. For instance, you say,
and I quote, 'the credit union ...
is part of a world wide union
movement.' Now would you ex
plain 'world wide' and 'move
ment?' "
"Oh, that's very simple. You
see we at Stanford make up
only one of the C.U.'s around
the world.
"C.U.'s, how interesting. I
must remember that. I notice
that your, ah, organization co
operates with, and I quote,
'A.I.D. in establishing financial
and economic system in ermer
ging countries.' You're Ameri
can, aren't you? Why do you
have to meddle in the, and I
quote, 'economic systems' of
these countries?"
"Why, we're not meddling, it's
merely that the A.I.D. is inter
nationally . .
"Oh, the A.I.D. is internation
al, is it?" In any case, you say
'you are helping millions of peo
ple everywhere.' Everywhere,
Sir? Does that include our foes?
"Well, you see . .
"Never mind. We'll work that
out. Let me just sum up. You
are an international organiza
tion, or part of one, excuse me,
of C.U.'s, connected with the
A.1.D., concerned with helping
millions of people everywhere
help themselves."
And so it is no longer a secret
that un-Americanism can exist
right here on the ceimpus, where
we thought we were safe, bed
ded in the most subtle of con
spiracies, the bank. The work of
this committee has dutifully
shown, and no doubt will con
tinue to show, that un-American
ism can hit us right where it
hurts us the most, the pocket
book.

right here on the ceimpus, where
we thought we were safe, bed
ded in the most subtle of con
spiracies, the bank. The work of
this committee has dutifully
shown, and no doubt will con
tinue to show, that un-American
ism can hit us right where it
hurts us the most, the pocket
book.
There are two ways to formu
late the Great Society: one is to
wage war, thereby preserving
the Great Society as well as
forcing it upon others, and the
other is to continue the splendid
performance of the House Un-
American Activities Committee.
The House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee, unlike such
financial frivolities as the War
on Poverty, costs very little to
run. Equally, there is support
from both sides of the Political
continuum for its endeavors, es
pecially since the House Un-
American Activities Committee
picks on a scapegoat that every
one can hate, like The Klan.
Just recently, Ronnie Reagan
has patted himself on the back
(and threatened himself with
political annihilation) by sug
gesting a similar investigation
of the John Birch Society.
Stanford Un-Americanism
But un-Amerieanism on the
national scale is far removed
from Stanford. Few of us are
aware of the recent investiga
tion of a campus organization
which, as was obvious to anyone
who saw its advertisement in
The Daily, severely threatens
everyone in the Stanford com
munity.
The scene is a small office in
the bureaucratic confines of a
great university, a credit union.
Seated across from its manager
is a man in a three-piece suit,
with pencil and notebook in
hand.
"You are the manager of this
establishment, I presume."
"Well, I'm just a small cog
in a big wheel, but I manage
the Stanford Branch; yes, that's
right."
"Are you responsible for the
ad that appeared in The Daily a
few days ago?"

"Why, yes."
"Then you won't mind ex
plaining a few of the things in
that add. For instance, you say,
and I quote, 'the credit union ...
is part of a world wide union
movement.' Now would you ex
plain 'world wide' and 'move
ment?' "
"Oh, that's very simple. You
see we at Stanford make up
only one of the C.U.'s around
the world.
"C.U.'s, how interesting. I
must remember that. I notice
that your, ah, organization co
operates with, and I quote,
'A.I.D. in establishing financial
and economic system in ermer
ging countries.' You're Ameri
can, aren't you? Why do you
have to meddle in the, and I
quote, 'economic systems' of
these countries?"
"Why, we're not meddling, it's
merely that the A.I.D. is inter
nationally . .
"Oh, the A.I.D. is internation
al, is it?" In any case, you say
'you are helping millions of peo
ple everywhere.' Everywhere,
Sir? Does that include our foes?
"Well, you see . .
"Never mind. We'll work that
out. Let me just sum up. You
are an international organiza
tion, or part of one, excuse me,
of C.U.'s, connected with the
A.1.D., concerned with helping
millions of people everywhere
help themselves."
And so it is no longer a secret
that un-Americanism can exist
right here on the ceimpus, where
we thought we were safe, bed

spiracies, the bank. The work of
