Viet Cong guerrillas hit U. S. and
Vietnamese units with ambushes
Thursday, inflicting considerable loss
es, as expectations increased for at
least a three-day truce for the Lunar
Now Year next week.
A published report that Secretary
of State Dean Rusk would come here
Saturday for talks with Vietnamese
and U. S. officials stirred speculation
that something extraordinary might
be in the wind.
