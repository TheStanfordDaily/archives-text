# Professors Stress Viet Nam In Comments On LBJ Speech
## 
### CECIL REED 
President Johnson's State of the
Uriion message Wednesday evening
drew both praise and criticism among
Stanford Professors.
Vietnam was the most emphasized
issue.
Milorad Drachkovitch of the Hoover
Institute emphasizes the importance
of two clear statements on Vietnam
which emerged from the speech, stat

ing that "We shall not be defeated,"
and that "We are willing to discuss if
the other side is willing to do so."
"I'm glad that the stress in the
Vietnam war is patience and the possi
bility of undramatic moves," asserted
Richard Lyman of the History De
partment. "Gradual, long-run moves
ane the more likely paths to negotia
tion," he added.
Associate Professor of Political Sci
ence Jan Triska agreed that a simple
solution is "not easy for the complex
situation in Vietnam." But he is criti
cal of Johnson's approach and "lack
of sensitivity."
"I'm afraid he's operating in a
vacuum. He better stop taking the
government attitude toward Vietnam
and start talking about the adminis
trative attitude in Vietnam," he com
mented.
Johnson is "too determined that we
have to win." The President pays too
little heed to "critics like Senator
Mansfield" who are "sensitive, criti
cal and to the point." Triska agreed
with the Senator that there is "no cor
relation between an increase in man
power and a successful conclusion to
the war."

Thomas Bailey, Professor of Ameri
can History, also criticized Johnson's
Vietnam views.
Go-For-Brok^
"His statement that time was on
our side in Vietnam does not square
with my own understanding of the
realities. The American people are a
impatient, go-for-broke type, who
crave quick success. Dragged-out
wars, as was true of the Korean ex
perience, promote growing discontent,
not only among the mothers of the
boys but among the taxpayers. The
Communists are traditionally a pa
tient lot who are working for the long
pull. Congress cheered a ringing as
certion of our determination to fight
to the end. but will they do so ten or
twenty years from now, after mil
lions of casualties and billions of dol
lars?". he said.
Commenting on the recent peace of
fensive, Bailey also claimed that
"over-anxiety for peace further con
vinces the adversary that he is win
ning and can win. On the other hand,
the peace offensive has refurbished
the image of I,BJ, both at home and
abroad, as a peace-loving President,
and this may well have been its main
objective."
"Despite the fact that we are en
gaged in a war in Vietnam. I am im
pressed that he made a special point
that his administration would contin
ue full steam ahead with social and
economic policies that will not only
benefit us but the whole world," ob
serves Professor Christina Harris of
the Political Science Department. "I
am enormously pleased that we are
going on with the reforms of the
Grrat Societv."
