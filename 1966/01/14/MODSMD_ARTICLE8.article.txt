# Student Committee Poll Favors Widespread Open House Changes
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
An all-campus survey released yes
terday by a subcommittee of LASSU
indicates that students favor major
changes in open house regulations,
while discounting Administration ar
guments against liberalization of pres
ent open house policies.
A subcommittee of the Student Af
fairs Committee was set up last Octo
ber to poll student opinion on a range
of questions dealing with the effectivi
ty of present regulations. The investi
gating group, headed by Dan Smith,
designed and pre-tested a 19 question
survey before distributing the final
set of questions to members of all
campus living groups shortly before
the end of fall quarter.
In an attempt to eliminate technical
flaws which have distorted the re
sults of past student polls, Smith ob
tained the aid of the Registrar's Of
fice and A 1 Abrams, a graduate stu
dent in statistics. The group was able
to obtain a true random sample by
matching numbers in a random pro
gression with student alpha-sort num
bers. Smith said that this was the
first time that the Registrar's Office
had opened its files to a student or
ganization for such a program.
Speeifie, But Random
Of the 490 people who sent ques
tionnaires, about 75 percent, replied.
According to Smith this was the
smallest sample which would still
yield meaningful results about the
opinion of each living group. By send

ing questionnaires to specific, yet
randomly chosen students, the prob
lem of packing the survey by any one
faction was effectively eliminated.
Most questions asked students to
evaluate their use of open house and
how they would use open house hours
if present policy were liberalized. Un
der existing regulations the use of
open house time is about the same in
all on campus living groups, which
includes university residences as well
as fraternities. Students have guests
slightly more often than once a
month. Under liberalized regulations,
students admit that they would use
open house opportunities once every
one to two weeks.
Asked to rate the use of their open
house hours on a one to five scale
between study and social activities,
most living groups indicated a slight
preference for the social with a 2.9-
3.0 figure for all undergraduate men
and the women's residences.
An Allocation of Time
Although the Open House Subcom
mittee in a statement issued Novem
ber 6 claimed that an increase in open
house opportunities would be used
more for study than socializing, the
results of the survey seem to suggest
that students would make no change
in the allocation of their time. Stu
dents predicted that they would main
tain the balance between study and
social, scoring about the same 3.0 fig
ure with an even stronger consensus
of opinion.
In the area of privacy and accom
modation of roommates, the poll de
nied contentions that open house
hours cause problems. A report issued
by ASSU Judicial Council last fall
noted that "the only rational justifi
cation for the present policy that we
have been able to discern is the argu
ment that it constitutes an attempt
to insure mutual consideration in the
use of one's living quarters for inter
personal relationships."

Rating the invasion of privacy on
a scale from 1 (severe) to 5 (not at
all), students found little conflict with
a 4.2 figure for women and a 4.7 fig
ure for all undergraduate men. With
an increased opportunity for open
houses, students saw only a slight in
crease in the invasion of their per
sonal privacy. In estimating the effect
of open houses on privacy for study,
the results under present and liberal
ized regulations showed also that stu
dents anticipated only slight concern
about being disturbed.
A High Value
All living groups replying to the
questionnaire placed a high value on
the right to be alone with a guest.
Using a 1 to 5 scale, very important
to not important, undergraduate men
placed a slightly stronger value upon
the opportunities for privacy with a
guest, 1.7 to 1.9.
Next Thursday the Student Affairs
Committee will formally report its
findings before the Legislature and
discuss a resolution drawn up by the
committee. Among its tentative rec
ommendations are the following:
• Visitors of the opposite sex
should be permitted in lounges until
2:30 a.m. on any night of the week.
• Visitors of the opposite sex
should be permitted in non-lobby
areas from noon to midnight, Sunday
through Thursday, and from noon un
til 2:30 a.m. weekends.
• Open house hours within the
above limits should be set by the in
dividual living group at will.
• Open house hours would be post
ed in the lobby and it would be the
responsibility of the host or hostess
to see that guests observe the sched
ule.
• Judicial matters arising from vio
lations would be handled within the
living groups as a matter of primary
jurisdiction.
Based upon results of the survey,

final recommendations may be some
what more liberal, Smith told The
Daily.
Centers of Decision
In most areas the results of the
survey support the committee de
mands that control of living house
regulation be put in the hands of in
dividual living groups. Asked to de
cide the center of decision for policy
—uniform University policy for ail
groups, general University maxima
with flexibility for each living group
within the limits, the living group
alone, or the individual student—the
consensus showed that most students
wanted policy to be made within the
living group itself. However in upper
class women's residences there was a
slight tendency to accept University
maxima with a degree of flexibility
for Ihe living groups to determine.
Between Two and Four
According to the survey students
would like to have between two and
four open houses on the week days
and on at least one or preferably two
weekend evenings. Among undergrad
uate men the desire for an increased
number of open house nights was
about 20 percent higher.
Student response to their ob
servance of the present policy re
flected statements made by the Judi
cial Council made last quarter in ren
dering several decisions concerning
open house violations when it "took
into consideration the fact that the
rule was so generally disregarded,
and was, in a sense, behind the times.
Rating their observance of the pres
ent system from "strict" to "not at
all" on a 1 to 5 scale, upper class
women's residences showed a mod
erate attitude (1.7) while men's liv
ing groups were considerably more
lax at. 3.4 and fraternities at 4.3.
In Accord With Practice
Smith noted that the number of re
turns from fraternities had not been
sufficiently large, but that results
were generally in line with past sur
veys and in accord with what is be
lieved to be current practice in the
fraternities.
On the question of the best times
for open-house hours, students ex
pressed a diversity of opinions.
Present open house hours at Hoskins
House are the same as those recom
mended by the subcommittee.
