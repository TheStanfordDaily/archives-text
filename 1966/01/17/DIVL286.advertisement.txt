Rabbi, Father and Reverend
In areas of life where we are ignorant, none of us feels secure. This is why
most people leave religion to the theologians and formulas for living to the phi
losopher. But the result is spiritual suicide and ultimate defeat, for the Creator of
man is the Author of life and the God of persons. He is dead set against man
made religion and worthfess super-structures not based on faith.
Energetically opposing the misuse of religious authority, Jesus Christ said.
The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, so practice what they tell you;
but not what they do; for they preach but do not practice. They bind heavy .
burdens, hard to bear and lay them on men's shoulders; but they will not move
them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by man,- for they make
their phlacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honor
at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the market
places, and being called rabbi by men. Bui you are not to be called rabbi, for
you have one teacher and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on
earth, for you have one Father who is in heaven. Neither be called master, for
you have one master, the Christ. He who it gredtest among you shall be your
servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles him
self will be exalted" (Matthew 23.1-12).
To be a Christian is not to join a church or religious group nor to follow a
human leader, but to know a person whose name is Jesus Christ. It is He who
said, "I am the way and the truth and the life; no man comes to the Father but
by me." Why not leave religion to the experts and discover in experience one
Friend who cares more about you than you care about yourself. Jesus said,
"Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take
my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you
will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light"
(Matthew 1 1.28-30).

servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles him
self will be exalted" (Matthew 23.1-12).
To be a Christian is not to join a church or religious group nor to follow a
human leader, but to know a person whose name is Jesus Christ. It is He who
said, "I am the way and the truth and the life; no man comes to the Father but
by me." Why not leave religion to the experts and discover in experience one
Friend who cares more about you than you care about yourself. Jesus said,
"Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take
my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you
will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light"
(Matthew 1 1.28-30).
