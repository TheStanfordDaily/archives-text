# Cagers Topple USC, UCLA
## DAILY Sports 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
The Stanford basketball team,
shooting a torrid for the week
end, swept a crucial series from USC
and UCLA, defeating the Trojans, 73-
64, and upsetting the Bruins, 74-69.
The victory over UCLA, was the
Tribe's second upset of the season be
fore the TV cameras. Earlier, Stan
ford dumped USF, 81-78, before an
other coast-wide audience.
The victory over the Bruins snapped
a 36 game conference winning streak
for the Westwooders. The last time
UCLA was beaten in conference play
was in 1963 when Stanford tied them
for the championship. The same two
teams are presently tied for the
AAWU lead with 3-1 records.
Troy Falls
Friday night, USC and Stanford
traded leads until Bob Bedell scored a
three-point play to put his team
ahead, 15-11.
Stanford outhustled the Trojans on

defense and on the boards and went
into the locker room at halftime with
a 35-28 lead. The keynote of the half
was exemplified by Art Harris* steal
of a USC pass and a stuff just as the
buzzer sounded.
Harris, a leaping sophomore guard,
stood out both nights scoring 22 and
24 points, grabbing rebounds with the
big boys, and playing a ball-hawking
defensive game.
The Trojans tried a loose man on
man press throughout the game, but
Gary Petersmeyer had no trouble
dribbling by the slower Trojan guards.
Fast Break
Stanford scored quite a few points
off the fast break after stolen passes.
Harris usually lead the group. In the
first half, he had three assists.
The Indians let up in the second
half, and USC came right back to take
the lead, 43-42 with 14 minutes left to
play. A 20 foot jumper by center
John Block, who scored 28 for the
night, and a 12 foot jumper by Bin

Westphal inched Troy ahead.
Coach Howie Dallmar immediately
called a time-out to talk things over.
Whatever it was that he told his squad
it worked. Ray Kosanke and Harris
each hit four points as the Tribe out
scored USC, 10-1, to lead 54-44.
With Bob Bedell helping control the
boards and Harris popping in 8 points,
it was only a matter of by how much
for the rest of the game.
Hot Hand
Harris with an unstoppable variety
of long jumpers, driving lay-ins, and
sharp passes befuddled UCLA com
pletely as he scored almost at will
against the Bruins. He hit 10 of 12
field goals and added four free throws
for his 24 points. He was inside with
the big boys, too, as he snatched 9 re
bounds.
Harris wasn't the only Indian out
there, though. Forward Howard Has
sen getting his first starting assign
ments had the task of guarding Ed
gar Lacey. He did a fine job there

and also matched Lacey on offense.
Hassen hit four of six field goals and
five of six free throws for 13 points.
Kosanke hit 14 points and did a good
job on the boards. Bedell was the top
rebounder with 12. He also scored 16
points. Harris' mate at guard Gary
Petersmeyer guArded UCLA's top
scorer, Mike Warren. He held him to
12 points.
Blitz
Stanford used one of the Bruin's
favorite tricks, the blitz, to take a 21-7
lead at the outset. Harris hit four bas
kets and a free throw, and Bedell put
through three inside shots to lead the
Indians.
Then, UCLA began pecking away at
Stanford's lead until Warren's 15 foot
jumper with three minutes left in the
half closed the gap to two points, 29-
27. During this time, Stanford lost
the ball three times to the UCLA
press.
Kosanke, Harris, and Bedell then
guided the Indian machine
into a 38-31 halftime lead. Ko
sanke hit a tinee point play,
Harris popped in a 15 foot jump
er and a lay-in, and Bedell hit
two free throws with 20 seconds
left.
Harris had 15 points at half
time including seven of nine
field goals.

Strong Start
Sensing victory, the Indians
came out stronger than before
in the second half.
Harris drove down the lane
and put up two points over cen
ter Mike Lynn to start things
off. Kosanke got two more in
side. Bedell then hit two baskets
to increase the Stanford lead
to 46-33.
One of the interesting things
about Stanford's first four bas
kets was that three of them
were from the inside. In the sec
ond half as well as the first half,
Stanford repeatedly was able to
get the ball inside and score the
short shot.
The Bruins weren't dead yet,
however. They began another

comeback with eight minutes
left. The first part of the second
half the Bruins were puzzled by
a modified zone which Stanford
brought out from the half time
locker room with them. It kept
Lacey, Lynn, and company out
side.
I/ong Jumpers
Finally, Freddie Goss and
Mike Warren started hitting on
long jumpers.
Four points by Kenny Wash
ington closed the score to 60-58
with six minutes to play. Coach
Dallmar signaled for a time out.
Kosanke kept Stanford ahead
with two tip-ins sandwiched
around Lynn's hook. Harris hit
a free throw and Hassen hit
three free throws to give the
Tribe a 68-62 lead.

With 1:21 left, baskets by
Lacey and Washington brought
UCLA within two points again,
69-67. Lynn fouled Harris trying
to steal the ball. Harris sank
two free throws in a one and
one situation. Doug Mcintosh
came right back and hit a jump
er for UCLA to keep his team
within two points of Stanford.
Cool and Calm
The Indians got the ball down
court and Warren intentionally
fouled Petersmeyer to break up
the Stanford stall. Petersmeyer
calmly sank both freethrows
with 21 seconds showing on the
clock to give Stanford a four
point cushion, 73-69. UCLA took
a quick shot which missed. Har
ris got the rebound and was
fouled coming down the court.
He hit one free throw with five
seconds left.
As Stanford was exulting in
victory, Harris was raised to
the shoulders of Stanford root
ers as the che e r s bounced
around the Pavilion walls.
The Indians' conference rec
ord is now 3 1 which puts them
in a tie with UCLA for first.

off. Kosanke got two more in
side. Bedell then hit two baskets
to increase the Stanford lead
to 46-33.
One of the interesting things
about Stanford's first four bas
kets was that three of them
were from the inside. In the sec
ond half as well as the first half,
Stanford repeatedly was able to
get the ball inside and score the
short shot.
The Bruins weren't dead yet,
however. They began another

comeback with eight minutes
left. The first part of the second
half the Bruins were puzzled by
a modified zone which Stanford
brought out from the half time
locker room with them. It kept
Lacey, Lynn, and company out
side.
I/ong Jumpers
Finally, Freddie Goss and
Mike Warren started hitting on
long jumpers.
Four points by Kenny Wash
ington closed the score to 60-58
with six minutes to play. Coach
Dallmar signaled for a time out.
Kosanke kept Stanford ahead
with two tip-ins sandwiched
around Lynn's hook. Harris hit
a free throw and Hassen hit
three free throws to give the
Tribe a 68-62 lead.

With 1:21 left, baskets by
Lacey and Washington brought
UCLA within two points again,
69-67. Lynn fouled Harris trying
to steal the ball. Harris sank
two free throws in a one and
one situation. Doug Mcintosh
came right back and hit a jump
er for UCLA to keep his team
within two points of Stanford.
Cool and Calm
The Indians got the ball down
court and Warren intentionally
fouled Petersmeyer to break up
the Stanford stall. Petersmeyer
calmly sank both freethrows
with 21 seconds showing on the
clock to give Stanford a four
point cushion, 73-69. UCLA took
a quick shot which missed. Har
ris got the rebound and was
fouled coming down the court.
He hit one free throw with five
seconds left.
As Stanford was exulting in
victory, Harris was raised to
the shoulders of Stanford root
ers as the che e r s bounced
around the Pavilion walls.
The Indians' conference rec
ord is now 3 1 which puts them
in a tie with UCLA for first.
The Stanford basketball team,
shooting a torrid for the week
end, swept a crucial series from USC
and UCLA, defeating the Trojans, 73-
64, and upsetting the Bruins, 74-69.
The victory over UCLA, was the
Tribe's second upset of the season be
fore the TV cameras. Earlier, Stan
ford dumped USF, 81-78, before an
other coast-wide audience.
The victory over the Bruins snapped
a 36 game conference winning streak
for the Westwooders. The last time
UCLA was beaten in conference play
was in 1963 when Stanford tied them
for the championship. The same two
teams are presently tied for the
AAWU lead with 3-1 records.
Troy Falls
Friday night, USC and Stanford
traded leads until Bob Bedell scored a
three-point play to put his team
ahead, 15-11.
Stanford outhustled the Trojans on

defense and on the boards and went
into the locker room at halftime with
a 35-28 lead. The keynote of the half
was exemplified by Art Harris* steal
of a USC pass and a stuff just as the
buzzer sounded.
Harris, a leaping sophomore guard,
stood out both nights scoring 22 and
24 points, grabbing rebounds with the
big boys, and playing a ball-hawking
defensive game.
The Trojans tried a loose man on
man press throughout the game, but
Gary Petersmeyer had no trouble
dribbling by the slower Trojan guards.
Fast Break
Stanford scored quite a few points
off the fast break after stolen passes.
Harris usually lead the group. In the
first half, he had three assists.
The Indians let up in the second
half, and USC came right back to take
the lead, 43-42 with 14 minutes left to
play. A 20 foot jumper by center
John Block, who scored 28 for the
night, and a 12 foot jumper by Bin

Westphal inched Troy ahead.
Coach Howie Dallmar immediately
called a time-out to talk things over.
Whatever it was that he told his squad
it worked. Ray Kosanke and Harris
each hit four points as the Tribe out
scored USC, 10-1, to lead 54-44.
With Bob Bedell helping control the
boards and Harris popping in 8 points,
it was only a matter of by how much
for the rest of the game.
Hot Hand
Harris with an unstoppable variety
of long jumpers, driving lay-ins, and
sharp passes befuddled UCLA com
pletely as he scored almost at will
against the Bruins. He hit 10 of 12
field goals and added four free throws
for his 24 points. He was inside with
the big boys, too, as he snatched 9 re
bounds.
Harris wasn't the only Indian out
there, though. Forward Howard Has
sen getting his first starting assign
ments had the task of guarding Ed
gar Lacey. He did a fine job there

and also matched Lacey on offense.
Hassen hit four of six field goals and
five of six free throws for 13 points.
Kosanke hit 14 points and did a good
job on the boards. Bedell was the top
rebounder with 12. He also scored 16
points. Harris' mate at guard Gary
Petersmeyer guArded UCLA's top
scorer, Mike Warren. He held him to
12 points.
Blitz
Stanford used one of the Bruin's
favorite tricks, the blitz, to take a 21-7
lead at the outset. Harris hit four bas
kets and a free throw, and Bedell put
through three inside shots to lead the
Indians.
Then, UCLA began pecking away at
Stanford's lead until Warren's 15 foot
jumper with three minutes left in the
half closed the gap to two points, 29-
27. During this time, Stanford lost
the ball three times to the UCLA
press.
Kosanke, Harris, and Bedell then
guided the Indian machine
into a 38-31 halftime lead. Ko
sanke hit a tinee point play,
Harris popped in a 15 foot jump
er and a lay-in, and Bedell hit
two free throws with 20 seconds
left.
Harris had 15 points at half

Troy Falls
Friday night, USC and Stanford
traded leads until Bob Bedell scored a
three-point play to put his team
ahead, 15-11.
Stanford outhustled the Trojans on

defense and on the boards and went
into the locker room at halftime with
a 35-28 lead. The keynote of the half
was exemplified by Art Harris* steal
of a USC pass and a stuff just as the
buzzer sounded.
Harris, a leaping sophomore guard,
stood out both nights scoring 22 and
24 points, grabbing rebounds with the
big boys, and playing a ball-hawking
defensive game.
The Trojans tried a loose man on
man press throughout the game, but
Gary Petersmeyer had no trouble
dribbling by the slower Trojan guards.
Fast Break

off the fast break after stolen passes.
Harris usually lead the group. In the

it worked. Ray Kosanke and Harris
each hit four points as the Tribe out

With Bob Bedell helping control the
boards and Harris popping in 8 points,
it was only a matter of by how much
for the rest of the game.

against the Bruins. He hit 10 of 12
field goals and added four free throws
for his 24 points. He was inside with
the big boys, too, as he snatched 9 re
bounds.
Harris wasn't the only Indian out
there, though. Forward Howard Has

five of six free throws for 13 points.

job on the boards. Bedell was the top
rebounder with 12. He also scored 16

Then, UCLA began pecking away at

and UCLA, defeating the Trojans, 73-
64, and upsetting the Bruins, 74-69.
The victory over UCLA, was the
Tribe's second upset of the season be
fore the TV cameras. Earlier, Stan
ford dumped USF, 81-78, before an
other coast-wide audience.
The victory over the Bruins snapped
a 36 game conference winning streak
for the Westwooders. The last time
UCLA was beaten in conference play
was in 1963 when Stanford tied them
for the championship. The same two
teams are presently tied for the
AAWU lead with 3-1 records.
Troy Falls
Friday night, USC and Stanford
traded leads until Bob Bedell scored a
three-point play to put his team
ahead, 15-11.
Stanford outhustled the Trojans on

defense and on the boards and went
into the locker room at halftime with
a 35-28 lead. The keynote of the half
was exemplified by Art Harris* steal
of a USC pass and a stuff just as the
buzzer sounded.
Harris, a leaping sophomore guard,
stood out both nights scoring 22 and
24 points, grabbing rebounds with the
big boys, and playing a ball-hawking
defensive game.
The Trojans tried a loose man on
man press throughout the game, but
Gary Petersmeyer had no trouble
dribbling by the slower Trojan guards.
Fast Break
Stanford scored quite a few points
off the fast break after stolen passes.
Harris usually lead the group. In the
first half, he had three assists.
The Indians let up in the second
half, and USC came right back to take
the lead, 43-42 with 14 minutes left to
play. A 20 foot jumper by center
John Block, who scored 28 for the
night, and a 12 foot jumper by Bin

Westphal inched Troy ahead.
Coach Howie Dallmar immediately
called a time-out to talk things over.
Whatever it was that he told his squad
it worked. Ray Kosanke and Harris
each hit four points as the Tribe out
scored USC, 10-1, to lead 54-44.
With Bob Bedell helping control the
boards and Harris popping in 8 points,
it was only a matter of by how much
for the rest of the game.
Hot Hand
Harris with an unstoppable variety
of long jumpers, driving lay-ins, and
sharp passes befuddled UCLA com
pletely as he scored almost at will
against the Bruins. He hit 10 of 12
field goals and added four free throws
for his 24 points. He was inside with
the big boys, too, as he snatched 9 re
bounds.
Harris wasn't the only Indian out
there, though. Forward Howard Has
sen getting his first starting assign
ments had the task of guarding Ed
gar Lacey. He did a fine job there

and also matched Lacey on offense.
Hassen hit four of six field goals and
five of six free throws for 13 points.
Kosanke hit 14 points and did a good
job on the boards. Bedell was the top
rebounder with 12. He also scored 16
points. Harris' mate at guard Gary
Petersmeyer guArded UCLA's top
scorer, Mike Warren. He held him to
12 points.
Blitz
Stanford used one of the Bruin's
favorite tricks, the blitz, to take a 21-7
lead at the outset. Harris hit four bas
kets and a free throw, and Bedell put
through three inside shots to lead the
Indians.
Then, UCLA began pecking away at
Stanford's lead until Warren's 15 foot
jumper with three minutes left in the
half closed the gap to two points, 29-
27. During this time, Stanford lost
the ball three times to the UCLA
press.
Kosanke, Harris, and Bedell then
guided the Indian machine
into a 38-31 halftime lead. Ko
sanke hit a tinee point play,
Harris popped in a 15 foot jump
er and a lay-in, and Bedell hit
two free throws with 20 seconds
left.
Harris had 15 points at half
time including seven of nine
field goals.

Strong Start
Sensing victory, the Indians
came out stronger than before
in the second half.
Harris drove down the lane
and put up two points over cen
ter Mike Lynn to start things
off. Kosanke got two more in
side. Bedell then hit two baskets
to increase the Stanford lead
to 46-33.
One of the interesting things
about Stanford's first four bas
kets was that three of them
were from the inside. In the sec
ond half as well as the first half,
Stanford repeatedly was able to
get the ball inside and score the
short shot.
The Bruins weren't dead yet,
however. They began another

comeback with eight minutes
left. The first part of the second
half the Bruins were puzzled by
a modified zone which Stanford
brought out from the half time
locker room with them. It kept
Lacey, Lynn, and company out
side.
I/ong Jumpers
Finally, Freddie Goss and
Mike Warren started hitting on
long jumpers.
Four points by Kenny Wash
ington closed the score to 60-58
with six minutes to play. Coach
Dallmar signaled for a time out.
Kosanke kept Stanford ahead
with two tip-ins sandwiched
around Lynn's hook. Harris hit
a free throw and Hassen hit
three free throws to give the
Tribe a 68-62 lead.

With 1:21 left, baskets by
Lacey and Washington brought
UCLA within two points again,
69-67. Lynn fouled Harris trying
to steal the ball. Harris sank
two free throws in a one and
one situation. Doug Mcintosh
came right back and hit a jump
er for UCLA to keep his team
within two points of Stanford.
Cool and Calm
The Indians got the ball down
court and Warren intentionally
fouled Petersmeyer to break up
the Stanford stall. Petersmeyer
calmly sank both freethrows
with 21 seconds showing on the
clock to give Stanford a four
point cushion, 73-69. UCLA took
a quick shot which missed. Har
ris got the rebound and was
fouled coming down the court.
He hit one free throw with five
seconds left.
As Stanford was exulting in
victory, Harris was raised to
the shoulders of Stanford root
ers as the che e r s bounced
around the Pavilion walls.
The Indians' conference rec
ord is now 3 1 which puts them
in a tie with UCLA for first.
