## DAILY Sports 
### JOE HERNANDEZ Sports Editor 
The Stanford basketball team,
shooting a torrid for the week
end, swept a crucial series from USC
and UCLA, defeating the Trojans, 73-
64, and upsetting the Bruins, 74-69.
The victory over UCLA, was the
Tribe's second upset of the season be
fore the TV cameras. Earlier, Stan
ford dumped USF, 81-78, before an
other coast-wide audience.
The victory over the Bruins snapped
a 36 game conference winning streak
for the Westwooders. The last time
UCLA was beaten in conference play
was in 1963 when Stanford tied them
for the championship. The same two
teams are presently tied for the
AAWU lead with 3-1 records.
Troy Falls
Friday night, USC and Stanford
traded leads until Bob Bedell scored a
three-point play to put his team
ahead, 15-11.
Stanford outhustled the Trojans on

defense and on the boards and went
into the locker room at halftime with
a 35-28 lead. The keynote of the half
was exemplified by Art Harris* steal
of a USC pass and a stuff just as the
buzzer sounded.
Harris, a leaping sophomore guard,
stood out both nights scoring 22 and
24 points, grabbing rebounds with the
big boys, and playing a ball-hawking
defensive game.
The Trojans tried a loose man on
man press throughout the game, but
Gary Petersmeyer had no trouble
dribbling by the slower Trojan guards.
Fast Break
Stanford scored quite a few points
off the fast break after stolen passes.
Harris usually lead the group. In the
first half, he had three assists.
The Indians let up in the second
half, and USC came right back to take
the lead, 43-42 with 14 minutes left to
play. A 20 foot jumper by center
John Block, who scored 28 for the
night, and a 12 foot jumper by Bin

Westphal inched Troy ahead.
Coach Howie Dallmar immediately
called a time-out to talk things over.
Whatever it was that he told his squad
it worked. Ray Kosanke and Harris
each hit four points as the Tribe out
scored USC, 10-1, to lead 54-44.
With Bob Bedell helping control the
boards and Harris popping in 8 points,
it was only a matter of by how much
for the rest of the game.
Hot Hand
Harris with an unstoppable variety
of long jumpers, driving lay-ins, and
sharp passes befuddled UCLA com
pletely as he scored almost at will
against the Bruins. He hit 10 of 12
field goals and added four free throws
for his 24 points. He was inside with
the big boys, too, as he snatched 9 re
bounds.
Harris wasn't the only Indian out
there, though. Forward Howard Has
sen getting his first starting assign
ments had the task of guarding Ed
gar Lacey. He did a fine job there

and also matched Lacey on offense.
Hassen hit four of six field goals and
five of six free throws for 13 points.
Kosanke hit 14 points and did a good
job on the boards. Bedell was the top
rebounder with 12. He also scored 16
points. Harris' mate at guard Gary
Petersmeyer guArded UCLA's top
scorer, Mike Warren. He held him to
12 points.
Blitz
Stanford used one of the Bruin's
favorite tricks, the blitz, to take a 21-7
lead at the outset. Harris hit four bas
kets and a free throw, and Bedell put
through three inside shots to lead the
Indians.
Then, UCLA began pecking away at
Stanford's lead until Warren's 15 foot
jumper with three minutes left in the
half closed the gap to two points, 29-
27. During this time, Stanford lost
the ball three times to the UCLA
press.
Kosanke, Harris, and Bedell then
