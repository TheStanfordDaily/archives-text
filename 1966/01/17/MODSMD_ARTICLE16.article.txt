# Vinyl Floor For Lag?
## 
### TOM BOWEN 
Indio, California is a small
desert community in the vast
ness of the Mojave Desert which
is most famous for its annual
date festival and indeed refers
to itself as the "Date Capital
of the World."
At first glance this oasis has
little or nothing to do with Stan
ford in general or Lake Lagu
nita in particular.
However, Indio, California is
the base of operations for a
gentleman and Stanford alum
nus who specializes in lining
lakes and reservoirs with a vinyl
membrane which prevents,
among other things, the loss of
water and hopefully the growth
of weeds.
Stanford Great Lakes?
Both of these things are con
tinuing problems for Stanford's
answer to the Great Lakes
which resembles successively a
meteorite crater, a pleasant sail
ing lake and the Louisiana
bayou country. As a matter of
fact the growth of weeds be
came so acute last Spring that
the Stanford Sailing Association
picked up their boats and pad

died south to Lake Vasona near
San Jose.
It wasn't that they didn't like
it in their own private body of
water with none of the crowds
they faced at Vasona, it was
just that the plant growth was
so thick and flourishing that a
sail boat could not pass through
it. There was even the danger
of some unfortunate student
sailor becoming so entangled in
the weeds near the center of the
lake that he would be unable
to reach shore before starvation
overtook him.
It is not for lack of opposition
that the weeds continue to
wreak havoc among the azure
waters of Lake Lag. Every year
while the lake is dry during the
Fall, the Department of the
Physical Plant sprays the bot
tom with weed killers in order
to stunt the growth of plant
life, but every Spring just like
clock work the weeds come
thundering back up through the
surface.
Another novel idea for the re
moval of the delinquent vegeta
tion is the dredging of the bot
tom of the lake with chains to
pull up the weeds by their roots.

This was done at Searsville
Lake about a decade ago with
amazing temporary success,
However the next spring the
left over smaller chunks of weed
had taken root and the entire
surface of the lake was covered
with a carpet of greenery sev
eral times thicker than had pre
viously been observed.
Rare Flora
However, rumor has it that
the weeds in Lake Lag are not
just ordinary underwater flora,
but are indeed a rare variety
of growth which occurs nowhere
else in the world.
Consequently whenever one
mentions the wanton murder of
these vegetable pirates of the
high seas, some obscure biolo
gist rises to their defense and
pleas for clemency at any cost.
Another suggested solution to
the Lake Lag weed war is per
haps the most fantastic and yet
the most practical. This entails
the lining of the bottom of the
lake with some material which
would be inpentrable by any veg
etable matter currently known
to man and, at the same time,
keep the lake from losing the
million and a half gallons a day
it now gives away to seepage.
Vinyl Bottom
Among the suggested mate
rials the most promising seems
to be the vinyl produced by the
Indio Farm alumnus or some
other sort of asphalt material.
These probably will successfully
do the job and might even make
Lagunita into a year 'round
lake.
But assuming that it is al
lowed to evaporate and drain
in the Fall as it is now, a seri
ous problem might develop with
regards to the annual Big Game
Bonfire. For when most vinyl
or asphalt is heated it turns into
a thick viscous substance, not
unlike tar, and there would be
the distinct possibility that some
unfortunate freshman might get
too close while admiring the fire
he had helped build and suffer
the same fate as those prehis
toric monsters who are now per
manent residents of Los Ange
les' La Brea Tar Pits.
However, it seems that for
the time being, budding Stan
ford sailors will be forced to
live with the weeds and seepage
of their home base or return to
alien soil. And the weeds will
continue to grow and grow, and
may even reach a thickness and
density that would permit a
walking on water act that hasn't
been done well for years.
