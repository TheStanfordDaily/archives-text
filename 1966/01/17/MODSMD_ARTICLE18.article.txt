# Spurr Predicts Economy To Achieve Record High
## 
### 
The American economy will
probably achieve another all
time high this year, but its
growth will trail the 1965 rate,
according to Prof. William Spurr
of the Stanford Business School.
He warns, however, "If the
war escalates, it wlil create an
artificial boom with inflation,
overexpansion, and its attendant
inefficiencies."
Forecasts Rising GNP
Spurr forecasts total produc
tion of goods and services will
reach $710 billion this year, up

six per cent from last year's level
of $670 billion. More than half
the gain will come from stepped
up consumer spending for non
durable goods and services.
But, Spurr cautions, "There
are a few signs of strain. As
the year progresses, we should
be increasingly alert for signs
of a possible downturn."
Spurr's views have been de
veloped in his graduate course
in business forecasting and out
lined in several recent talks with
business and investment groups.
Sees Economy Stress Points
Spurr sees several stress points
in the economy. Among these
are some price inflation caused
by changes in metals prices,
tighter money and an increase
in the Federal Reserve discount
rate, a more rapid rise in busi
ness spending for equipment
than in production of consumer
goods, and weak spots in the
credit structure.
On the other hand, we have
not reached the stage of "profit
less prosperity." Net profits as
a ratio of sales are high, and
labor cost per unit produced in
manufacturing has not in
creased. Business failures have
not been excessive, and inven
tories now are under much bet
ter control than five years ago,
thanks to computers and im
proved sales forecasting.
Government Sustains Expansion
Moreover, he notes, "Federal
policy is aimed not only to avoid
recession but also to sustain ex
pansion. Our progress is charted
not in relation to a static base
line but in relation to our grow
ing economic potential."
Compared to the Korean War,
Vietnam has had a much more
gradual impact on an economy
starting from a much higher
level. Korea boosted defense
spending from five to 13 per cent
of the Gross National Product
while from 1963 to the first half
of 1965, defense spending
dropped from eight to seven per
cent of the nation's output of
goods and services.
Overall, Spurr expects legis
lation adopted in the last ses
sion of Congress to boost non
defense spending by about $2.5
billion. State and local govern
ment expenditures may rise by
$5 billion and defense spending
by much more, depending on
the Vietnam situation. A gain
of $8 billion in business invest
ment in plant and equipment
will be partially offset by a $2
billion reduction in inventories.
