A Stanford Medical School
team reports successful use of
the needle-sharp beam of a lin
ear accelerator to destroy reti
noblastoma in infant eyes with
out damage to the lens of other
structures.
Dr. Malcolm A. Bagshaw, as
sociate professor of radiology,
and Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, pro
fessor and executive head of the

Department of Radiology, said
that 15 eyes in 10 children with
retinoblastoma were treated
with radiation from the Stan
ford medical linear accelerator
and followed for 10 years. One
of the patients was six years old.
All but one child still have use
ful vision. No deaths have oc
curred, and no extensions of the
tumor beyond the globe have
been observed.
