The new Undergraduate Pub
lication Fund and the ASSU As
sistance Fund, although distinct,
have co-ordinated by their spon
sors to extend full printing op
portunities to all interested un
dergraduates.
Mrs. Elizabeth Webb, a rep
resentative of the Undergradu
ate Creative Development Com
mittee, and Ken Cnesse, chair
man of the ASSU Publication
Board, discussed the relation
ship of the two grants recently.
The new $3,000 fund was es
tablished last fall by a special
faculty committee for Under
graduate Creative Development.
"This group, after studying pos
sible uses for a large donation
presented to Stanford last
spring, alloted the money for
the fund with the purpose of
stimulating growth in this
area," said Mrs. Web b. This
fund supplements the existing
ASSU-sponsored one.
Ken Creese explained the As
sistance Fund of the Publication
Board, which is composed of the
editors of all ASSU approved
publications. The amount of this
fund varies from $1,000 to
$3,000, and represents a share of
the profits from the members'
activities.
"The additional money now
available should encourage un
dergraduates to write and to
publish," stated Creese. Mrs.
Webb felt that "t here is not
enough activity of this type for
a campus of this size occuring
presently."
The differences between the
funds, as related by Creese, per
tain to the variety of work that
each will sponsor. "The ASSU
fund will aid larger groups to

publish material of general in
terest to the entire student body
or of an informative nature,"
Creese commented.
The newer fund will support
more academic or literary en
deavors. Mrs. Webb pointed out
the freshman literary magazine,
"Prism," as an example of one
publication that could apply to
either group for aid.
"To eliminate all conflicts,"
saHi Mrs. Webb, "the two groups
have conferred and will continue
to do so. Although the funds are
separate, their functions have
been co-ordinated."
Creese added, "The Publica
tion Board has amended its by
laws so that the new fund could
be perpetuated. Student interest
and use of these funds are en
couraged and would create an
increase in literary activity
Among Stanford undergradu
ates."
