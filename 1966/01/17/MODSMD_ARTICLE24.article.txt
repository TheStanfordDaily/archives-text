# Grace Makes Last-Second Kick To Tie Peacock Gap
## 
### ARLEN HOLTER 
A disputed penalty kick after
the clock had run out gave the
Stanford rugby team, a 17-17,
tie with the Peacock Gap Rugby
Club. 2nd % Mike Grace, the
Australian graduate student
gained the tie for the Indians
by kicking his 9th, 10th F and
11th points for the afternoon.
Repeat?
The game began as if it was
going to be a repeat of last
weekend's rout. Mike Grace
gained his first three points of
the afternoon as he took a pass
from scrum - half David Evans
after a line out, faked to his
outside wing, and then cut back
to the inside for the try. Grace
also kicked the extra points and
the Cards were off to an easy
and early 5-0 lead.
However, the Gappers came
roaring back as they were to do
all day, to score their first tie.
Ex-Cal footballer Rudy Carva
jal's kick was wide so the In
dians still had the lead 5-3.
After both sides exchanged
missed penalty kicks, ex-Stan
ford footballer and now med stu
dent Joe Neal picked up a loose
ball and rambled 40 yards before
he was forced to pass to wing
Bill Ostrander who was ran out
of bounds. Capitalizing on this
good field position the Indians
were able to push across another
score as a Frank Patitucci to
Grace to Andy Evanstone run

made the score 8-3 as the half
ended.
Grace Kicks
The second half started with
Grace kicking his first of three
penalty kicks of the day. At this
point it seemed that the Indians
had an almost insurmountable
lead of 11-3. But it was a former
Stanford rugger, Tim Hansel,
who led the Peacock rally. Han
sel popkicked the ball into the
end zone where Carvajal fell on
it for a try.
Although hampered by a
shoulder separation that he suf
fered in the recent seven-a-side
tourney, Hansel again brought
the Gappers down the field mo
ments later for another try to
narrow the score to 11-9.
The momentum of the game
had now clearly changed. Seem
ingly at ease Peacock's scrum
forced the ball into the Indian
endzone again. This time Carva
jal's kick was good and for the
first time all afternoon the Gap
pers led 14-11.
Clutch Kick
Grace tied the score, though,
with a penalty kick from a dif
ficult angle. An Indian offside
on a loose scrum gave Carvajal
another kick which gave Pea
cock the lead 17-14 and set the
stage for Grace's dramatic boot
after the final gun.
In commenting on his Indians
performance, Coach Pete Kme
tovie was obviously disappoint
ed. "We simply didn't play a
good game. We lost all of our
momentum in the second half.
They beat us with more hustle
in the scrums and on the line
outs." Kmetovic cited the play
of Grace, breakaway Bob New
berry, and prop Joe Neal as the
lone bright spots.
The two Stanford JV teams
were not even able to gain a tie
as the No. 1 team lost to the
Olympic Club "B" team 8-0 and
the No. 2 JVs lost to the Palo
Alto Rugby Club 15-3.

of bounds. Capitalizing on this
good field position the Indians
were able to push across another
score as a Frank Patitucci to
Grace to Andy Evanstone run

made the score 8-3 as the half
ended.
Grace Kicks
The second half started with
Grace kicking his first of three
penalty kicks of the day. At this
point it seemed that the Indians
had an almost insurmountable
lead of 11-3. But it was a former
Stanford rugger, Tim Hansel,
who led the Peacock rally. Han
sel popkicked the ball into the
end zone where Carvajal fell on
it for a try.
Although hampered by a
shoulder separation that he suf
fered in the recent seven-a-side
tourney, Hansel again brought
the Gappers down the field mo
ments later for another try to
narrow the score to 11-9.
The momentum of the game
had now clearly changed. Seem
ingly at ease Peacock's scrum
forced the ball into the Indian
endzone again. This time Carva
jal's kick was good and for the
first time all afternoon the Gap
pers led 14-11.
Clutch Kick
Grace tied the score, though,
with a penalty kick from a dif
ficult angle. An Indian offside
on a loose scrum gave Carvajal
another kick which gave Pea
cock the lead 17-14 and set the
stage for Grace's dramatic boot
after the final gun.
In commenting on his Indians
performance, Coach Pete Kme
tovie was obviously disappoint
ed. "We simply didn't play a
good game. We lost all of our
momentum in the second half.
They beat us with more hustle
in the scrums and on the line
outs." Kmetovic cited the play
of Grace, breakaway Bob New
berry, and prop Joe Neal as the
lone bright spots.
The two Stanford JV teams
were not even able to gain a tie
as the No. 1 team lost to the
Olympic Club "B" team 8-0 and
the No. 2 JVs lost to the Palo
Alto Rugby Club 15-3.
A disputed penalty kick after
the clock had run out gave the
Stanford rugby team, a 17-17,
tie with the Peacock Gap Rugby
Club. 2nd % Mike Grace, the
Australian graduate student
gained the tie for the Indians
by kicking his 9th, 10th F and
11th points for the afternoon.
Repeat?
The game began as if it was
going to be a repeat of last
weekend's rout. Mike Grace
gained his first three points of
the afternoon as he took a pass
from scrum - half David Evans
after a line out, faked to his
outside wing, and then cut back
to the inside for the try. Grace
also kicked the extra points and
the Cards were off to an easy
and early 5-0 lead.
However, the Gappers came
roaring back as they were to do
all day, to score their first tie.
Ex-Cal footballer Rudy Carva
jal's kick was wide so the In
dians still had the lead 5-3.
After both sides exchanged
missed penalty kicks, ex-Stan
ford footballer and now med stu
dent Joe Neal picked up a loose
ball and rambled 40 yards before
he was forced to pass to wing
Bill Ostrander who was ran out
of bounds. Capitalizing on this
good field position the Indians
were able to push across another
score as a Frank Patitucci to
Grace to Andy Evanstone run

made the score 8-3 as the half
ended.
