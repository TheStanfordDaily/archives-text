With a standing-room-o n 1 y
crowd watching, Stanford's box
ing team last Thursday fell to
the University of California, 8-5,
in a meet thai was highlighted
with both excellent and poor
boxing.
As was expected, Tom Jenks
and George Bellows of Stanford
and Dave Archibald of Cal were
big winners.
Two Bouts Contrasted
The first two bouts were an
indication of the type of boxing
that was to follow.
In the initial bout of the eve
ning, Jack Oatman fought to a
draw in the 147-pound match
that resembled a street-fight.
Contrasted to the first bout
was the second match in the 156
pound class beween Stanford's
George Bellows and Cal's Dick
Weinbrandt. Displaying consid

erable poise in the ring, both
boxers used conventional styles
of boxing effectively employing
an aggressive attack on offense
while incorporating defensive
moves that complemented their
variety of jabs and punches.
Bellows was awarded the deci
sion.
Bellows to the Body
Although Bellows had to re
vert to going mostly to the body
with his blows because of the
additional height advantage of
his foe and was thus unable to
effectively hurt his opponent, he
dominated the match through
out. Bellow's deficiency in reach
against Weinbrandt was over
come because of the eventual
winner's ability to work inside
and harass his opponent with
sharp, crisp shots to the body.
In terms of boxing style, Eric
de Gooyer in the heavyweight
division showed the most ingen
uity though lacking a little in
sense. De Gooyer stole the show
as the crowd was entertained
with his boxing antics that only
helped contribute to the frus
tration of his opponent.
De Gooyer commenced the
match with a charging, free
swinging style but then, either
because he hoped to fool his foe
or because he became too tired
to continue his aggressiveness,
he reverted to a bobbing, jab
bing type of boxing.
DeGooyer's Antics
In the third round de Gooyer,
as if almost daring his foe
to hit. him, dropped his guard
and merely backed away from
the now ineffective punches of
his rival.
The bout was stopped in the
final round by the referee after

de Gooyer had shaken his op
ponent with innumerable blows
to the head.
Tom Jenks, who was the most
impressive boxer of the evening
in terms of style and effective
ness, also was awarded a tech
nical knockout. Aga i ft Jenks
used his bobbing, backing-up
style while throwing in shots
from every angle and position.
The bout was stopped in the
second round.
John Merrill was also stopped
short in his bout against Dave
Archibald. Merrill, after being
dropped to the mat after less
than a minute of the first round
by the free-swinging Archibald,
walked into the blow that put
him down for good.
Restrained
In the 165 lb. division, John
Price was completely out-sized
and out-boxed but his success
in using his speed and agility
to stick his opponent resulted
in a relatively close contest.
Cal's Jim Moore, however, was
able to control most of the fight
and was awarded the victory.
Stanford's Dennis Hanson
also fought in the 165-pound
class and was awarded a sur
prising decision over Greg Mon
ohan.
In the final bout, Delos Brown
and Walt Cummingham fought
to a stale mate although Brown
was hurt considerably In the
final round and became com
pletely ineffective, unable to
swing or defend merely taking
the volley of Cummingham's
punches as best as possible.
