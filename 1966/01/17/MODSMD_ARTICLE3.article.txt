cidal buffalo herd and consequently
lives a favored life in a Hillsborough
corral.
"She is friendly," says Mrs. D. C.
Basolo Jr. of the seven-month-old, 400
pound bison. Mrs. Basolo's husband
raises 2, buffaloes on a 66,000 • acre
ranch in Nevada, and Mrs. Basolo says
most of them are ill humored and bad
mannered.
Friendly Jingles lives in a back

plush San Francisco suburb.
The disadvantage to a pet buffalo,
says Mrs. Basolo, is that the others
consider it a fink when it returns to
a herd.
