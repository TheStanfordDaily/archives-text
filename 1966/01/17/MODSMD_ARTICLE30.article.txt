## A 						Matter Of Re-computating Comp Center Compilations 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Recently you ran two articles
pertaining to the Computation
Center. Please allow me to cor
rect and comment upon certain
facts and impressions contained
therein.
Your article on the status of
"free" computer time attempts
to explain what I attempted to
explain, at much greater length,
to the community of Computa
tion Center users at an all-user
meeting held on January 5. The
seriousness of the issues under
discussion was emphasized to
users in a Computation Center
Bulletin mailed to all users dur
ing the last week of December.
(Copies are available to all who
ask) An alarmingly small num
ber of users showed up at the
January 5 meeting.
Here, in brief, is the story
that was told. The Computation
Center operates on the basis of
cost-recovery —it can neither
make a profit nor take a loss.
An hourly rate for computer
time on each machine is set (a
"fair" or "supportable" rate by
the standards of the Defense
Contract Audit Agency) on the
basis of expected costs and ex
pected utilization. Now, DCAA
insists, in effect, that all com
puter time used be paid for at
this rate. The details are too
long-winded to go into here, but
this attitude is in line with gen
erally accepted standards of ac
counting and auditing.

Holders of research contracts
and grants pay for computer
time out of their research budg
ets. Funds to cover "unspon
sored" faculty and student re
search and instructional use of
the computer (i.e., homework
for courses using the computer)
are available from the univer
sity, from the National Science
Foundation (for research), and
from special grants and gifts.
At the moment, the Computation
Center happens to be the custo
dian of these funds (reluctantly,
I hasten to add). These funds
constitute a scarce resource, and
therefore have to be budgeted
carefully, since when they run
out in a particular budget year,
there is no more.
Because of an astonishing
growth in demand for the funds
covering "unsponsored" re
search, the money in this cate
gory ran out rather early this
year. All available funds of this
kind were allocated by Decem
ber 15. Hence, the crisis. It was
not triggered by a "reduction in
a government grant" as you put
it in your caption, but merely
by intense demand on campus
for limited funds.
It isn't accurate to call this
situation a "policy change."
When the well has run dry, it
hasn't changed its policy about
giving water. It has merely run
dry.
It is also not true that "in the
past the government ...has

been paying for more computer
time than it has actually been
using." First of all, this would
have been illegal. Secondly, give
credit (as taxpayers) where it's
due, to the government auditors
for their very sharp eyesight.
There is some "idle time" on
our computers, but it cannot be
used by "unsponsored" users
right now because such use must
be paid for at the going rate,
and the well has run dry.
The university is contributing
far in excess of the $25,000 men
tioned in your article. This will
be increased substantially in the
next year and hopefully in the
years to come.
Finally (and alas) the Compu
tation Center occupies only Pine
Hall (for machines) and Polya
Hall (for people). Redwood.
Spruce and Cedar lie outside its
cybernated grasp.

• Disaster
Editor, The Dally:
We would like to comment on
the extremely noticeable lack of
adequate ramp facilities leading
from the post office to Salvatier
ra Road, which, when one ap
plies only slight consideration,
seems to be one Hell of a drop.
Obviously, a simple asphalt
ramp would remedy this situa
tion.
