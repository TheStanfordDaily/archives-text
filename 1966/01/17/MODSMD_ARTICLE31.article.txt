# TWO MINUTES OF HAIGHT
## As TORPOR Descends ... 
### BY TIM HAIGHT 
Unhappily, the A.P.A.T.H.Y. group start
ed here last week has failed to materialize,
apparently from lack of interest. However,
another group, TORPOR, is slouching onto
the campus political scene. Fully called
Truth Often Requires Pensiveness—Obvi
ously Repugnant, this new militant-apathy
organization hopes to force professors to
admit the same degree of reasoning into
their classes as they see us display in our
attitudes toward on-campus politics.
TORPOR presents an iron-clad argument.
In a few years we will be out in the world,
making decisions. Our coursework, exclu
sive of trade training, will probably have
about as much effect on the way we live
as it does now—precious little. So why try
to impose absurd academic standards on
our lives? Far better to impose our lives'
standards on our studies. It leaves more
time for the tube.
Off-The-Reoord Points
The activists in TORPOR haven't gotten
around to publishing any platform yet, but
they have made a few off-the-record points.
They maintain above all that the best way
to prove their case is to go to almost every
board meeting and listen to the arguments.
Seventy-five percent of them are totally ir
rational. Or try discussing the campus reli
gious situation or the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam around the dinner
table and guess how many of the arguments
would hold up on a Poly Sci final.
So far, the most idiotic arguments have
come from the discussions about Social
Regulations. One of the best will come in
handy in many departments, when one is
faced with a question about education and
responsibility. Everyone knows that society
accepts high school dropout girls' getting

jobs and living in their own apartments.
But Stanford women, vastly more educated,
must be protected from off-campus living.
Education is inversely related to responsi
bility, Q.E.D.
Another prize is the "Protectionist" argu
ment. That is, the reason for social regula
tions is that the girls want someone to
come looking for them if some disaster be
falls them and they don't get in on time.
From the number of late-leave violations
that are not excused by a disaster, it is ob
vious that there are possibly other reasons
for not getting in, but the idea of a volun
tary sign-out where those who didn't want
to be protected wouldn't have to be is un
thinkable. Reworded, the girls want to be
protected, even if it is against their will.
6 A.M. Worse Than 2:30 AJVf.?
Still another argument that blows the
mind is the question of why a late leave
violation at 6 a.m. is more serious than one
at 2:30. No kidding, last quarter a majority
of the AWS Council voted to make a 6 a.m.
late leave infringement a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The reason given
had something to do with 6 a.m. being de
fined as the beginning of the University
day, and for some reason this was impor
tant. You figure it out.
The "New Reasoning," as TORPOR calls
it, is evident in other fields as well. Our
University officers have displayed it on oc
casion. The best statement so far came
about three years ago from a high univer
sity figure. He said, "I don't see why any
Jew would find it improper to worship in
Memorial Church." Yes, he really said that.
At this point you may think this reason
ing absurd. It is. But it is the kind of rea

soning that caroms around Quad when
people do not apply to extracurricular is
sues the rigor that is expected of them in
class. And why should they? With a little
determination any body can resist the at
tempts at "personality development" that
the modern university calls education.
Leave discussion of student affairs to the
motivated, those with an emotional stake
in the issues. Emotional argument is always
better than detached reasoning.
And, realistically, this is the type of
thinking we will most likely display in our
"big world" lives. We will have our jobs
and families to worry about. We won't have
time to reason.
Despair For Change
And since most of the student leaders
honestly despair of getting us to change,
TORPOR offers the ideal solution. Apply
less thought to useless academics, concen
trate on training to get a job, and watch a
lot of television.
TORPOR is more, however, than realistic
preparation for American adulthood. The
"New Reasoning" has fascinating applica
tions to historical situations on Civ finals.
For example, by this method one can argue
to kill Socrates; the Sophists had the most
realistic philosophy of education. And don't
let Christ say anything that might have "on
world" applications. That might rock the
boat. The astronomy of Tycho Brahe is the
best. It's a compromise between that radi
cal Copernicus and the traditions of the
University. The Nazi revolution did not
come about due to a lack of democratic
participation among the German people.
We have the same apathy and torpor
here. And everybody knows it can't happen
here.

would hold up on a Poly Sci final.
So far, the most idiotic arguments have
come from the discussions about Social
Regulations. One of the best will come in
handy in many departments, when one is
faced with a question about education and
responsibility. Everyone knows that society
accepts high school dropout girls' getting

jobs and living in their own apartments.
But Stanford women, vastly more educated,
must be protected from off-campus living.
Education is inversely related to responsi
bility, Q.E.D.
Another prize is the "Protectionist" argu
ment. That is, the reason for social regula
tions is that the girls want someone to
come looking for them if some disaster be
falls them and they don't get in on time.
From the number of late-leave violations
that are not excused by a disaster, it is ob
vious that there are possibly other reasons
for not getting in, but the idea of a volun
tary sign-out where those who didn't want
to be protected wouldn't have to be is un
thinkable. Reworded, the girls want to be
protected, even if it is against their will.
6 A.M. Worse Than 2:30 AJVf.?
Still another argument that blows the
mind is the question of why a late leave
violation at 6 a.m. is more serious than one
at 2:30. No kidding, last quarter a majority
of the AWS Council voted to make a 6 a.m.
late leave infringement a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The reason given
had something to do with 6 a.m. being de
fined as the beginning of the University
day, and for some reason this was impor
tant. You figure it out.
The "New Reasoning," as TORPOR calls
it, is evident in other fields as well. Our
University officers have displayed it on oc
casion. The best statement so far came
about three years ago from a high univer
sity figure. He said, "I don't see why any
Jew would find it improper to worship in
Memorial Church." Yes, he really said that.
At this point you may think this reason
ing absurd. It is. But it is the kind of rea

soning that caroms around Quad when
people do not apply to extracurricular is
sues the rigor that is expected of them in
class. And why should they? With a little
determination any body can resist the at
tempts at "personality development" that
the modern university calls education.
Leave discussion of student affairs to the
motivated, those with an emotional stake
in the issues. Emotional argument is always
better than detached reasoning.
And, realistically, this is the type of
thinking we will most likely display in our
"big world" lives. We will have our jobs
and families to worry about. We won't have
time to reason.
Despair For Change
And since most of the student leaders
honestly despair of getting us to change,
TORPOR offers the ideal solution. Apply
less thought to useless academics, concen
trate on training to get a job, and watch a
lot of television.
TORPOR is more, however, than realistic
preparation for American adulthood. The
"New Reasoning" has fascinating applica
tions to historical situations on Civ finals.
For example, by this method one can argue
to kill Socrates; the Sophists had the most
realistic philosophy of education. And don't
let Christ say anything that might have "on
world" applications. That might rock the
boat. The astronomy of Tycho Brahe is the
best. It's a compromise between that radi
cal Copernicus and the traditions of the
University. The Nazi revolution did not
come about due to a lack of democratic
participation among the German people.
We have the same apathy and torpor
here. And everybody knows it can't happen
here.
Unhappily, the A.P.A.T.H.Y. group start
ed here last week has failed to materialize,
apparently from lack of interest. However,
another group, TORPOR, is slouching onto
the campus political scene. Fully called
Truth Often Requires Pensiveness—Obvi
ously Repugnant, this new militant-apathy
organization hopes to force professors to
admit the same degree of reasoning into
their classes as they see us display in our
attitudes toward on-campus politics.
TORPOR presents an iron-clad argument.
In a few years we will be out in the world,
making decisions. Our coursework, exclu
sive of trade training, will probably have
about as much effect on the way we live
as it does now—precious little. So why try
to impose absurd academic standards on
our lives? Far better to impose our lives'
standards on our studies. It leaves more
time for the tube.
Off-The-Reoord Points
The activists in TORPOR haven't gotten
around to publishing any platform yet, but
they have made a few off-the-record points.
They maintain above all that the best way
to prove their case is to go to almost every
board meeting and listen to the arguments.
Seventy-five percent of them are totally ir
rational. Or try discussing the campus reli
gious situation or the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam around the dinner
table and guess how many of the arguments
would hold up on a Poly Sci final.

late leave infringement a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The reason given
had something to do with 6 a.m. being de
fined as the beginning of the University
day, and for some reason this was impor
tant. You figure it out.
The "New Reasoning," as TORPOR calls
it, is evident in other fields as well. Our
University officers have displayed it on oc
casion. The best statement so far came
about three years ago from a high univer
sity figure. He said, "I don't see why any
Jew would find it improper to worship in
Memorial Church." Yes, he really said that.
At this point you may think this reason
ing absurd. It is. But it is the kind of rea

soning that caroms around Quad when
people do not apply to extracurricular is
sues the rigor that is expected of them in
class. And why should they? With a little
determination any body can resist the at
tempts at "personality development" that
the modern university calls education.
Leave discussion of student affairs to the
motivated, those with an emotional stake
in the issues. Emotional argument is always
better than detached reasoning.
And, realistically, this is the type of
thinking we will most likely display in our
"big world" lives. We will have our jobs
and families to worry about. We won't have
time to reason.
Despair For Change
And since most of the student leaders
honestly despair of getting us to change,
TORPOR offers the ideal solution. Apply
less thought to useless academics, concen
trate on training to get a job, and watch a
lot of television.
TORPOR is more, however, than realistic
preparation for American adulthood. The
"New Reasoning" has fascinating applica
tions to historical situations on Civ finals.
For example, by this method one can argue
to kill Socrates; the Sophists had the most
realistic philosophy of education. And don't
let Christ say anything that might have "on
world" applications. That might rock the
boat. The astronomy of Tycho Brahe is the
best. It's a compromise between that radi
cal Copernicus and the traditions of the
University. The Nazi revolution did not
come about due to a lack of democratic
participation among the German people.
We have the same apathy and torpor
here. And everybody knows it can't happen
here.
Unhappily, the A.P.A.T.H.Y. group start
ed here last week has failed to materialize,
apparently from lack of interest. However,
another group, TORPOR, is slouching onto
the campus political scene. Fully called
Truth Often Requires Pensiveness—Obvi
ously Repugnant, this new militant-apathy
organization hopes to force professors to
admit the same degree of reasoning into
their classes as they see us display in our
attitudes toward on-campus politics.
TORPOR presents an iron-clad argument.
In a few years we will be out in the world,
making decisions. Our coursework, exclu
sive of trade training, will probably have
about as much effect on the way we live
as it does now—precious little. So why try
to impose absurd academic standards on
our lives? Far better to impose our lives'
standards on our studies. It leaves more
time for the tube.
Off-The-Reoord Points
The activists in TORPOR haven't gotten
around to publishing any platform yet, but
they have made a few off-the-record points.
They maintain above all that the best way
to prove their case is to go to almost every
board meeting and listen to the arguments.
Seventy-five percent of them are totally ir
rational. Or try discussing the campus reli
gious situation or the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam around the dinner
table and guess how many of the arguments
would hold up on a Poly Sci final.
So far, the most idiotic arguments have
come from the discussions about Social
Regulations. One of the best will come in
handy in many departments, when one is
faced with a question about education and
responsibility. Everyone knows that society
accepts high school dropout girls' getting

jobs and living in their own apartments.
But Stanford women, vastly more educated,
must be protected from off-campus living.
Education is inversely related to responsi
bility, Q.E.D.
Another prize is the "Protectionist" argu
ment. That is, the reason for social regula
tions is that the girls want someone to
come looking for them if some disaster be
falls them and they don't get in on time.
From the number of late-leave violations
that are not excused by a disaster, it is ob
vious that there are possibly other reasons
for not getting in, but the idea of a volun
tary sign-out where those who didn't want
to be protected wouldn't have to be is un
thinkable. Reworded, the girls want to be
protected, even if it is against their will.
6 A.M. Worse Than 2:30 AJVf.?
Still another argument that blows the
mind is the question of why a late leave
violation at 6 a.m. is more serious than one
at 2:30. No kidding, last quarter a majority
of the AWS Council voted to make a 6 a.m.
