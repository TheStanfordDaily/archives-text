# THE 						CAPITOL SCENE
## Medicare To Insure Red, White & Blue Corpuscles 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
One of the provisions of Medi
care is that any person not cov
ered by Social Security or rail
road retirement insurance is in
eligible for hospital and nursing
home benefits if he is a Commu
nist or a member of a Commu
nist front.
To enforce this, a person in
this category must answer the
following questions: "Are you
now or have you during the past
12 months been a member of
any organization which is re
quired to register under the In
ternal Security Act of 1950 as
a Communist action organiza
tion, a Communits front organi
zation, or a Communist infiltrat
ed organization?"
I hadn't realized what chaos
this question was causing until
I got a call from my Uncle Har
ry who was all excited about it.
"How are you, Uncle Harry?"
I asked.
"My rheumatism is killing me.
That's what I'm calling about.
What is all this business about
not being a member of the Com
munist party or a Communist in
filtrated organization in order to
get Medicare?"
"It's quite simple, Uncle Har

ry. We don't want people who
would overthrow our govern
ment to get free hospital and
nursing care."
"With my rheumatism I can't
even get to the doctor, much less
overthrow the government."
"Ah, Uncle Harry, that's just
it. If you were a Communist and
got hospital care, you might be
come well, and then you would
be in a position to overthrow
the government."
"If I could get rid of my rheu
matism, I'd be willing to join
the John Birch Society."
"But, Uncle Harry, I don't
know what you're all excited
about. You're not a member of
the Communist party, are you?"
"I should hope not. Have you
ever seen anyone with rheuma
tism who wanted to be part of
a sit-in?"
"Then what are you worried
about?"
"It's these Communist-front
and Communist-infiltrated orga
nizations. I don't know if I be
long to any or not."
"Well, what organizations have
you joined in the past 12
months?"
"The Bideaway Village for
Senior Citizens, $10 down and
$10 a month."
"I'm sure that's not on the
subversive list."
"What about the Retired
Friends of the Forest Hills Li
brary?"
"That I'd better check. Any
thing else?"
"The Planned Parenthood As
sociation?"
"That sounds bad, Uncle Har
ry. It's not on the list now, but
you never can tell."
"I knew it," Uncle Harry said.
"I'll never get my rheumatism
cured."
Law For Good Old People
"Now don't be discouraged,
Uncle Harry. This law is only
aimed at bad old people, not
good old people. I'm sure they
didn't have you in mind when
they wrote it."
"At your age you can say that.
If you want my opinion, I think
the government's trying to save
some money."
"Uncle Harry, you don't seem
to understand. The United States
is out to eradicate the Commu
nist party. If their members
don't get hospital care, they'll
be eradicated that much sooner."
"Now that you explain it to
me, it does make sense. I have
only one problem."
"What's that?"
"Wit h my rheumatism my
hands shake so much I can't
even answer no to the question."

One of the provisions of Medi
care is that any person not cov
ered by Social Security or rail
road retirement insurance is in
eligible for hospital and nursing
home benefits if he is a Commu
nist or a member of a Commu
nist front.
To enforce this, a person in
this category must answer the
following questions: "Are you
now or have you during the past
12 months been a member of
any organization which is re
quired to register under the In
ternal Security Act of 1950 as
a Communist action organiza
tion, a Communits front organi
zation, or a Communist infiltrat
ed organization?"
I hadn't realized what chaos
this question was causing until
I got a call from my Uncle Har
ry who was all excited about it.
"How are you, Uncle Harry?"
I asked.
"My rheumatism is killing me.
That's what I'm calling about.
What is all this business about
not being a member of the Com
munist party or a Communist in
filtrated organization in order to
get Medicare?"
"It's quite simple, Uncle Har

ry. We don't want people who
would overthrow our govern
ment to get free hospital and
nursing care."
"With my rheumatism I can't
even get to the doctor, much less
overthrow the government."
"Ah, Uncle Harry, that's just
it. If you were a Communist and
got hospital care, you might be
come well, and then you would
be in a position to overthrow
the government."
"If I could get rid of my rheu
matism, I'd be willing to join
the John Birch Society."
"But, Uncle Harry, I don't
know what you're all excited
about. You're not a member of
the Communist party, are you?"
"I should hope not. Have you
ever seen anyone with rheuma
tism who wanted to be part of
a sit-in?"
"Then what are you worried
about?"
"It's these Communist-front
and Communist-infiltrated orga
nizations. I don't know if I be
long to any or not."
"Well, what organizations have
you joined in the past 12
months?"
"The Bideaway Village for
Senior Citizens, $10 down and
$10 a month."
"I'm sure that's not on the
subversive list."
"What about the Retired
Friends of the Forest Hills Li
brary?"
"That I'd better check. Any
thing else?"
"The Planned Parenthood As
sociation?"
"That sounds bad, Uncle Har
ry. It's not on the list now, but
you never can tell."
"I knew it," Uncle Harry said.
"I'll never get my rheumatism
cured."
Law For Good Old People
"Now don't be discouraged,
Uncle Harry. This law is only
aimed at bad old people, not
good old people. I'm sure they
didn't have you in mind when
they wrote it."
"At your age you can say that.
If you want my opinion, I think
the government's trying to save
some money."
"Uncle Harry, you don't seem
to understand. The United States
is out to eradicate the Commu
nist party. If their members
don't get hospital care, they'll
be eradicated that much sooner."
"Now that you explain it to
me, it does make sense. I have
only one problem."
"What's that?"
"Wit h my rheumatism my
hands shake so much I can't
even answer no to the question."
