# IN SCHENLEY BOYCOTT
## Pickets Increase Liquor Sales 
### PAM LANG 
About 20 Stanford student volun
teers achieved only partial success
this weekend while picketing three
Palo Alto liquor stores in support of
Delano's striking Farm Workers Asso
ciation.
The boycott was aimed only at
Schenley-distributed wines and li
quors. The pickets attempted to dis
courage purchase of Schenley prod
ucts by distributing information on
the grape pickers' strike in Delano,
where Schenley farms are among
those being struck.
Picketers were recruited from the
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM), the Canterbury Foundation
and the Stanford Friends of the Stu
dent Non-Violent Coordinating Com
mittee (SNCC) at a meeting held
Thursday afternoon in Tresidder,
Picket lines were scheduled at Er
nie's, U-Save, and Cesano's Liquor
Stores from 2 to 8 p.m. Friday and
Saturday. A planned picket of Rick
ey's Hyatt House was called off after
negotiation Friday morning between
the Rev. Don Poston of the First
Christian Church and Rickey's man
agement reached a provisional agree
ment.
Although the local picketing passed
without incident, a related episode
in San Francisco Thursday night led
to a minor demonstration.
Representatives of SNCC and the
California Council for Farm Labor
visited a cocktail party given by the
California Heritage Council, an al
legedly conservative organization, ask
ing that some of the Delano farm
workers with them be admitted to the
party because their Mexican ancestry
gave them a great interest in "Cali
fornia heritage."
Refused admission to the party,
they staged a demonstration, "their
own party," in the street outside, sing
ing freedom songs and displaying
picket signs. According to UCCM
member Brian Peckham, a junior eco
nomics major and project coordinator
for the local picketing, "they made
their point."
The student pickets here felt that

they too had been generally success
ful. "Things were pretty quiet," said
Peckham.
However, the managements of Ce
sano's and Ernie's considered the stu
dent effort unsuccessful, reporting, in
fact, that it had led to increased sales
of Schenley products.
Owner Jim Cesano, whose store was
picketed only for three hours on Fri
day afternoon, said that his Schenley
sales increased from a usual "very

small" percentage to 40% of the after
noon's total sale.
"They were nice kids," he said,
"very courteous. I would like to have
them come backâ€”they're good for
business."
Igor Koman, manager of Ernie's,
said, "They're going the wrong way.
I don't think they should picket in
dividual stores." He explained his in
creased sales by saying of the pickets,
"People are tired of things like that."
