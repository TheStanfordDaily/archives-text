mer chairman of the Department of

ca." He is a lecturer and co-author of

Emphasis on Viet Nam
"Prof. Mancall is presently teaching

sition to the U. S. policy in Viet Nam
might combine to emphasize Viet Nam
in this session," notes Moses.
"However, the conference as a
whole will not be a huge diatribe on
Viet Nam. It will have an academic

bent, and will concern revolutions in
general. We will refer to Viet Nam
only as it is exemplary of revolution."
Sunday will be devoted to seminars
for a core of 40 students who have
prepared for the institute by reading
three works of the speakers. These

ca." He is a lecturer and co-author of

and results; and its effects on the de

Stanford History Department.
Emphasis on Viet Nam
"Prof. Mancall is presently teaching
a course in Chinese Institutions. This
interest plus Sen. Church's open oppo
sition to the U. S. policy in Viet Nam
might combine to emphasize Viet Nam
in this session," notes Moses.
"However, the conference as a
whole will not be a huge diatribe on
Viet Nam. It will have an academic

bent, and will concern revolutions in
general. We will refer to Viet Nam
only as it is exemplary of revolution."
Sunday will be devoted to seminars
for a core of 40 students who have
prepared for the institute by reading
three works of the speakers. These
seminars are not open to the public.
A bibliography and precis on the
purpose of the institute will be dis
