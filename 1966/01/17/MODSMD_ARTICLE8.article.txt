### 
The ad-hoc committee of the Over
seas Campus Board has formed four
subcommittees, covering different as
pects of the overseas campuses. They
will present their findings during the
committee's next general meeting on
January 25 at 9:30 p.m. in TMU.
In its first meeting last Tuesday
evening, which drew an attendance of
about 40, the committee discussed
structural problems and decided upon
the smaller groups.
The committees deal with the goals
of the academic program and related
topics, teachers, their selection and
nationality, the content and format of
courses, and invironmental factors of
the academic situation. Jeff Difen
dorf, Marcia Cohn, Dan Bedford, and
Pat Deckert are serving as chairmen.
Interested students may still con
tact the subcommittee chairmen if
they wish to participate.
Each subcommittee will meet indi
vidually during the next two weeks to
prepare preliminary reports which
will be reviewed during the main
meeting, according to ad-hoc commit
tee chairman Steve Martindale.
He added that the goal of the com
mittee is to evaluate the overseas pro
gram from the students' point of view
as much as possible. Martindale said
that eventually the group would seek
the opinions of faculty and adminis
tration members and probably also of
the alumni.
A final report will be submitted to
the Academic Committee of General
Studies.
