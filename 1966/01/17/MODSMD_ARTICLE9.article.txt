# AFTER THE 'BOMBING'
## Charges Labeled 'Ridiculous' 
### 
Raymond P. Tiernan. 23, a Stanford
graduate student, told The Daily yes
terday that he considers his arrest
along with three other local men on a
charge of conspiracy following an
anti-Vietnam War leaflet "bombing"
of Oakland as an attempt by the Oak
land Police Department "to get the
peace movement."
Tiernan would not comment on
whether or not he was involved in thÂ«
incident, but saw the issue as bigger
than just a question of dropping leaf
lets. He said it was a test if "radical
action can be taken by the peace move
ment and not be strangled by the Oak
land police."
Ridiculous
He added that he thought the con
spiracy charge was "ridiculous," and
that the police would not specify what
kind of conspiracy was involved.
Tiernan was arrested along with
Anthony E. Broskley, 28, Palo Alto,
an unemployed heavy equipment op
erator; Glen Fowler, 21, a San Jose
State College student; and James Pe
trie, 56, the pilot.
They were apprehended Friday
night at San Carlos Airport after Oak
land police followed the aircraft's re
turn flight via radar stations at Mof
fett Field and the Oakland Airport.

Oakland police said the plane flew
over their city as low as 1,500 feet
without lights. Such an action is con
sidered as a possible violation of Fed
eral Aviation Agency (FAA) laws.
The leaflets depicted the charred
bodies of a woman and a child on one
side and an anti war statement on the
other.
I Will Kill You
Tiernan said that while being ar
rested he was hit on the temple and
also in the small of the back by an
Oakland planclothesman. He said that
one of the policeman told Broskley:
"If you blink your eyelash I will kill
you."
The four were taken to Oakland
where they were "grilled for eight
hours by police before being thrown
into a cell Saturday morning along
with five sailors, three Negroes, an
Indian, and a Mexican," Tiernan con
tinued. The nine whites were fed a
breakfast consisting of a bologna
sandwich, while the others received
nothing.
The suspects were released Satur
day afternoon on $3,300 bail, $1,100
each for Tiernan and Petrie and $550
each for Broskley and Fowler. Tiernan
could not explain why his and Pe
trie's bails were higher.
Tiernan and the others are due to

be arraigned in Oakland this morn
ing.
