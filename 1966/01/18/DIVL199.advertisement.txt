Wayward Sons
Jesus Christ once told a simple story of a wayward son who went astray.
"There was a man who had two sons", he said, "and the younger of them
said to the father. 'Father, give me the share of property that falls to me'. And
he divided his living between them. Not many days later, the younger son
gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he
squandered his property in loose living. And when he had spent everything,
a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want. So he went
and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into
the fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the
swine ate ; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he
said, 'How many of my father s hired servants have bread enough and to spare,
but I perish here wiith hunger!
I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have
sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called
your son; treat me as one of your hired servants".' And he arose and came to
his father. But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had com
passion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to the
father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy
to be called your son.' But the father said to his servants, "Bring quickly the
best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet;
and bring the fatted calf and kill it,and let us eat and make merry; for this
my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found' . . (Luke
15:11-32).
Jesus Christ who told this story, is the One, who by His perfect sacrifice for
sin, has made it possible for wayward sons like you and I to go back to our
heavenly Father—a Father whose treasures we have misused and resources we
have misspent. The Good News is the love of the Father who freely forgives,
forgets and restores, with joy.
It is Jesus Christ who told this tale, who also said, "All things have been
delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son
chooses to reveal Him. Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden and
I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:27, 28).

I Christ. Why not go to Him today?

gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he
squandered his property in loose living. And when he had spent everything,
a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want. So he went
and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into
the fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the
swine ate ; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he
said, 'How many of my father s hired servants have bread enough and to spare,
but I perish here wiith hunger!
I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have
sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called
your son; treat me as one of your hired servants".' And he arose and came to
his father. But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had com
passion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to the
father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy
to be called your son.' But the father said to his servants, "Bring quickly the
best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet;
and bring the fatted calf and kill it,and let us eat and make merry; for this
my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found' . . (Luke
15:11-32).
Jesus Christ who told this story, is the One, who by His perfect sacrifice for
sin, has made it possible for wayward sons like you and I to go back to our
heavenly Father—a Father whose treasures we have misused and resources we
have misspent. The Good News is the love of the Father who freely forgives,
forgets and restores, with joy.
It is Jesus Christ who told this tale, who also said, "All things have been
delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son
chooses to reveal Him. Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden and
I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:27, 28).
Have you found the rest and restoration of our Father? It is found iin Jesus
I Christ. Why not go to Him today?

Jesus Christ once told a simple story of a wayward son who went astray.
"There was a man who had two sons", he said, "and the younger of them
said to the father. 'Father, give me the share of property that falls to me'. And
he divided his living between them. Not many days later, the younger son
gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he
squandered his property in loose living. And when he had spent everything,
a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want. So he went
and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into
the fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the
swine ate ; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he
said, 'How many of my father s hired servants have bread enough and to spare,
but I perish here wiith hunger!
