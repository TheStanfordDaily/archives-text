tinue as chief of the war on poverty

ficers at a heavier rate in Viet Nam
fighting than in Korea or World War

• Frencli Boycott Halted
LUXEMBOURG — France ended a
six-month boycott of the European
Common Market Monday and came
up at once with a demand that each
of the six members keep the right to
vote major decisions.
The demand came with a 1-point
memorandum presented by Maurice
Couve de Murville, President Charles
de Gaulle's Foreign Minister. He also
asked for measures to clip the wings
of the Common Market executive,
called the commission.
The vote has existed all along, but
had been due to disappear Jan. 1. As
for the nine-man executive commis
sion, headed by Walter Hallstein of
West Germany, the French believe it
has overreached itself and interfered
too much in the national affairs of the
member countries.
