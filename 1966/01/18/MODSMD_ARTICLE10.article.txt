# Critic Emphasizes Jazz Variety In '50's
## 
### 
Jazz took no one course in the 50's.
If anything, it was the decade of di
versification, according to jazz critic
and composer Leonard Feather in the
second of a series of Tresidder lec
tures on "America's only native art
form."
The 50's can be looked on as the
decade in which the shibboleth was
broken which limited the playing of
jazz to nine instruments. For the first
time, Feather explained, instruments
such as the flute, cello, oboe, French
horn and organ were introduced to
the creation of jazz.
Shift to Small Combo
The most significant aspect in the
Jazz of the 50's was its shift in inter
est from the big band sound of the
40's to the small combo.
Feather cited economics as the pri
mary cause of this change: night
clubs no longer wished tb build large
showrooms to house these bands. Fur
thermore, the 50's also witnessed a
diminished interest in dancing to jazz
music.
The jazz scene around 1950 was
much more quiescent than it is now,
according to Feather. In that year,
the leadership of jazz was in a "sad
state," according to fellow critic Gold
berg whom Feather quoted, because
Dizzy Gillespie had to disband his
large band and form a combo.
Feather named three major figures
at work around 1950: Miles Davis,
George Shearing, and Lennie Trus
tano. However, Davis was considered
obscure and esoteric, as was Theloni
ous Monk, at that time.
Shearing, on the other hand, was
highly popular with the public al
though critics found his music bland.
Feather did acknowledge that "as an
improvising pianist, Shearing is and
was a first-class performer."
Jazz Movements
Listing some of the movements
unique to the 50's, Feather discussed
the Third Stream movement, "Cool"
Jazz, Hard Be-bop Jazz, and West
Coast Jazz.
He admitted finding both merit and
fakery in Third Stream Jazz, a fusing
of classical themes with jazz artistry.
Feather attributed the founding of
this movement to Stan Kenton's al
most unnoticed album "Innovations
in Modern Music," recorded in 1950.
Festival Jasz
Feather praised the innovations in
troduced by such artists of the 50's as
Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, Gerry Mul
ligan, John Lewis, and particularly
Cannonball Adderly, who almost liter
ally catapulted himself to fame in
1955 when he leapt on the stage of
New York's Bohemia Club and demon
strated his talents.
In 1956 another highly gifted per

former to achieve public recognition
was Thelonious Monk. Shortly after
wards, the jazz scene was excited by
a revolutionary concept devised by
Miles Davis and John Coltrane: that
of improvisation by arranging notes
on a scale rather than with chords.
The last decade Feather found es
pecially noteworthy for its populariza
tion of jazz festivals, a phenomenon
introduced in America at Newport in
1954.

Jazz of the 50's was its shift in inter
est from the big band sound of the
40's to the small combo.
Feather cited economics as the pri
mary cause of this change: night
clubs no longer wished tb build large
showrooms to house these bands. Fur
thermore, the 50's also witnessed a
diminished interest in dancing to jazz
music.
The jazz scene around 1950 was
much more quiescent than it is now,
according to Feather. In that year,
the leadership of jazz was in a "sad
state," according to fellow critic Gold
berg whom Feather quoted, because
Dizzy Gillespie had to disband his
large band and form a combo.
Feather named three major figures
at work around 1950: Miles Davis,
George Shearing, and Lennie Trus
tano. However, Davis was considered
obscure and esoteric, as was Theloni
ous Monk, at that time.
Shearing, on the other hand, was
highly popular with the public al
though critics found his music bland.
Feather did acknowledge that "as an
improvising pianist, Shearing is and
was a first-class performer."
Jazz Movements
Listing some of the movements
unique to the 50's, Feather discussed
the Third Stream movement, "Cool"
Jazz, Hard Be-bop Jazz, and West
Coast Jazz.
He admitted finding both merit and
fakery in Third Stream Jazz, a fusing
of classical themes with jazz artistry.
Feather attributed the founding of
this movement to Stan Kenton's al
most unnoticed album "Innovations
in Modern Music," recorded in 1950.
Festival Jasz
Feather praised the innovations in
troduced by such artists of the 50's as
Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, Gerry Mul
ligan, John Lewis, and particularly
Cannonball Adderly, who almost liter
ally catapulted himself to fame in
1955 when he leapt on the stage of
New York's Bohemia Club and demon
strated his talents.
In 1956 another highly gifted per

former to achieve public recognition
was Thelonious Monk. Shortly after
wards, the jazz scene was excited by
a revolutionary concept devised by
Miles Davis and John Coltrane: that
of improvisation by arranging notes
on a scale rather than with chords.
The last decade Feather found es
pecially noteworthy for its populariza
tion of jazz festivals, a phenomenon
introduced in America at Newport in
1954.

Jazz took no one course in the 50's.
If anything, it was the decade of di
versification, according to jazz critic
and composer Leonard Feather in the
second of a series of Tresidder lec
tures on "America's only native art
form."
The 50's can be looked on as the
decade in which the shibboleth was
broken which limited the playing of
jazz to nine instruments. For the first
time, Feather explained, instruments
such as the flute, cello, oboe, French
horn and organ were introduced to
the creation of jazz.
