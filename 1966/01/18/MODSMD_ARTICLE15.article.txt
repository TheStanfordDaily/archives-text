# Gymnasts Fall To Arizona
## 
### HUGH WEST 
Lack of depth was a telling
factor Saturday, as the Stanford
Varsity Gymnasts fell to a
powerful Arizona State team
182.5-99.15.
Although the Indians turned
in some respectable individual
performances, they could fill
only two events with three con
testants and in the side horse
had only one man. Arizona
State, meanwhile, filled every

event with three or four men.
Stanford's best event was the
first of the afternoon â€” the
Floor Excercise. Captain Bob
Cook, Pete Gibson, and sopho
more Tom Boyce turned in
scores of 7.15, 7.7, and 7.5 for
an event total of 22.35, just four
points behind Arizona State.
Cook Stars
Cook was the Tribe's mainstay
for the afternoon, compiling a
42.45 all-around score, capped by
a 7.9 in the long horse and a 7.95
in the rings.
Several Stanford Freshman
and Grad Studens turned in no
table exhibition performances.
Jim Peterson turned in an 8.2
in the floor exercise, and Jon
Harrison, a relative newcomer
to the event, turned in an 8.45
in the Rings. Former national
champion Russ Mills gave a
near-flawless side-horse exhibi
tion for a 9.45 score.
Outstanding performances for

State were turned in by Rich
ard Impson with a 9.1 in the
Floor Exercise, Skip Johnson
with a 9.2 in the Long Horse,
and Les Christianson, with a
9.25 in the Rings. Impson went
all seven events, contributing
57.60 points.
