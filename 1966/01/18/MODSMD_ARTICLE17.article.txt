# Frosh Cagers Sweep Weekend Pair; Now 6-0
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Somewhere behind all the
glory of Stanford's varsity bas
ketball team rests the glories of
the Frosh basketball squad —
six little glories. Unbeknown to
most residents of the Farm is
the fact that the Papooses have
rolled up a 6-0 record, climaxed
by two comeback victories this
weekend.
In both games, played against
Cal State at Hayward and Men
lo College, the frosh needed a
second half spurt to insure vic
tory. Against Hayward, though,
the Tribe really had a little trou
ble. Throughout the first half,
they played a shabby game, yet
left the court with a 9 point
lead. The final score was 73-48.
On Saturday afternoon Menlo
College really put on a scare
for 30 minutes. With large Stu
Watterson scoring 23 and grab
bing 18 rebounds, the Oaks led
at halftime and with only ten
minutes remaining in the game
held a five point advantage at
48-43.
Point Streak
But very swiftly the Pa
pooses accelerated. They steam
rolled for 13 consecutive points.
A Don Griffin jumper with
9:04 remaining put Stanford
ahead by one point. The rest of
the game was really anticlimatic
as Menlo got to within 3 points,
but never any closer.
Don Griffin and Mai McElwain
led the Stanford spurt that
sewed up the game. Both were
prominent on the rebounds and
on the scoreboard with short
jump shots from the key.
Menlo's problem during the
streak was continually losing
the ball without even getting a
shot off. The Stanford defense
forced them to take long shots
when they did get the ball down
court. Griffin had 19 points Fri
day to lead Stanford and 16 Sat
urday, second only to McEl
wain's 18. McElwain led Stan
ford in both games in rebounds
with 7 and 12.
