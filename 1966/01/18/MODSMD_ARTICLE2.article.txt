# Stanford Villagers Aid Needy College Student
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
A group of Stanford Village resi
dents who resolved at an end-of-the
quartor party to "do something about
educational opportunities for cultural

ly deprived students" has supported
a Ravenswood High School graduate
through two years of college.
Mr. and Mrs. John Balch, who held
the party, described the support as
both financial and academic. "We
were concerned," said Mr. Balch," not
so much for the brilliant student —
there's plenty of support for him —
but for the sort of student who can
do college work, but won't test well."
Selected From Ravenswood
Such a student was selected from
among the Class of '64 at Ravens
wood High School through consulta
tion with teachers, counselors, parents
and peers. The selectee is currently
completing his second year at the Col
lege of San Mateo.
Members of the group contribute
either monthly "family shares" of $15
or "students' shares" of $5-$ lO. Among
the uses of the money is a special
"incentive fund" in which the student
gets a bonus for evrty grade above
C. "Since boys from his background
are expected to earn money after
graduation," Mrs. Balch explained,
"he holds a job in the microbiology
lab during the school year as well as
a full-time summer job."
Tutor Selectee
Drawing on their own academic re
sources, group members have tutored
the selectee in reading and writing
skills. The Balchs, both doing gradu
ate work in education, have concen
trated on English preparation. Anoth
er member of the group, Mrs. Alice
Cottrell, administered a series of diag
nostic reading tests to determine
which skills needed the most work.
Dr. Bernadine Allen of Stanford's
Counselling and Testing Service also
helped with her specialty, while Guy
Browning, Bill Cottrell, Vic Preiser,
and Greta Weaver contributed their
time and money.
Success in their initial effort has
encouraged the group to adopt a sec
ond student who is just beginning
college. Additional expenses for this
endeavor as well as the loss of a few
contributors who have moved to oth
er universities have led the group to
seek outside financial help. Treasurer
for this effort is Mrs. Balch, of 201-3
Stanford Village.
Thooritical Interest
The novelty of "students paying for
another student" has aroused the
theoretical interest of group members.
Mr. Balch, who is studying the "psy
chology of higher education" under
Professor Nevitt Sanford. feels that
"there must be thousands of other
culturally handicapped students who
are also capable of doing eollege work.
Most of these students will not show
up well on standardized tests. Our
problem is to devise some other means
of finding them."
