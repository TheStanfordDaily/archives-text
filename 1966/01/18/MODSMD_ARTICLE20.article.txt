# ARFEP REVISITED
## Key To Vietnam--China 
### MICHAEL REUSS 
In the past year Vietnam was
a recurrent, daily issue, at least
in some form, in every paper.
This focus promises to remain
in 1966, and perhaps for years
to come.
Yet an effectual dialogue has
long ceased to exist as the sides
have coalesced into the "peace
fanatics," the extremist "patri
ots," and an overwhelming ma
jority of apathetics who, outside
of their concern about how the
war directly affects them, by
their own admission just are not
interested in the intricate and
emotion-laden problems that
surround the Vietnam Question.
Hopeful Break
One hopeful break in this in
creasing stratification of opin
ion was provided early last fall
by the creation of ARFEP-
Americans for Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy. Finally an
attempt was made to put Viet
nam in its context, the Far
East. The announced goals of
ARFEP are to bring pressure
on the administration through
public dialogue to:
"1. Announce its readiness to
negotiate toward recognition of
Communist China.
2. Negotiate toward admitting
China to the United Nations.
3. Declare its readiness to
join China in nuclear weapons
control and in ending restric
tions on trade and communica
tions.
4. Intensify efforts toward a
cease-fire and negotiated settle
ment in Vietnam."
Each one of these proposals
emphasize the non-dogmatic po
sition of ARFEP. The stress is
on the effort to attempt nego
tiations, the opening up of a
dialogue on essential problems,
but the actual concrete terms of
a settlement or the methods to
be used to attain it are left un
stated. This latitude allows
those with a wide variety of dif
ferent views to unite behind the
general demands of ARFEP and
hopefully reintroduce an ele
ment of communication into the
Vietnam debate by expanding it
to encompass the whole question
of our role in the Far East
U. S. And Red China
As is apparent, the major em
phasis of the proposals is on
the relationship between the
United States and Red China.
Again this is putting Vietnam in
its perspective. Our hard-line at
titude in Vietnam, the much
prevalent "dominoes" theory are
both outgrowths of the cold war
in the Far East, where the U. S.
recognizes China as its chief ad
versary.
Yet as D. H. Fleming states
in his "Can We Play God in
Asia?": "There is a manifest
vanity in our assertion of con
trol over the entire Pacific
Ocean and the islands and
fringes of China on the far side
of it." The U. S. must accept

the fact that she cannot act as
the international arbiter of the
validity of foreign countries'
political development. If the
moral argument of consistency
to our own ideal of self-determi
nation does not restrain us from
unwarranted interference, the
argument of national interest
should warn us that if the U. S.
continues to presume to hold
such a position she will alienate
most, if not all, new countries
Vietnam And China
The U. S. attitude in Vietnam
is closely interrelated to the re
evaluation that is called for in
China. A fresh outlook recog
nizing China and her inevitable
role in the Far East would go
far to bringing the realization
that the U. S. cannot eternally
determine the course of events
in the Far East. On a larger

scale it becomes increasingly
ridiculous for the U. S. to lack
official diplomatic connections
with Red China, and as Red
China grows as a nuclear power
the U. N. will become more im
potent as an international body
in regulating nuclear forces or
in other vital matters.
In attempting to open discus
sion on such a broad topic as
the American role in the Far
East, ARFEP has necessarily
undertaken a great deal. Yet in
avoiding a dogmatic specificity,
in accepting a variety of alter
natives for achieving its goals,
ARFEP has created a broad
enough spectrum so that there
should be room for a Vietnam
Day Committee executive and a
firm supporter of CONSCIENCE
and the administration to unite
in demanding a new dialogue.
