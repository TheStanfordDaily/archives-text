# 'THE QUESTIONS'
## A 						Psychological Analysis 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter presented Eugene lonesco's
"The Chairs" and novelist John
Hawkes' first play, "The Ques
tions," the latter a world pre
miere, last Thursday through
Sunday in the Little Theater.
That is about all one can say
for sure about the perform
ances; both plays are difficult
to perform and to understand.
I will not dwell on the lonesco
production. It had been dis
cussed at great length by those
more erudite than I. I would
summarize my feeling about it
by stating that I think it is
amusing, mildly interesting, but
pretentious and overlong. The
translation used by the reper
tory group was singularly undis
tinguished. The direction, by Mel
Shapiro, seemed competent, but
the play would have benefited
greatly from some judicious cut
ting, especially during some of
the tedious business of moving
more and ever more chairs on
the set.
Some generally very fine
work by Jane Hoffman and
Paul E. Richards as the old cou
ple occasionally lagged. This
may have been due to the tedi
um inherent in the play. Both
are skilled pantomimists, and
Richards especially was con
vincingly aged. Stephen D. New
man, as the Orator, has a short
but significant part; he must
appear dignified and confident,
then be speechless, and finally
babble idiotically. This is the
play's climax, lonesco's vision of
man's final statement before
God, or no-God. Newman was
perfect.
If lonesco is difficult theater,

"The Questions" seems nearly
impossible. Through its 75-min
ute duration, one of the two
characters, The Girl (neither
Hawkes nor lonesco is too crazy
about giving names to his char
acters) sits in a chair; The Man
paces the stage around her. The
scenery consists of the chair,
two rail-like constructions which
suggest a trial lawyer's box, and
a table with a water pitcher on
it. There is also a fan overhead
which rotates continuously with
a frenzy-inducing slowness.
No Action, Talk Only
There is no action, only talk,
seldom leavened by highly
pitched emotionalism and even
less often by wit, though there
are some funny lines. What
"happens" is: a 17-year-old girl
(Carol Androsky) is forced to
reconstruct her version of a
three-year period, recently end
ed, during which her mother
brings home a young English
idler and either does or does not
have an affair with him. The
menace a trois is given explicit
approval by her father. The
Man (Glenn Cannon) prods and
questions the Girl until he
forces her to reveal that her
view of this triangle was a ro
mantic and unrealistic oversim
plification, in which her mother
was temporarily wooed by the
dark stranger, then gallantly
won back by her father. The
Man presses her to admit that
her mother was blithely cas
trating her father, that her fa
ther participated in the sordid
ness, and that none of them is
as innocent as she wants to be
lieve. But even after her admis
sion of the details of the affair
seem to support this conclusion,

she says, "My story is just as
good as yours." Her innocence,
if that is what it is, remains un
shaken.
The question about "The Ques
tions" is, who are the two char
acters? The Man is a lawyer, a
psychiatrist, her father and an
extension of her own mind, pos
sibly all at the same time. He
tries to destroy her image of her
father as a noble Southern gen
tleman. Maybe, then, he is the
father, attempting to atone for
his guilt by self-abasement. But
she identifies so thoroughly
with her father (though not
with the character on stage)
that by being the father, he be
comes her. Is the play occurring
in objective reality (a medium
Hawkes thinks very little of) ?
Or is it in her mind? Or some
one else's?
Inadequate Synopsis
This inadequate synopsis
should serve, if nothing else, to
underscore the ambiguity with
which the play abounds. The
acting preserves the ambiguity
without being vacillating or un
sure. Miss Androsky did not
have a bad moment Thursday
night; the only objection which
might be raised is that she looks
a good deal older than 17. Can
non was likewise excellent. He
began by displaying more an
tagonism, more spleen than the
play called for in its early
stages, but warmed to the task
quickly. I found his Southern
accent mannered, but then, I
find most Southern accents
mannered on stage. The two
spent an incredible length of
time before the audience, with
no action or other players to re
lieve them, and they carried it

off without a hitch. The audi
ence was involved throughout.
Involved, that is, in intellec
tual terms. There are emotional
peaks, but these are not as com
pelling as the ideas behind
them. The play offers a pro
found psychological experience;
it is thoughtful and complex,
and its development is steady.
Still, what is the theater for?
What is its function as a medi
um? If that function is partly
to entertain, in a "pure" sense,
appealing primarily to the emo
tions, then "The Questions" is
lacking that element. If revela
tion of intellectual and psycho
logical truth is all that is re
quired, then Hawkes' first play
is a handsome and impressive
work.
One cannot be sure.
