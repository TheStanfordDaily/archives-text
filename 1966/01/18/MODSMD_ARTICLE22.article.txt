## Rebutting The Slum Queen Of Hoskins' Eighth Floor 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As I look out my back window
I can just about make out the
slum queen on the eighth floor
of Hoskins. She obviously has
never lived in a slum and it
doesn't sound like she's ever
seen one.
The "low rise barracks which
spread out below" are without
a doubt among the very finest
provided by any university in
the country to married students.
These "barracks" are surround
ed by vast green lawns and at
tractive landscaping. There is a
central play area located in each
court that provides the kids with
ample play area. The "kids"
playing in the street are prob
ably Hoskins dwellers.
There are some people that
wouldn't be satisfied in any sur
roundings, but I doubt that such
a person could claim any type
of humble origins. The slum
queen on the eighth floor of Hos
kins just might like to inspect
a few real slum tenements and
make an objective comparison to
the housing provided by Stan
ford. She might be surprised to
find that there is a real world.

• Self-adulation
Editor, The Daily:
Once again Mike Couzens has
ably demonstrated his complete
inability to understand the prob
lems now facing student gov
ernment at Stanford. In Mr.
Couzens' most recent journalis

tic excursion into fuzzy think
ing, recorded in Friday's Daily,
he accused his fellow legislators
of "communal adulation," i.e.,
Mike feels they have an inflated
sense of self-importance. While
this is certainly a common fail
ing among student politicians
everywhere, it is ironic that it
is Mr. Couzens who is complain
ing. Is Messianic self-adulation
really that much more desira
ble? or helpful?
Mr. Couzens deplores the atti
tude—"communal adulation" —
that has "led to constant mis
trust of committees — even
standing ones with experienced
members." Translation: only
those legislators with enormous
gall and/or exceedingly poor
judgement would dare question
the report of one of Mike's com
mittees.
Mr. Couzens, a loser in his
quest last year for the legisla
ture's speakership, hurled still
more invective at the winner,
Jay Kadane. Claiming that Ka
dane's recent State of the Legis
lature speech was symptomatic
of the legislature's sense of self
importance, he openly decreed
"It is not the place of the Speak
er to publicly examine the mo
tives of the men with whom he
must deal." Who else should do
it? Apparently no one.
In his address Kadane pointed
out what has been obvious for
some time—the influence of the
student government on univer
sity policy-making is minimal.
Consider the recent administra

tion takeover of Union residence,
where, as Mr. Kartane pointed
out, none of the students con
cerned was given a chance to
examine the "pressing needs"
which the administration hastily
dusted off for student consump
tion, despite the legislature's
open demand for satisfaction of
the students' right of legitimate
inquiry. Mr. Couzens' statement
that "legislators who make
themselves knowledgeable can
earn . . . decision making influ
ence from the university" is lu
dicrous if critically examined. If
it is ever to become true, for
example, in regard to the pres
ent difficulties with the Wilbur
faculty master system, it will
only be because able and ener
getic student leaders such as
Mr. Kadane bring the truth
about the present state of af
fairs into the open, and in doing
so alert many well-meaning but
previously unaware university
officials. Until the administra
tion reacts to these attempts
constructively, events will con
tinue to prove that officials be
come more "reasonable" only
as the threat of student disorder
increases.
Any serious attempt by Mr.
Couzens to perpetuate the myth
of an effective "rapport built
with greatest care" between stu
dent interests and the adminis
tration, which might have been
injured by Mr. Kadane's speech,
must be considered as (1) the
product of colossal ignorance on
the part of Mr. Couzens or (2) a
tale told with sound and fury to
cover up Mr. Couzens' own fail
ures as a representative of stu
dent interests.

• Civ Line
Editor, The Daily:
For freshmen and the upper
classmen who are enrolled in
Western Civ this quarter it
looks like most of their time is
going to be spent in the Civ li
brary waiting in line. No less
than sixteen of the assignments
require reading from the mimeo
graphed book called Syllabus
Sources. For approximately 1200
students to try getting fifty of
these books creates problems of
wasted time and needless trou
ble for both students and library
assistants. If an industrious
group of graduate students can
compile an outline for end of the
quarter cramming, it is our feel
ing that the history department
should make enough copies of
Syllabus Sources available so
that students could purchase
them for a nominal fee.
