# D.A. Gets 2 Weeks For Grad's Case

Arraignment of Stanford graduate
student, Raymond Tierman, who faces
charges of conspiracy for his partici
pation in an anti-Vietnam leaflet drop
on Oakland Friday, has been post
poned until January 31, Tierman said
yesterday.
The postponement was granted by
the Oakland Municipal Court to give
the district attorney more time to de
termine the exact charges, according
to Tierman.
He said yesterday that the conspira
cy charge, a felony that could mean a
sentence of three years and a $5000
fine, is "an obvious case of using the
police department as a political weap
on."
"If we had been dropping leaflets
in support of the war or for a foot
ball game, they certainly would not
have charged us with conspiracy," he
stated.
Tierman and three other men were
arrested Friday night at the San Car
los Airport. He was released Saturday
on $1100 bail.
Dick Mullins, a graduate student in
psychology, who described himself as
a "friend of Tierman," said yesterday
he had initiated a "defense and bail
fund" for Tierman.
