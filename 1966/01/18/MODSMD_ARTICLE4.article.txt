# BERLIN U.
## SU Students Walk By The Wall 
### 
"I want to walk in the city of the
'wall,' to acquire a foreigner's per
spective of Americanism, and to par
ticipate in an educational system em
phasizing 'academic freedom.'"
These were the words of senior
Diane Hatch when she filled out her
application form for a scholarship to
attend the Free University of Berlin

two years ago. (The word "Free" is
used politically in this context, not
monetarily.)
The possibilities of going to the
Free University and of receiving a
scholarship to do so will be discussed
this afternoon in Tresidder.
"I think far too many students have
hesitated to attend foreign universi
ties rather than foreign campuses for
reasons which are sometimes quite
questionable," she declared. "Concern
about the draft would certainly seem
to be a legitimate reason, but reasons
based upon 'academic expediency' are
of only limited validity."
No Tests, Assignments
Some of the attractions for the
American student who attends the
Free University of Berlin were sug
gested by Diane: an unstructured aca
demic environment—no reading lists,
assignments, mid-terms, term-papers,
or final examinations—where one can

become involved in honest intellectual
persuits.
Culture-Bound
"To study those areas of your con
cern with a new repetoire of foreign
approaches can be, and was for me,
a very valuable experience," she ex
plained. Just think how many text
books, paperbacks, and magazine ar
ticles that we read are written by
Americans, or more exactly, by Amer
ican University professors, and how
few are written by foreign, particu
larly non-English-speaking, authori
ties.
"Attending the Free University in
Berlin forced me to realize how cul
ture-bound many of my previous stud
ies had been. We at Stanford have a
way of talking, of moving about the
Quad, of grooming ourselves, not to
mention a feeling about time and its
proper use; I would suggest the Free
University in Berlin as a means to
achieving a new and perhaps greater
perspective."
