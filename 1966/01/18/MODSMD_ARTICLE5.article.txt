# Fellowships To Be Given For Brazilian Exchange
## 
### 
Stanford -in - Latin America? Not
quite, but Stanford's exchange pro
gram with the University of Gauna
bara in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is en
tering its third year.

An informational meeting will be
held tonight at 9:30 in Fremont
Lounge of Stern Hall. The State De
partment of Education and Cultural
Affairs finances the one month sum
mer stay for Stanford graduates or
undergraduates.
According to Maury Sterns, ex
change coordinator, interest in Bra
zil's culture is the only crucial re
quirement for applicants. "Portuguese
is not an absolute prerequisite,
though attitude is an essential con
sideration."
Profound Effect
Sterns explained that the program
has had a profound effect on previous
participants. A number of undergrad
uates have returned to Stanford to
continue Brazilian studies, while oth
ers have gone back to the country it
self. Last year's fellowship winners
were especially impressed by the fol
lowing:
• The immenseness of the country
—they discovered that culture varied
significantly within the many districts
as they traversed the land.
• Interviews with distinguished
Brazilians like Gilberto Freye, noted
sociologist, and novelist Jorge Amado.
• Political questions posed by the
Brazilians. Stanford students were
frequently asked to discuss the dif
ferences between a Communist and
a nationalist revolution.
Lecture Series
The Stanford-Guanabara Exchange
Program is also sponsoring bi weekly
lectures on Brazil. Guest speakers
will include Dr. Robert Pakenhan of
the Political Science Department and
Dr. John Wirth of the History De
partment.
"We are doing all that w e can to
make Stanford fully aware of our
activities," Stems stated. Four com
mittees are responsible for the Wed
nesday night lecture series, campus
relations, recruitment, and" receiving
the six Brazilian students who will
visit Stanford. Students interested in
serving in one of the groups may call
the new exchange office located in the
Old Union. Further information about
the exchange program is also availa
ble at the I-Center and the 1.1. R.
