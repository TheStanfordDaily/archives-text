That Minstrel Show has been re
ceived by critics with great praise
and some embarrassment. George
Dusheck of the San Franeisoo Exami
ner wrote on Jan. 6, "It is funny, pen
etrating and disturbing. It spares
nono of the stock features, whife or
black ... It is often savagely brutal
in making its points. And ... a warn
ing for the squeamish ... it is scata
logical, bawdy and irreverant."
