Asia Week, the first of the lIR se

areas, continues today with a massive
kite-flying rally in White Memorial

Plaza. Prizes of $50, $25, and $10 will
be awarded on the basis of originality
in design and skill in handling. All
participants must have their kites

aloft by noon. Kites will be on sale
on the Plaza before the rally.
Asia Week chairman Andrew Wil
son said, "Our plan is to present a
radically different student approach
to Asian affairs. We hope to extend
the focus on Asian events from the
exclusive viewpoint of campus poli
tics."
With the purpose of stimulating in
terest and entertainment, Asia Week
includes a variety of events.
Student Service Programs
Ex-Dean Dwight Clark, director of
Project Concern—a medical and reli
gious organization in Vietnam and
Hong Kong—will trace the involve
ment of student service programs and
their current activities in a speech to
day at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder Union's
Large Lounge. Also Director of Vol
unteers in Asia for the World Uni
versity Service Hong Kong project,
Clark was elected Stanford's "Red Hot
Prof" earlier this year.
Thursday's plans include a Japanese
film at 8 p.m. in the Large Lounge at
Tresidder. During the week an exhibit
of Japanese paintings and sculpture
will be on display at Tresidder.
An exotic dragon parade will wind
its way to the final activity of Asia
Week, an all - campus Chinese New
Year's Dance at 8 p.m. in Lagunita
Hall. Pending approval from adminis
tration and local authorities, Asia
Week chairman Wilson plans a fire
works display to accompany the pa
rade. Bob Kelly's band will provide
the music and Asian dancers and mu
sicians will perform during intermis
sions.
Exclude Campus Politics
Curt Keck, vice president of the In
stitute of International Relations,
conceived and is in charge of the 6-
week series of geographical projects.
Hoping to exclude only "rarefied
campus politics" from the various
area projects, Keck commented that
the emphasis will be on the "policies
and charatcers of the countries. All
angles of cultural and sociological
background will be covered."
Following Asia Week will be lIR
weeks focusing on Latin America, the
Soviet Union, Europe, Africa and the
Middle East.
