Code Book of Life
Computer people have o saying, "garbage in, garbage out", for nonsense
equations fed into electronic brains bring nonsense out. The mind is like a
computer, we humans "feed", through our sensory inputs the eyes and ears,
on good and evil. The man who reads pornography without a filter circuit
in his mind will soon find his moral standards crumbling and his behavior
uncontrolled. Fine music, literature and art do uplift the soul—the computer
must be programmed and the input data monitored if life, not death, is to be
the result.
The Holy Bible, God's Word to man, might well be called the code book
of life, the master plan, the flawless program, the hidden key. To those who
have responded to its constant invitation into life, it is a mirror which shows
them who we are. Here for anyone who wills to see, are hidden secrets many
men would die to know." . . . among the mature we do impart wisdom, although
it is not a wisdom of this age, or of this age or the rulers of this age, who
are doomed to pass away. But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God
... as it is written, 'What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of
man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him' God has
revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the
depths of God ... we have the mind of Christ" (I Corinthinans 2).
To those who never read the Bible, relying on the advice of "experts", the
Word reminds us, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which
proceeds out of the mouth of God". Jesus Christ said, "It is the Spirit that
gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are
Spirit and Life. But there are some of you who do not believe" (John 6:63, 64).
In an age when men dispute the authority of the Word of God, you ought to
make up your own mind by reading this Best Seller of all time, a Book which
claims for itself Divine inspiration throughout (2 Timothy .3:1 3—17). Addressed
to you, an individual beloved by God, it says, "Faith comes by hearing and
hearing by the Word of God" (Romans 10:17) and "These things are written
that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing
you may have life in his name" (John 20:31).
The self-consistent Holy Bible speaks for itself, and its words are backed in
life and experience by an all-wise God whose greatest concern s your mortal
soul and your eternal destiny. The God who wrote it cared enough to die for
you, why not find out who He is and what He has to say?
