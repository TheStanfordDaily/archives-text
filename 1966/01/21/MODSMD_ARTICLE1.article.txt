# The
						Whys And Wherefores Of Sponsoring
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Editor 
What are the duties and responsibilities of
a Wilbur sponsor? After three months on
the job, here are two assessments:
'The ideal sponsor is one who is not no
ticed; he is an organizer, rather he is just a
member of the house who happens to be an
upperclassman."
"The sponsor has to make up for the lack of
University atmosphere at Wilbur caused by
the absence of upperclassmen. His duties in
clude cajoling, sympathizing, ministering, en
couraging and sometimes just plain kicking
some guys in the rear."
Diversity Amongst Sponsors
These responses reflect the diversity of
viewpoints typical of the 25 upperclass spon
sors at Wilbur. Yet there are some points of
agreement, at least among the five sponsors
this reporter interviewed.
Administrative chores take up little of the
sponsor's time —and less of his interest. "Dur
ing the first month, you do a lot of adminis-

trative work," Tom Hecht, a senior Political
Science major in Junipero explained, "but af
ter the house elects its officers, you let them
handle the social, cultural, athletic and judi
cial organizations."
A1 Taylor, the senior History major who is
head sponsor, agreed. He pointed out that the
new Wilbur Constitution guarantees greater
freshmen control of their own living groups,
especially in the field of judicial processes.
"The assertion that there is a trend toward
sponsor control is categorically wrong," he
added.
Freshmen Self-Discipline
The trend away from sponsor control is
evident in the area of discipline. Most spon
sors—like Hecht and Steve Hurlburt, a fifth
year Physics major who lives in Otero —main-
tain that there is almost no occasion when
sponsor disciplinary action is needed. "Most
judicial cases are handled by individuals,"
Hurlburt stated. He went on to explain how
the freshmen on his floor corrected one of
their comrade's tendency to disrupt open

house proceedings: the offender was discov
ered on one occasion to have a date of his
own in his room during open house—his floor
mates proceeded to lock him in by means of
a well-placed broom handle. "That solved that
problem," Hurlburt concluded.
"Discipline is more effective if it comes
from one's peers (not from an authority fig
ure)," Hecht added. The three sponsors in the
house usually set up broad lines on discipline
and then let the judicial council in the house
handle it from there."
What the "peer group" cannot supply, how
ever, is the sponsor's knowledge—of Stanford
and of less tangible matters. This, according
to Dave Harris of Rinconda, the sponsor
spends most of his time dispensing informa
tion, "talking to those who are facing the
problem of adjustment," and "discussing with
the freshmen what I am doing and why." This
last is essential, since "relating your experi
ences can help the freshmen place their own
experiences in perspective."

To Hecht, the sponsor's primary function Is
to be a "catalyst" in the freshmen's endeavors
to become educated and integrated into cam
pus life. "The sponsor must be available to
discuss anything. He will probably lead a
non-academic credit seminar, or conduct civ
reviews, or hold a bull session after a house
sponsored lecture . . . Since the frosh have
relatively similar backgrounds and values, it
is best to continually challenge them. For if
they go unchallenged, the high school values
are re-enforced."
Yet sponsors find that the "challenge" works
both ways. According to John Cahill, a fifth
year student in Structural Engineering living
in Madera, the sponsor has his values chal
lenged also- by the freshmen as well as his
fellow sponsors.
One of the more formal mechanisms of in
tellectual exchange used by the sponsors is
the non-credit seminar. Cahill joined 15 frosh
from Madera and Roble in reading 5 books
on existentialism over Christmas vacation.

Now the group meets regularly to discuss the
books and their effect on the student's values.
Hurlburt conducts a similar co-ed seminar for
12 freshmen.
Five Hours Per Day
All these activities require an average of 5
hours per day per sponsor. "You can't con
centrate on your studies," Hurlburt said. "Or
plan ahead," Hecht added.
Why then do more than 100 upperclassmen
apply every year for a job which, according
to Hecht, "turns out to be very difficult, often
frustrating- and almost completely devoid of
privacy."
Many apply in a burst of altruistic concern
for the frosh; others apply for the honor that
has long been associated with being selected
as a Wilbur sponsor. Yet, Taylor concluded,
"after a while you realize that although your
relationship with a freshman may be helpful
to him, it's not really what motivates you to
seek that relationship. You come not as a
teacher, but as a friend."
