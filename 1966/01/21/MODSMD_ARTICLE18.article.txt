# To Steal Or Not
## 
### HENRY BRIGGS 
In the old days, when the Stan
ford campus still had a rural
flavor, students were incurably
honest. The Honor Code then
included most of the conditions
that are now listed under the
Fundamental Standard.
Stealing was one of them.
Chief Davis of the Stanford
Police Department tells of a
twenty dollar bill that was found
one day in the Library. The find
er gave his prize to the head of
the Library, who placed it on top
of the Information Desk. It
stayed there for two weeks be
fore it was claimed.
Steal Books
Another story tells of a stu
dent who left for summer vaca
tion in such excitement and for
got some books that he had
perched on a window ledge out
side of Engineering Corner.
When he returned in September
the books were still there.

Chief Davis and most of the
powers that be in the world of
Crime on Campus still do con
sider the student body to be a
generally honest group.
But although most serious
stealing is affected by outsiders,
students do engage in petty pil
fering.
Chief Davis points to pre-
W.W. II days, when stealing was
included in the Honor Code, as
one reason for the exceptional
honesty of the era. Mr. Chester
Berry of Tresidder Union also
points to the "break down of
the Fundamental Standard" as
a contributive reason for losses
in the Union.
An employee of the Bookstore
who has caught more than one
person stealing says of one such
experience, "I was more nervous
than the kid. How would you
feel if you had to stop some
one?"
