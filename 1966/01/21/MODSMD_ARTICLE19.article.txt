Commenting on a recent arti
cle in The Wall Street Journal
entitled "Diverse Campuses:
More Colleges Seek Students
with Unusual Backgrounds, Tal
ents," Dr. Sterling Huntley
maintained that this trend re
flects what is happening in East
tern schools who are often sev
eral years behind Stanford in
their admissions policies.
"We have been doing this for
quite some time. We have been
able to give leadership in this
area because we're freer from
traditional restritcions," Hunt
ley stated.
The Associate Director of Ad
missions also pointed out that
diversity has always been a part
of the university's goals:
"Stanford sees its role as a
university to promote as much
as possible leadership i"n all
segments of society. Also I hope
that leaders in business educa
tion and art as well as in the
Spanish-American communities
would be Stanford graduates."
However Huntley draws the
distinction between leadership
in a particular professional
field and leadership in minority
community such as Negro or
Spanish-American. One requires
specific training while the other
entails a general inducement of
individual motivation. Often one
person becomes a leader in both
fields.
In order to seek out repre
sentatives from "all segments of
society," Stanford always has
emphasized recruitment in low
er socio economic areas.
"We have always recruited in
lower class areas but more re
cently the results have stepped

up. The efforts that we have
been making for a long time
are paying off," Huntley ob
observed.
He cites the recent develop
ment of college referral organi
zations and the increased avail
ability of scholarships as rea
sons behind the rising number of
applications from the low in
come strata.
New plans such as the Na
tional Achievement Scholarship
Program greatly aid in spur
ring motivation to attend col
lege. An outgrowth of the Na
tional Merit program, this proj
ect directs its concern to assist
ing in lower economic areas.
Director of Admissions, Rix
ford K. Snyder pointed out the

tremendous increase in scholar
ship funds. In his fifteen years
in the admissions office, the per
centage of students on financial
aid has risen from 3% to 40%.

as possible leadership i"n all
segments of society. Also I hope
that leaders in business educa
tion and art as well as in the
Spanish-American communities
would be Stanford graduates."
However Huntley draws the
distinction between leadership
in a particular professional
field and leadership in minority
community such as Negro or
Spanish-American. One requires
specific training while the other
entails a general inducement of
individual motivation. Often one
person becomes a leader in both
fields.
In order to seek out repre
sentatives from "all segments of
society," Stanford always has
emphasized recruitment in low
er socio economic areas.
"We have always recruited in
lower class areas but more re
cently the results have stepped

up. The efforts that we have
been making for a long time
are paying off," Huntley ob
observed.
He cites the recent develop
ment of college referral organi
zations and the increased avail
ability of scholarships as rea
sons behind the rising number of
applications from the low in
come strata.
New plans such as the Na
tional Achievement Scholarship
Program greatly aid in spur
ring motivation to attend col
lege. An outgrowth of the Na
tional Merit program, this proj
ect directs its concern to assist
ing in lower economic areas.
Director of Admissions, Rix
ford K. Snyder pointed out the

tremendous increase in scholar
ship funds. In his fifteen years
in the admissions office, the per
centage of students on financial
aid has risen from 3% to 40%.
