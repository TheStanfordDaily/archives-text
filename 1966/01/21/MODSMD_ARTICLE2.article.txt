# Brown Joins Clergymen's War Protest
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
Sanford professor of religion Rob
ert McAfee Brown is one of a recently
founded group of clergymen opposed
to escalation of the "morally intolera
ble" Vietnam war.
The 41 members of the National
Emergency Committee of Clergy Con
cerned about Vietnam were organized
a few weeks ago from 150 local com
mittees in 43 states.
Dr. Brown minimizes his participa
tion in the group thus far, but express
es agreement with its aims and hopes
for its success. "This is a very re
sponsible group," he said yesterday;
"it won't just be written off as a
bunch of beats."
Reduoe Defense Budget
He stated that the Committee's
goals are to achieve a cessation of
bombing in North Vietnam, to fur
ther peace negotiations, to resist es
calation of the war, and to divert some
of this year's defense budget to eco
nomic projects at home and abroad.
The Committee wants to mobilize
community opinion to keep the Pres
ident aware of "a growing consensus
across the country against the war
and in support of his peace offen
sive."
The acting executive secretary of
the group is the Rev. William Sloane
Coffin, chaplain of Yale University,
who will be on campus next week as
a Wilbur Guest-in-Residence. He will
preach in Memorial Church on Sun
day, January 30.
Prominent Committeemen
Other prominent members of the
Committee are Richard Cardinal Cush
ing of Boston; the Rev. Martin Luther
King; the Rev. Dr. Eugene Carson
Blake, stated clerk of the United
Presbyterian Church; and Rabbi Ja
cob Weinstein, president of the Cen
tral Conference of American Rabbis.
"Our hope will be to do more things
around the Bay Area," said Dr. Brown.
The efforts of "concerned" clergy are
being coordinated locally by the Santa
Clara County Council of Churches.
The Committee hopes eventually to
establish branches throughout the
country, aiming "to try to mobilize
the clergy, operating across state
lines."
'Apalling' War
Committee members have sent two
telegrams outlining their position to
President Johnson. The first, sent on
January 12, began, "We are appalled
by the war in Vietnam and the exten
sion of hostilities," and went on to
describe the Committee's goals.
The second telegram was sent after
Johnson's State of the Union address.
"We will support you," it said,
"against all critics who call for great
er beligerence."
