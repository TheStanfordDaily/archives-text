### 
RALEIGH, N.C. (CPS) — "I
may have bitten off more than
I can chew," Bob Holmes, the
editor of the North Carolina
State Technician, says several
days and several demonstrations
after he wrote an editorial con
demning the song "Dixie."
"I never expected it to esca
late to the scale it has," he said.
"We were just trying to provoke
some discussion among the stu
dents here, but its gotten out
of hand."
'All Those Things'
The editorial had no argu
ment with the song, only to the
reaction to the music. The edi
torial added "it appears that all
a group has to do is strike up
a few notes of that tune and...
people automatically shout fran
tically, and stand up and sing.
'Dixie' represents all of those
things the South should be at

tempting to lay aside. 'Dixie*
gives unreconstructed Southern
ers something of the past to
cheer and there certainly is little
in the past of the South about
which anyone should wish to
cheer...."
The morning after the edi
torial appeared, a big banner
reading "Dixie Forever" ap
peared on a smokestack on the
campus. Students rose at break
fast In the cafeteria to sing
"Dixie."
That night some 600 students
gathered between two dormi
tories and began singing the
song. Half of them moved on
to the newspaper office after a
student counselor confiscated a
bull horn and told the demon
strators to move on.
'Dixie'
The crowd grew and then
marched to the state capital,
only blocks away, singing "Dix
ie" all the while. Marches on
the capital are a traditional
form of protest on the Raleigh
campus.
