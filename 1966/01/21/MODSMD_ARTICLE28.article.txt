# 'Ballou,' 'Bedford' Humbug
## 
### CURT KECK 
"Cat Ballou" and"The Bed
ford Incident," are featured as
a doubleheader a n d together
ihey are just barely worth the
money to see.
"Cat Ballou" owes its failure
as a great comedy to the incon
sistency of tone that is scattered
throughout the film. The screen
play was originally conceived as
a serious western hut as the
filming progressed the farce of
the plot became evident. The di
rector swapped canoes in the
middle of the stream, which was
wise considering the saga of the
serious western is faltering at
the box office. Had the director
been more judicious in cutting
the uncomic scenes, of which
there are many, the movie could
have been moulded into a spoof
that really spoofs.
Redeeming Grace
Lee Marvin, in his role as Kit
Sheleen, the drunkenest gun
slinger west of Pecos, is the mo
vie's redeeming grace. The film's
more humorous moments focus
around Marvin and are the re
sult of his good acting. When
Marvin is off the screen, the
gags and slapstick do not come
across as anything funnier than
the beach-bongo jamborees that

have recently deluged the movie
goer.
The audience's captivation of
Kit Sheleen's every move is ap
parent in the long pantomime
during which Sheleen gets ready
for the showdown with terror
of the terrorers, Tim Strawn.
Only excellent acting in creat
ing a stage presence could have
kept these scenes alive.
Catty Jane
The other major role, notably
Cat Ballou played by Jane Fon
da, is credible enough but lack
ing in consistent humor. Jane
Fonda would have been far
more entertaining had she been
cast as a compote of Annie Oak
ley and Calamity Jane rather
than the delectible little sage
flower that she is. Cat Ballou's
boyfriend Michael Callan, was a
little too much of the bumbling
and cowardly rustle r turned
train robber to come across as
funny.
The music is entertaining, es
pecially when Nat King Cole
and Stubby K a ye sing and
strum "The Ballad of Cat Bal
lou." However, their interrup
tions in the plot are scheduled
too frequently and a slight te
dium develops toward the last
of their sing fest.

What "Cat Ballou" lacks in
the uproarious side-splitters for
which it has be en acclaimed,
"The Bedford Incident" seems
to sequel in a deficiency of dra
ma.
The plot is simple and, in the
last few minutes, frighteningly
realistic. A Russian submarine
violates the three mile limit off
Greenland. The destroyer Bed
ford spots the sub and the chase
is on.
Action
All the action revolves around
one man, the Captain, and is a
study of his emotions. Richard
YVidmark is superbly cast and
is extremely forceful as the un
compromising Captain. Sidney
Poitier, as the journalist cover
ing the activities of the destroy
er, and Martin Balsam, as the
new medical officer aboard the
ship, also turn in excellent per
formances.
The movie is good in every
respect, including the plot, but
it does not rival the suspense
of "Dr. Strangelove," in which
military blunders in the Cold
War threaten to turn the earth
into an ash.
An unavoidable tension devel
ops in the first scenes and hangs
over the audience like a mush
room cloud throughout the rest
of the movie. In several places
the action drags, but the little
sequences in which you see only
the starkness of the sea and the
ship serve an important func
tion in creating an atmosphere
an atmosphere of constant

alert in which the Captain keeps
the 'crew's m oral e savagely
honed.
Concent ration
It is difficult to screw up your
eyes and concentrate in an icy
sweat, though, if the submarine
is Russian instead of German
and the scene is the Cold War
rather thai: World War II. When
watching a war film, it is easy
to become blood thirsty and if
the setting is in the supposedly
calm p 1 a y g r o u n d of NATO,
much excitement is lost. But, as
Widmurk puts it, "Everyone
loves the hunt."
