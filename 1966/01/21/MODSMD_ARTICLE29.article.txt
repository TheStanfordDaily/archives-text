# Lumet's Superb Direction Surmounts Flaws In 'Hill'
## 
### PATRICK THOMAS 
Sidney Lumet, who directed
"The Pawnbroker", has given the
world another example of his
genius in "The Hill." The film is
a masterful presentation on a
screenplay by Ray Rigby, mar
red only by a few apparent in
consistencies in the story itself.
The scene is a British military
prison, where British soldiers
have been sent on charges rang
ing from stealing three bottles
of scotch to alleged cowardice in
action. In the center of the
prison yard stands a huge, man
made hill of sand, and all that
occurs in the movie somehow
leads back to this hill.
Each character finds a differ
ent meaning in the hill. Sergeant
Major Wilson (Harry An
drews), who tries to break down
the prisoners by making them
run up and down the hill under
a blazing sun, sees in it an im
passive, unfeeling monument to
his rank and authority. For
staff officer Williams (lan Hen
dry), who carries out the Ser
geant Major's orders, the hill
means power over the prisoners,
a chance to compensate for
doubts about his own masculin
ity by sadistically punishing
men who are stronger than him
self.
Golgotha
For one prisoner the hill be
comes Golgotha, as after being
forced to climb it for hours on
end he dies from exhaustion.
Here the plot swings into mo
tion and characters begin to un
wind before our fascinated and
sometimes horrified eyes. The
officers are determined to con
ceal their treatment of the dead
prisoner, and prisoner Roberts
(Sean Connery) is determined to
expose their cruelty.
Yet there are no good or bad
people on either side. The pris
oners have their inadequacies
and inner contradictions. Even
the sadism of officer Williams,
though unforgivable, is under
standable. The story is one of
frustration. The unjust military
penal system is like the hill:
huge and unfeeling.
On this level the storv is a so
cial commentary on the sense

less values of the system. But
beneath is the question of sur
vival, and the usually brilliant
characterizations which slowly
develop show us what men can
and must do in order to save
themselves from death, disgrace,
and weakness.
Flaw in Roberts
If the movie has a serious
flaw it is in the characterization
of Roberts. He comes into the
prison concerned only with in
dividual suivival, but his dis
gust turns from individual offi
cers toward the entire British
military system. This sudden
emergence of abstract thought
may be plausible, but not prob
able in a man such as Roberts.
We are not prepared for this
change in the film, and there is
no attempt made to explain or
justify it.
Similarly, officer Williams' fi
nal attack on Roberts seems un
likely coming at the time it does,
and what could have been a con
clusion seems more like a con
trived ending.
Such flaws are important, but
not disastrous, for the directing
of Lumet is consistently impres
sive. There is no musical back
ground, but rather a constant
sound of prisoners marching, of
ficers screaming, and trapped
flies buzzing around, either try
ing to escape the prison walls or
feeding on what they can find
within. Camera s hots rapidly
shift from an officer's calm view
of the hill to the frenzied, dizzy
ing view of a climbing prisoner
Drunkenness
An officer collapses from
drunkenness, and just as we are
about to laugh at his clumsi
ness, we remember the prisoner
who, two minutes earlier, had
collapsed from exhaustion. Al
though the story is packed with
violence, almost none appears on
the screen. We see, however,
what is significant about the
violence: the scarred mind and
body of a man who has just
been beaten or run to exhaus
tion, and the reactions of fellow
prisoners to him.
Lumet could probably make a
mediocre story worth seeing,
and this story rises far above
mediocrity.

mediocrity.
Sidney Lumet, who directed
"The Pawnbroker", has given the
world another example of his
genius in "The Hill." The film is
a masterful presentation on a
screenplay by Ray Rigby, mar
red only by a few apparent in
consistencies in the story itself.
The scene is a British military
prison, where British soldiers
have been sent on charges rang
ing from stealing three bottles
of scotch to alleged cowardice in
action. In the center of the
prison yard stands a huge, man
made hill of sand, and all that
occurs in the movie somehow
leads back to this hill.
Each character finds a differ
ent meaning in the hill. Sergeant
Major Wilson (Harry An
drews), who tries to break down
the prisoners by making them
run up and down the hill under
a blazing sun, sees in it an im
passive, unfeeling monument to
his rank and authority. For
staff officer Williams (lan Hen
dry), who carries out the Ser
geant Major's orders, the hill
means power over the prisoners,
a chance to compensate for
doubts about his own masculin
ity by sadistically punishing
men who are stronger than him
self.
Golgotha
For one prisoner the hill be
comes Golgotha, as after being
forced to climb it for hours on
end he dies from exhaustion.
Here the plot swings into mo
tion and characters begin to un
wind before our fascinated and
sometimes horrified eyes. The
officers are determined to con
ceal their treatment of the dead
prisoner, and prisoner Roberts
(Sean Connery) is determined to
expose their cruelty.
Yet there are no good or bad
people on either side. The pris
oners have their inadequacies
and inner contradictions. Even
the sadism of officer Williams,
though unforgivable, is under
standable. The story is one of
frustration. The unjust military
penal system is like the hill:
huge and unfeeling.
On this level the storv is a so
cial commentary on the sense

less values of the system. But
beneath is the question of sur
vival, and the usually brilliant
characterizations which slowly
develop show us what men can
and must do in order to save
themselves from death, disgrace,
and weakness.
Flaw in Roberts
If the movie has a serious
flaw it is in the characterization
of Roberts. He comes into the
prison concerned only with in
dividual suivival, but his dis
gust turns from individual offi
cers toward the entire British
military system. This sudden
emergence of abstract thought
may be plausible, but not prob
able in a man such as Roberts.
We are not prepared for this
change in the film, and there is
no attempt made to explain or
justify it.
Similarly, officer Williams' fi
nal attack on Roberts seems un
likely coming at the time it does,
and what could have been a con
clusion seems more like a con
trived ending.
Such flaws are important, but
not disastrous, for the directing
of Lumet is consistently impres
sive. There is no musical back
ground, but rather a constant
sound of prisoners marching, of
ficers screaming, and trapped
flies buzzing around, either try
ing to escape the prison walls or
feeding on what they can find
within. Camera s hots rapidly
shift from an officer's calm view
of the hill to the frenzied, dizzy
ing view of a climbing prisoner
Drunkenness
An officer collapses from
drunkenness, and just as we are
about to laugh at his clumsi
ness, we remember the prisoner
who, two minutes earlier, had
collapsed from exhaustion. Al
though the story is packed with
violence, almost none appears on
the screen. We see, however,
what is significant about the
violence: the scarred mind and
body of a man who has just
been beaten or run to exhaus
tion, and the reactions of fellow
prisoners to him.
Lumet could probably make a
mediocre story worth seeing,
and this story rises far above
mediocrity.
