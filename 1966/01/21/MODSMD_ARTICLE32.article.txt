## Alas, Even At Stanford U., 'The Best Lack Conviction' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
America today is in great dan
ger. Its government is bureau
cratic, its industries are bureau
cratic, its educational systems
are bureaucratic, and even its
people and their values are be
coming governed by bureaucra
cy.
Stanford is a community of
many theories and few convic
tions. Its spirit is directed by the
question: "How will other peo
ple react?" Its actions are deter
mined by the business of getting
a degree. Its judgments are
based on whether or not words
sound intellectual.
People are afraid to contradict
one another, even afraid to ar
ticulate their ideas at all for
fear that they are inferior. It is
now time to change the spirit of
Stanford University. It is time
for students to form unified
convictions rather than accumu
lating unrelated concepts.
Students must stand on indi
vidual character, and strive for
the assimulation of knowledge
rather than the accumulation of
credits. The "General Studies Re
quirements" need to be re-or
ganized to aid education, rather
than to hinder it with survey
courses super-simplified which
bore and talk down to students.
Education is not a temporal
business, but an end in itself.
It is the cultivation of mind that
is our concern, not the produc
tion of "the ideal social person
ality." Democracy is a fine po
litical theory, but is faulty when
applied to education.
It is not necessary to lower
one's educational standards for
the masses. Life and society will
act enough to this effect without
the help of professors and our
university system. The over
quoted words of Yeats still hold
true:
"The best lack all conviction,
while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's account of my talk
to the society of mechanical en
gineer's—would seem to indicate
that I conducted myself as some
sort of idiot.
Possibly some of the engi
neers along with your reporter
did get that idea.
The engineers received me
with quiet dignity, they listened
with extreme interest, their ques
tions were interesting and well
placed as anticipated. When the
talk was over they gave me a
solid round of applause which
indicated that they had been
well entertained if not enlight
ened.
Your reporter started his story
by saying "Wm. Lee Ballenger a
man with no formal education."
He would have been more truth
ful, fair and informative if he
had called me a man of unortho
dox education. I've been going to
universities and colleges since
your reporter was pre-natal — I
am equivalent to a doctorate on
several subjects.
I never paid tuition's, I never
got credits, I just got educations.
The progress of science is a
theoretical procession of reduc
tions of the natural truths of na
ture to the laymans simplicity,
when a man comes along pro
fessing new discoveries, with
terms and symbols too complex
for the laymen to understand.
The dictates of orderly ad
vance would dictate that the one
complex individual be dismissed
as presenting only symptoms of
a psychogenic nature of interest
only to psychiatrist. In such
cases the laymen as a group
should retain themselves as the
highest authority on intelligence
in spite of the obvious truth's
in what I just said.
The physics and astronomy
departments in universities all
over the world waste time and
energy on Einstein's theories of

relativity — Einstein claimed dis
covery of a fourth dimension.
We live in a universe of only
three
No. 1
How wide?
No. 2
How long?
No. 3
How deep space?
I can not allow my conscience
to be a party to a belief in a
man's work when he claims by
so called math and symbols to
have discovered something be
yond all conceivable space and
that that discoverey is a fourth
dimension.
I suggest to the men in the
engineering department that
they ask the men in the physics
department to build an engine
and make it work in compliance
with abstractionist principles.
As a final thought your re
porter might have said that Bal
lenger foresaw a world in which
trains were great magnets with
freight and passengers travelling
noiselessly over long magnetic
beds. Each train would house a
perpetual motion machine on one
car. This machine would gene
rate the electricity needed by the
small motor needed to pull the
train.
Your reporter noted that my
theories were not in physics 51.
He should have also noticed that
there isnt anything in physics
51 which would prove my theo
ries wrong. Tests which I will
eventually set up may prove me
right I think they will
Then it will be physics 51
thanks to the stern stuff pio
neers and some dreamers are
made of.

ticulate their ideas at all for
fear that they are inferior. It is
now time to change the spirit of
Stanford University. It is time
for students to form unified
convictions rather than accumu
lating unrelated concepts.
Students must stand on indi
vidual character, and strive for
the assimulation of knowledge
rather than the accumulation of
credits. The "General Studies Re
quirements" need to be re-or
ganized to aid education, rather
than to hinder it with survey
courses super-simplified which
bore and talk down to students.
Education is not a temporal
business, but an end in itself.
It is the cultivation of mind that
is our concern, not the produc
tion of "the ideal social person
ality." Democracy is a fine po
litical theory, but is faulty when
applied to education.
It is not necessary to lower
one's educational standards for
the masses. Life and society will
act enough to this effect without
the help of professors and our
university system. The over
quoted words of Yeats still hold
true:
"The best lack all conviction,
while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's account of my talk
to the society of mechanical en
gineer's—would seem to indicate
that I conducted myself as some
sort of idiot.
Possibly some of the engi
neers along with your reporter
did get that idea.
The engineers received me
with quiet dignity, they listened
with extreme interest, their ques
tions were interesting and well
placed as anticipated. When the
talk was over they gave me a
solid round of applause which
indicated that they had been
well entertained if not enlight
ened.
Your reporter started his story
by saying "Wm. Lee Ballenger a
man with no formal education."
He would have been more truth
ful, fair and informative if he
had called me a man of unortho
dox education. I've been going to
universities and colleges since
your reporter was pre-natal — I
am equivalent to a doctorate on
several subjects.
I never paid tuition's, I never
got credits, I just got educations.
The progress of science is a
theoretical procession of reduc
tions of the natural truths of na
ture to the laymans simplicity,
when a man comes along pro
fessing new discoveries, with
terms and symbols too complex
for the laymen to understand.
The dictates of orderly ad
vance would dictate that the one
complex individual be dismissed
as presenting only symptoms of
a psychogenic nature of interest
only to psychiatrist. In such
cases the laymen as a group
should retain themselves as the
highest authority on intelligence
in spite of the obvious truth's
in what I just said.
The physics and astronomy
departments in universities all
over the world waste time and
energy on Einstein's theories of

relativity — Einstein claimed dis
covery of a fourth dimension.
We live in a universe of only
three
No. 1
How wide?
No. 2
How long?
No. 3
How deep space?
I can not allow my conscience
to be a party to a belief in a
man's work when he claims by
so called math and symbols to
have discovered something be
yond all conceivable space and
that that discoverey is a fourth
dimension.
I suggest to the men in the
engineering department that
they ask the men in the physics
department to build an engine
and make it work in compliance
with abstractionist principles.
As a final thought your re
porter might have said that Bal
lenger foresaw a world in which
trains were great magnets with
freight and passengers travelling
noiselessly over long magnetic
beds. Each train would house a
perpetual motion machine on one
car. This machine would gene
rate the electricity needed by the
small motor needed to pull the
train.
Your reporter noted that my
theories were not in physics 51.
He should have also noticed that
there isnt anything in physics
51 which would prove my theo
ries wrong. Tests which I will
eventually set up may prove me
right I think they will
Then it will be physics 51
thanks to the stern stuff pio
neers and some dreamers are
made of.

is our concern, not the produc
tion of "the ideal social person
ality." Democracy is a fine po
litical theory, but is faulty when
applied to education.
It is not necessary to lower
one's educational standards for
the masses. Life and society will
act enough to this effect without
the help of professors and our
university system. The over
quoted words of Yeats still hold
true:
"The best lack all conviction,
while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."

• Ballenger Retorts
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's account of my talk
to the society of mechanical en
gineer's—would seem to indicate
that I conducted myself as some
sort of idiot.
Possibly some of the engi
neers along with your reporter
did get that idea.
The engineers received me
with quiet dignity, they listened
with extreme interest, their ques
tions were interesting and well
placed as anticipated. When the
talk was over they gave me a
solid round of applause which
indicated that they had been
well entertained if not enlight
ened.
Your reporter started his story
by saying "Wm. Lee Ballenger a
man with no formal education."
He would have been more truth
ful, fair and informative if he
had called me a man of unortho
dox education. I've been going to
universities and colleges since
your reporter was pre-natal — I
am equivalent to a doctorate on
several subjects.
I never paid tuition's, I never
got credits, I just got educations.
The progress of science is a
theoretical procession of reduc
tions of the natural truths of na
ture to the laymans simplicity,
when a man comes along pro
fessing new discoveries, with
terms and symbols too complex
for the laymen to understand.
The dictates of orderly ad
vance would dictate that the one
complex individual be dismissed
as presenting only symptoms of
a psychogenic nature of interest
only to psychiatrist. In such
cases the laymen as a group
should retain themselves as the
highest authority on intelligence
in spite of the obvious truth's
in what I just said.
The physics and astronomy
departments in universities all
over the world waste time and
energy on Einstein's theories of

relativity — Einstein claimed dis
covery of a fourth dimension.
We live in a universe of only
three
No. 1
How wide?
No. 2
How long?
No. 3
How deep space?
I can not allow my conscience
to be a party to a belief in a
man's work when he claims by
so called math and symbols to
have discovered something be
yond all conceivable space and
that that discoverey is a fourth
dimension.
I suggest to the men in the
engineering department that
they ask the men in the physics
department to build an engine
and make it work in compliance
with abstractionist principles.
As a final thought your re
porter might have said that Bal
lenger foresaw a world in which
trains were great magnets with
freight and passengers travelling
noiselessly over long magnetic
beds. Each train would house a
perpetual motion machine on one
car. This machine would gene
rate the electricity needed by the
small motor needed to pull the
train.
Your reporter noted that my
theories were not in physics 51.
He should have also noticed that
there isnt anything in physics
51 which would prove my theo
ries wrong. Tests which I will
eventually set up may prove me
right I think they will
Then it will be physics 51
thanks to the stern stuff pio
neers and some dreamers are
made of.
WM. LEE BALLENGER
Editor, The Daily:
America today is in great dan
ger. Its government is bureau
cratic, its industries are bureau
cratic, its educational systems
are bureaucratic, and even its
people and their values are be
coming governed by bureaucra
cy.
Stanford is a community of
many theories and few convic
tions. Its spirit is directed by the
question: "How will other peo
ple react?" Its actions are deter
mined by the business of getting
a degree. Its judgments are
based on whether or not words
sound intellectual.
People are afraid to contradict
one another, even afraid to ar
ticulate their ideas at all for
fear that they are inferior. It is
now time to change the spirit of
Stanford University. It is time
for students to form unified
convictions rather than accumu
lating unrelated concepts.
Students must stand on indi
vidual character, and strive for
the assimulation of knowledge
rather than the accumulation of
credits. The "General Studies Re
quirements" need to be re-or
ganized to aid education, rather
than to hinder it with survey
courses super-simplified which
bore and talk down to students.
Education is not a temporal
business, but an end in itself.
