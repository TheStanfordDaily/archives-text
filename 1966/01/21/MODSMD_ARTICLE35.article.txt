# THE
						CAPITOL SCENE
## 'Spontaneity' And LBJ's Washington Press Corpse 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
Bill Moyers, the able White
House Press Secretary, revealed
in a candid television interview
this week that he had on occa
sion "planted" questions with
reporters in advance of a Pres
idential press conference. He did
it, he explained, because "you
never can tell what's going to
happen in one of these press
conferences and I wanted to be
certain that the questions that
the President did have on his
mind, and for which he was
prepared to deal in a substantive
way, did get asked."
For years Presidential press
secretaries have been "planting"
questions with reporters to make
life easier for their bosses, and
there is nothing really wrong
with it except that, as the prob
lems President Johnson faces be
come more complex, more ques
tions are going to have to be
planted, and eventually there
will be no time left for ques
tions that the reporters have
thought up themselves.
Conference Set
I can see in a few months
from now Mr. Moyers saying to
the President, "Your press con
ference is all set, sir. Jack will
ask you the spontaneous ques
tion on Vietnam, Phil will ask
you about civil rights, and Nan
cy will ask you how your health
is."
"Isn't anybody going to ask
me about Lady Bird's beautifi
cation program?"
"We'll ask Joe to question you
about it."
"By the way, what happened
at the last press conference?
Somebody posed a question, and
I didn't even know he was going
to ask it."
'That was a slip-up, sir. You
were trying to recognize Mari
anne, because I had asked her to
ask you about the low rate of
unemployment in the United
States, and the reporter sitting
behind her thought you had
recognized him. Before I could
stop him he got the question
out. What I've done this time
is plant questions around the
people who have been asked to
ask questions, so in case some
one else asks a question by mis
take, you'll still be prepared for
it."

"That's good thinking, Bill."
"Now, what we're doing at this
press conference to facilitate
matters, Mr. President, is we're
putting the answers to the spon
taneous questions on the tele
prompter. Therefore, you have
to call on the people in order."
Problem of Perception
"That makes sense. I'd hate
to be asked about Vietnam and
give an answer that had to do
with Luci's engagement. I did
have another problem last time
and that was the TV lights
were so bright I couldn't see
the people who were supposed
to ask me the questions I had
the answers to."
"We've reserved the first four
rows for the reporters with
the planted questions. What I
would suggest is that you look
all around the room, but only
recognize someone in the first
four rows."
"You seem to have covered all
the bases, Bill. Have you plant
ed any questions I can get a
laugh out of?"
"I gave one to Sarah McClen
don on your beagles, but I told
her to ask it only if we had
time."
"Where should I insert this
sentence about my belief in a
free press and the public's right
to know what their President
has on his mind?"
"Between the spontaneous
question on steel prices and the
spontaneous question on Arthur
Goldberg's visit to the Pope."
