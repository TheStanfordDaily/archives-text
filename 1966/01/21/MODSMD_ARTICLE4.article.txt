# Louis Hershey Predicts Return To 'Korean War' Draft System
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Selective
Service Director Lewis B. Hershey
said this week the "odds are strong"
that there will be a return to a sys
tem of testing and consideration of
class standing by local draft boards
in granting college student defer
ments.

Hershey told a news conference he
expects to make up his mind within
the next few days, about reverting
to a system such as that used during
the Korean War.
"The odds are strong we are going
to revert to such a system, not nec
essarily to the exact details of the
previous system, but to such a sys
tem," Hershey said.
The results would be used as guides
by local draft boards in deciding on
student deferments, but Hershey em
phasized that under the law a local
board is not required to base its de
cision on such data.
Class Standings
He said the system of class stand
ing and testing would apply to stu-

dents next college year if the decision
is reached to reinsate such a system
and the details can be worked out
quickly enough.
Questioned as to whether college
students may be drafted if they fail
to meet the required passing grade
or to maintain standing in the stipu
lated upper portion of the class, Her
shey said he could not estimate when
such students might be ordered for
induction.
Hershey was closeted most of the
day with state draft directors primar
ily from Eastern and Midwestern
states.
He said the special meeting was
held so that national and state offi
cials could discuss their problems.
