# Tax Credit For Tuition May Pass
## 
### 
Republican support may ensure pas
sage of a tax credit program for col
lege tuition payments during this ses
sion of Congress.
Republican support w a s pledged
this week when Rep. Gerald Ford (R-
Mich.), the House minority leader,
made his report on domestic prob
lems as part of the "loyal opposi
tion," the GOP answer to President
Johnson's State of the Union message.
A program allowing tax credits for
college tuition has been proposed in
the last two sessions by Sen. Abra
ham Ribieoff (D-Conn.) but has been
strongly fought by the administration
forces.
Credit on Taxes
As now proposed, the measure
would enable anyone who supports a
college studentâ€”the student himself,
his parents, or a relative- to subtract
from the final amount of income tax
he would otherwise pay the federal
government a percentage of the first
$1,500 spent on tuition, fees, books,
and supplies at institutions of higher
education. The amount of this credit
would be 75 per cent of the first $200,
25 per cent of the next $300, and 10
per cent of the next $1,000. The max
imum credit for a student's tuition
would be $325.
Ribieoff claims he is primarily in
terested in easing the burden of col
lege costs for middle-income families
who cannot qualify for scholarship
aid, but who often find it difficult to
support their children in college. "Aid
ing education," he says, "is strictly
secondary to aiding these hard
pressed parents."
The tax credit is considered indirect
and costly by its critics. Estimate of
its cost run from $750 million to $1.3
billion a year and administration
spokesmen have said that if this is
to be spent on education it might bet
ter be channeled directly into differ
ent forms of education aid.
