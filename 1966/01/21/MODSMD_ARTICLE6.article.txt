# Kesey Gets Six Months
## 
### 
Novelist Ken Kesey, who once stu
died creative writing at Stanford and
is described by critics as one of Amer
ica's most promising young writers,
was sentenced Monday to six months
jail, fined $1,500, and given three
years probation by Superior Court
Judge Louis B. Matteis on a narcotics
charge.
In the April 23 raid on Kesey's La
Honda home, San Mateo County sher
iff's deputies and State Narcotics Bu
reau agents arrested Kesey and thir
teen others. Both Kesey and John
Browning, also arrested, were released
from the County Jail because an ap
peal of their conviction is pending.
Defense attorney Brian D. Rohan
says he will try to refute the convic
tion with the Bill of Rightsâ€”the sher
iff's raiding party did not have
enough evidence for a search warrant.
Kesey's sentence was more severe
than those imposed upon the other
thirteen people involved in the case,
possibly because on December 13 he
and two other persons were found
guilty on charges of possession of
marijuana. Browning was given the
same sentence as Kesey except with
no fine, and Virginia Jackson of Bon
ny Doon, also arrested in the raid,
was meted a sentence of three years
probation, a $250 fine, and psychiatric
observation when "deemed proper" by
the probation officer.
