An Impressive Record
Since being elected to the Senate in
1956, Senator Church has established
an impressive record as a conserva
tionist and foreign policy spokesman.

He was floor manager for the conser
vation bill in the Senate last Session.
Church has represented the senate in

numerous international conferences,
including the OAS Economic Confer
ence in 1957 and the British-American
Conference in London in 1964. He has
also conducted fact finding tours
through Africa and to trouble spots
in the Far East.
Church gained his reputation as a
top notch orator by winning the
American Legion Oratorical contest
while still in high school. He used the

strongly Republican Idaho.
