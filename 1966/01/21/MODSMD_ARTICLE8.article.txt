# LASSU:
## Hours Extended 
### 
The Legislature last night accepted
a series of recommendations which
would substantially liberalize open
house policy, and "very strongly
urged" their adoption by the Student
Affairs and Services Committee.
The recommendations set maxi
mum open house hours from noon
until midnight Sunday through
Thursday and from 10 a.m. until
2:30 a.m. on the weekends. They also
provide for open lobby areas all days
of the week.
Any living unit may restrict these

hours !* it so desires. Violations of
open house policy will be handled by
each individual living group rather
than Judicial Council.
The LASSU i-ecommendations will
be sent to the Student Affairs and
Services Committee, which has also
been studying open house policy. This
committee will recommend changes
in the existing policy to President
Sterling. Final University approval
for any changes must come from the
Board of Trustees.
Other Business
The recommendations by LASSU
were based on the results of a student
poll taken at the end of last quarter.
The Legislature felt the recommenda
tions 'did not contradict the educa
tional goals of the institution" and
also increased the responsibility of
the individual living groups.
In other business, the Legislature
passed a resolution which will set up
a subcommittee to investigate the an
nual $8000 budget of the IIR.
A second subcommittee was also
formed to consider revisions of the
Social Regulations Handbook. Accord
ing to the resolution, there are inac
curacies between the handbook and
current policy.
During a heated and long-winded
debate, the Legislature approved a
bill raising the ceiling of total ASSU
loan outstanding from $2000 to $3000.
An amendment to make, ASSU loans
available with no fixed ceiling and
at an interest rate of five per cent
was defeated earlier by four votes.
V
Amendment Supporters
Suporters of the amendment argued
that ASU loans—which are made in
terest-free to campus living groups—
would drain interest-earning funds
from the ASSU reserves and thereby
benefit on-campus living groups at
the expense of off-campus residents.
Its opponents maintained the ASSU
has a responsibility to make interest
free loans available to living groups.
In other action, the Legislature
allocated $300 from the ASSU con
tingency fund to the payroll account
of the student police "for winter and
spring quarters."
It also approved a by-laws change
allocating $.85 per student per quar
ter to the Daily. The change alters
the method of computing student en
rollment from estimated to actual
count.

tions 'did not contradict the educa
tional goals of the institution" and
also increased the responsibility of
the individual living groups.
In other business, the Legislature
passed a resolution which will set up
a subcommittee to investigate the an
nual $8000 budget of the IIR.
A second subcommittee was also
formed to consider revisions of the
Social Regulations Handbook. Accord
ing to the resolution, there are inac
curacies between the handbook and
current policy.
During a heated and long-winded
debate, the Legislature approved a
bill raising the ceiling of total ASSU
loan outstanding from $2000 to $3000.
An amendment to make, ASSU loans
available with no fixed ceiling and
at an interest rate of five per cent
was defeated earlier by four votes.
V
Amendment Supporters
Suporters of the amendment argued
that ASU loans—which are made in
terest-free to campus living groups—
would drain interest-earning funds
from the ASSU reserves and thereby
benefit on-campus living groups at
the expense of off-campus residents.
Its opponents maintained the ASSU
has a responsibility to make interest
free loans available to living groups.
In other action, the Legislature
allocated $300 from the ASSU con
tingency fund to the payroll account
of the student police "for winter and
spring quarters."
It also approved a by-laws change
allocating $.85 per student per quar
ter to the Daily. The change alters
the method of computing student en
rollment from estimated to actual
count.
The Legislature last night accepted
a series of recommendations which
would substantially liberalize open
house policy, and "very strongly
urged" their adoption by the Student
Affairs and Services Committee.
The recommendations set maxi
mum open house hours from noon
until midnight Sunday through
Thursday and from 10 a.m. until
2:30 a.m. on the weekends. They also
provide for open lobby areas all days
of the week.
Any living unit may restrict these

hours !* it so desires. Violations of
open house policy will be handled by
each individual living group rather
than Judicial Council.
The LASSU i-ecommendations will
be sent to the Student Affairs and
Services Committee, which has also
been studying open house policy. This
committee will recommend changes
in the existing policy to President
Sterling. Final University approval
for any changes must come from the
Board of Trustees.
Other Business
The recommendations by LASSU
were based on the results of a student
poll taken at the end of last quarter.
The Legislature felt the recommenda
tions 'did not contradict the educa
tional goals of the institution" and
also increased the responsibility of
the individual living groups.
