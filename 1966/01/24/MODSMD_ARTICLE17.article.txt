# Ramblers Cruise By Stalled Cards, 16-6
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford Rugby team, out
played from the onset, dropped a
16-6 decision to the Peninsula
Ramblers Rugby Club Saturday.
The loss was the first of the
year for the Indian ruggers and
the first Stanford loss to the
Ramblers since the series started
in 1939.
The Ramblers, led by many
ex-San Jose State football play
ers such as Jerry Colletto and
Brent Berry, held the vaunted
Stanford scrum at bay while
dominating the backfield play all
afternoon.
Allie Lopez, the 6-0, 230
pound lock of the Ramblers, put
his team on the score board first
with a 28 yard penalty kick. Lo
pez scored 10 points for the day.
Chance to Score
The Indians got a chance to
score soon after when the Ram
blers were called for playing the
man, not the ball, on a scrum
play. But Mike Grace's 30 yard
penalty attempt, though dead
center struck the horizontal goal
post bar and bounced back.
At this point in the game,
Stanford's Eric de Gooyer sus
tained a deep cut on his head
and was forced to leave the
game. Later, in the second half,
the Indians lost the use of an
other tall scrum man when Gene
Moffett was ejected from the
game along with the Rambler's
Ken Berry for fighting.
With both deGooyer and Mof
fet missing, the Ramblers dom
inated the lineouts. The Ram
blers continually broke the In
dians' lineout defense to move

the bail out of their own terri
tory.
Half Ends
At the close of the first half
the Ramblers first %, Jerry
Stelle, chased two of his own
kicks, re-catching the ball each
time, and finally beat Bill Os
trander to the ball in the end
zone for a try.
The conversion kick by Allle
Lopez was good and the Penin
sula squad had an 8-0 halftime
lead.
Stanford opened the second
half with their first points of
the day as Mike Grace booted a
penalty kick good for three
points. Seconds later, Grace
almost scored a try, breaking
away for a long gainer, but was
hauled down short of the goal.
First Offensive Drive
It was halfway through the
second half before the Indians
could put together their first of
fensive drive of the day. Frank
Patitucci got away for a 20
yard run and then passed to
Mac Wylie who scored the try.
However the angle for the ex
tra point was bad and Grace's
conversion try was no good,
leaving the Indians behind, 8-6.
The Cards seemed to be gain
ing strength at this point in the
game, but sloppy passing set
back all of their offensive
thrusts. The Ramblers then pad
ded their lead with a 25 yard
penalty kick by Lopez.
The Rambler player-coach,
Jack Butler, then iced the game
for his team when he picked
up his own penalty kick and car
ried it across the goal line. The

conversion was good and made
the score 16-6 whore it ended.
Kmetovic Disapixiinted
Coach Pete Kmetovic, dis
heartened by the loss which left
the Indians with a 1-1-1 record
for the season, said that: "We
simply were outhustled and
beaten.
"We never dominated the
game and when we did get the
ball, we couldn't muster enough
offense to do anything with it."
One bright spot of the day
was the play of Randy Vahan.
Vahan. a six year rugby veteran,
was playing his first game of
the season and bolstered the In
dian scrum.
Nye, Neifcl Outstanding
Others singled out by Kmeto
vic for their play were Blaine
Nye and Joe Neal. Bob New
berry, at breakaway, played both
a fine offensive and defensive
game, several times kicking the
ball out of danger.
Next week the Indian Rug

will bring an experienced team

ers such as Jerry Colletto and

Allie Lopez, the 6-0, 230
pound lock of the Ramblers, put
his team on the score board first
with a 28 yard penalty kick. Lo
pez scored 10 points for the day.
Chance to Score
The Indians got a chance to
score soon after when the Ram
blers were called for playing the
man, not the ball, on a scrum
play. But Mike Grace's 30 yard
penalty attempt, though dead
center struck the horizontal goal
post bar and bounced back.
At this point in the game,
Stanford's Eric de Gooyer sus
tained a deep cut on his head
and was forced to leave the
game. Later, in the second half,
the Indians lost the use of an
other tall scrum man when Gene
Moffett was ejected from the
game along with the Rambler's
Ken Berry for fighting.
With both deGooyer and Mof

the Ramblers first %, Jerry
Stelle, chased two of his own
kicks, re-catching the ball each
time, and finally beat Bill Os

Lopez was good and the Penin
sula squad had an 8-0 halftime
lead.
Stanford opened the second
half with their first points of
the day as Mike Grace booted a

fensive drive of the day. Frank
Patitucci got away for a 20
yard run and then passed to
Mac Wylie who scored the try.
However the angle for the ex
tra point was bad and Grace's
conversion try was no good,
leaving the Indians behind, 8-6.
The Cards seemed to be gain

game, but sloppy passing set
back all of their offensive
thrusts. The Ramblers then pad

penalty kick by Lopez.
