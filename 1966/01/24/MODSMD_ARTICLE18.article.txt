# Boxers Pound Out Victory Over Navy
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Stanford's boxing team sus
tained only one defeat last
Thursday as they paraded to a
4Y2-2V2 victory over the 12th Na
val District.
Tom Jenks, an impressive box
er all season, who garnered his
second straight technical knock
out of the season, and Delos
Brown in the heavyweight divi
sion were the highlights of the
evening.
In the first bout of the eve
ning Jack Oatman was out
fought by his more experienced
opponent and lost a decision.
Stanford went undefeated in the
next six bouts.
Marlar's Fight A Draw?
Jim Marlar, although knock
ing his opponent down in the
first round for a nine-count, was
bothered by the powerful right
of his Navy foe throughout the
contest. The bout was surpris
ingly called a draw.
George Bellows also fought to
a stale-mate with his taller op
ponent. Bellows tired in the last
round allowing his opponent to
salvage a draw.
Price Looks Good
John Price, definitely the bet
ter boxer, showed some fine,
hard blows in the 165pdund
fight but his opponent, fighting
mainly on guts, used his aggres
sive style to tie Price up on
several occasions. Price won the
decision.
The second bout in the 165-
lb. class was contrasted to
Price's. Dennis Hanson landed
very few blows in the bout with
his opponent's bobbing and
weaving making it difficult for
Hanson to use his short jabs ef
fectively. Hanson kept the pres
sure on his foe throughout the
contest, however, and was
awarded the decision.
Jenks' bout ended in a tech
nical knockout when his oppo
nent failed to come out for the
third round.
Coach Praises Jenks
The first round was relative
ly close, but as Coach Ray Lun
ny put it, "Jenks really worked
him over in that second round.
Another 15 seconds and the bout
would have been stopped. The
bell saved the Navy man."

For the second straight time
Delos Brown fought to a draw.
Brown fought to a stale-m ate
with Walt Cummingham in last
week's Cal fight.
However, Brown showed con
siderable improvement over last
week. Coach Lunny was very
impressed with Brown and con
sidered the Navy heavyweight
a better boxer than Cumming
ham.
Lunny commented, "Last
week's bout did more for Brown
than a week of training could
have done. I expect a lot from
Brown now that he is a little
wiser and in better shape."
Brown was one of the last box
ers to come out for the team and
subsequently was not in good
shape for his first bout.
