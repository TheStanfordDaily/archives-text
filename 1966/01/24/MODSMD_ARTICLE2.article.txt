# Sen. Church Blasts ‘Pax Americana’
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
Senator Frank Church of Idaho told a Stan
ford audience Friday night that it is beyond
the power and best interest of the United States
to impose a Pax Americana upon an unwilling
world.
Addressing the Institute of International Re
lation's annual Conference, Church expressed
"deep misgivings about the present foreign pol
icy of the United States" and outlined a new
approach to American policy in an age of reso
lution. He criticized post-war policy makers for
treating the underdeveloped nations through an
extension of "European" policies.
Addressing a near capacity audience in Din
kelspiel Auditorium, Church went on to blast
all aspects of American foreign policy. He is
considered a strong Administration critic in
his position as a Democratic member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
By failing to recognize the difference between
direct aggression in Eastern Europe by the
Russians and Chinese support for wars of libe
ration in Asia, the maverick Senator asserted,
the United States has committed itself to the
role of "self-appointed fireman, scurrying to
quench every revolutionary blaze, no matter
how repugnant the government that sounded
the alarm." Church noted that the causes of
impending uprisings in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America are essentially indigenous.
Guerilla Wars to Come
Rejecting the "domino theory" Church told
the conference, "Regardless of the outcome in
Vietnam, we shall have to live in a world beset

with guerrilla wars for many years to come."
Guerrilla wars, the senator noted, were not
links in a chain, but were rather a contagious
disease carried on the winds of change.
Yet the senator denied that he or any of
the other dissenters from present foreign policy
in the Senate were trying to spread a gospel of
neo-isolationism. Rather he urged that the
United States exercise a "prudent restraint and
develop a foreign policy more closely tied to a
sober assessment of our own national interests."
Speaking directly to the Vietnam situation
and the Dominican crisis, Church asserted that
it was American prestige and not security that
was at stake in Vietnam. But in the Dominican
Republic he noted that traditionally the Carib
bean had been a sphere of American influence,
thus explaining intervention.
For guerrilla wars which do not effect Amer
ican security, Church advocated an "arm's
length" policy, which would preclude the con
version of a conflict into an American war.
Turning to an analysis of Communist strat
egy, Church noted that unlimited US interven
tion was actually strengthening the Commu
nist's appeal in underdeveloped nations. By not
allowing nations to undergo their own revolu
tions, the United States has aided the Commu
nists in linking their ideology to nationalism in
the new nations.
No Cause to Panic
That some insurgent nations might go Com
munist in a world not dominated by American
intervention, Church regarded as no cause for
panic since the ideological trend in the world
today is nationalism. "Even when the two com

bine, Communism had become the servant of
nationalist aspirations."
Looking beyond Southeast Asia, Church pre
dicted that prolonging the Vietnam War might
lead to a solidification of Russia and China and
a full-scale renewal of the cold war.
While- direct intervention proved successful
in Europe niter the Second World War, Church
noted that our intervention was welcome there
and that America has no right to extend this

assumption to the rest of the world.
Church also criticized the growing bi-partisan
ship in foreign policy which "effectively re
moved American foreign policy from the area
of open debate within the government. It is no
longer fashionable for the opposition party to
oppose."
Church participated with other conference
speakers in a panel discussion of social change
and political violence.
