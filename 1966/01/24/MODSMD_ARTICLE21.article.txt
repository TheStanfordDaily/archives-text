# TWO WEEKEND WINS
## Frosh Befuddle Braves 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
Another winning chapter was
written into this year's frosh
cage history last weekend as the
continuum of improvement
wrought victories swallowed up
the less potent Braves with the
scores of 60-51 and 67-58.
The weekend series was
enough to show that Coach Bill
Turner's squad has developed as
a unit, and the team's 6-0 record

going into the weekend is evi
dence that there just aren't too
many of the kind in the area.
Deficit Diminishes
Friday's contest saw the
Frosh out front most of the
way with an occasional threat
by the jayvees. The latter were
behind 12 at the half, but a grad
ual scoring surge evened it up
with 11 minutes to go in the
game and inched them ahead

for a few short seconds.
ThP Frosh wore fated to pull
it through, however, and they
finished it in victory, with plen
ty to spare, at 60-51.
"Friday's game was a bit rag
ged. but Saturday's game was
better played." reflected Coach
Turner, and the tallies tell his
tale.
Lead All the Way
Saturday's spread was the
same, but was raised to the
level of 67-58. The younger quin
tet kept the scoreboard on their
side throughout, though their
lead was at times precarious.
A spread of four at halftime
turned into the final 67-58 nine—
spread.
"Don Griffin and Ed Martin
did a good job this weekend,"
said Coach Turner, singling out
his two hi g h-scoring players.
"(Karl) Wustrack was good on
Saturday—he hurt us a lot —so
did Jim Brigham—the two for
wards really hurt," he admitted.
The Brave's damage was not de
cisive, however.
Santa Clara Next
With a 8-0 record in their hat,
the freshman cagers will travel
to Santa Clara next week. "It
will be interesting," Turner tells,
"This is our second game on the
road; the first was at San Jose.
Santa Clara is a stronger team.
"The team's season so far was
probably surprising to some,"
the coach continued. "We've
really done some improving, as
a team, and are working togeth
er a lot better. We've developed
a real good defense. The boys
have been working hard all sea

son long, and especially these
last few games. They get a lot;
of credit."
The good defense was evident!
this weekend, but that doesn't j
mean to say that the offense j
didn't shine too.
The latter was popping from j
all over and around the key. The |
over-all fine play of the fresh- j
men this weekend was typical j
of their already impressive sea
son. .

over-all fine play of the fresh- j
men this weekend was typical j
of their already impressive sea
son. .
Another winning chapter was
written into this year's frosh
cage history last weekend as the
continuum of improvement
wrought victories swallowed up
the less potent Braves with the
scores of 60-51 and 67-58.
The weekend series was
enough to show that Coach Bill
Turner's squad has developed as
a unit, and the team's 6-0 record

going into the weekend is evi
dence that there just aren't too
many of the kind in the area.
Deficit Diminishes
Friday's contest saw the
Frosh out front most of the
way with an occasional threat
by the jayvees. The latter were
behind 12 at the half, but a grad
ual scoring surge evened it up
with 11 minutes to go in the
game and inched them ahead

for a few short seconds.
ThP Frosh wore fated to pull
it through, however, and they
finished it in victory, with plen
ty to spare, at 60-51.
"Friday's game was a bit rag
ged. but Saturday's game was
better played." reflected Coach
Turner, and the tallies tell his
tale.
Lead All the Way
Saturday's spread was the
same, but was raised to the
level of 67-58. The younger quin
tet kept the scoreboard on their
side throughout, though their
lead was at times precarious.
A spread of four at halftime
turned into the final 67-58 nine—
spread.
"Don Griffin and Ed Martin
did a good job this weekend,"
said Coach Turner, singling out
his two hi g h-scoring players.
"(Karl) Wustrack was good on
Saturday—he hurt us a lot —so
did Jim Brigham—the two for
wards really hurt," he admitted.
The Brave's damage was not de
cisive, however.
Santa Clara Next
With a 8-0 record in their hat,
the freshman cagers will travel
to Santa Clara next week. "It
will be interesting," Turner tells,
"This is our second game on the
road; the first was at San Jose.
Santa Clara is a stronger team.
"The team's season so far was
probably surprising to some,"
the coach continued. "We've
really done some improving, as
a team, and are working togeth
er a lot better. We've developed
a real good defense. The boys
have been working hard all sea

son long, and especially these
last few games. They get a lot;
of credit."
The good defense was evident!
this weekend, but that doesn't j
mean to say that the offense j
didn't shine too.
The latter was popping from j
all over and around the key. The |
