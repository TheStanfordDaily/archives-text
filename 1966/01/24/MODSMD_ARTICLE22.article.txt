# Capacity Crowd Helps Poly Wrestlers Defeat Stanford
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
A keyed-up Cal Poly wres
tling squad pinned a 27-6 defeat
on the Indian grapplers before
a capacity crowd in San Luis
Obispo last Friday.
Bud Hollingbery and Rick
Lindsley scored the only two
Stanford victories. Cal Poly,

broke away from his opponent
late in the last round, but could
not score a take-down to pick
up the needed two points.
Poly-Debilitated Prostration
Bud Hollingbery put an end
to the Cal Poly string as he man
handled his 177 pound adversary.
Hollingbery completely domina
ted his match, taking a 10-1 de
cision over Dean Hilger.
In the unlimited weight divi
sion, Poly wanted a cracker but
got Rick Lindsley instead. Linds
ley blanked Poly heavyweight
Joe Faria, 5-0, to end the meet
on a positive note for the Tribe.
Stanford next sees action this
Thursday night in the Pavilion
against visiting Santa Clara.
Feb. 2, the grapplers go in a
double header against San Jose
State. Both freshman and var
sity squads will hit the mats.
