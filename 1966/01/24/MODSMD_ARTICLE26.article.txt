# TWO MINUTES OF HAIGHT
## Intra-University Discussion 
### BY TIM HAIGHT 
What happened to all those student and student
faculty discussion groups we used to have?
Last year we had WEDG, SAUS, the GCC, and
others. In one way or another they tried to take
a long look at the act of going through Stanford
and how it affects the people involved. Now they
are ho more.
Whither Seniors?
Did they die because the FSM quieted down?
Did the moving spirits graduate and move on to
better things? Hopefully not. Students and fac
ulty should be conscious enough of the transfor
mation that can happen in students' character
that they would not need a scandal or Cal's lead
ership to make them think. And if all the people
who did care to think about education graduated,
Stanford need not fear tottering over the edge
of greatness.
We must look at ourselves in the perspective
of the social and educational changes we are
undergoing. We should discuss the processes with
each other. Only by an awareness of the basic
needs of an educational institution can we find
common ground on which to try to disentangle
the myriad student-faculty diifferences that can
too easily solidify into unreasoning stubborn
ness.
As students we can benefit by doing a little
reading about higher education. We will be able
to present our cases in a better perspective. We
will perhaps be more aware of the dynamics of
the University, and the problems we must meet
if we are to make changes. At best, we will even
be a little inspired by the concern that many
scholars feel about the possibilities for real
growth that lie so near to realization and yet so
irritatingly far away.
Another thing we can do as students is to back
up our arguments with all the techniques usual
to an academic community. The poll of the LASSU
Open House Hours subcommittee, which made a
serious attempt to statistically measure the feel
ings of the undergraduate living groups, is a
step in this direction. An addition to that presen
tation could be a serious discussion of the philo
sophical aspects of open house, answering such
questions as why the Board of Trustees should
feel that each living group cannot be trusted to
make its own personal schedule of hours.
Issues that would fall under this question
would include how students assume responsibil

ity, how responsibility and charactor development
are related, and how peer group influence com
pares with perceived hierarchal authority with
respect to reinforcing institutional values.
If the faculty does not seem responsive to per
mitting students to sit on subcommittees of the
Academic Council right away, we may be miffed,
and with some justification. But this is no excuse
for not doing our best. If that avenue is blocked,
rather than feel bitter we should set up parallel
committees, make a deep study of possibilities,
publish results, and ask for a hearing. It's a lot
of work, but what do we expect? And the effort
would greatly benefit the students involved. We
certainly do not lack faculty who would help us
set up accurate methods of investigation.
The possibilities go on and on. Non-credit semin
ars, or senior colloquia which are easily set up
for credit on any subject a faculty member and
less than nineteen students can choose, outside
money, like the $2000 grant that Political Union
got for being a "new student group." All we need
to do is make the effort.
Student Laziness
The laziness that has characterized most stu
dent-initiated proposals so far is due to many
problems. One is the acadfcmic pressure, another
the attitude on the part of many students that the
academic part of their lives is not worth much
thought outside of their courses. These problems
will be with us for a long time.
But there are other dysfunctions which we
might eliminate. Student government lately has
adopted a sort-of "all or nothing" point of view
—either we get what we want in a relatively
simple negotiating process or we threaten bedlam.
This is unfortunate. It is simply not that easy.
A boxer does not fight with a few light taps and
an atomic bomb. We must find other channels
of communication and other ways to push our
causes.
It will take work, but if student government
could ally itself with more than the politically
active, such as all those people in that 500 person
student-faculty seminar— could establish a clear
cut bureaucracy that was more than one branch
trying to outdo or undo the other, could teach
education and methods of getting things done as
well as making pronouncements, we could make
student opinion a dignified and provocative force
as well as a noisy one.
