## Museum Not A 'Bright Spot' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Many visitors to the Stanford
Museum, inquire "where is the
enjine"? "Where are all of the
antiques and the ancient things
that used to be here?"
It seems, these historical
archaeological and anthropologi
cal ingredients have been de
leted, taken away, stored, out
of sight. In their place has ap
peared a polyglot mixture of
beatnik nonsense known today
as progressive non entity mate
rials

There is no more California
Lore, which has a fettish with
the Stanford family. Modernis
tic or "revolutionary" art, statu
ary and paintings come and go,
in an ever moving chaos and an
unreasonable lack of logic or
method of presentation. And ap
proximately 20 percent of the
floor area, vacant-unused!
Gone is the beauty and the
old ancient objects so dear to
the hearts of children, who used
to come to the museum with

their notes books and pencils
for "class work."
For the MUSEUM, has been
degenerated into a hodge podge,
much of it mere personal pa
tronage, by management. While
the new galleries are beautiful
in the sense they are bright and
cheery, a hotel lobby appearance
is there and dedication seems to
be more for show, than realism.
Why degenerate the Stanford
Museum into a bright spot, with
no museum environment??
THE OLD TIMER.
