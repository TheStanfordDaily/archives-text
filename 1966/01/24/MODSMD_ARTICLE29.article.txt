## Latin Americans Distrust Johnson's 'Holy Alliance' 
### 
It has been evident for some
time that our relations with La
tin America are deteriorating
and that there has been an ur
gent, almost desperate need for
change at the highest levels in
Washington.
In a recent trip to South Am
erica I found that virtually ev
erywhere, from the top to the
bottom and from the right to the
left, there exists a general dis
trust and suspicion of the John
son administration and a very
wide anti-American feeling. Trav
eling, as it happened, in the
wake of Sen. Robert Kennedy's
South American tour, it was
plain enough that the South
American crowds were attribu
ting to the late President all the
qualities they missed in his suc
cessor.
Not Love, But Trust
I do not need to be told that
great and rich powers must not
expect to be loved. But they do
need to be trusted by their
neighbors.
The main elements of the
present distrust are, it seems to
me:
Fear among people of the
center and left that President
Johnson, acting on the advice of
Undersecretary Thomas Mann,
will use U. S. military force and
U. S. economic power to thwart
or suppress radical social
changes;
Anger on the right that the
United States is inciting the
masses to expect radical im
provements in their way of liv
ing;
The belief of the intellectual
leaders of South America that
U. S. policy has a primitive and
superstitious obsession with the
danger of communism which
distracts and coarsens its di
plomacy;
A feeling that Washington
does not mucn care and is real
ly rather bored with Latin
America, that it is inattentive
and is preoccupied with Asia
and Europe. As a result there
is very little original and crea
tive thinking about the affairs
of the hemisphere.
Hope In Gordon
There is reason to hope that
the President has turned a page
in placing Lincoln Gordon in
charge of inter-American af
fairs, for Gordon is a man of
ihigh quality. He will, to be
sure, have to persuade the
doubting Latin Americans that
he does not belong to that school
of U. S. diplomats which thinks

that the only people who can
govern Latin America are mili
tary men. For he has been am
bassador to Brazil during the
regime of Gen. Castelo Branco.
But surprisingly enough there
exists in highly enlightened and
progressive circles in South
America a belief that what ex
ists in Brazil is not a mere mili
tary dictatorship, but rather an
authoritarian government for a
limited emergency. There is
much readiness to understand
that normal political maneuver
ing had to be suspended in order
to conquer the galloping infla
tion and the deep corruption.
This underlying confidence
rests in very large part on re
spect for the director of the
Brazilian economic program,
Robert Campos. His presence at
the center of things is widely
accepted as a guarantee that
the cleansing operation of Cas
telo Branco is being done in
good faith.
Not a New Holy Alliance
If Gordon is to succeed he
will have to dispel the belief
that since the death of Presi
dent Kennedy our Laitn-Ameri
can policy has changed. To do
that he will have to see to it that
it really has not been changed
and that in Washington the Alli
ance for Progress has not been
supplanted by a new Holy Alli
ance for the suppression of all
reformers whom those on the
extreme right choose to call
Communists.
To do this will require a big
course of re-education — or re
placement — among the offi
cials at home and abroad who
deal with the details of our re
lations with each Latin-Ameri
can country.
But all of these things will not
suffice. The basic problems of
South America are, I believe, in
soluble if they are undertaken
country by country and bit by
bit. Without the opening up of
a continental Common Market,
the basic problems of popula
tion, land and resources cannot
be overcome.
It is necessary to think and
to act by measures and proj
ects which are continental in
scale. The work to be done is
great, but the promise is enor
mous. This country can, if we
have the vision to realize it,
promote the opening, the explo
ration and the development of
the greatest and richest unused
region which is still possessed
by Western men.
