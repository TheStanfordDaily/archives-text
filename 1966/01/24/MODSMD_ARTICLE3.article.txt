# A 						Day With Sen. Church
## 
### 
Daily Reporter Jim Selna followed Senator
Frank Church around Friday on his quick Stan
ford visit, and here gives sidelights on the ac
tive young Idaho senator.
The throng of people waiting for the arrival
of flight 59 from Washington was larger than
usual—even for a Friday. The San Francisco
press corps had gathered in mass, but most of
the crowd and the airport officials seemed un
aware of anything special.
As the passengers debarked the photogra
phers quickly singled out the man they had
come to see.
He might have been just another young exec
utive passing through town on business. But
there was something in his boyish face and ex
uberence that reflected more than success.
Feeding' of Senators
For a man of 41, Frank Church has indeed

been very successful. Already a member of the
United States Senate for ten years and a re
spected Democratic spokesman, he has gained
a reputation for saying what he thinks. Despite
a President who is "highly skilled in the care
and feeding of young senators," he has often
been two steps ahead of the Administration in
his foreign policy outlook and rarely under its
thumb.
As the reporters began to fire questions at
him concerning Vietnam, the senator spoke
with the authority that his tenure on the For
eign Relations Committee had brought him.
Yet the slight tinge of gray in his hair, the
lines in his forehead and the tone of his voice
added an air of serious deliberation to his re
plies. He could assure a lady reporter that the
war had not forced Aemrica to make a choice
between "guns and butter," and he soberly
hoped that the President's peace offensive would

eliminate the need for any such
choice.
When the conference broke up, the
senator seemed a bit more relaxed.
He took time to catch up on family
news with a cousin who had come
down to the airport from the City.
Church was bubbling with the news
that his eldest son Forrest had been
accepted by Stanford.
Small Talk
As he made his way out of the air
port with members of the lIR Con
ference committee, the senator in
dulged in small talk.
Driving down the Bayshore, he rem
inisced about his own days at Stan
ford after the war. An outdoorsman
and strong conservationist he looked
askance at the high rise construction
dotting the horizon along the penin
sula. As for the continuum of brick
and tile architecture that dominates
the campus, the senator wondered
what kind of architecture people
might use on the moon. After all,
that was one place where the Spanish
were not likely to already have estab
lished the trend in buildings.
Church appeared for dinner Friday
evening at the Faculty Club at six
with several members of the faculty
who were participating in the confer
ence. Sitting around a large coffee
table in one of the lounges, the sena
tor showed himself to be a charming
conversationalist. When asked what
he would like to drink before dinner,
Church uncovered one of the rarely
seen weaknesses of the academic life.
Amidst the collective skills of three
PhD's, there was no one who knew
how to make Washington's favorite
drink, the martini.
Over dinner he talked about a range
of subjects from LBJ's move to
lengthen the terms of members of
the House to the validity of historical
parallel in State Department think
ing to talk about home. The father
of two boys, Church had to admit
that his younger son with some re
sults had coaxed him to watch Bat
man.
Dinkelspiel Talk
The group of dinner guests walked
over to Dinkelspiel for the senator's
address. He took a last glance over
the text before taking the platform.
Skillfully weaving spontaneous re
marks into the prepared text in many
places, Church impressed the audi
ence with his ideas, but did not over
power the audience emotionally.
During the question period, the au
dience came alive. And so did the
senator's wit.
Asked if he felt himself powerless
to effect foreign policy changes, he
paused a second, thought and then
told his questioner that he did not
think he was impotent — in effecting
policy shifts.
The busy day came to an end with
a reception in the large lounge at Tre
sidder. The fatigue of the ady's activi
ties and the time change were begin
ning to show on the senator's face.
He spent an hour answering ques
tions for about one hundred students.
Still retaining a chipper smile, Church
fielded a good many barbed ques
tions with sincerity.
And so ended a day with Senator

the crowd and the airport officials seemed un
aware of anything special.
As the passengers debarked the photogra

come to see.
He might have been just another young exec

there was something in his boyish face and ex
uberence that reflected more than success.
Feeding' of Senators
For a man of 41, Frank Church has indeed

been very successful. Already a member of the
United States Senate for ten years and a re
spected Democratic spokesman, he has gained
a reputation for saying what he thinks. Despite
a President who is "highly skilled in the care
and feeding of young senators," he has often
been two steps ahead of the Administration in
his foreign policy outlook and rarely under its
thumb.
As the reporters began to fire questions at
him concerning Vietnam, the senator spoke
with the authority that his tenure on the For
eign Relations Committee had brought him.
Yet the slight tinge of gray in his hair, the
lines in his forehead and the tone of his voice
added an air of serious deliberation to his re
plies. He could assure a lady reporter that the
war had not forced Aemrica to make a choice
between "guns and butter," and he soberly
hoped that the President's peace offensive would

eliminate the need for any such
choice.
When the conference broke up, the
senator seemed a bit more relaxed.
He took time to catch up on family
news with a cousin who had come
down to the airport from the City.
Church was bubbling with the news
that his eldest son Forrest had been
accepted by Stanford.
Small Talk
As he made his way out of the air
port with members of the lIR Con
ference committee, the senator in
dulged in small talk.
Driving down the Bayshore, he rem
inisced about his own days at Stan
ford after the war. An outdoorsman
and strong conservationist he looked
askance at the high rise construction
dotting the horizon along the penin
sula. As for the continuum of brick
and tile architecture that dominates
the campus, the senator wondered
what kind of architecture people
might use on the moon. After all,
that was one place where the Spanish
were not likely to already have estab
lished the trend in buildings.
Church appeared for dinner Friday
evening at the Faculty Club at six
with several members of the faculty
who were participating in the confer
ence. Sitting around a large coffee
table in one of the lounges, the sena
tor showed himself to be a charming
conversationalist. When asked what
he would like to drink before dinner,
Church uncovered one of the rarely
seen weaknesses of the academic life.
Amidst the collective skills of three
PhD's, there was no one who knew
how to make Washington's favorite
drink, the martini.
Over dinner he talked about a range
of subjects from LBJ's move to
lengthen the terms of members of
the House to the validity of historical
parallel in State Department think
ing to talk about home. The father
of two boys, Church had to admit
that his younger son with some re
sults had coaxed him to watch Bat
man.
Dinkelspiel Talk
The group of dinner guests walked
over to Dinkelspiel for the senator's
address. He took a last glance over
the text before taking the platform.
Skillfully weaving spontaneous re
marks into the prepared text in many
places, Church impressed the audi
ence with his ideas, but did not over
power the audience emotionally.
During the question period, the au
dience came alive. And so did the
senator's wit.
Asked if he felt himself powerless
to effect foreign policy changes, he
paused a second, thought and then
told his questioner that he did not
think he was impotent — in effecting
policy shifts.
The busy day came to an end with
a reception in the large lounge at Tre
sidder. The fatigue of the ady's activi
ties and the time change were begin
ning to show on the senator's face.
He spent an hour answering ques
tions for about one hundred students.
Still retaining a chipper smile, Church
fielded a good many barbed ques
tions with sincerity.
And so ended a day with Senator
Church.
Daily Reporter Jim Selna followed Senator
Frank Church around Friday on his quick Stan
ford visit, and here gives sidelights on the ac
tive young Idaho senator.

uberence that reflected more than success.
Feeding' of Senators
For a man of 41, Frank Church has indeed

been very successful. Already a member of the
United States Senate for ten years and a re
spected Democratic spokesman, he has gained
a reputation for saying what he thinks. Despite
a President who is "highly skilled in the care
and feeding of young senators," he has often
been two steps ahead of the Administration in
his foreign policy outlook and rarely under its
thumb.
As the reporters began to fire questions at
him concerning Vietnam, the senator spoke
with the authority that his tenure on the For
eign Relations Committee had brought him.
Yet the slight tinge of gray in his hair, the
lines in his forehead and the tone of his voice
added an air of serious deliberation to his re
plies. He could assure a lady reporter that the
war had not forced Aemrica to make a choice
between "guns and butter," and he soberly
hoped that the President's peace offensive would

eliminate the need for any such
choice.
When the conference broke up, the
senator seemed a bit more relaxed.
He took time to catch up on family
news with a cousin who had come
down to the airport from the City.
Church was bubbling with the news
that his eldest son Forrest had been
accepted by Stanford.
Small Talk
As he made his way out of the air
port with members of the lIR Con
ference committee, the senator in
dulged in small talk.
Driving down the Bayshore, he rem
inisced about his own days at Stan
ford after the war. An outdoorsman
and strong conservationist he looked
askance at the high rise construction
dotting the horizon along the penin
sula. As for the continuum of brick
and tile architecture that dominates
the campus, the senator wondered
what kind of architecture people
might use on the moon. After all,
that was one place where the Spanish
were not likely to already have estab
lished the trend in buildings.
Church appeared for dinner Friday
evening at the Faculty Club at six
with several members of the faculty
who were participating in the confer
ence. Sitting around a large coffee
table in one of the lounges, the sena
tor showed himself to be a charming
conversationalist. When asked what
he would like to drink before dinner,
Church uncovered one of the rarely
seen weaknesses of the academic life.
Amidst the collective skills of three
PhD's, there was no one who knew
how to make Washington's favorite
drink, the martini.
Over dinner he talked about a range
of subjects from LBJ's move to
lengthen the terms of members of
the House to the validity of historical
parallel in State Department think
ing to talk about home. The father
of two boys, Church had to admit
that his younger son with some re
sults had coaxed him to watch Bat
man.
Dinkelspiel Talk
The group of dinner guests walked
over to Dinkelspiel for the senator's
address. He took a last glance over
the text before taking the platform.
Skillfully weaving spontaneous re
marks into the prepared text in many
places, Church impressed the audi
ence with his ideas, but did not over
power the audience emotionally.
During the question period, the au
dience came alive. And so did the
senator's wit.
Asked if he felt himself powerless
to effect foreign policy changes, he
paused a second, thought and then
told his questioner that he did not
think he was impotent — in effecting
policy shifts.
The busy day came to an end with
a reception in the large lounge at Tre
sidder. The fatigue of the ady's activi
ties and the time change were begin
ning to show on the senator's face.
He spent an hour answering ques
tions for about one hundred students.
Still retaining a chipper smile, Church
fielded a good many barbed ques
tions with sincerity.
And so ended a day with Senator
Church.
