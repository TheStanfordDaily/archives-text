# 600 Students Take A Deeper Look At 'Selves In Society'
## 
### 
Last night 600 Stanford men and
women participated in "A Deeper
Look at Ourselves," and whether they
emphatically agreed with or voilent
ly opposed the eight speakers, they
were certainly exposed to the motiva
tion to discover the "real me."
After the seven students and guest
lecturer, Dr. Frederick Adler, ex
plored the self as an entity, and in
relation to peers, the opposite sex,
and society, the 600 students broke
into discussion groups with faculty
couples in private homes.
Jim Anderson led the speakers. He
began by asking "Who am I?" The
rest attempted to define the problem
of self-discovery.
Nick Davis offered the idea of
"Venetian blinds." He said that the
"real me" could either shine through
or be totally blocked off by "a mask"
which he hoped to recognize. Yet he
was quick to add the importance of
control. A person can let the mask
become permanent—for instance, the
guise of always being a joker—and
refuse to let his more serious, more
vulnerable self shine through.
Janet Pezzaglia spoke of relations
with the opposite sex. "How much do
I commit myself?" Do I really care
about the boy I'm dating, or is ho a

means to some other end?" she
asked. Questions like these stimulated
avid discussion later. One coed re
ported that two hours were spent in
her group discussing dating and mar
riage.
And so the talks went. Susan Heil
man and Tom Kelleway proposed
other perspectives on the self. Tim
McCarthy gave the male view of dat
ing and relationships, telling of his
discovery that "girls are people, too."
On peers, Pete Love delved into
the different roles a person assumes
in different situations, from the
flicks to a poetry lecture.
