# Peace Committee Plans Attack On Napalm Plant
## 
### DICK BALLANTINE Acting Managing- Editor 
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam is planning to instigate a
"nationwide protest" against the use
of napalm in Vietnam as a result of
the disclosure that a Sunnyvale Com
pany is involved in manufacturing
the highly inflammable gasoline.
Keith Lowe, a member of the SC
PV's Steering Committee, announced
that protests and demonstrations
against napalm producing plants will
be organized by the National Coordin
ating Committee whose headquarters
are in Madison, Wisconsin.
Defense Bulletin
It was learned publicly late last
week that the United Technology
Center was manufacturing napalm at
its Coyote plant when the Sunnyvale
Public Safety Department received a
bulletin from the Department of De
fense concerning the shipments and
the special fire problems accidents
could create. The napalm is then de
livered by rail and truck to Concord,
where it is sent to Vietnam.
A UTC spokesman said the firm
is designing units for mixing and
filling napalm containers in battle
zones. The actual amount of Napalm-
B, an advanced form, being manu
factured has not been specified.
UTC officials have refused to com
ment on the project. It is financed by
a $230,000 contract from Eglin Air
Force Base in Florida.
Coyote Is Pilot Project
"The protest against the Coyote
plant will be the pilot project," Lowe
said. "Our object is to stop the pro
duction of napalm."
Lowe said that a demonstration
will be held at the Coyote plant some
time this week. The Concerned Citi-

Zens Group of Palo Alto, the San
Jose Peace Center and the San Jose
State College Viet Nam Day Commit
tee will also participate in the pro
test. Approximately 230 students be
long to the SCPV, Lowe estimated.
"We plan to protest on as many
fronts as possible," Lowe emphasized.
He said that pickets and leaflets will
be utilized at the Coyote plant, and
that the UTC directors and workers
will be contacted. "Telegrams have
already been sent to Assemblyman
William Stanton and Congressman
Don Edwards stating our feelings,"
Lowe added. "We also plan to seek
support from the Teamsters and the
Longshoremen Union, if they are in
volved."
The SCPV is also considering a citi
zen's suit against the use permit
granted the UTC by the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission in No
vember, 1963. The permit does not
mention any other use of the Shingle

Valley property other than a "re
search, development and testing cen
ter for rocket propellants and racket
propulsion systems." The permit pro
hibits the intentional detonation of
high explosiives or testing of nuclear
engines.
Lowe emphasized that in challeng
ing the validity of the permit their
goal was not to simply cause the
transfer of the plant. "Wo want to
point out the political nature of the
weapons used against insurgent peas
ants," he said. "It is the kind of
weapons, anti-personnel and crop-de
struction, which we disapprove of,"
he added.
Napalm-producing plants which the
National Coordinating Committee
will consider protesting include the
Tennessee Gas Transmission Co.,
which has a factory in Berkeley, the
Martin Marietta Corp., the Napco
Chemical Co., and the Leffingwell
Chemical Corporation.
