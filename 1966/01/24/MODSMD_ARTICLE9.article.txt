# MONK-COLTRANE CONCERT
## Jazz Puzzles, Pleases 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Thelonius Monk Quartet and
the John Coltrane Quintet — oops,
Octet — performed to a capacity
crowd of 1609 variously delighted,
mystified and bored people in Memo
rial Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
The Monk group played first, after
a half-hour delay caused by transpor
tation difficulties. The set was short
-—too short—but contained some ex
cellent Monk piano work (and danc
ing, sort of), some average Charlie
Rouse, on tenor, and two fine bass
solos by Larry Gales. Drummer Ben
Riley provided crisp and sensitive
backing throughout. The quartet led
off with a humorous treatment of
"Lulu's Back in Town" and all per
formed well, with Gales' melodic and
deep-toned bass excursions a high
light.
Then they played two Monk
standards, "Hackensack" and "Epis
trophy." Monk, taking shorter solos
than is usual, still showed off his in
credibly sharp ear for rhythmic in
novation and strategic dissonance.
The audience seemed pleasantly sur

prised at the rapport the pianist es
tablished almost immediately. The
response of the crowd was generous
and appreciative. Monk left the stand
after those three numbers, but the
applause brought him back for a solo
ballad rendition, by turns haunting
and beautiful, humorous and wry.
Then it was Coltrane's turn. He
showed up with two drummers (El
vin Jones and Rashied Ali), two bass
ists (Jimmy Garrison and Donald
Garrett) a tenor (Pharoah Saunders),
a conga drummer, or something,
dressed in black snakeskin pants and
jacket and calling itself Juno, and an
unidentified and inaudible female pia
nist.
Five Numbers
The octet played four or five sepa
rate numbers, but after the initial
statement of the melodies, often ab
breviated, the tunes were sublimated
by the polyrhythmic and cacophonic
group improvisation.
What they played was seldom music,
in the conventional sense. Coltrane
occasionally evidenced flashes of bril
liant technique, but he gave himself
little solo space and much of his work
was buried by the thunder of the three
percussionists.
Jones and Ali work together aston
ishingly well. Jones is demoniacal
when he plays; he throws up throbbing
waves and counter-waves of rhythms.
This technique, however, is put to best
advantage behind a competent solo, of
which there were few.
The musical highlight of the long set
was Jimmy Garrison's long and intri
cate bass solo, providing a rich and
delicate introduction to the group's
rendition of "Afro-Blue." The solo
could have been shorter, but there was
much beauty in it. Coltrane was effec
tive on "My Favorite Things."
Their elaborate percussion, the an
tagonism to ward anything approach
ing conventional European chord struc
ture, the apparent chaos at times—
this is not American jazz in any recog
nizable form. It is African music, or
neo-African, influenced by what its
practitioners have learned and have
iearnend to avoid musically, and by
the way in which they have been hated
and have learned to hate, sociological
ly. It is sometimes interesting, sporad
ically exciting, rhythmically compell
ing—but, sadly, most often dull.
