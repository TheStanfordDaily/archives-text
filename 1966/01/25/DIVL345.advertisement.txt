If is one thing to quiet the symptom, another to cure the disease. To wash
the body is not to cleanse the soul. Sin is never just what we do, but what we
are. To reform the outer man and leave untouched the human heart is to build
the kind of hypocrites Jesus Christ so soundly condemned: "Woe to you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate,
but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Phariseel First
cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyrocritesl For you are like whitewashed
tombs, which outwardly apppear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's
bones and all uncleanness. So you also appear righteous to men, but within
you are full of iniquity and hypocrisy" (Matthew 23:25-28).
To hypocrites, and liars, to the immoral and adulterous, in fact to all of us,
Greek and Jew, the Bible says, "God has concluded all under sin, that he may
have mercy upon all" (Romans 11:32), and"the wages of sin is death" (Ro
mans 6:23).
In the perfect sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, God has bridged for us a
Way reconciling His holiness with our sinfulness, putting away sin by the
sacrifice of Himself. The Bible is Good News because it says to you: God has
reconciled and forgiven you, "the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ
our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
Why not start today on that New Life which God offers you today? "For we
ourselves were once foolish, disobendient, led astray, slaves to various passions
and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating
one another; but when goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior ap
peared, He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in
virtue of His own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the
Holy Spirit, which He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
jo that we might be justified by His grace and become heirs in hope of eternal
life" (Titus 3:3-7).

bones and all uncleanness. So you also appear righteous to men, but within
you are full of iniquity and hypocrisy" (Matthew 23:25-28).
To hypocrites, and liars, to the immoral and adulterous, in fact to all of us,
Greek and Jew, the Bible says, "God has concluded all under sin, that he may
have mercy upon all" (Romans 11:32), and"the wages of sin is death" (Ro
mans 6:23).
In the perfect sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, God has bridged for us a
Way reconciling His holiness with our sinfulness, putting away sin by the
sacrifice of Himself. The Bible is Good News because it says to you: God has
reconciled and forgiven you, "the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ
our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
Why not start today on that New Life which God offers you today? "For we
ourselves were once foolish, disobendient, led astray, slaves to various passions
and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating
one another; but when goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior ap
peared, He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in
virtue of His own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the
Holy Spirit, which He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
jo that we might be justified by His grace and become heirs in hope of eternal
life" (Titus 3:3-7).

If is one thing to quiet the symptom, another to cure the disease. To wash
the body is not to cleanse the soul. Sin is never just what we do, but what we
are. To reform the outer man and leave untouched the human heart is to build
the kind of hypocrites Jesus Christ so soundly condemned: "Woe to you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate,
but inside they are full of extortion and rapacity. You blind Phariseel First
cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hyrocritesl For you are like whitewashed
tombs, which outwardly apppear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's
bones and all uncleanness. So you also appear righteous to men, but within
you are full of iniquity and hypocrisy" (Matthew 23:25-28).
