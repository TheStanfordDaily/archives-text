Program is getting to know and work with some

believes he has gained tremendously from this exposure and experience is
Larry Moore, a Product Design engineer.
After receiving his B.M.E. in February, 1964, Larry joined our College
Graduate Program and began work in brake design. Stimulating assign
ments followed in product evaluation and disc brake development. Later,
he learned production techniques while supervising one phase of the
Mustang assembly line operations. An assignment in our Truck Sales
Promotion and Training Department added still another dimension to his
experience. The "big picture" of product development was brought into
focus for Larry when he became associated with Thunderbird Product
Planning. From there he moved to the Special Vehicles Section . . . into
the exciting world of high-performance cars!
Currently, Larry Moore is on leave of absence, studying to acquire his
M.B.A. degree at Michigan State. He feels—and rightly so—that we're
100 percent behind his desire to improve his educational background.
