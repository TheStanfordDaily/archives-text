# Hormones Alter Rats' Sex
## 
### 
Sex hormones administered to
rats in infancy have altered
their sexual behavior for a life
time.
This conclusion, reported
Wednesday by a Stanford medi
cal school investigator, may help
humans learn why behavior is
permanently affected by early
experiences, or more specifically
how the central nervous system
regulates the pattern of behav
ior predominantly shown by an
individual.
They may even explain in part
why one person develops a ca
pacity to resist disease while
another develops ulcers or mi
graine headaches under the
pressures of living.
Scientists believe that hor
mones, present during critical
periods of development, condi
tion the organism's central ner
vous system to produce perma
nent changes adulthood.
The study was described by
Dr. Seymour Levine, associate
professor of psychiatry, at a
public lecture titled "Progress
in Medicine" sponsored by the
Stanford University School of
Medicine.
Dr L.evine observed that rats
at birth can become either male
or female. Doctors can operate
on the sex-determining mecha
nism in newborn rats to make

a potential male rat become a fe
male, and vice versa. But this
pattern can only be changed
shortly after birth.
The studies, according to Dr.
Levine, have established that
reproductive hormones exert a
profound influence on the nerv
ous system of the newborn rat.
They cause the brain to be or
ganized into a male or female
pattern of hormone release.

These patterns are part of the
"hormonostat" of the central
nervous system which controls
the rate of hormone production
and release or both.
The results are only the be
ginning of what will eventually
be a long list of interactions
among the neuroendocrine sys
tems at all stages of animal and
human development, Dr. Levine
concluded.
