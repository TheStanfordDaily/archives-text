chylus does not reproduce our
external environment, the audi

lel between the Greek myth and
the modem world.
"Prometheus has brought man
the gift of fire. With this gift,
which is the gift of knowledge,
man develops from an unthink
ing animal to the potential mas
ter of his environment.
"But with knowledge comes
power, and a terrifying sense of
responsibility. Power includes
the possibility of destroying as
well as creating, and is danger
ous when used rashly or indis
criminately.
"At a time when we possess
nuclear fire, the conflict Aeschy
lus dramatized is astonishingly,
if not alarmingly, contempo
rary."

Towering some thirty-odd feet
above the chorus is the Prome
theus of the Stanford Repetory's
production of Aeschylus's play,
"Prometheus Bound." Begining
a ten-day run at Mem Aud on
February 2, Stanford's produc
tion is using a new translation
of the famed Greek tragedy.
Prometheus Bound, Aeschylus'
classic portrayal of the struggle
between right and might, will
be presented by the Stanford
Repertory Theater February 2-
12 at 8:30 p. m. in Memorial Au
ditorium.
It will be the first profession
al production of the play in the
United States and the premier
production of the V e 11 a c o 11
translation.
In a 2000-ye a r-old dramatic
style the chorus will wear Afri
can facial masks and costumes
made from charred nylon net,
sea shells, leather, styrofoam,
and fiberglass resin.
Their movements on the stage,
dominated by a 32-f o o t-h i g h
rock, will be stylized in the
Greek tradition. The play fea
tures former Broadway actor
John Karlen as Prometheus and
Juliet Randall as 10.
Director Erik Vos is visiting
artistic director at Stanford and
a leading Dutch stage director.
He is visiting the US on a Ful
bright Scholarship. Earlier this
season he directed the Reper
tory in Moliere's "That Scoun
drel Scapin."
Commenting on the play, Vos
says: "While the theater of Aes
chylus does not reproduce our
external environment, the audi
ence will discover a close paral
lel between the Greek myth and
the modem world.
"Prometheus has brought man
the gift of fire. With this gift,
which is the gift of knowledge,
man develops from an unthink
ing animal to the potential mas
ter of his environment.
"But with knowledge comes
power, and a terrifying sense of
responsibility. Power includes
the possibility of destroying as
well as creating, and is danger
ous when used rashly or indis
criminately.
"At a time when we possess
nuclear fire, the conflict Aeschy
lus dramatized is astonishingly,
if not alarmingly, contempo
rary."

Stanford students of $1.00 per
