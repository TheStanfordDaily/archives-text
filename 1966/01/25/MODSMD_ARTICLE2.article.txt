# Tresidder Opens Wide For 'Lovin' Spoonful'
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
"The Lovin' Spoonful" dubiously
recognized by Newsweek, as the "lat
est mutation in the biology of the
big beat," will electronically combine
the clamor of guitars, autoharp, and
harmonica for a dance Friday night
in Tresidder.
The group, whose hits include "Do
You Believe in Magic" and, more re
cently, "You Didn't Have to Be So
Nice," will play from 9 to 12 in the
Grill Room downstairs. Tickets, for
$1.50 a person, will be on sale at the
Tresidder Box Office all week.
Sudden Fame
The Spoonful's rise to fame has
been sudden during the last few
months. They were the first rock 'n
roll group to be featured the hungry
i. Following that historic perform
ance, Ralph Gleason of the Chronicle
wrote: "Their music is an expression
of freedom... a protest against the
formalization of music ... an expres
sion of a new age."
The members of the group have
unusual histories. Zal Yanovsky, from
Toronto, Canada, started playing folk
music on his guitar at fifteen, quit
ting high school the following year.
Before joining the Spoonful, Zal spent
ten months in Israel, followed by sev
en months working in a laudromat,
surviving a flaming plane crash dur
ing his travels.
John Sebastian, born and bred in
Greenwich Village, has tinkered with
the guitar, autoharp, and harmonica
since he was twelve. After spending
five years in Italy, he worked as a
guitar - maker's apprentice, in jug

bands, and with some young city
country blues musicians.
Rust Allergy
He retired temporarily because of
the increasing commercialism of folk
music and worked in a boat yard
painting hulls with rust-proof paint,
until he discovered he was allergic to
the compound. He headed straight
back for the Village, where he met
Zal.
Steve Boone, related to the famous
Daniel of the same name, plays the
bass guitar in the group. After an
accident that placed him in traction
for two months, he started his musi
cal career. Like the other members
of the group, Steve was in Europe
and claims he "was knocked out and
awed by the musicians there."
Joe Butler, from Glen Cove, Long
Island, began beating the drums at
thirteen. Following college he played
in several night clubs until he met
Steve Boone. The two moved to the
Village, and the group was completed.
After a disasterous first stand at
the Night Owl Cafe, they moved un
derground to the basement of the
Albert Hotel where their only ap
plause came from the kitchen staff
who praised the group's funny hats,
adopted to protect the musicians
from falling plaster. They returned
with new confidence for a successful
run at the Night Owl. The latest
chapter to their story will be added
this Friday at Stanford.

Tresidder Box Office all week.
Sudden Fame
The Spoonful's rise to fame has
been sudden during the last few
months. They were the first rock 'n
roll group to be featured the hungry
i. Following that historic perform
ance, Ralph Gleason of the Chronicle
wrote: "Their music is an expression
of freedom... a protest against the
formalization of music ... an expres
sion of a new age."
The members of the group have
unusual histories. Zal Yanovsky, from
Toronto, Canada, started playing folk
music on his guitar at fifteen, quit
ting high school the following year.
Before joining the Spoonful, Zal spent
ten months in Israel, followed by sev
en months working in a laudromat,
surviving a flaming plane crash dur
ing his travels.
John Sebastian, born and bred in
Greenwich Village, has tinkered with
the guitar, autoharp, and harmonica
since he was twelve. After spending
five years in Italy, he worked as a
guitar - maker's apprentice, in jug

bands, and with some young city
country blues musicians.
Rust Allergy
He retired temporarily because of
the increasing commercialism of folk
music and worked in a boat yard
painting hulls with rust-proof paint,
until he discovered he was allergic to
the compound. He headed straight
back for the Village, where he met
Zal.
Steve Boone, related to the famous
Daniel of the same name, plays the
bass guitar in the group. After an
accident that placed him in traction
for two months, he started his musi
cal career. Like the other members
of the group, Steve was in Europe
and claims he "was knocked out and
awed by the musicians there."
Joe Butler, from Glen Cove, Long
Island, began beating the drums at
thirteen. Following college he played
in several night clubs until he met
Steve Boone. The two moved to the
Village, and the group was completed.
After a disasterous first stand at
the Night Owl Cafe, they moved un
derground to the basement of the
Albert Hotel where their only ap
plause came from the kitchen staff
who praised the group's funny hats,
adopted to protect the musicians
from falling plaster. They returned
with new confidence for a successful
run at the Night Owl. The latest
chapter to their story will be added
this Friday at Stanford.
"The Lovin' Spoonful" dubiously
recognized by Newsweek, as the "lat
est mutation in the biology of the
big beat," will electronically combine
the clamor of guitars, autoharp, and
harmonica for a dance Friday night
in Tresidder.
The group, whose hits include "Do
You Believe in Magic" and, more re
cently, "You Didn't Have to Be So
Nice," will play from 9 to 12 in the
Grill Room downstairs. Tickets, for
$1.50 a person, will be on sale at the
Tresidder Box Office all week.
