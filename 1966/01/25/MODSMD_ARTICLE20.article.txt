## 
### 
The U.S. Public Health Ser
vice has awarded two research
grants to Dr. Leroy A. P e s c h,
Stanford School of Medicine, and
to James C. Bliss, of the Stan
ford Electronic Laboratory.
The purpose of Dr. Pesch's
grant of $55,544 "is to establish
a laboratory to continue the in
vestigation of a mechanism for
the biological regulation of hep
atic metabolism and to corrolate
this by chemical events with his
topathic changes of hepatic in
jury." Pesch's work "is directed
to the better understanding of
ways in which changes in cellu

lar structure and function regu
late normal cellular metabolic ac
tivities and initiate cell injury."
Mr. Bliss's grant of $83,149 is
for pursuing experiments in tac
tal reading studies. He received
the grant as a result of his work
exploring the ability of people
to read using touch.
He was disappointed that the
grant did not include further de
velopment of a reading device
which he had worked on previ
ously along with John Linville.
The grant is designated to ex
tend two years. A sum of $47,984
will be allotted for the first year
and $35,165 for the second.
