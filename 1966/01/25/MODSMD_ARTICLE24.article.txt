### 
NEW YORK (AP)—Ken Boy
er, seven-time All-Star third
baseman and the National
League's Most Valuable Player
two years ago, signed his con
tract Monday with the New
York Mets.
The 35-year-old infielder, ac
quired from St. Louis last Oc
tober after a poor season with
the Cardinals, becomes the high
est-paid player for baseball's

least successful team — with a
salary estimated at $65,000.
Same Salary
George Weiss, president of the
Mets, said "Despite his disap
pointing season Boyer will re
ceive the same salary he got in
St. Louis. I don't believe a play
er of his caliber should be cut
after one poor year.
"We came to terms quickly—
after one five-minute conversa
tion."
1964 MVP
After playing a leading role
in the Cards' pennant-winning
drive in 1965, starring in the
World Series triumph over the
New York Yankees, and being
named MVP, Boyer slumped last
year. He was bothered by a bad
back and hit only .260, with 13
homes and 75 runs batted in. In
10 previous major league sea
sons, Boyer had compiled a .296
batting mark with an average
of 25 homers and 93 RBI. He
batted .296 in 1964, hitting 24
homers and knocking in 119
runs. His highest average for
the Cards was .329, in 1961.
