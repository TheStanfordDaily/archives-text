# JV's Lone Bright Spot In Rugby Weekend
## 
### 
Stanford's powerful Junior
Varsity provided the only glitter
in a dark weekend picture of rug
by by soundly womping the Pe
ninsula Ramblers J.V.'s, 22-3.
The initial two tries were
scored by Monty Orr, each com
ing as the climax to lengthy pass
ing rushes. The hard running of
Leon Hartvickson and Tim Abe
na accounted for three scores in
the escond half.
Aggressive play and quick
thinking by Tony Jerenianson
rewarded him with a three point
try. Â»
Ramblers Weak
The Ramblers put up only a
very feeble attack. They never
had the strength or momentum
to push across a score under
their own steam .Their only tal
ly came on a penalty kick.

The scrum must be awarded a
major share of the laurels for
their strong defensive play. Al
though the scrum was out
jumped in the line-outs, they
simply pushed the Ramblers in
the set scrums and the loose
rucks.
A line-out is similar to a jump
ball in basketball except the
eight scrum men from each
side participate. Line-outs are
used to start play when a ball
goes out of bounds.
Set scrums restart play after
minor infractions on the field.
A. loose ruck is an organized
congregation over a loose ball
after a tackle.
Next week the JV's play the
Highland Rugby Club here at 3
p.m.
