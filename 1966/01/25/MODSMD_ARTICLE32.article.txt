# AP Names Dodgers Team Of The Year
## 
### 
The Los Angeles Dodgers, win
ners of 13 straight games in a
late-season surge that enabled
them to capture baseball's Na
tional League pennant, were
named the Team of the Year for
1965 Tuesday in the annual As
sociated Press poll.
The Dodgers, who also won
the World Series, collected 12
first-place votes and 499 points
in the balloting of 33 sports
writers and sportscasters.
Michigan State's football team,
champion of the Big Ten, was
second with 55 first-place votes
and 287 points. The UCLA Bru
ins, basketball's national college
titleholders, were third with
251 points followed by the Bos
ton Celtics, pro basketball
champs, with 221.
Points were awarded on a basis
of three for a first-place vote,
two for second and one for
third.
The Dodgers, who finished in
a sixth-place deadlock in 1964,
led the NL race for most of the
1965 campaign. However, on
Sept. 15, they dropped in to
third place, 4*Â£ games behind
first-place San Francisco.
UCLA Wins
The Bruins' basketball team
captured the NCAA title for the
second consecutive year. UCLA
won 28 games and lost two and
was 14-0 in its conference, The
Athletic Association of Western
Universities.
The Twins, surprise American
League baseball champions,
were fifth in the voting. Then
came four football teams. They

were the Arkansas Razorbacks,
Southwest Conference leaders,
and three National League clubs,
the champion Green Bay Pack
ers, Cleveland Browns and Chi
cago Bears.
