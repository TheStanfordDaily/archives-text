## Secrecy, Stalemate And A United, Neutral Vietnam 
### 
If anything useful is to come
of it all, the governments con
cerned in the Vietnamese War
are quite right in keeping secret
whatever diplomatic action may
now be taking place.
We may read this fact to mean
that the war is at present at a
military stalemate and that there
is a hesitation everywhere be
fore accepting a decision to en
ter the next cycle of escalation.
For it is bound to be more terri
ble than anything we have yet
seen.
Stalemate Inevitable
The stalemate consists in the
certainty that — without gigan
tic csealation — the United
States cannot be expelled from
Vietnam or the countryside of
Vietnam regained by the gov
ernment of Saigon.
On the other hand, the United
States cannot begin to hope that
with any conceivable reinforce
ments, which can in the forsee
able future be landed in South
Vietnam, it can seek out and de
stroy the Viet Cong. The United
States cannot put Saigon in con
trol of the countryside and make
it the ruler of the whole of South
Vietnam.
This stalemate means that nei
ther side has won or lost the
war, that neither side has any
credible prospect of winning the
war. A stalemate of this kind is
bound to generate diplomatic ac
tivity to bring the fighting to
an end. The stalemate and the
diplomatic activity can be ex
pected to continue unelss they
or we raise the tempo of vio
lence to a new level.
What the world is looking for,
what, I venture to say, the great
majority of our people are ex
pecting is an honorable truce.
This will have to be a truce
which conofrms with the reali
ties of the military situation.
Whether or not one thinks that
the war has been wisely con
ducted in 1965, there is no doubt,
I believe, that the President is
still seeking the kind of settle
ment which would reflect a mili
tary stalemate.
Majority Trusts LB.J
There is a large majority
which trusts the President to
find a decent way out of a war
which is intensely unpopular.
As President Eisenhower found
in Korea, the diplomatic problem
of making peace out of a stale
mate is a difficult one. Both
sides have to be persuaded fully
that they cannot get better

terms by renewing and intensi
fying the fighting.
Now, in the Vietnamese War,
neither side has as yet used more
than a portion of the military
power at its command. The
United States has made only a
limited use of its air power, and
besides that, there is our terri
ble nucelar power.
Our Asian adversaries, also,
have not used all of their power,
essentially their enormous man
power. Even Hanoi has engaged
only a portion of its excellent
army, the capacity of China to
expand the war across its land
frontiers remains intact, and, in
addition, there is the very great
nuclear power of the Soviet Un
ion which might become engaged
if the war became a final show
down on the battlefield between
Communist and anti-Communist
states.
Since a stalemated truce
means that there are big forces
still unengaged, there will be
factions on both sides which
will insist that one more fling—
and after that still another fling
—will lead to a victory in the
war.
A Matter of Definition
As a matter of fact, in a
stalemated truce, the question of
who, if anybody, has won or lost
is a matter of how each bellige
rent has defined its war aims. In
the Korean War, when Gen. Mac-
Arthur by the Inchon landing
had cleared South Korea up to
the 38th parallel, we in the West
had won the original war. When
our war aims were escalated to
include North Korea and Gen.
Mac Arthur marched to the fron
tiers of China and provoked the
Chinese to intervent, we were in
a wholly different war. It was
a long and bloody business be
fore a stalemate was reached.
The problem we shall face,
now or after the next cycle of
violence, is how to make the
best settlement that a stalemate
makes possible. We shall have
to make our political aims con
form with our military invest
ment, and we shall have to avoid
raising our political aims to a
point where they demand an im
possbile level of military en
gagement.
Almost certainly, the most
we can get out of any military
investment we make in South
east Asia will be, sooner or later,
a united Vietnam which, in keep
ing with its ancient fear of Chi
nese conquest, cultivates its re
lations with the Soviet Union
and practices a policy of peace
able coexistence with the West.
