# Disrupt Or Disband?
## 
### 
As key proposals for reforming University
policies on religion, liquor, open house hours
and the Wilbur Hall system move slowly from
the formulation stage to the final phases of the
decision - making process, there has been a dis
tressing tendency toward polarization and non
communication at a time when compromise and
rational discussion are needed more than ever.
Ten days ago, Speaker Jay Kadane told the
Legislature that he had reluctantly come to
the conclusion that "student power within the
University, to the extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat of disruption
of life on the campus and its attendant bad
publicity for the University."
More recently, certain administrators have
reiterated the proposition that the Trustees
are empowered by law —and their own tem
perament —to make the decisions as to how this
University will be run. One high administrator
even suggested that if students were to be
adamant about some issue, to the extent that
Mr. Kadane's speech implied, then the Trus
tees would sooner disband the University than
bow to student pressure.
Indeed, it is our understanding that one of
the major objections to a liberalization of Stan
ford's "non-sectarian" religious policy —as
stated at the Trustee meeting of December —
was that several Trustees resented student
pressure on this issue — and others. If this
charge of undue student pressure were true —
and if one considers the last two year's efforts
on this issue and the support the proposals for
refonn have in all parts of the community, it
is patently absurd —it would still be an irrele
vant argument to use in a meeting of sup
posedly learned and rational minds.

Both of the above-stated positions are tech
nically correct: the Trustees have the legal
power to do what they wish; the students can
only protest.
However, both sides seem to be forgetting
the fact that this is supposed to be a communi
ty —a community of scholars, if you will. And
supposedly scholars use reason instead of pole
micism. One communicates by way of discus
sion, not by way of disruption or disbandment
of the University.
Communication though, seems to be some
what more difficult to effect today. Twice in
the last two months, the Legislature instructed
the student representatives to the Committee
of 15 to ask that committee to recommend "an
appropriate and knowledgeable committee . . .
to make a comprehensive study of Wilbur." So
far the Committee has not met. We do not
think —as Mr. Kadane said in his speech—that
the "value" of the Committee needs to be re
considered, at least not for the reason that he
implied; namely, the Committee's refusal to
agree with some student's objections to the
closure of Union. Yet the Committee of 15 is
failing—in an important way —in that it meets
infrequently. It waits for the crisis to occur,
perhaps in hope that impending confrontations
will just dissolve.
It is time —unfortunately it may be past time
—for the Committee to try preventive discus
sion.
More importantly, it is time for all those con
cerned —from the more concerned student ac
tivists to the more recalitrant Trustees —to re
open the lines of communication and discuss
the important issues confronting us before the
lines are drawn, the decisions made, and the
reactions inevitable.
