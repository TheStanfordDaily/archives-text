## Re: Monk—Coltrane—'Is That Where It's At?' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Try as I might, I have been
unable to resolve a question
which has plagued me since Sun
day afternoon: "Was the Thelo
nius Monk-John Coltrane con
cert a giant put-on?
I arrived approximately ten
minutes before the concert was
scheduled to begin, expecting to
reach my seat just before the
downbeat, but found instead
that the doors had not been
opened. When I finally reached
my seat, I was subjected to the
same emcee mediocrity which
has plagued the jazz series all
year, but was able to pass off
my irritation in expectation of
a stimulating musical experi
ence.
The Thelonius Monk Quartet,
which left the stand after what
seemed to be an unusually brief
appearance, was followed by the
John Coltrane aggregation. Not
ing that several members were
not listed on the program, I
presume they joined the group
at a Bayshore Freeway incident
prior to the concert reportedly
involving six squad cars.
Although I have followed Mr.
Coltrane's career closely and
was expecting free jazz, I was
not prepared for what I heard.
Two bassists and two drummers
completely overpowered the pi
anist, who after briefly intro
ducing the first number was not
heard from again. And as if
these were not sufficient to pro
pel the soloists, another tenor
saxophonist was added (for con
trast, I presume). These six
were capable of smothering any
thing Mr. Coltrane chose to
emit, but for good measure and
perhaps for inspiration an Afri
can drummer was featured in
addition.
The "other" tenor saxophon
ist, whose trips to the micro
phone were fortunately limited,
seemed to derive musical inspir
ation from his thumb which
must have been smashed some
where in the mechanism of his
saxophone. The pain of his mu
sical pleadings was acknowl
edged by the others who flailed
their instruments more and
more furiously, and in this man
ner led a bewildered audience
on a "trip" through a barrier
of sound.
Mr. Coltrane's role in all this,
aside from brooding in the back
ground, was to signal when it
was time to return to earth,
which he did by returning to

the microphone and once again
attempting to penetrate the im
pentrable. Having expected to
spend an afternoon listening to
brilliant musicians stimulate
one another (as free jazz is theo
retically supposed to do), I could
feel only frustration at being
unable to extract even the voice
of Mr. Coltrane from the bar
rage of sound.
Which leads me to ask again,
"Was it a giant put-on?" Or to
use the vernacular, "Is that
really where it's at?"

• Hoskins A-Go-Go
Editor, The Daily:
I had the opportunity to read
an article in The Daily about
the girls' migration from Union
Residence to Hoskins House in
Escondido Village. As a resident
of Escondido I would like to
make several comments that I
believe necessary to straighten
things out.
One girl said, "I like being in
the world of regular people."
Well, if this is so, they should
find, very quickly, another place
to live, because their "regular"
people do not correspond to our
regular people. We were a quiet
and peaceful community before
they moved. Now we find our
selves living next to an Insane
Asylum. We cannot have peace
of mind anymore. Our nightly
rest is disturbed by the wild par
ties going on, bottles thrown
from the building, people
screaming in the street at 2
a. m., our parking place taken
by their cars, honking horns
when we are trying to study,
and so on.
Last Saturday night (Jan. 15),
during one of the parties, some
stupid people coming out of the
building set the fire alarm go
ing. In minutes the area was
crowded with firemen and po
licemen and one quarter of Es
condido was awakened by their
"funny joke." It is time the re
sponsible authorities take some
action in order to stop this con
tinuous carnival.
Another girl said, "Now I
more of a sense of perspective."
The only perspective they have
shown a taste for, so far, is for
a Go-Go Merry-Go-Round.
Their privileges end where
our (that is, the healthy people
of Escondido) rights begin. I
do not care if they and their
community develop a peculiar

idea of living. But go have your
stinking fun Elsewhere, not in
Escondido.
For all these reasons we are
hoping the University Authori
ties will put an end to this un
pleasant situation. We are hop
ing that for the future long
months of hard studying we will
be able to have a normal life
again.

• Too Much Sex
Editor, The Daily
I wish to cancel my subscrip
tion to The Daily. I am thor
ough bored by the prime space
devoted to your preoccupation
with sexuality. This uninter
rupted drivel and infantile repe
tition now takes your daily out
put on a direct line from my
mailbox to my wastebasket.
We parents were led to be
lieve, from your ads, that a copy
in our home would in some
small measure bring our chil
dren closer. Unless one's child is
pursuing a course in sexuality
ad nauseum, this could not be
further from the truth.
Trying to analyze the reasons
for this unseemly preoccupation,
I find it nothing more than a
blatant effort ot embarrass the
conscientious student, the fac
ulty, trustees, and loyal friends
of the University. I suppose the
homily, do not bite the hand
that feeds you, is lost on the
prodigious intellect of these cre
ators of a new and wonderful
society. Let me remind them
that the deficit in their tuition
is made up in great measure
by donations from people whose
moral convictions are not unlike
mine. It is very difficult to raise
money for a university, it is im
possible to raise money for a
brothel.
My cancellation of this sub
scription terminates a rather
unpleasant association with the
didactic sufferers, as the late
Mr. Bernard Shaw so aptly de
scribed them, "a feverish little
clod of ailments and grievances
complaining that the world will
not devote itself to making you
happy." I am sure there are
some good things, perhaps even
some great things being at the
University, how I would enjoy
reading about them.
Until such time as you prefer
to accentuate the positive and
relegate the trivia to the hack
pages where it belongs, I shall

return to my wooly thinking
about the University and its con
tribution to society, and be
grateful that your brand of raw
realism is not slung across my
face every day.

Editor, The Daily
Jim is a nice guy, all right,
but he stutters whenever he
talks about anything exciting.
Like sex. Especially Stanford
sex.
"D, D, Denny," he remarked
this afternoon, "You sh, s, shud
da been at m, my party."
I'd attended his parties before
and I knew they had nothing
to do with sex, but he was stut
tering like crazy so my answer
was the obvious one: "Why?"
"We h, had a, a, boy and g,
girl and s, s, sexual rights fer,
fer, fer, form."
"Oh?" a spark of curiosity
split th rough my boredom.
"Just what sexual rights did
they perform?' '
"N, not rites," he said.
"Rights."
"Not rites," I said. "Writes.
Well that's a hellova lot less in
teresting. What did they write
about?"
"They w, were right a, ab,
about everyth, thing. J, j, just
like Hefner. He's s, s, s, some
pamphlets they g, gave out."
I took the material, glanced
at it, and included it in my next
letter home. I don't like tc make
decisions on these delicate mat
ters without a dash of parental
guidance.
Mommy wrote back that
"Shame is filling our house, that
our son, whom we wanted to
enter the priesthood, should con
taminate this noble nation's post
office with such trash." She con
tinued that I'd better not get
any nice girls in trouble with
these ideas (mom lets the evil
old sluts take care of them
selves) and further, I'd bloody
well better not get any contra
ceptives from that communist
health center. Or from any place
for that matter; remember, af
ter all, what the V.C. said (is
our private correspondence V.C.
stands for Vatican Council, not
Viet Cong, but I was unaware
that either one had gotten
around to making any pro
nouncements on contraceptives).
After pondering her reply, I

decided her position was too con
servative (too far right)? so I
rifled off a telegram telling her
that the two directives were mu
tually exclusive.
That was a week ago and I
haven't heard from her yet, but
this afternoon two big-biceped
men came to repossess my Con
firmation robe. And my car.
Independence was beginning
to cost, so I hustled down to the
campus to see what I had won.
I sat in front of Tresidder for
three straight hours winking at
every skirt that went by. All I
got was a black eye. I never could
figure out why those crazy guys
from India don't wear pants like
the rest of us.
After the swelling had gone

down, I could hazily make out
the desk the Sexual Right For
um had set up by the ost Office.
I suavely breezed up to the not
too-sharp broad who was man
ning it and said, as studly as I
could, "Okey honey. You got me
into this. Lets make it."
She handed me three manu
scripts discussing legalized abor
tion, found out I wasn't in the
market for an "unbutton" but
ton, and told me to get lost.
A sad but wiser man, I strug
gled home to draft a repentent
letter to the folks and get a cou
ple vicarious thrills from the
nudies in the new Playboy.
