## Napalm Pickets To Force Analysis Of Commitment 
### 
As long as war, or better,
whatever abstract conception we
have of a particular war, can re
main disenchanted from the
members of the society partici
pating in that war, there can be
only a vague notion as to the ma
chinery and spirit of such an
act.
The war in Vietnam is curi
ous to the extent that, although
it is an existential fact, few of
us know about it. Theories of
international conflict and nation
al revolution can be taught in
the classroom, yet involvement
in the actual proceedings is lack
ing. In short, the citizen at home
lacks any definite feeling of re
sponsibility or participation in
an event to which his repre
sentatives claim he si commit
ted.
Silence Is Consent
Yet every citizen is, in fact,
committed; silence is the most
notorious of supporting acts, and
silence forces democratically
elected officials, who hear little
or nothing to the contrary, to
give their full support to Presi
dent Johnson.
Another group which, through
its voiced silence and its prac
tical support, must be said to
be committed, is that group pro
ducing war products. The Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, which has heretofore

directed its efforts towards
arousing the public, now in
tends to picket the United Tech
nology Center, in Sunnyvale, a
firm which produces napalm. Ini
tially, at least, this seems to be
an attempt ot awaken the con
sciences of those essential to
the manufacture of one of the
most atrocious and indiscrimi
nate devices being used in the
Vietnam war.
One cannot pass off the pro
duction-line men as mere cogs
in the wheel when their partic
ipation is just as meaningful as
the participation of those for
mulating strategy: for in a
structural analysis, people main
tain the war. Without people,
the war cannot continue.
A Symbolic Purpose
Even if the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam con
vinces no man to leave his job
because he is producing an im
moral product, the gesture of
picketing has a deeper and more
symbolic purpose: to force the
production-line worker to assess
his real participation in the war
and to review his own conscience
as to what napalm already does
mean to those who suffer from
it.
The responsibility for the war,
which more and more people
seem to be beginning to con
demn, lies not only with the dip
lomat, but also with the soldier
and the weapon-maker. Neither
an idea, nor nationalism alone
continues a war. If any individual
or organization can succeed in
making us aware of our posi
tion for or against the war, then
it is our corresponding duty to
make our position publicly
known.
I think there is less and less
disagreement that the war in
Vietnam is dirty, expensive, and
a growing fiasco. The Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
is, if it indeed does picket the
United Technology Center, serv
ing an important purpose of
clarification. An end to the pro
duction of napalm, or, more
realistically, an analysis of pur
pose, is late in coming but an
optimistic step forward.

The Daily is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
ever, letters should not exceed
300 words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on 65-space
lines and double-spaced.

give their full support to Presi
dent Johnson.
Another group which, through
its voiced silence and its prac
tical support, must be said to
be committed, is that group pro
ducing war products. The Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, which has heretofore

directed its efforts towards
arousing the public, now in
tends to picket the United Tech
nology Center, in Sunnyvale, a
firm which produces napalm. Ini
tially, at least, this seems to be
an attempt ot awaken the con
sciences of those essential to
the manufacture of one of the
most atrocious and indiscrimi
nate devices being used in the
Vietnam war.
One cannot pass off the pro
duction-line men as mere cogs
in the wheel when their partic
ipation is just as meaningful as
the participation of those for
mulating strategy: for in a
structural analysis, people main
tain the war. Without people,
the war cannot continue.
A Symbolic Purpose
Even if the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam con
vinces no man to leave his job
because he is producing an im
moral product, the gesture of
picketing has a deeper and more
symbolic purpose: to force the
production-line worker to assess
his real participation in the war
and to review his own conscience
as to what napalm already does
mean to those who suffer from
it.
The responsibility for the war,
which more and more people
seem to be beginning to con
demn, lies not only with the dip
lomat, but also with the soldier
and the weapon-maker. Neither
an idea, nor nationalism alone
continues a war. If any individual
or organization can succeed in
making us aware of our posi
tion for or against the war, then
it is our corresponding duty to
make our position publicly
known.
I think there is less and less
disagreement that the war in
Vietnam is dirty, expensive, and
a growing fiasco. The Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
is, if it indeed does picket the
United Technology Center, serv
ing an important purpose of
clarification. An end to the pro
duction of napalm, or, more
realistically, an analysis of pur
pose, is late in coming but an
optimistic step forward.

As long as war, or better,
whatever abstract conception we
have of a particular war, can re
main disenchanted from the
members of the society partici

only a vague notion as to the ma
chinery and spirit of such an
act.
The war in Vietnam is curi
ous to the extent that, although
it is an existential fact, few of
us know about it. Theories of
international conflict and nation
al revolution can be taught in
the classroom, yet involvement
in the actual proceedings is lack
ing. In short, the citizen at home
lacks any definite feeling of re
sponsibility or participation in
an event to which his repre
sentatives claim he si commit
ted.
Silence Is Consent
Yet every citizen is, in fact,
committed; silence is the most
notorious of supporting acts, and
silence forces democratically
elected officials, who hear little
or nothing to the contrary, to
give their full support to Presi
dent Johnson.
