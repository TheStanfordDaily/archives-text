# THE CAPITAL SCENE
## Don't Call Us, We'll Call You 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
After it was announced that
Marvin Watson had been put in
charge of security at the Execu
tive Mansion and was logging
everyone's telephone calls, re
porters began to refer to th e
White House as "Stalag 1600."
The excuse given for check
ing calls was that a special study
was being made to see how
many telephone lines the White
House really needs.
Well, it turns out that the
survey is over and now .accord
ing to Mr. Bill Moyers, the White
House expects to save $6,000 a
month in telephone charges.
Cut Down and Removed
Many special assistants had
their lines cut down and a few
who had got no calls at all dur
ing the survey had their tele
phones taken away from them
altogether.
As a matter of fact, the day
after the economies were put
into effect, the President called
in Marvin Watson and said:
"Marv, I can't seem to get
Jack on the phone."
"He doesn't have a phone
anymore, sir. We found out dur
ing the survey he got exactly
three calls: two were from his
wife asking him when he was
going to be home and one was
from his wife saying she was
leaving home.'
"Well, how do I get in touch
with him?" the President asked.

"We have these pigeons, sir.
You just write a message and
attach it to a leg. Jack will get
it within the hour."
"That's a good idea, Marv. I'll
tell Bill to announce it at the
briefing. His line's busy."
Just Plain Bill
"Bill has only one line now,
Mr. President. It appears every
newspaperman in the world was
calling him up and we figured
it might discourage them if they
couldn't get through."
"What happens if I need Bill
in a hurry?" the President said.
"We're installing a drum in
your office. You beat on it and
as each office along the way
hears the signal they'll pass it
on and Mr. Moyers will eventual
ly hear it and come running. He
can also beat out a message to
you when he has something on
his mind."
"That makes sense. What is
this I hear about the telephones
being taken out of the War
Room?"
"They never got any calls
down there sir, and I figured we
could save $600."
"What happens in an emer
gency?"
"We have a bonfire ready to
go at anytime in the rose gar
den. When you wave this flag,
an Indian with a blanket will be
alerted to send out smoke sig-

nals. Another Indian stationed
in the War Room will be able
to reply. It's absolutely fool
proof."
"Good boy, Marv. I notice you
took out all the phones in the
East Wing of the White House.
How do we keep in touch with
them?"
Pony Express Rider
"We have a Pony Express
rider stationed right outside the
West Wing door. He will deliver
a pouch back and forth three
times a day."
"That makes sense," the Pres
ident said. "What if Lady Bird
wants to speak to me?"
"The Army engineers have
built this system. You see, these
two ordinary soup cans. There
is a waxed string attached to
each end. When you talk in one
end, Mrs. Johnson can hear you
and she can reply the same
way."
"I'll be darned," the President
said.
Just then Luci walked in.
"What happened to my phone?"
she demanded.
The President looked at Mr.
Watson. "Marv, you didn't take
her phone away, too?"
"You said to take out every
thing but the Hot Line."
"Give Luci her phone backâ€”
and, Marv, take out the Hot Line
instead.'*
