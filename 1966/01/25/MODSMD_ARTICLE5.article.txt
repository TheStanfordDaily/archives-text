# Frosh Being Challenged By New Wilbur Program
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
Although it is still too early for a
complete evaluation of the Wilbur
Faculty-Master Program, strengths
and weaknesses of the new system
are beginning to make themselves
felt.
Dr. Eric Hutchinson, Wilbur Facul
ty-Master, told The Daily that a 700
man residence hall was too large for
him to be entirely effective in his role
of determining "academic inputs." He
suggested that the ideal size for a
residence under the system would be
around 250 students. This roughly cor
responds to the size of the proposed
Moore and Jacks Halls.
Many of the activities which Hutch
inson outlined in the fall are just get
ting under way on a large scale. Sev
eral non-credit projects were conduct
ed last quarter. Hutchinson noted that
there was a real need for tutorial
work, both for the exceptionally tal
ented and those finding courses dif
ficult.
Promising Students
The sciences proved to be particu
larly difficult for the freshmen dur
ing the first quarter. Hutchinson con
ducted a weekly non-credit session
with those students having difficulty
in chemistry. At the same time a half
dozen promising students in chemis
try were allowed to work on depart
mental projects with graduate stu
dents. He said that both tutorial ex
periments were highly successful.
He expressed hopes that similar
projects might be extended to mathe
matics, and ultimately into the lib
eral arts. The major problems is in
getting members of the faculty to
lake on tutorials. Presently any teach
er who gives his time is doing so in
addition to his departmental obliga
tions. Hutchinson saw one solution if
departments would allow participa
ting professors to reduce their de
partmental activities proportionately.
Noting that the purpose of the fac
ulty-master plan was to promote "a
scholarly atmosphere," Hutchinson
said that most students are being
"challenged as much as they need to
be." A small number have expressed
strong criticism against an anti-intel
lectual trend in freshman life. How
ever Hutchinson said that these were
the student who would benefit the
most from an increase in opportuni
ties to do tutorial work.
Without Justification
The strains of competition were
particularly strong among the men
at Wilbur. Hutchinson said that much

of the concern was without justifica
tion. Not one member of the fresh
man class has left school for academ
ic reason. The overall performance
of the class was quite good, he told
The Daily. The composite GPA was
only slgihtly lower than that of the
entire University. He inetrpreted this
as a sign that the class had a lot of
promise.
Hutchinson had particular praise
for the role of the sponsors under the
new system. Several of the sponsors
are conducting informal seminars and
discussions this quarter on subjects
which range from existentialism to
modern poetry to theology. "These
projects can hardly fail to be effective
since they stimulate thought in areas
which the boys might not have

touched upon otherwise," Hutchinson
remarked.
"The role of the sponsor cannot be
filled by any other type of resident,"
the Faculty - Master said. Although
graduate students might have their
place in connection with tutorials,
Hutchinson emphasized that there
was no substitute for the "very sensi
tive relationship" between freshmen
and sponsors.
A Real Concern
v "The present group of sponsors
show a real concern for the well-being
of the freshmen and are generous
with their time," he noted.
Some of the specific proposals have
met with varying success:
• A debating union, styled after
those at Oxford, met once and has
not reconvened since.
• Bi-weekly essay contests spon
sored by Madera Sponsor Tom Fox
have proved to be quite successful.
• A photograph group has been es
tablished with its own darkroom at
Wilbur.
• Plans are well along for a festival
of the arts in the spring. Plans in
clude performance of an original stu
dent production and a contest in the
graphic arts.
• Non-credit seminars with faculty
members have been few, and spon
sors have been more active in this
area.
Hutchinson admitted that after four
months in his new post he knew "a
lot more about being a faculty-master
than in the beginning of the fall." Be
sides the large number of students,
he said just locating a particular stu
dent had proved to be a time consum
ing task.
A Bit Self Contained
The Faculty-Master was also some
what disappointed that freshmen had
not taken a greater interest in activi
ties outside the Wilbur complex. He
suggested that Wilbur had the ten
dency to be "a bit self-contained."
Social contact between the fresh
man men and women has always been
a problem. Hutchinson said that the
mey at Wilbur were mature enough
to benefit from changes in open house
policies such as those presently before
the Legislature.
Discipline has been a pleasant sur
prise to Hutchinson. Most judicial
problems have been handled by indi
vidual sponsors and there have been
no major incidents. Even the single
Wilbur-Stern water balloon fight had
been mild compared to past melees.
