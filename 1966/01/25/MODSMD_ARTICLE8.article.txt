# Lithographs Portray Earthly Apocalypse

### SANDY SHAPIRO 
"I am absorbed by problems of be
lief, suffering, and destruction as
basic human concerns. Some religious
symbols encourage such reflections,
but I am interested in the human
problems more than the traditional
symbols."
Karen Laub-Novack, wife of Reli
gious Professor Michael Novack, pur
sued this interest in her series of sev
enteen lithographs on The Apocalypse,
currently on display at Tresidder Un
ion. The exhibit is presented in con
nection with the Stanford University
Ecumenical Lecture Series — Secular
and Relgiious Visions of the Future.
According to Champ Taylor, assist
ant chaplain, apocalypse means un
covering or unveiling — literally the
removing of a veil. The Book of Reve
lation (Apocalypse) is an unveiling of
God's future plan for His people,
truths and realities that men could
not discover for themselves. The book
is rich in symbolism and has been an
inspiration for painting and sculpture
through the ages.
Earthy Forms
Mrs. Novack read the Apocalypse
on a recent trip to Rome for the Vati
can Council meetings. She was im
pressed by the images and poetry of
the book, but sought to escape the
stereo-typed images of past works.
Traditional winged angels have been
replaced by human, "earthy" forms
in an attempt to combine divine
visions with man's inner realities.
"Evil is a consequence of man's fail
ures, not an outside force, and I tried
to convey this in my prints," explains
Mrs. Novack.
Lithography is a difficult process
involving lime stone and nitric acid.
The drawing is sketched on the stone
slabs with a wax crayon or grease
base paint and then covered with a
mixture of acid and water. The places
treated with the acid repeal ink, and
the crayoned portions absorb it, thus
yielding the print. The process is re
peated for each color.
"I like to work on large areas.
Color, line, and texture fascinate me.

I begin most of my paintings tenta
tively and swiftly, waiting for an in
teresting structure or organization to
emerge ... A mood or an atmosphere
at first; then I work for control and
details." Mrs. Novack did about twen
ty preliminary sketches for each of
her compositions, utilizing broad
strokes and vivid colors to achieve
her final images.
Mrs. Novack feels art is a search
for self, and her lithographs are in
tended to be more than religious ex
pressions. "They can have secular in
terpretations—they pertain to human
problems in general and so are perti
nent to the current world situations."
". . . the human figure stimulates
me more than any other subject. In
my prints I have found a way of ex
pressing more highly articulated tra
ditional themes by using literary texts
as a starting point for my ideas and
images," summarizes Mrs. Novack.
