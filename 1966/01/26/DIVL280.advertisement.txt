Where to See Jesus
While scholars raise the question of a historical Jesus and confused theolo
gians dispute the authority of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, a risen Lord, is
known and loved by million who have met Him as a personal Friend. The man
who wonders if God is dead hasn't looked and doesn't want to know, for find
ing Christ, one is forever changed, and can not help but see Him everywhere.
In fact, so completely has the Sovereign Lord identified Himself with man, we
must find Him in our neighbor's eyes and search Him out in a brother's soul.
Warning of the judgment when God wili one day find us out, Jesus Christ
assures all men: "When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels
with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. Before Him will be gathered
all the nations, and He will separate them from one another as a shepherd
separates the sheeps from the goats, and He will place the sheep at His right
hand, but the goats at the left. Then the King will say to those at his right
hand, 'Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I
was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I
was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison
and you came to me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, Lord, when did we
see thee hungry and feed thee, or thirsty and give thee drink? And when did
we see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and clothe thee? And when
did we see thee in prison and visit thee?' And the King will answer them,
Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethern, you
did it to me.' Then He will say to those at His left hand, Depart from me,
you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I
was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no
drink. I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not
clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me' . . . and they will go
away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matthew
25:31-46).
Have you met Jesus Christ? He is never very far away.

was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I
was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison
and you came to me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, Lord, when did we
see thee hungry and feed thee, or thirsty and give thee drink? And when did
we see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and clothe thee? And when
did we see thee in prison and visit thee?' And the King will answer them,
Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethern, you
did it to me.' Then He will say to those at His left hand, Depart from me,
you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I
was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no
drink. I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not
clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me' . . . and they will go
away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matthew
25:31-46).

Where to See Jesus
While scholars raise the question of a historical Jesus and confused theolo
gians dispute the authority of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, a risen Lord, is
known and loved by million who have met Him as a personal Friend. The man
who wonders if God is dead hasn't looked and doesn't want to know, for find
ing Christ, one is forever changed, and can not help but see Him everywhere.
In fact, so completely has the Sovereign Lord identified Himself with man, we
must find Him in our neighbor's eyes and search Him out in a brother's soul.
Warning of the judgment when God wili one day find us out, Jesus Christ
assures all men: "When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels
with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. Before Him will be gathered
all the nations, and He will separate them from one another as a shepherd
separates the sheeps from the goats, and He will place the sheep at His right
hand, but the goats at the left. Then the King will say to those at his right
hand, 'Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I
was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I
was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison
and you came to me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, Lord, when did we
see thee hungry and feed thee, or thirsty and give thee drink? And when did
we see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and clothe thee? And when
did we see thee in prison and visit thee?' And the King will answer them,
Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethern, you
did it to me.' Then He will say to those at His left hand, Depart from me,
you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I
was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no
drink. I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not
clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me' . . . and they will go
away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matthew
25:31-46).
