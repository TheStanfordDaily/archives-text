by medium-range missiles.

Studies Program at American Univer

deployment of intercontinental mis

country to spend more money, send
more troops and suffer more casual
ties in Vietnam.

• Braves Must Stand Trial
MILWAUKEE, Wis.-- A Wisconsin
judge ruled yesterday that baseball
must stand trial in a state court on

charges of violating antitrust and
monopoly statutes.
The action by Circuit Court Judge
Elmer W. .Roller, representing the
first major challenge in 44 years to
baseball's traditional immunity from
antitrust laws, rejected an attempt
by the National League to gain dis
missal of Wisconsin's antitrust suit.
Judge Roller told the Associated
Press later that his memorandum
decision did not touch upon Atty.
Gen. Bronston La Follette's petition
for an injunction against the BraveS'
proposed move to Atlanta because
he wanted to confer with counsel for
both sides before further action. This,
he said, would be "within two or
three days."
The attorney general has asked the
court to prohibit the Braves from
playing their home games any place
but in Milwaukee this season unless
a new franchise is granted to the
city.
