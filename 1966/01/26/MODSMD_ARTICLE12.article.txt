# Yale Pres Terms Lynd Trip 'Naive'
## 
### 
FROM THE CPS
In the words of Yale Presi
dent Kingman Brewster Jr.,
Staughton Lynd, a Yale assist
ant professor, was "naive and
misguided" in making an un
authorized trip to Vietnam.
Brewster had stronger words
about the professor's speech in
Hanoi, calling it "a disservice
to the causes of freedom of dis
sent, freedom of travel, and con
scientious pacifism."
In first direct comment on
Lynd's activities, he said he felt
that Lynd's "disparagement of
his country's leadership and pol
icies, while in Hanoi, damaged
the causes he purports to serve."
Lynd and two other Ameri
cans, Thomas Hayden, a foun
der of the Students for a Demo
cratic Society, and Herbert Ap
theker, the chief theoretician of
the American Communist Par
ty, spent 10 days in North Viet
nam in defiance of a State De
partment ban on travel there.
"Naive and Misguided"
Of the trip itself, the Yale
President said that he could
view this "for fact-finding in
the cause of peace as a consci
entious effort, even though it
was naive and misguided." But
Brewster said he felt quite dif
ferently about the "talk which
Mr. Lynd is reported to have
made in Hanoi."
Brewster cited the Hanoi ra
dio reports that Lynd publicly
asserted while in the North
Vietnamese capital "that the
Johnson administration lies to
the American people and that
the United States is immoral,
illegal, and anti-democratic."
Lynd said that he had no com
ment on Brewster's statement.
He had earlier said that he
was thinking of leaving Yale be
cause of the reaction to his trip.
At that time he noted that the
school had not brought any pres

sure on him to leave but that
the reaction among "some alum
ni" had been quite unfavorable
and that "Yale had to answer
the phone all the time."
Not Under Pressure
The Yale president indicated
that Lynd is not and will not be
put under any pressure to re
sign. Quoting directly from a
speech before the Yale Alumni
Association in November, Brew
ster reaffirmed his conviction
that "as long as a man is in
good faith, as long as he is not
in default with respect to the
teaching and scholarly obliga
tions for which he is employed,
the long-run interest of the
university, indeed the long-run
charge which the university
bears from its own tradition
makes it unthinkable that we
should penalize a faculty mem
ber for his political position."
Although Brewster expressed
his disagreement with Lynd, he
gave no indication that his ac
tions represented a neglect of
his "teaching and scholarly ob
ligations" and the implication
was that, although the presi
dent disapproved of the trip to
Hanoi, penalization of the as
sistant professor was still "un
thinkable."
The three points, as outlined
by Lynd, are:
• Bombing of North Vietnam
must end permanently and un
conditionally.
• The U. S. must accept all
of North Vietnam's four points
(which include the withdrawal
of all troops) as a basis for ne
gotiations.
• The U. S. must demonstrate
its sincerity by "actual deeds."
As to the question of "actual
deeds" Lynd suggested that rec
ognition of Viet Cong by the
U. S. and a willingness to in
clude them in negotiations
would satisfy the North Vietna
mese government.

In first direct comment on
Lynd's activities, he said he felt
that Lynd's "disparagement of
his country's leadership and pol
icies, while in Hanoi, damaged
the causes he purports to serve."
Lynd and two other Ameri
cans, Thomas Hayden, a foun
der of the Students for a Demo
cratic Society, and Herbert Ap
theker, the chief theoretician of
the American Communist Par
ty, spent 10 days in North Viet
nam in defiance of a State De
partment ban on travel there.
"Naive and Misguided"
Of the trip itself, the Yale
President said that he could
view this "for fact-finding in
the cause of peace as a consci
entious effort, even though it
was naive and misguided." But
Brewster said he felt quite dif
ferently about the "talk which
Mr. Lynd is reported to have
made in Hanoi."
Brewster cited the Hanoi ra
dio reports that Lynd publicly
asserted while in the North
Vietnamese capital "that the
Johnson administration lies to
the American people and that
the United States is immoral,
illegal, and anti-democratic."
Lynd said that he had no com
ment on Brewster's statement.
He had earlier said that he
was thinking of leaving Yale be
cause of the reaction to his trip.
At that time he noted that the
school had not brought any pres

sure on him to leave but that
the reaction among "some alum
ni" had been quite unfavorable
and that "Yale had to answer
the phone all the time."
Not Under Pressure
The Yale president indicated
that Lynd is not and will not be
put under any pressure to re
sign. Quoting directly from a
speech before the Yale Alumni
Association in November, Brew
ster reaffirmed his conviction
that "as long as a man is in
good faith, as long as he is not
in default with respect to the
teaching and scholarly obliga
tions for which he is employed,
the long-run interest of the
university, indeed the long-run
charge which the university
bears from its own tradition
makes it unthinkable that we
should penalize a faculty mem
ber for his political position."
Although Brewster expressed
his disagreement with Lynd, he
gave no indication that his ac
tions represented a neglect of
his "teaching and scholarly ob
ligations" and the implication
was that, although the presi
dent disapproved of the trip to
Hanoi, penalization of the as
sistant professor was still "un
thinkable."
The three points, as outlined
by Lynd, are:
• Bombing of North Vietnam
must end permanently and un
conditionally.
• The U. S. must accept all
of North Vietnam's four points
(which include the withdrawal
of all troops) as a basis for ne
gotiations.
• The U. S. must demonstrate
its sincerity by "actual deeds."
As to the question of "actual
deeds" Lynd suggested that rec
ognition of Viet Cong by the
U. S. and a willingness to in
clude them in negotiations
would satisfy the North Vietna
mese government.
FROM THE CPS
In the words of Yale Presi
dent Kingman Brewster Jr.,
Staughton Lynd, a Yale assist
ant professor, was "naive and
misguided" in making an un
authorized trip to Vietnam.
Brewster had stronger words
about the professor's speech in
Hanoi, calling it "a disservice
to the causes of freedom of dis
sent, freedom of travel, and con
scientious pacifism."
