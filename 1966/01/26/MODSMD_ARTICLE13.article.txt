# Shoplifting, Stealing Rises Near Colleges
## 
### 
The problem of student theft
on campuses is not a new one.
It ranges in severity from mon
ey taken from gym lockers and
books stolen in cafeterias to
large scale break-ins.
However, the problem of stu
dent theft seems now to extend
beyond the universities into the
nearby towns. The Yale Co-op
reported in late fall that student
arrests for shoplifting were
averaging one a day. Officials
at the Co-op said they had no
way to measure losses until a
year-end inventory but were
certain that this school year
losses would at least match last
year's $90,000 figure.
Store detectives said students
from every area of the school
had been involved. A graduate
student from Saigon was caught
recently. A divinity school stu
dent was arrested after attempt
ing to steal two bars of soap
and an interpretation of the
Scriptures.
Because of the increase in
shoplifting, New Haven authori
ties told campus police that all
shoplifting cases must be re
ferred directly to the police de
partment. Students are now
booked and ordered to appear
in city courts.
In Chapel Hill, N. C., home

of the University of North Caro
lina, a bookshop owner esti
mates he loses $7,000 a year
through shoplifting.
The University of Maryland
lost $5,000 on equipment stolen
during berak-ins over a five
week period last fall.
Sorority houses at the Uni
versity of Kentucky were loot
ed several times last fall and
during the Christmas holidays.
More than once a coed awoke
to find a prowler going through
her room.
The FBI reported that shop
lifting was the nation's fastest
growing larceny, having in
creased 93 per cent in the past
five years. The report, however,
had nothing in it to indicate that
shoplifting might be a special
problem near college campuses.
Those reports come from the
colleges themselves.
No one is certain to what ex
tent students are involved in
the thefts. But that students
are involved in some large scale
operations is unquestioned. The
question is why. A merchant
near Maryland's College Park
campus says that students steal
because they consider it a "chal
lenge to see if they can get
away with it."

had nothing in it to indicate that
shoplifting might be a special
problem near college campuses.
Those reports come from the
colleges themselves.
No one is certain to what ex
tent students are involved in
the thefts. But that students
are involved in some large scale
operations is unquestioned. The
question is why. A merchant
near Maryland's College Park
campus says that students steal
because they consider it a "chal
lenge to see if they can get
away with it."
The problem of student theft
on campuses is not a new one.
It ranges in severity from mon
ey taken from gym lockers and
books stolen in cafeterias to
large scale break-ins.
However, the problem of stu
dent theft seems now to extend
beyond the universities into the
nearby towns. The Yale Co-op
reported in late fall that student
arrests for shoplifting were
averaging one a day. Officials
at the Co-op said they had no
way to measure losses until a
year-end inventory but were
certain that this school year
losses would at least match last
year's $90,000 figure.
Store detectives said students
from every area of the school
had been involved. A graduate
student from Saigon was caught
recently. A divinity school stu
dent was arrested after attempt
ing to steal two bars of soap
and an interpretation of the
Scriptures.
Because of the increase in
shoplifting, New Haven authori
ties told campus police that all
shoplifting cases must be re
ferred directly to the police de
partment. Students are now
booked and ordered to appear
in city courts.
In Chapel Hill, N. C., home

of the University of North Caro
lina, a bookshop owner esti
mates he loses $7,000 a year
through shoplifting.
The University of Maryland
lost $5,000 on equipment stolen
during berak-ins over a five
week period last fall.
Sorority houses at the Uni
versity of Kentucky were loot
ed several times last fall and
during the Christmas holidays.
More than once a coed awoke
to find a prowler going through
her room.
The FBI reported that shop
lifting was the nation's fastest
growing larceny, having in
creased 93 per cent in the past
five years. The report, however,
had nothing in it to indicate that
shoplifting might be a special
problem near college campuses.
