# SLAC Facilities Near Completion
## 
### 
Construction of America's big
gest and most ambitious in
strument for nuclear research,
SLAC, is approximately 80 per
cent complete. The full 10,000-
foot electron beam will be acti
vated for the first time next
May and full scale experiments
are expected to be underway
before the end of this year.
The accelerator construction
is on schedule with plans an
nounced in July, 1962, when
ground was broken, and the
original $114 million budget au
thorized by Congress "still ap
pears to be adeqaute for the
machine's completion," reports
project director, Professor Wolf
gang K. H. Panofsky.
All originally planned SLAC
buildings, except the two end
stations where experimental
targets will be set up, have
been completed. Building con
struction is under the direction
of SLAC's joint-venture subcon

tractor, Aetron-Blume - Atkin
son, while nearly all design and
construction of the accelerator
itself is being done by SLAC
personnel.
The SLAC staff stands at
approximately 1,160. About 275
are senior staff or faculty mem
bers, scientists, and engineers.
About 180 are temporary em
ployees during construction.
Test of the accelerator, 2,000
feet at a time, are being con
ducted, and tests with an ac
tual electron beam in the first
666 feet (two sectors of the
eventual 30) are continuing.
"The energy and beam qual
ity observed during these tests
fully agree with design expecta
tions," Panofsky comments.
Being built by Stanford un
der contract with the U. S.
Atomic Energy Commission,
SLAC will accelerate electrons
to energies of 10 to 20 billion
electron volts.
