# Communist System Has Difficulties
## 
### 
The more coercive and re
strictive a political regime, the
greater political and economic
difficulties it experiences, re
search at Stanford's Studies of
the Communist System shows.
The more coercive and less
responsive East European coun
tries —Czechoslovakia, East Ger
many and Albania—have higher
investment in military force per
adult, lower yearly wage in
creases, a smaller proportion of
their students studying in West
ern countries, fewer students
studying social sciences or the
humanities in their own coun
tries, fewer translations of
Western social science litera
ture, and a very slow increase
in Communist Party member
ship, the study shows.
The statistical analysis from
which these conclusions are
drawn was made by Dennis C.
Pirages, a doctoral candidate in
political science under the tutel
age of Prof. Jan Triska, director
of Stanford Studies of the Com
munist System.
"It is also interesting," Pir
ages' paper notes, "that the
three most coercive countries
emphasize the development of a
communications system instead
of development of an education
al system."
