## Fire-Fighters Build Their Own Engine 
### 
Stanford University firemen
have a custom-designed, hand
built rescue truck worth an es
timated $35,000 if bought com
mercially.
The fire engine, dubbed "Res
cue 95," is the brain-child of
Fire Chief John Marston, As
sistant Chief Frank Jurian and
Lt. A 1 Ramies, the department's
master mechanic.
A slice of the credit goes also
to Rudy Holmquist of Wood
side, now retired. Holmquist, a
36-year veteran of the Univer
sity's sheet metal shop, was its
foreman.
Surplus Truck
Holmquist estimates he fitted
and shaped some 1900 pounds
of sheetmetal for the truck body
while spending the last year of
his Stanford service helping on
the project.
The truck itself, a 1945 model
V-12 Seagrave, began life as a
pumper stationed at the China
Lake Naval Air Station, Inyo
County, in the year it was first
built. Through devious adminis
trative channels festooned with
red tape, it was discharged as
surplus and came to Stanford
Electronics Laboratories for vol
unteer emergency duty on Stan
ford's back-country antenna
farm.
A Pittance
With the advent of a new sub
station staffed by Stanford
firemen at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, the depart
ment acquired the unwanted old
engine for a pittance.
While maintaining the engine's
main function as a pumper cap
able of throwing 750 gallons per
minute through a massive noz
zle-gun on top, the firemen set
about building the rest of it into

a four-wheeled storage i o c k er.
Tucked away into a dozen neat
compartments, each fitted with
a counter-sunk handle, is a fan
tastic array of equipment for
midably titled "forcible entry
tools."
First Aid
Among them are a com
pressed air gun and chisels,
known as a "block-buster"; cut
ting torch, gas and fume sniffer,
grip hoist, hydraulic shears,
chain saws, portable generator,
a Lyle gun for shooting rescue
lines, ropes, hose lines, and
breathing apparatus for fire
men.
Also floodlights, wire cables,
hydraulic jacks, a submersible
pump with a capacity of 160
gallons per minute, tanks of
breathing air and medical oxy
gen with 150 feet of special
hoses, a fiberglass ladder, light,
strong, and nearly indestructi
ble; salvage covers, rescue
ropes, face-masks and hose
lines.
In addition, it holds complete
first aid equipment down to a
doctor's stethoscope, a resuscita
tor which can handle two pa
tients at once, a new-type light
weight folding stretcher with
wheels, a variety of portable fire
extinguishers, and if everything
else fails, a 200-gallon reserve
tank of water.
Psychology
Chief Marston is justifiably
proud of his new baby. And the
cost is more than a bargain, he
feels, because the Stanford fire
men answer about 600 calls a
year. "Twenty-five per cent of
calls require rescue equipment,"
he says,"and now we've got the
equipment to do it."


Stanford firemen saved the Uni
versity $33,000 by custom-build
ing their new "Rescue 95" from
sheetmetal and a 1945 pumper
truck. Costing $2000 compared
to an estimated commercial
value of $35,000, the vehicle is
equipped to handle Stanford's

Psychology
Chief Marston is justifiably
proud of his new baby. And the
cost is more than a bargain, he
feels, because the Stanford fire
men answer about 600 calls a
year. "Twenty-five per cent of
calls require rescue equipment,"
he says,"and now we've got the
equipment to do it."


Stanford firemen saved the Uni
versity $33,000 by custom-build
ing their new "Rescue 95" from
sheetmetal and a 1945 pumper
truck. Costing $2000 compared
to an estimated commercial
value of $35,000, the vehicle is

ment
Stanford University firemen
have a custom-designed, hand
built rescue truck worth an es
timated $35,000 if bought com
mercially.
The fire engine, dubbed "Res
cue 95," is the brain-child of
Fire Chief John Marston, As
sistant Chief Frank Jurian and
Lt. A 1 Ramies, the department's
master mechanic.
A slice of the credit goes also
to Rudy Holmquist of Wood
side, now retired. Holmquist, a
36-year veteran of the Univer
sity's sheet metal shop, was its
foreman.
Surplus Truck
Holmquist estimates he fitted
and shaped some 1900 pounds
of sheetmetal for the truck body
while spending the last year of
his Stanford service helping on
the project.
The truck itself, a 1945 model
V-12 Seagrave, began life as a
pumper stationed at the China
Lake Naval Air Station, Inyo
County, in the year it was first
built. Through devious adminis
trative channels festooned with
red tape, it was discharged as
surplus and came to Stanford
Electronics Laboratories for vol
unteer emergency duty on Stan
ford's back-country antenna
farm.
A Pittance
With the advent of a new sub
station staffed by Stanford
firemen at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, the depart
ment acquired the unwanted old
engine for a pittance.
While maintaining the engine's
main function as a pumper cap
able of throwing 750 gallons per
minute through a massive noz
zle-gun on top, the firemen set
about building the rest of it into

a four-wheeled storage i o c k er.
Tucked away into a dozen neat
compartments, each fitted with
a counter-sunk handle, is a fan
tastic array of equipment for
midably titled "forcible entry
tools."
First Aid
Among them are a com
pressed air gun and chisels,
known as a "block-buster"; cut
ting torch, gas and fume sniffer,
grip hoist, hydraulic shears,
chain saws, portable generator,
a Lyle gun for shooting rescue
lines, ropes, hose lines, and
breathing apparatus for fire
men.
Also floodlights, wire cables,
hydraulic jacks, a submersible
pump with a capacity of 160
gallons per minute, tanks of
breathing air and medical oxy
gen with 150 feet of special
hoses, a fiberglass ladder, light,
strong, and nearly indestructi
ble; salvage covers, rescue
ropes, face-masks and hose
