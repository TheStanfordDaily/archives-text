# Executives To Operate Computers
## 
### 
Executives attending the
Transportation M a 11 a g e rn ent
Program at the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business this sum
mer will have an opportunity to
play the Business Logistics
Game—the first computer con
test designed specifically for
transportation and distribution
executives.
Using the facilities of Stan
ford's Computation Center, the
executives will develop strate
gies designed to serve their hy
pothetical customers more effic
iently, at less expense than their
rival companies.
Every mode of transportation
is available in the game, each
with its costs and its hazards.
Once a distribution strategy has
been selected, the executives
can tell within seconds how it
would work in actual practice.
The computer print out shows
sales, costs, market percentages,
and degree of customer satis
faction.
Resident Executives
The game is part of the
Transportation Management
Program — a four-week in-resi
dence program for executives
who are concerned with trans
portation, distribution, ware
housing, and supply.
Executives come from a wide
variety of transportation com
panies and from virtually every
industry. They live together in
Florence Moore Hall, one of
Stanford's new residence dormi
tories. Many opportunities are
provided for out-of-class con
tacts with faculty members and
prominent executives who serve
as guest speakers.
The intensive course of study
includes courses in business
economics, financial analysis,
business logistics, quantitative
methods, and computer uses.
Much of the material is based
on cases gathered from industry
which illustrate important prob
lems. Executive-students ana
lyze these situations and pro
pose solutions which then must
be defended in class.
Geographical Distribution
The Transportation Manage
ment Program is now in its
eleventh year. During its first
decade, participating executives
came from all parts of the Unit
ed States and from every contin
ent in the world.
Its course of study includes
a balanced program of lectures,
classroom discussion, and an
alysis of case problems. Objec
tives of the program take into
acount the need of all execu
tives for self-renewal, the op
portunity to study in depth im
portant changes taking place in
the business world, and the need
to learn more about new tools
and technologies.

Transportation M a 11 a g e rn ent
Program at the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business this sum
mer will have an opportunity to
play the Business Logistics
Game—the first computer con
test designed specifically for
transportation and distribution
executives.
Using the facilities of Stan
ford's Computation Center, the
executives will develop strate
gies designed to serve their hy
pothetical customers more effic
iently, at less expense than their
rival companies.
Every mode of transportation
is available in the game, each
with its costs and its hazards.
Once a distribution strategy has
been selected, the executives
can tell within seconds how it
would work in actual practice.
The computer print out shows
sales, costs, market percentages,
and degree of customer satis
faction.
Resident Executives
The game is part of the
Transportation Management
Program — a four-week in-resi
dence program for executives
who are concerned with trans
portation, distribution, ware
housing, and supply.
Executives come from a wide
variety of transportation com
panies and from virtually every
industry. They live together in
Florence Moore Hall, one of
Stanford's new residence dormi
tories. Many opportunities are
provided for out-of-class con
tacts with faculty members and
prominent executives who serve
as guest speakers.
The intensive course of study
includes courses in business
economics, financial analysis,
business logistics, quantitative
methods, and computer uses.
Much of the material is based
on cases gathered from industry
which illustrate important prob
lems. Executive-students ana
lyze these situations and pro
pose solutions which then must
be defended in class.
Geographical Distribution
The Transportation Manage
ment Program is now in its
eleventh year. During its first
decade, participating executives
came from all parts of the Unit
ed States and from every contin
ent in the world.
Its course of study includes
a balanced program of lectures,
classroom discussion, and an
alysis of case problems. Objec
tives of the program take into
acount the need of all execu
tives for self-renewal, the op
portunity to study in depth im
portant changes taking place in
the business world, and the need
to learn more about new tools
and technologies.
