# Professors Defend Student Civil Rights
## 
### 
FROM TIIE CPS
A firm stand for student
rights has been issued by the
American Association of Uni
versity Professors.
Published in the winter issue
of the AAUP Bulletin, the
statement is the result of a
four-year study and several re
vised drafts. It is the first for
mal statement by the AAUP on
student rights.
The student sit-in movement
for civil rights first prompted
the AAUP to consider the ques
tion of student rights, both on
and off campus. Headed by Prof.
Phillip Monypenny of the Uni
versity of Illinois, the new
AAUP standing committee on
the Faculty Responsibility for
the Academic Freedom of Stu
dents studied the practices of
the "better established and
freer institutions" for the basis
of its position.
Personal Development
"Faculty members and admin
istrative officials should insure
that institutional powers are
not employed to inhibit such in
tellectual and personal develop
ment of students as is often pro
moted by their off-campus ac
tivities," the statement says.
Along with placing a measure
of responsibility on the faculty
for safe-guarding student aca
demic freedom, the statement
says:
• Students are responsible for
learning a course, "but they
should be free to take reasoned
exception to the data or views
offered." They should maintain
the standards established by
their professors, but should be
protected against prejudiced or
capricious academic evalua
tion. Information which a pro
fessor acquires about a stu
dent's views during the course
of his work as an instructor
should be confidential.
• Institutions should have a
careful policy on maintaining
and revealing a student's educa
tional record. Academic and dis
ciplinary records should be sepa
rate; data from disciplinary and
counseling records should not
be available to unauthorized
persons, and "no records should
be kept which reflect the politi
cal activities or beliefs of stu
dents."
• Not only should institutions
be open to all who are qualified,
they should "use their influence
to secure equal access for all
students to public facilities in
the local community." Campus
organizations should be open to
all, students and student or

ganizations should be allowed to
express opinion publicly and pri
vately and they should be al
lowed to invite and hear any
person they choose.
Off-Campus Freedom
Speaking on off-campus free
dom, the student, the AAUP
statement says they should have
the same rights as any citizen.
Institutional powers should not
be used to "inhibit" the student
in any way in his off campus
experiences.
The statement also sets stand
ards for disciplinary proceed
ings and protections for student
government and student publi
cations. "Disciplinary proceed
ings should be instituted only
for violation of standards of
conduct defined in advance and
published through such means
as a student handbook or a gen
erally available volume of uni
versity regulations."
AAUP officials said that
some administrators were criti
cal of a preliminary draft of
the statement published in 1964
but that events since then made
them more favorable to it.

the "better established and

of its position.

"Faculty members and admin
istrative officials should insure
that institutional powers are
not employed to inhibit such in
tellectual and personal develop
ment of students as is often pro
moted by their off-campus ac
tivities," the statement says.
Along with placing a measure
of responsibility on the faculty
for safe-guarding student aca
demic freedom, the statement
says:
• Students are responsible for
learning a course, "but they
should be free to take reasoned
exception to the data or views
offered." They should maintain
the standards established by
their professors, but should be
protected against prejudiced or
capricious academic evalua
tion. Information which a pro
fessor acquires about a stu
dent's views during the course
of his work as an instructor
should be confidential.
• Institutions should have a
careful policy on maintaining
and revealing a student's educa
tional record. Academic and dis
ciplinary records should be sepa
rate; data from disciplinary and
counseling records should not
be available to unauthorized
persons, and "no records should
be kept which reflect the politi
cal activities or beliefs of stu
dents."
• Not only should institutions
be open to all who are qualified,
they should "use their influence
to secure equal access for all
students to public facilities in
the local community." Campus
organizations should be open to
all, students and student or

ganizations should be allowed to
express opinion publicly and pri
vately and they should be al
lowed to invite and hear any
person they choose.
Off-Campus Freedom
Speaking on off-campus free
dom, the student, the AAUP
statement says they should have
the same rights as any citizen.
Institutional powers should not
be used to "inhibit" the student
in any way in his off campus
experiences.
The statement also sets stand
ards for disciplinary proceed
ings and protections for student
government and student publi
cations. "Disciplinary proceed
ings should be instituted only
for violation of standards of
conduct defined in advance and
published through such means
as a student handbook or a gen
erally available volume of uni
versity regulations."
AAUP officials said that
some administrators were criti
cal of a preliminary draft of
the statement published in 1964
but that events since then made
them more favorable to it.
FROM TIIE CPS
A firm stand for student
rights has been issued by the
American Association of Uni
versity Professors.
Published in the winter issue
of the AAUP Bulletin, the
statement is the result of a
four-year study and several re
vised drafts. It is the first for
mal statement by the AAUP on
student rights.
The student sit-in movement
for civil rights first prompted
the AAUP to consider the ques
tion of student rights, both on
and off campus. Headed by Prof.
Phillip Monypenny of the Uni
versity of Illinois, the new
AAUP standing committee on
the Faculty Responsibility for
the Academic Freedom of Stu
