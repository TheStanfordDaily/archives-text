## Nicolao, Buckingham To Swim In Germany 
### 
By WELLS SHOEMAKER
Two Stanford swimmers, Luis
Nicolao and Greg Buckingham,
will compete this weekend in
the Bremen International In
vitational Swim Fest in Bre
men, Germany.
The annual meet hosts a dif
ferent group of international
stars every year. Dick Roth,
Stanford freshman and world
record holder, participated last
year.
Luis Nicolao has swum 100
meters butterfly faster than
anyone in the world. Nicolao,
who won the 100 fly at both
the indoor and the outdoor AAU
national championships last
year, is now in his freshman
year at Stanford.
Record Breaker
Nicolao has already been a
party to a considerable amount
of record smashing at Stanford.
He has bagged the pool record
for 200 butterfly and has swum
on one leg of pool-record-set
ting freshman 400 medley free
style relays.

The relays, swum in the
frosh's opening meet, are both
within .5 second of NCAA fresh
man records. Nicolao's 51.0 split
in the medley relay puts the
NCAA frosh mark of 51.6 for
the 100 fly on thin ice. Nicolao
should handle the NCAA fresh
man record of 1:58.1 for the 200
fly with at least 5 seconds to
spare.
Nicolao will compete in the
100 and 200 meters butterfly
this weekend. Australian Ke
vin Berry, Olympic 200 meter
butterfly champ whom Nicolao
beat earlier this season, will also
swim in the Bremen meet.
Can't Pass The Buck
Greg Buckingham, who holds
the American 400 yards indivi
dual medley record, topped five
of the events in the junior col
lege All-American listings last
year at San Mateo College. He
placed in six other events to
keep busy in his spare time.
Buckingham will be eligible to
compete for Stanford next year.
Buckingham owns the Stan

ford pool record of 4:55.2 for
500 freestyle; his best is some
10 seconds faster. Buckingham
posted a 2:00.1 pool record per
formance for 200 individual
medley last weekend.
Buckingham has turned in an
impressive 16:54.4 in the 1650
yard race and has hit 1:44 for
the 200 freestyle.
The 400 meters freestyle, the
200 meters freestyle, and the
400 meters individual medley
await Buckingham in Bremen.

Swim Fest and pays transpor
tation and living expenses for
the cosmopolitan collection of

Two Stanford swimmers, Luis
Nicolao and Greg Buckingham,
will compete this weekend in
the Bremen International In
vitational Swim Fest in Bre
men, Germany.
The annual meet hosts a dif
ferent group of international
stars every year. Dick Roth,
Stanford freshman and world
record holder, participated last
year.
Luis Nicolao has swum 100
meters butterfly faster than
anyone in the world. Nicolao,
who won the 100 fly at both
the indoor and the outdoor AAU
national championships last
year, is now in his freshman
year at Stanford.
Record Breaker
Nicolao has already been a
party to a considerable amount
of record smashing at Stanford.
He has bagged the pool record
for 200 butterfly and has swum
on one leg of pool-record-set
ting freshman 400 medley free
style relays.

The relays, swum in the
frosh's opening meet, are both
within .5 second of NCAA fresh
man records. Nicolao's 51.0 split
in the medley relay puts the
NCAA frosh mark of 51.6 for
the 100 fly on thin ice. Nicolao
should handle the NCAA fresh
man record of 1:58.1 for the 200
fly with at least 5 seconds to
spare.
Nicolao will compete in the
100 and 200 meters butterfly
this weekend. Australian Ke
vin Berry, Olympic 200 meter
butterfly champ whom Nicolao
beat earlier this season, will also
swim in the Bremen meet.
Can't Pass The Buck
Greg Buckingham, who holds
the American 400 yards indivi
dual medley record, topped five
of the events in the junior col
lege All-American listings last
year at San Mateo College. He
placed in six other events to
keep busy in his spare time.
Buckingham will be eligible to
compete for Stanford next year.
