# Otto Graham Back To Pros
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Washington Redskins lured Ot
to Graham back into profession
al football Tuesday, using the
same tactics they do to sign
big name college players—lots
of money.
After a decade of losers, the
Redskins went high to sign up
the 44-year-old former great
Cleveland quarterback as head
coach and general manager. He
succeeds Bill McPeak, fired
last month after five years with
a year to go on his contract.
To get Graham, who led Cleve
land to six straight National
Football League Eastern Divi
sion titles and three NFL cham
pionships as a player, it took a
long-term contract — five years
or longer — a salary of $50,000
or more, bonuses and a deal
that insured lifetime security.
In the past, Graham has
turned down professional of
fers, including the Redskins, to
stick with his security as foot
ball coach at the Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn.
Now, credited with 20 years
service, including a World War
II Navy hitch, Graham is ex
pected to retire from the Coast
Guard
