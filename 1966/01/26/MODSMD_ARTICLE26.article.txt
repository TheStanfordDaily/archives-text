# TONY KUBEK QUITS
## Yankees In Trouble 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Mickey
Mantle underwent surgery on
his right shoulder and Tony
Kubek retired from baseball
Tuesday in developments that
will shape the immediate future
of the New York Yankees.
Bobby Richardson notified the
club he would be back to play
second base in the 1966 season
when he learned that the Yanks
would be without Kubek, their
regular shortstop.
With Roger Maris still a ques
tion mark after playing only 46
games last year, Elston Howard
coming back from a 1965 opera
tion, and 37-year-old Whitey
Ford operating with a circula
tion problem in his left hand,
the Yanks face an uphili strug
gle to regain their old status as
champions.
Mantle's condition was listed
as satisfactory at Rochester,
Minn., where a Mayo Clinic
spokesman said there were no
complications in the operation
to remove a bone chip from his
shoulder.
Although hospital spokesman
released no information about
the effect of the operation on
Mantle's baseball future, Gener
al Manager Ralph Houk of the
Yanks said in Cheshire, Conn.,
that a spokesman at the hospi
tal told him Mantle would be
in good shape to report for
spring training, March 1 at Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla.
Houk said he understood Man

tie would be in the hospital for
three weeks. "It is a great thing
for us that it was discovered,"
he said. "We understand now
that Mickey should have no
more pain and it is very happy
news for us."
While the Yanks were hopeful
of regaining the services of
their brilliant switch-hitter, at
least on a part time basis, they
had to be reconciled to the loss
of their shortstop.
There has been talk of mov
ing Mantle to first base if he
is unable to perform as a regu
lar in left field. There also had
been reports he might be used
as a super pinch hitter.
"I hope I never see the day
when Mickey would be availa
ble only as a pinch hitter," said
Manager Johnny Keane, who
was with Houk in Cheshire on
a Yankee promotional caravan.
Kubek announced his retire
ment in New York because of a
series of injuries that had ham
pered his career i"n recent years.
Reports from the Mayo Clinic
indicated the 29-year-old infield
er has some pressure on the spi
nal cord nerve which could af
fect his reflexes.
Although the doctors told Ku
bek months of rest might allevi
ate the situation, Kubek felt
there was possibility of perma
nent disability if he tried to
Play.
