# High ball- To-High ball On Liquor Issue
## 
### 
As we understand it, one of the more bitter
intra-faculty struggles of the year was waged
over the vital issue of who should get which
liquor locker where in the Faculty Club.
Why not?
This epic eyeball-to-eyeball — or is it high
ball-to-highball? — confrontation is only part
of the continuing fiasco which is known as Stan
ford's liquor policy. There are other scenes;
such as furtive faculty and staff members secret
ing their contraband medicinal tonics into the
Club via little brown bags; or Senator Frank
Church embarassing three Ph.Ds with his re
quest for a martini which none had the proper
ingredients for (the Senator ended up with
Scotch and water).
Yet we suppose that all this will have a bene
ficial effect on the community, for the situation
at the Faculty Club — with all its attendant
absurdities — has probably solidified faculty
support for a change in the liquor policy. And
when the faculty joins the student body in sup
porting a reform, the Administration is usually
not far behind.
Thus, President Sterling's Student Affairs and
Services Committee has empowered one of its
subcommittees to undertake the fourth study of
the liquor problem in the last six years. Accord
ing to reports, the subcommittee's recommenda
tions will soon be acted upon by the full com

mittee. The revision will most probably reiterate
the 1962 request of the Legislature and a student
body referendum — a request that was em
phatically rejected by the Board of Trustees —
that the new policy "be in accordance with state
law."
Contrary to popular mythology, the prohibi
tion against liquor on campus is not part of The
Founding Grant or the Charter or any other
known epistle of the Stanford Pentateuch; in
other words, the Trustees can change the policy
as they see fit. That is, unless they wish to
abridge state law and make Stanford a totally
'wet' campus; this would require a special act
of the State Assembly.
A substantial revision of this policy could well
lead to several welcome innovations on campus
—one obvious example being the proposed addi
tion of a Rathskeller to Tresidder Union. More
over, it would finally lay to rest a policy which
is as widely observed as Prohibition. When one
considers the keg and "Batman" rites currently
practiced by some fraternities and the fact that
Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler cannot
recall a case where a student was tried solely
for possessing or transporting liquor on campus,
it would appear that some reforms are needed.
Or else the Trustees will continue to emulate
Will Rogers trenchant observation about his fel
low Oklahoinans who "will vote dry as long as
they can stagger to the polls."
