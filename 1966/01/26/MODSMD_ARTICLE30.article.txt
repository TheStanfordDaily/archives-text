## Who Got The $100,000? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The General Studies Office
has been faced with a problem
for some time to which it has
failed to direct sufficient atten
tion.
At the inception of the Gen
eral Studies Program, a rather
generous sum of money (about
$100,000) was donated through
a Carnegie Foundation grant for
the purpose of financing senior
colloquia. The hope was that
before this initial gift was ex
hausted, departments would—
seeing the value in such a re
quirement—shoulder responsi
bility for providing sufficient
colloquia, both in quantity and
quality.
The subsequent depletion of
the original endowment at the
end of the academic year 1963-
1964 has left the problem on
uncertain ground. Several par
ties are involved, and yet it is
difficult to point a critical fin
ger to anyone in particular con
cerning the present shortage of
reasonably good colloquia.
According to the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, dur
ing the period of the availability
of the original sum, progressive
improvements of the regular
budgets were made in order to
provide for the inclusion of col
loquia in the regular teaching
program. This explicitly states
that department heads are re
ceiving sufficient funds for col
loquium financing. Yet many
departments are arguing that
no such money exists, that they
are under enough pressure to
merely answer the needs of
their own students.
Does such money exist, and if
so, to what other departmental
purposes Ls it being directed?
And where are the administrat

ors under whose jurisdiction
this question of money falls?
The problem is of admitted com
plexity, and yet one wonders if
this is the reason behind a lack
of any positive or corrective ac
tion.
It is the upperclassman who
feels the pressure resulting
from failure to meet the collo
quia shortage. Good colloquia
are all to often gifts of the gods,
for placement is usually decided
in the luck of early pre-registra
tion. At least one graduating
senior this year was forced to
search out a willing professor
and initiate a colloquim which
he requested the General Stu
dies Office to recognize. It is not
the duty of students to organize
courses solely to satisfy Uni
evrsity program requirements.
The theory behind colloquia
is good, but some basic changes
are called for. A number of pos
sible solutions seem open:
• find new non-departmental
financial backing
• insist departments shoulder
responsibility
• drop the requirement
Perhaps LASSU should consider
the problem, as it was recently
invited to form a three-man
committee to work under the
General Studies Office Board.
In any case the dilemma ex
ists, and an apparent impasse
has blocked administration ac
tion to date; many students
await new thinking and positive
action.

• Coltrane Si,
Heineman No
Editor, The Dally:
The "reporting" presented in
Monday's Daily on the Monk-

Coltrane concert was an excel
lent example of a newspaper
that in the past been satisfied
with jobs half done or not done
at all, and a boy (student?!)
who once again hasn't done his
home-work. Oh, by the way Mr.
Heineman, the "unidentified and
inaudible female pianist" was
Mrs. Coltrane. You know Al,
•John Coltrane.
It was not made clear by Mr.
Heineman why he felt it neces
sary to refer to the conga drum
mer as "it". Perhaps because
the drummer wore a snakeskin
suit? After all, Mr. Heineman
wore sheep's wool; as for his
playing the drummer was re
ceived exceptionally well by the
audience, if that is a valid index
to performer success. Perhaps
his catholic sensibilities were
offended (as were those of a
letter-writer yesterday) by the
group in general which seem
ingly ripped assunder a great
many listeners' neatly arranged
notions on the jazz concept.
Of the four newspaper ac
counts of Sunday's concert that
I have read thus far, only
Stanford's critic - in - residence
has seen fit to dismiss it as ". . .
sadly, most often dull." Heine
manship in The Daily is mere
ly another reason why Stanford
remains a thorn in the left but
tock of greatness. It is not a lack
of anything at Stanford, but
sadly enough, the inconsequen
tal manlier in which students
ingest and utilize it.

• Listen to KYA
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Canning, Coltrane
was not "putting you on," and
no, Stanford Daily, Thelonius is
not "a monk." If you were put

out by waiting, if you didn't
like their attitude on stage, if
you didn't think they showed
the proper deference for being
given the privilege of playing
before us, and if you couldn't
understand or feel their music,
then you should have stayed
home and listened to KYA.
Perhaps these men don't par
ticularly like us—fat, dumb, and
happy out in the audience. And
perhaps they don't have the in
clination to put on a charming
show and give appropriate pat
ter between numbers. They
aren't paid to do that. They are
paid to "blow their minds," to
try and communicate with you
—comfortable, out in the audi
ence — to tell you something,
possibly to shake you up, jar
your complacency, show you
something new, give you a new
perspective, just for a short
while.
All this in a huge auditorium
in the middle of the day. If you
don't like temperamental artists,
then stay away from them, and
applaud only your artisans. And
if you don't like their music, at
least have the good grace to ad
mit its validity. There are ex
istent other rhythms and har
monies than those common in
the European tradition. They
can be compelling, and God
knows, they just might be perti
nent, they might have some
thing to say.
If you don't dig it, then just
keep quiet about it.
To question the integrity of
jazz men of the stature of Monk
and Coltrane is simply childish
and exhibits your own ignorance
of the form and the possible
goals these men may be trying
to attain.
