# THE 						CAPITOL SCENE
## SMERSH And Ho-ho-ho Vs. James Bond Of 00 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
The trouble with all the spy
fantasy that is being shown
these days on television and in
the movies is that it tends to
give people a false sense of se
curity. Most people are hoping
a James Bond, a "Man From
Uncle," or a "Batman" will save
us in Viet Nam.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if
James Bond was called in by his
boss "M"?
"James, we have just re
ceived information that
SMERSH is in league with the
North Vietnamese and they
plan to take over South Viet
Nam."
No Surprise
"I wouldn't put it past them,"
Bond says.
"Unless we stop them, the
United States will become
bogged down in a land war in
Southeast Asia which could, if
escalated, lead to World War
III."
"It sounds serious," Bond re
plies.
"I'm turning the case over to
you. Here is your equipment."
"M" hands him a bandaid.
He explains, "When you rub
your thumb against the gauze,

this bandaid becomes a defolia
tion machine. That's it. They're
waiting for you in Saigon."
Bond flies to Saigon. He's
about to take a shower in his
hotel room with a stewardess
he met on the plane when Am
bassador Lodge, Gen. Westmore
land, and Gen. Ky walk in.
"We couldn't wait for you to
come downtown," Ambassador
Lodge says. "We thought you'd
better be filled in on the picture
right away."
"The truth of the matter,"
Gen. Ky says, "is that we've run
out of ideas. The Viet Cong is
stronger than ever, more troops
are pouring in, and NorthViet
Nam is getting bolder all the
time."
Gen. Westmoreland says, "007
you're our only hope."
Wile's Mr. Big?
Bond starts dressing. "Who is
Mr. Big in this operation?" he
asks.
Ambassador Lodge replies, "A
fellow by the name of Ho Chi
Minh who is believed to live in
Hanoi. We think he's working
with the Chinese."
Bond turns to Gen. Westmore
land. "Can you drop me into Ha
noi?"
Gen. Westmoreland replies,
"We're not allowed to fly over
Hanoi. But we can drop you on
a bridge near it on our next
bombing raid."
"Good. Now could you gen
tlemen suggest a restaurant
where I could get an adequate
bottle of wine?"
Bond is on a B-52. Hanging on
to his parachute is a beautiful
Eurasian girl known as Lots of
Lolly, who is to act as his inter
preter. They both jump together
and land in a haystack.
A North Vietnamese soldier
rushes in and is about to kill
them both when Bond notices
the soldier is a woman. "Kill
her," he says to the woman sol
dier, "but let me go."
The woman soldier shoots Lots
of Lolly. An hour later, as Bond
is getting dressed, he says to
the woman soldier, "Take me to
your leader."
Anything You Want
"Anything you want, James,"
she replies.
She takes Bond to Hanoi and
shows him a secret tunnel which
leads into Ho's palace. But an
alert guard knocks them both
out, and they are dragged,
chained, into the conference
room before Ho and his Chinese
Communist advisors.
Ho laughs. "Ho, ho ,ho, 007,
you thought you could defeat
the Democratic People's Repub
lic, did you?"
Bond says, "Would it be all
right if I put a bandaid on my
right toe?"
"Go ahead," Ho says, "though
you won't live long enough for
it to heal."
Bond rubs the gauze of the
bandaid and suddenly he is hold
ing a defoliation machine in his
hands. "All right, Commies, now
it's my turn to laugh."
"Don't shoot, 007," Ho cries.
"We'll do anything you want."
"Will you go back to the Ge
neva Convention of 1954?" Bond
asks.
"Of course," Ho says,"and
we'll throw in unconditional
talks as well."

come downtown," Ambassador
Lodge says. "We thought you'd
better be filled in on the picture
right away."
"The truth of the matter,"
Gen. Ky says, "is that we've run
out of ideas. The Viet Cong is
stronger than ever, more troops
are pouring in, and NorthViet
Nam is getting bolder all the
time."
Gen. Westmoreland says, "007
you're our only hope."
Wile's Mr. Big?
Bond starts dressing. "Who is
Mr. Big in this operation?" he
asks.
Ambassador Lodge replies, "A
fellow by the name of Ho Chi
Minh who is believed to live in
Hanoi. We think he's working
with the Chinese."
Bond turns to Gen. Westmore
land. "Can you drop me into Ha
noi?"
Gen. Westmoreland replies,
"We're not allowed to fly over
Hanoi. But we can drop you on
a bridge near it on our next
bombing raid."
"Good. Now could you gen
tlemen suggest a restaurant
where I could get an adequate
bottle of wine?"
Bond is on a B-52. Hanging on
to his parachute is a beautiful
Eurasian girl known as Lots of
Lolly, who is to act as his inter
preter. They both jump together
and land in a haystack.
A North Vietnamese soldier
rushes in and is about to kill
them both when Bond notices
the soldier is a woman. "Kill
her," he says to the woman sol
dier, "but let me go."
The woman soldier shoots Lots
of Lolly. An hour later, as Bond
is getting dressed, he says to
the woman soldier, "Take me to
your leader."
Anything You Want
"Anything you want, James,"
she replies.
She takes Bond to Hanoi and
shows him a secret tunnel which
leads into Ho's palace. But an
alert guard knocks them both
out, and they are dragged,
chained, into the conference
room before Ho and his Chinese
Communist advisors.
Ho laughs. "Ho, ho ,ho, 007,
you thought you could defeat
the Democratic People's Repub
lic, did you?"
Bond says, "Would it be all
right if I put a bandaid on my
right toe?"
"Go ahead," Ho says, "though
you won't live long enough for
it to heal."
Bond rubs the gauze of the
bandaid and suddenly he is hold
ing a defoliation machine in his
hands. "All right, Commies, now
it's my turn to laugh."
"Don't shoot, 007," Ho cries.
"We'll do anything you want."
"Will you go back to the Ge
neva Convention of 1954?" Bond
asks.
"Of course," Ho says,"and
we'll throw in unconditional
talks as well."
The trouble with all the spy
fantasy that is being shown
these days on television and in
the movies is that it tends to
give people a false sense of se
curity. Most people are hoping
a James Bond, a "Man From
Uncle," or a "Batman" will save
us in Viet Nam.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if
James Bond was called in by his
boss "M"?
"James, we have just re
ceived information that
SMERSH is in league with the
North Vietnamese and they
plan to take over South Viet
Nam."
No Surprise
"I wouldn't put it past them,"
Bond says.
"Unless we stop them, the
United States will become
bogged down in a land war in
Southeast Asia which could, if
escalated, lead to World War
III."
"It sounds serious," Bond re
plies.
"I'm turning the case over to
you. Here is your equipment."
"M" hands him a bandaid.
He explains, "When you rub
your thumb against the gauze,

this bandaid becomes a defolia
tion machine. That's it. They're
waiting for you in Saigon."
Bond flies to Saigon. He's
about to take a shower in his
hotel room with a stewardess
he met on the plane when Am
bassador Lodge, Gen. Westmore
land, and Gen. Ky walk in.
"We couldn't wait for you to
come downtown," Ambassador
Lodge says. "We thought you'd

Gen. Ky says, "is that we've run

is getting dressed, he says to
the woman soldier, "Take me to
your leader."
Anything You Want
"Anything you want, James,"
she replies.
She takes Bond to Hanoi and
shows him a secret tunnel which
leads into Ho's palace. But an
alert guard knocks them both
out, and they are dragged,
chained, into the conference
room before Ho and his Chinese
Communist advisors.
Ho laughs. "Ho, ho ,ho, 007,
you thought you could defeat
the Democratic People's Repub
lic, did you?"
Bond says, "Would it be all
right if I put a bandaid on my
right toe?"
"Go ahead," Ho says, "though
you won't live long enough for
it to heal."
Bond rubs the gauze of the
bandaid and suddenly he is hold
ing a defoliation machine in his
hands. "All right, Commies, now
it's my turn to laugh."
"Don't shoot, 007," Ho cries.
"We'll do anything you want."
"Will you go back to the Ge
neva Convention of 1954?" Bond
asks.
"Of course," Ho says,"and
we'll throw in unconditional
talks as well."
