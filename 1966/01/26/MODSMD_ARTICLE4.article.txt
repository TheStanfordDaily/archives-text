# WATTS DECLARES:
## Artificial Ego Prevents Harmony 
### 
Dr. Allan Watts, an authority on
Zen Bhuddism, presented a philoso
phy of universal unity to a packed
house at Dinkekspiel Auditorium last
night. The artificially created ego is
preventing man from living in har
mony with the universe, he said.
"The world outside our skin is as
much a part of our body as that
which is inside," Watts explained,
therefore we should not be sympa
thetic to the analytical approach of
modern technology, because it is con
trary to the natural unity of all exist
ence.
By describing the destruction of Cal
ifornia's natural beauty by that tech
nology known as the "Los Angeliza
tion of the world" Watts struck a re
sponsive chord with the audience,

which several times interrupted him
with applause and laughter.
Increased Sensitivity Needed
Watts, who graduated from th e
Seabury-Western Theological Semi
nary, attacked the current means of
exploring outer space as contrary to
the intelligent platt of the universe.
A more sensible means, he said,
would be to "increase our sensitivity"
to the world by refining such tech
niques as radar so that we could ex
plore space from here on earth.
That type of technology which we
are currently pursuing assumes a bas
ic unfriendliness of the cosmos. It ig
nores the fact that everyone is inti
mately tied to this friendly world by
the very fact that human beings are
as naturally suited to life here as

"the fruit which grows on a tree."
According to Zen Bhuddism, the
ficticious division of the world into
separate things is contradictory to the
very nature of the world. The entire
universe is a continium containing no
discrete "things."
Confused Awareness
This division of the world into
parts comes about because the intel
lect cannot grasp the entirety of the
world at once. So it breaks it up into
parts which it names; these names be
came the "things" which now confuse
man's awareness, explained Watts.
Zen teaches that man must over
come his feeling of alienation from
the world and achieve a greater un
derstanding of tho unity of all things.
If he can accomplish this, he will be

in a "position of great power" and
can act in accord with nature instead
of at cross purposes with it, said Dr.
Watts.
The greatest obstacle which man
must overcome, he stated, was that
"he identifies himself with his con
scious attention and voluntary will
and so is peculiarly cut off from him
self." The first step toward perfec
tion is to realize that, even though he
cannot explain how, each man "makes
the wind blow and the sea wave."
"All Men An? God"
The only problem with this realiza
tion, he stated, was that Westerners
were then likely to think that they
were God, and so should be revered
by all other men. This response would
never arise in Eastern cultures, be
cause their people accept the fact that
all men are God because they are all
one with the universe, so they would
not demand others to worship them.
In this state of enlightenment, man
can not explain how the universe
runs "any more than you can now
'explain' how you open and close your
hand," Watts said. "It is not a matter
which is explainable in words, the en
lightened man would reply, it is sim
ply willed."
in a lively question and answer pe
riod which followed the speech, Dr.
Watts explained that life's purpose is
not to "get somewhere. We're already
there and we just don't know it."
Man's purpose was to understand that
he is in unity with the world and to
respond to all men and to the uni
verse accordingly.

must overcome, he stated, was that
"he identifies himself with his con
scious attention and voluntary will
and so is peculiarly cut off from him
self." The first step toward perfec
tion is to realize that, even though he
cannot explain how, each man "makes
the wind blow and the sea wave."
"All Men An? God"
The only problem with this realiza
tion, he stated, was that Westerners
were then likely to think that they
were God, and so should be revered
by all other men. This response would
never arise in Eastern cultures, be
cause their people accept the fact that
all men are God because they are all
one with the universe, so they would
not demand others to worship them.
In this state of enlightenment, man
can not explain how the universe
runs "any more than you can now
'explain' how you open and close your
hand," Watts said. "It is not a matter
which is explainable in words, the en
lightened man would reply, it is sim
ply willed."
in a lively question and answer pe
riod which followed the speech, Dr.
Watts explained that life's purpose is
not to "get somewhere. We're already
there and we just don't know it."
Man's purpose was to understand that
he is in unity with the world and to
respond to all men and to the uni
verse accordingly.
Dr. Allan Watts, an authority on
Zen Bhuddism, presented a philoso
phy of universal unity to a packed
house at Dinkekspiel Auditorium last
night. The artificially created ego is
preventing man from living in har
mony with the universe, he said.
"The world outside our skin is as
much a part of our body as that
which is inside," Watts explained,
therefore we should not be sympa
thetic to the analytical approach of
modern technology, because it is con
trary to the natural unity of all exist
ence.
By describing the destruction of Cal
ifornia's natural beauty by that tech
nology known as the "Los Angeliza
tion of the world" Watts struck a re
sponsive chord with the audience,

which several times interrupted him
with applause and laughter.
Increased Sensitivity Needed
Watts, who graduated from th e
Seabury-Western Theological Semi
nary, attacked the current means of
exploring outer space as contrary to
the intelligent platt of the universe.
A more sensible means, he said,
would be to "increase our sensitivity"
to the world by refining such tech
niques as radar so that we could ex
plore space from here on earth.
That type of technology which we
are currently pursuing assumes a bas
ic unfriendliness of the cosmos. It ig
nores the fact that everyone is inti
mately tied to this friendly world by
the very fact that human beings are
as naturally suited to life here as

"the fruit which grows on a tree."
According to Zen Bhuddism, the
ficticious division of the world into
separate things is contradictory to the
very nature of the world. The entire
universe is a continium containing no
discrete "things."
Confused Awareness
This division of the world into
parts comes about because the intel
lect cannot grasp the entirety of the
world at once. So it breaks it up into
parts which it names; these names be
came the "things" which now confuse
man's awareness, explained Watts.
Zen teaches that man must over
come his feeling of alienation from
the world and achieve a greater un
derstanding of tho unity of all things.
If he can accomplish this, he will be

in a "position of great power" and
can act in accord with nature instead
of at cross purposes with it, said Dr.
Watts.
