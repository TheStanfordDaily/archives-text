## Faculty Strike In Fourth Week 
### HENRY ALLEY NEIL RIFENBARK 
The faculty of St. John's Univer
sity, one of the largest Roman Cath
olic colleges in the world, is beginning
its fourth week of striking. On Janu
ary 4, the strike came to both the
Brooklyn and Jamaica campuses
when 31 teachers were dismissed. For
ten months, the faculty had been
asking the administration for more
power in university affairs.

Although 7f) per cent of the Brook
lyn campus students and 90 per cent
of the Jamaica campus students have
been attending classes, the St. John
Student called a boycott of both
campuses a week after the faculty
strike had begun. The organization
decided to keep classes empty "until
such time as our striking faculty
and the administration enter into di
rect negotiations."
Many thought this action gave di
rect support to the teachers' position,
but the Union claimed that it was not
taking sides. However, the U. S. Na
tional Student Association is spon
soring a March for St. John's this Fri
day to "call for the reinstatement of
the faculty members who were dis
missed by the St. John's administra
tion." The NSA is inviting "all mem
bers of the academic community" to
join the marches at the two campuses.
Boycott Hurts Students
St. John's President, the Very Rev
erend Joseph T. Cahill. said that the
student boycott would only hurt the
students themselves. One day after
the Union's decision, students re
turned to their classes because they
were standing the risk of losing aca
demic credits.
During the past year, the St. John
faculty has tried to get a greater say
in administration matters. The con
flict, however, became worse when
the 31 teachers were asked to leave.
The United Federation of College
Teachers (UFCT) headed the strike,
and on January 5, it claimed that 200
out of 651 teachers had honored the
picket lines.
Conflict Grows
A spokesman for NSA said, "The
present crisis at St. John's Univer

sity was caused by some of the grav
est violations of educational princi
ples that have ever occurred in the
United States. The wholesale dismis
sal of faculty members by the St.
John's administration on December
16th was the culmination of a long
series of actions in which the St.
John's administration first ignored,
then evaded, and finally defied the
most basic traditions of academic
freedom.''
On Wednesday, January 7, the
striking and dismissed teachers, un
der the authority of the UFCT, op
ened a small school next to the New
York City university. This alien cam
pus enabled students to continue
their studies while the faculty and
administration were argueing. The
Reverand Peter O'Reilly, strike chair
man and one ol the university teach
ers. planned to give a course in phil
osophical psychology. The first for
mal classes of the "university in ex
ile" were hold last week.
Most of the "exile" classes begin
in the afternoon. Class schedules were
being distributed on the St. John's
campuses. A union spokesman said
that the "exile university" would not
seek accreditation and would not help
students complete degree require
ments. It is merely a means of keep
ing students in touch with their reg
ular instructors, he said.
Administrations View
On the administrations side, how
ever. the Reverend Joseph T. Tinnel
ly, special counsel to the school's
trustees, said that the strike was not
well founded. At a meeting of stu
dent representatives, lie said that
none of the 31 dismissed teachers had
been fired.
