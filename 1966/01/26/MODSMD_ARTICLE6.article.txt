# Napalm Factory President Will Meet SCPV Monday
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
The management of United Tech
nology Center, makers of napalm
bombs, has agreed to meet with rep
resentatives of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam on Mon
day. R. Allan Barnet, president of the
Sunnyvale firm, will discuss the con
tention that there are moral issues
raised by thep roduction of napalm
weapons at the UTC Coyote plant.
Four SCPV representatives went
to the UTC offices yesterday after
noon to ask to speak and supply in
formation to workers. "We want to
make them fully aware of the conse
quences of what they are doing,"
Cyril Sia, a member of the delegation,
explained.
Richard Peryam, of the UTC public
relations office, said that it is com
pany policy not to allow solicitation
on company property. He declined to
answer any further questions, saying
only that "we intend to fulfill the
contract and any other tasks our
government assigns us."
Everyone Partially Responsible
In addition to Sia, the SCPV was
represented by Asistant Professor of

English, Bruce Franklin, Keith Lowe
and Steve Marx. Claiming everyone
working for the company is partially
responsible for the weapon, Franklin
pressed for discussion on an indi
vidual basis. UTC officials were not
interested. They promptly ended the
interview because "there is nothing
further to be gained by talking now."
The confrontation was covered ex
tensively by the press, wire services
and television news.
UTC, a division of United Aircraft,
has a $230,000 contract to design and
fabricate units to mix napalm and
fill the containers. Napalm is a jelly
like gasoline which ignites when it
hits the ground.
Nationwide Campaign
The SCPV is organizing a nation
wide campaign against napalm pro
duction for use in the Vietnam war.
The group is attempting to bring a
citizens suit against UTC for produc
ing napalm without a use permit
from Santa Clara County.
"Our ultimate goal," Sia said, "is to
halt the production and use of napalm
altogether."
In a letter to UTC officials, the
SCVP stressed the "horror of hun
dreds of million people around the
world over the United States' use of
napalm."
"Innocent Civilians Burned"
"Splashing over a wide area and
aimed with a minimum of control, the
napalm furiously burns anyone it
touches. In the confused jungle war

fare in Vietnam, innocent civilians
have been burned by the napalm
bombs—as we all know from photo
graphs."
The letter called for compassion:
"We are sure that if you could actual
ly see the bodies of the victims of
your weapon, you would turn your
vast resources to some less inhumane
enterprise."
The SCPV is considering distribut
ing leaflets this afternoon at either
the UTC offices or plant, or both. The
3000 acre plant is located near San
Jose.
"The next action will be designed
to reach the workers themselves. We
also want to call public attention to
this situation," Marx explained.
The use permit, issued Dec. 4, 1963,
mentions only manufacture of "rock
et propellants or rocket propulsion
systems."
It states:
"Permittee shall not construct any
facilities for fabrication purposes up
on the subject property without both
architectural and site approval first
had and obtained under procedures
provided by applicable zoning ordi
nances.
"For the purposes of this condition,
'fabrication' shall be defined and
deem e d to be the manufacture of
rocket propellants or rocket propul
sion systems for removal from the
subject property for purposes other
than research, development or test
ing."

"The next action will be designed
to reach the workers themselves. We
also want to call public attention to
this situation," Marx explained.
The use permit, issued Dec. 4, 1963,
mentions only manufacture of "rock
et propellants or rocket propulsion
systems."
It states:
"Permittee shall not construct any
facilities for fabrication purposes up
on the subject property without both
architectural and site approval first
had and obtained under procedures
provided by applicable zoning ordi
nances.
"For the purposes of this condition,
'fabrication' shall be defined and
deem e d to be the manufacture of
rocket propellants or rocket propul
sion systems for removal from the
subject property for purposes other
than research, development or test
ing."
The management of United Tech
nology Center, makers of napalm
bombs, has agreed to meet with rep
resentatives of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam on Mon
day. R. Allan Barnet, president of the
Sunnyvale firm, will discuss the con
tention that there are moral issues
raised by thep roduction of napalm
weapons at the UTC Coyote plant.
Four SCPV representatives went
to the UTC offices yesterday after
noon to ask to speak and supply in
formation to workers. "We want to
make them fully aware of the conse
quences of what they are doing,"
Cyril Sia, a member of the delegation,
explained.
Richard Peryam, of the UTC public
relations office, said that it is com
pany policy not to allow solicitation
on company property. He declined to
answer any further questions, saying
only that "we intend to fulfill the
contract and any other tasks our
government assigns us."
Everyone Partially Responsible
In addition to Sia, the SCPV was
represented by Asistant Professor of

English, Bruce Franklin, Keith Lowe
and Steve Marx. Claiming everyone
working for the company is partially
responsible for the weapon, Franklin
pressed for discussion on an indi
vidual basis. UTC officials were not
interested. They promptly ended the
interview because "there is nothing
further to be gained by talking now."
The confrontation was covered ex
tensively by the press, wire services
and television news.
UTC, a division of United Aircraft,
has a $230,000 contract to design and
fabricate units to mix napalm and
fill the containers. Napalm is a jelly
like gasoline which ignites when it
hits the ground.
Nationwide Campaign
The SCPV is organizing a nation
wide campaign against napalm pro
duction for use in the Vietnam war.
The group is attempting to bring a
citizens suit against UTC for produc
ing napalm without a use permit
from Santa Clara County.
"Our ultimate goal," Sia said, "is to
halt the production and use of napalm
altogether."
In a letter to UTC officials, the
SCVP stressed the "horror of hun
dreds of million people around the
world over the United States' use of
napalm."
"Innocent Civilians Burned"
"Splashing over a wide area and
aimed with a minimum of control, the
napalm furiously burns anyone it
touches. In the confused jungle war

fare in Vietnam, innocent civilians
have been burned by the napalm
bombs—as we all know from photo
graphs."
The letter called for compassion:
"We are sure that if you could actual
ly see the bodies of the victims of
your weapon, you would turn your
vast resources to some less inhumane
enterprise."
The SCPV is considering distribut
ing leaflets this afternoon at either
the UTC offices or plant, or both. The
3000 acre plant is located near San
Jose.
