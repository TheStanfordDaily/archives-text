# Prot Rivers Claims Johnson Causes Own Press Failure
## 
### 
President Johnson's press relations
arc failing for a variety of reasons,
one of which is because "he is incap
able of personal chagrin," William
Rivers, associate professor of com
munication at Stanford, told a Tues
day Evening Scries audience here last
night.
Rivers, former Washington corres
pondent for The Reporter magazine
and authoi of "The Opinionnnikers,"
said that with all the historical prece
dent from Washington to Kennedy
going for him. LBJ has failed to
"shape and hone" his pivss relations
to get the media on his side.
"It's understandable," Prof. Rivers
told the Dinkclspiel Auditorium audi
ence, "how our presidents have used
tiie press for their own purposes.
"Our system is based on the need

for a public official to win public sup
port. Rut he finds it necessary, of
course, to go through the mass media
to reach the public.
"No wonder we have evidence
throughout our history of the Presi
dent using threats and bribes, silence
and oratory, lies and varying degrees
of the truth in trying to bend the
media to his point of view."
Prof. Rivers pointed out that the
press and the government are like
attorneys in a legal battle "friendly
enemies, trying to serve the cause of
justice from opposing perspectives."
"Roth can claim the public interest
as their- ultimate aim. (sometimes
speciously), and it is the duty of the
analyst outside both press and gov
ernment to try to determine when
each is actually serving selfish ends,"
he said.
