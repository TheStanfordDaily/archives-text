• Suslov Pledges War Aid
ROME — Soviet Communist ideol
ogist Mikhail Suslov pledged last
night, at the Italian Communist par
ty's national congress, that the So
viet people "will fulfill their interna
tional duty toward the brotherly peo
ple of Vietnam."
Suslov, a Soviet party secretary
and head of its delegation here, was
thunderously applauded when he took
the floor at the second day of the
week-long congress.
The gathering of more than 1,000
Communists rose before he began
talking and applauded a message
sent by the North Vietnamese Work

ers' party. Delegates chanted the
name of North Vietnam Premier Ho
Chi-Minh.
The message was one of thanks
for the solidarity of "all the Commu
nist parties in the world." It pledged
that North Vietnam would continue
fighting "until the final victory."
• Labor Party Faces Vote
HULL, England — The life of Prime
Minister Harold Wilson's Labor gov
ernment could be at stake today in
a special parliamentary election influ
enced by factors ranging from the
local party machines to the war in
Vietnam.
The vigorous and complicated cam

paign closed Wednesday night with
the outcome sure to be close. Book
makers put the odds 13-8 on Labor
and 11-10 against the Conservatives,
but most election eve bets were for
a Conservative victory.
Such a victory would give the Tor
ies a tremendous boost nationally and

cut Wilson's majority in the House
of Commons to one vote.

son is expected to issue soon orders

• 4-Year Terms In House?
WASHINGTON — A constitutional
amendment to provide four-year

terms for House members, with all of
them to be elected between presiden
tial elections, was introduced Wed
nesday by Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa.
President Johnson, in his State of
the Union message, urged doubling
the present two-year terms of House
members but he proposed they be
elected concurrently with presiden
tial elections.
Scott objected to the President's
proposal, saying such action "de
prives the public of any opportunity
to correct the excesses of a strong
president or the mistakes of a weak
one."
