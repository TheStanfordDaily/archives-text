# CONSCIENCE Plans High School Program
## 
### 
The Committee On National
Student Citizenship In Every
Case of Emergency, better
known as CONSCIENCE, an
nounced today that it is
undertaking an educational pro

gram aimed at high-school sen
iors. The program will be co
ordinated by the CONSCIENCE
Committee on Civic-Action.
Jim Rummonds, organizer
and chairman of the civic-action

program for CONSCIENCE an
nounced that the new program
will begin this Saturday with a
meeting at Stanford of repre
sentatives from some 16 penin
sula high-schools. Over 50 rep
resentatives are expected to at
tend the conference.
Acting through student body
and senior class presidents, the
Civic-Action Committee has
found a "very enthusiastic re
sponse from most of the officers
contacted," according to Rum
monds. In many cases the two
presidents themselves will head
their respective high school's
delegation.
Upon contacting the high
schools by phone, Rummonds
stated that some of the adminis
tration officials were reticent in
giving out any information "for
fear of having the minds of the
youth corrupted, but for the
most part were very cooperat
ive."
"The program," says Rum
monds, "will have several pur
poses. The main thing we are
trying to do is acquaint these
high school students with a
problem that is a very real con
cern to them. Many of them will
be going into the service in a
matter of months and there
should be some attempt to bring
to their attention some of the
fundamental problems underly
ing the war."
The Saturdady morning pro
gram will include speakers rep
resenting all phases of CON
SCIENCE activity. Hal Scott
and Mike Cummings, founders
of the CONSCIENCE move
ment, will speak on past and
future activity of the parent
organization and the structure
of its national foundation cov
ering all fifty states.
Terry Hopman and Jim Rum
monds, members of national
executive committee, will speak
on the problems and ramifica
tions of the Viet Nam war and
the future participation of the
high school action committees
in the continuing Viet Nam dia
logue. The representatives will
then be schooled on how to de
velop committees within their
own schools.
Rummonds said that ultimat
ely what they hope to do is offer
to the high schools a program
in the form of assemblies,
wherein the students could par
ticipate and achieve a better un
derstanding of the war in South
east Asia.
