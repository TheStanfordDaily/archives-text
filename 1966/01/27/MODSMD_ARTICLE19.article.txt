# IIR Ends Twentieth Year; Group Largest On Campus

First Of A Series
The Stanford Institute of In
ternational Relations was found
ed in 1946 and if bigness is a
measure of success, the lIR has
had a smashing twenty years.
Aside from the student body
itself, the lIR is the single
largest organization on the
Stanford campus, with more
vice-presidents, office space and
irons in the fire than one can
accurately compute.
The Institute had a modest be
ginning in 1946, when a group
of students got together and
decided they would like to do
something about wounded inter
national relations. Firm back
ing for the organization came
from the '46 chapter of the
American Veterans Committee
on campus, a group with special
interest in international mat
ters.

In 1946, the AVC was a pow
erful and active organization,
with a lare membership and
capable a publicity director.
"We aim to achieve a more
democratic and prosperous Am
erica and a more stable world,"
its leaders declared, and they
founded the new institute "to
create more student interest and
understanding in international
issues, which have been especial
ly disrupted at this time."
Additional Members
During the '50's the lIR
added more members and posi
tions to its ranks, and concen
trated for the most part on
bringing speakers to the campus
to speak on foreign policy. The
oragnization also sponsored a
number of panel discussions.
These grew in popularity and
frequency as the cold war
caused ai increase in interna
tional tensions.

In 1957, a short while after
the Russians had launched their
famous Sputnik, the leaders of
the lIR decided to boost the ac
tivities of the organization and
to take an active part in trying
to improve relations "instead of
just sitting around and talking
about them."
"New Institute"
On October 10th President
Craig Earner started the "New
Institute" by sending letters to
the United Nations. "We've de
cided," he explained, "to send
ideas of our members on current
international problems to both
the UN and men in the national
government, who have responsi
bility for these problems."

Aside from the student body
itself, the lIR is the single
largest organization on the
Stanford campus, with more
vice-presidents, office space and
irons in the fire than one can
accurately compute.
The Institute had a modest be
ginning in 1946, when a group
of students got together and
decided they would like to do
something about wounded inter
national relations. Firm back
ing for the organization came
from the '46 chapter of the
American Veterans Committee
on campus, a group with special
interest in international mat
ters.

In 1946, the AVC was a pow
erful and active organization,
with a lare membership and
capable a publicity director.
"We aim to achieve a more
democratic and prosperous Am
erica and a more stable world,"
its leaders declared, and they
founded the new institute "to
create more student interest and
understanding in international
issues, which have been especial
ly disrupted at this time."
Additional Members
During the '50's the lIR
added more members and posi
tions to its ranks, and concen
trated for the most part on
bringing speakers to the campus
to speak on foreign policy. The
oragnization also sponsored a
number of panel discussions.
These grew in popularity and
frequency as the cold war
caused ai increase in interna
tional tensions.

In 1957, a short while after
the Russians had launched their
famous Sputnik, the leaders of
the lIR decided to boost the ac
tivities of the organization and
to take an active part in trying
to improve relations "instead of
just sitting around and talking
about them."
"New Institute"
On October 10th President
Craig Earner started the "New
Institute" by sending letters to
the United Nations. "We've de
cided," he explained, "to send
ideas of our members on current
international problems to both
the UN and men in the national
government, who have responsi
bility for these problems."
