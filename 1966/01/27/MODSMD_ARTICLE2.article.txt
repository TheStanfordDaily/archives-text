# Godless Theology 'Clinging'
## The 						Axe! 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
"Faith requires a reverent destruc
tion of all images of God. The dis
couraging part about the new the
ology, in its effort to make the church
speak to conditions of the times, is
its clinging to the historical Jesus
and the Bible."
Were it to relinquish these images,
Christianity would arrive at a faith
that needs no defense, Alan Watts,
eating club guest-in-residence, told a
standing room audience in the Tresid
der lounges last night.
Speaking on "Atheism in the Name
of God," the authority on Eastern
thought developed a concept of faith
for the modern scientific environ
ment.
Belief: "To Cling"
Belief, he explained, derived from
terms meaning "to cling." But images
can not be relied upon in a relativistic
universe where things are defined by
the location of the observer.
"In this fluid situation, there is no
firm framework to cling to; what is
called for is intellectual swimming,
trusting the water of our environ
ment and giving of the self to it,"
he said.
"Faith is thus to open one's mind
and heart to whatever is, to accept
the truth that one has nothing to
hang on to, that there is no alterna
tive but to meet the risk of letting go
of all anchors."
In attempting to construct a relig
ious Christianity, modern theology is
on the right track. But it must
destroy all images. "An image is
necessary only to be broken. Like an
egg shell, it nurtures life which is
then let out."
One conception which must be re
constructed is that of the church.
"The true function of a priest is to
offer a sacrifice; the mass is the
bringing of life through the sacrific-

ial death of Christ." The Church is
identified as the body of Christ and
Is therefore vital only so long as it
is breaking itself."
"The Church must be self-destroy
ing," he stated.
The meaning of the consecration
of the bread at the last supper was
Jesus' implication that "all life you
eat is me; I come from the Godhead."
In contrast to the East, which con
ceptualizes the world as a manifesta
tion of the Godhead, the West has
thought of God as transcendant.
He is the artificer who has made
the world. But he is also continually
judging it. The resultant restlessness
caused by the development of the
scientific explanation of the universe
is "a mindless construct in which
man's own existence is a fluke. The
result of scientific naturalism is man
battling with his mother, nature, for
his existence. He is alone, separate
from the world."


As if you didn't know. The Axe is
back in its accustomed spot in Tresid
der. There arc lots of reasons it's
been away for so long. Namely, the
case that holds it has just recovered
from the last burglary attempt. Any
way, our very own head-chopper has
been resting up in the bank lo these
many months, which is where it was
if you were wondering.

"The Church must be self-destroy

The meaning of the consecration
of the bread at the last supper was
Jesus' implication that "all life you
eat is me; I come from the Godhead."
In contrast to the East, which con
ceptualizes the world as a manifesta
tion of the Godhead, the West has
thought of God as transcendant.
He is the artificer who has made
the world. But he is also continually
judging it. The resultant restlessness
caused by the development of the
scientific explanation of the universe
is "a mindless construct in which
man's own existence is a fluke. The
result of scientific naturalism is man
battling with his mother, nature, for
his existence. He is alone, separate
from the world."


As if you didn't know. The Axe is

"Faith requires a reverent destruc
tion of all images of God. The dis
couraging part about the new the
ology, in its effort to make the church
speak to conditions of the times, is
its clinging to the historical Jesus
and the Bible."
Were it to relinquish these images,
Christianity would arrive at a faith
that needs no defense, Alan Watts,
eating club guest-in-residence, told a
standing room audience in the Tresid
der lounges last night.
Speaking on "Atheism in the Name
of God," the authority on Eastern
thought developed a concept of faith
for the modern scientific environ
ment.
Belief: "To Cling"
Belief, he explained, derived from
terms meaning "to cling." But images
can not be relied upon in a relativistic
universe where things are defined by
the location of the observer.
"In this fluid situation, there is no
firm framework to cling to; what is
called for is intellectual swimming,
trusting the water of our environ
ment and giving of the self to it,"
he said.
"Faith is thus to open one's mind
and heart to whatever is, to accept
the truth that one has nothing to
hang on to, that there is no alterna
tive but to meet the risk of letting go
of all anchors."
In attempting to construct a relig
ious Christianity, modern theology is
on the right track. But it must
destroy all images. "An image is
necessary only to be broken. Like an
egg shell, it nurtures life which is
then let out."
One conception which must be re
constructed is that of the church.
"The true function of a priest is to
offer a sacrifice; the mass is the
bringing of life through the sacrific-

ial death of Christ." The Church is
identified as the body of Christ and
Is therefore vital only so long as it
is breaking itself."
