# 'UTC Workers Intimidated' Claims Vietnam Committee
## 
### 
The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam believes its
efforts to distribute pamphlets
to workers at the United Tech
nology Center at Coyote were
thwarted by the management of
the plant.
Eight people attempted to
pass out pamphlets describing
napalm, a flammable gas used
in the war in Vietnam, and pro
duced at the Center. "Workers
were reluctant to take the in
formation as they left the
plant," said Keith Lowe, a mem
ber of the SCPV's steering com
mittee.
"Wo were not allowed to
.speak with the workers nor
enter the property," he reported.
"Two Santa Clara sheriff cars
and company security men were
there to see to it that we stayed
out."
Richard Peryman, of the UTC
public relations office, said that
it is company policy not to al

low solicitation on company
property.
"But the company also hired
photographers, and workers
may have been intimidated by
this threat. Only 14 cars stop
ped at the gates to take the
leaflets, while at the junction of
Highway 101 and Metcalf,
where there were no photo
graphers, we gave out 30 pam
phlets."
The team is returning tomor
row to see if it leaflets had any
effect on the workers. The liter
ature describes napalm and
poses the moral question of pro
ducing the gas.
The management of the Cen
ter is meeting with a delegation
of representatives of all the
peace groups in the area on
Monday.
