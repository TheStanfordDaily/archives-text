The Lenox String Quartet, ac

music, will be featured in a six

part of Stanford University's
1966 Summer Festival of the

Repertory for concerts by the
quartet will center in the ex

1939 period, which provides the

The complete Bartok and
Schoenberg quartet cycles will

Ravel, Webern, Berg and Stra
vinsky. Occasional "classical"
works will be included for bal

pearance, Stephen pro

Lenox Quartet truly represents
the '20th Century Innovations'
which are the theme of our 1966
program. Its excellent as pro
tagonists of this music and its
versatility within the classics
combine to make them an ideal
festival attraction.
"Their repertory has an ex
citing 'inclusive' quality. The
Bartok cycle, for Instance, spans
the years 1908-1939, and the four
Schoenberg quartets range from
1905 to 1936."
In addition to the five eve
ning and one Sunday matinee
