# CONGRESSIONAL RACE
## Leppert States Stand 
### KIM BELL 
In an interview with the
Stanford Daily yesterday,
George Leppert. the Democrat
ic candidate for Congress in the
10th District of Santa Clara
County, discussed the founda
tions for His political platform
and told of his new method of
campaigning.
Professor Leppert, who is a
member of Stanford's Depart
ment at Engineer! n g, has
planned a series of public lec-
panel discussions "to
fill AT need of the people of his
district, for more public infor
mation on vital national and lo
cal issues."
The lecture series will begin
at 8 p.m. tomorrow at West Val

ley Junior College with a speech
by John Kaplan, another Stan
ford professor and author of the
controversial book. The Trial of
Jack Ruby. Professor Kaplan
will speak on the strengths and
weaknesses of the adversary
system of justice.
Succeeding: Meetings
Succeeding meetings will be
held monthly in different areas
of the district. The second pro
gram will be a discussion on
"Religion and the Secular Socie
ty" by a panel of two ministers
and a layman skilled in reli
gious affairs. They will concern
themselves with the workings
of an organized society and the
religion of the people who com
prise the society. A lecture on

recent oceanographic research
and Its possible effects on the
local industry of the future is
still in the planning stages.
However, Professor Leppert
said that the major issue of his
campaign is the Vietnam War.
In his opinion, America should
strive for four goals: an imme
diate cease-fire, a continued ces
sation of bombing, a clearly-evi
dent willingness to negotiate,
and a firm rejection of nation
al pressures to escalate the war.
When asked as to whom he
thought could represent the
North Vietnamese interests at
the conference table, Professor
Leppert answered that, "it
seems that the concern in Hanoi
is not as great as it is among
the Viet Cong and consequent
ly a representative delegation
would necessarily include the
negotiations should be held
along the lines of the 1954 Ge
neva Accords."
Teaching Career
Asked if he would relinquish
his career as an educator if he
were elected, Leppert said that
he would take advantage of the
University's policy of a two year
political leave of absence and
if he were re-elected he would
resign from Stanford.
In conclusion Professor Lep
pert pointed to the need for a
technically competent repre
sentative in Congress by this
community that is so dependent
on defense industries.
Moreover, he wishes to show
to the people of Santa Clara
County the many peace-time
pursuits to which industry can
devote itself with a little adjust
ment.

would necessarily include the
negotiations should be held
along the lines of the 1954 Ge
neva Accords."
Teaching Career
Asked if he would relinquish
his career as an educator if he
were elected, Leppert said that
he would take advantage of the
University's policy of a two year
political leave of absence and
if he were re-elected he would
resign from Stanford.
In conclusion Professor Lep
pert pointed to the need for a
technically competent repre
sentative in Congress by this
community that is so dependent
on defense industries.
Moreover, he wishes to show
to the people of Santa Clara
County the many peace-time
pursuits to which industry can
devote itself with a little adjust
ment.
In an interview with the
Stanford Daily yesterday,
George Leppert. the Democrat
ic candidate for Congress in the
10th District of Santa Clara
County, discussed the founda
tions for His political platform
and told of his new method of
campaigning.
Professor Leppert, who is a
member of Stanford's Depart
ment at Engineer! n g, has
planned a series of public lec-
panel discussions "to
fill AT need of the people of his
district, for more public infor
mation on vital national and lo
cal issues."
The lecture series will begin
at 8 p.m. tomorrow at West Val

ley Junior College with a speech
by John Kaplan, another Stan
ford professor and author of the
controversial book. The Trial of
Jack Ruby. Professor Kaplan
will speak on the strengths and
weaknesses of the adversary
system of justice.
Succeeding: Meetings
Succeeding meetings will be
held monthly in different areas
of the district. The second pro
gram will be a discussion on
"Religion and the Secular Socie
ty" by a panel of two ministers
and a layman skilled in reli
gious affairs. They will concern
themselves with the workings
of an organized society and the
religion of the people who com
prise the society. A lecture on

recent oceanographic research
and Its possible effects on the
local industry of the future is
still in the planning stages.
However, Professor Leppert
said that the major issue of his
campaign is the Vietnam War.
In his opinion, America should
strive for four goals: an imme
diate cease-fire, a continued ces
sation of bombing, a clearly-evi
dent willingness to negotiate,
and a firm rejection of nation
al pressures to escalate the war.
When asked as to whom he
thought could represent the
North Vietnamese interests at
the conference table, Professor
Leppert answered that, "it
seems that the concern in Hanoi
is not as great as it is among
the Viet Cong and consequent
ly a representative delegation
would necessarily include the
negotiations should be held
along the lines of the 1954 Ge
neva Accords."
