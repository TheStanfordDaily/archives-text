# SIERRA CAMP
## Summer Vacation Bliss 'This Land Is Your Land..' 
### MARSHA COOK Feature Editor 
You won't find it on a map. And no signs direct you to its se
cluded location. But the Stanford Sierra Camp is there —hidden
away on the south shore of Fallen Leaf Lake, just five miles from
Lake Tahoe, the casinos, and Mt. Tallac.
Offering delicious food, refreshing company, and a bevy of ac
tivities for the children, the Sierra Camp is a parent's dream. Yet
many faculty, alumni, and administrators have yet to take advan
tage of the fine family facilities.

Soon to be under the control
the Alumni Association, the
camp has been owned by Stan
ford for over two decades. This
summer asistant football coach
Mike White will manage the
camp, which houses and feeds
over 200 guests a week.
A Mother's Delight
Wives and mothers especial
ly enjoy the Sierra Camp, for it
relieves them of childcare and
cooking.
In the morning The Papoose
Playground supervises small
youngsters who are taught
songs, fingerpainting, drawing,
when they aren't climbing on,
or destroying, the playground
equipment. Babysitting is easily
arranged with the employees.
The afternoon features Kid
die Beach, supervised swimming
for the children.
During the pre-dinner Happy
Hour the Recreation staff
reads stories while the parents
adjourn for relaxation and re
covery from the rigors of the
outdoors.
Organized But Optional
Your time is your own. In the
evening movies, campfires,
folk dancing, faculty lectures,
teen dances, and a grand "Fun
Night" talent show are scat
tered throughout the week.
A large fire warms the lobby
where coffee is served late at
night, and Bridge, chess, read
ing, and singing can co-exist, not
offensive to the peace.
Just a few minutes from the
camp are golf, horseback rid
ing. and ice-skating.
The most popular sport is wa
ter skiing, and free beginning
instruction is offered. Other wa
terfront activities include swim
ming, boating, and fishing.
Boats can be rented at all hours.
Safe, Sane, Satisfying
If you're not out on the ten
nis courts or hiking through
the towering Sierra-Nevadas,
you may be devouring the glor
ious cuisine. Prepared by facul
ty and students from San Fran
cisco City College, the meals are
a highpoint of the day.
On Sunday the afternoon buf
fet is served in the tradition of
the finest restaurants, often in
cluding crab, shrimp, and fresh
strawberries (not in one dish,
however).
Waitresses in red skirts and
white blouses serve the large
meals family style, and the large
redwood dining room is condu*
cive to "good talk" and relaxa
tion.
A special bonus: there is no

poison oak, and rattlesnakes
have yet to be reported.
A Big Deal
Each family usually stays for
a week, though some have
stayed for three. Considering
the would-be expense of motels
and eating out, costs at the
camp are minimal.
Exact information can be ob
tained from the Alumni Asso
ciation at Bowman Alumni
House. The camp opens this
June IB and closes September
10.
No dogs, cats or other pets
are allowed. Everyone dresses
extremely casually, in sport
clothes or jeans, sweatshirts and
shifts.
Each family has its own cab
in, either on the side of the hill
or down by the lake. A foun
tain offers everything from
sodas to shaving cream, with a
diverse and enticing selection of
paperbacks thrown in.
If all the camp programs
aren't enough, Jack Benny
might be playing at Harrah's,
or you might drive up to Emer
ald Bay or all the way around
the lake or rent a Honda and
go over to Carson City—there
is no end to the possibilities.
With the children supervised,
the women relieved of dishes
and menus, the Sierra Camp of
fers stimulating company to any
graduate, teacher, or adminis
trator who takes advantage of
this sound Stanford benefit.


Marshmellows, guitars, firelight, and smog-free
Sierra air combine to set a romantic scene at the
Stanford Sierra Camp. Recreation Director Jeff
Kupers leads parents, children, and staff in popu
lar folk songs. With Branner sponsor Barbie
Burns on his right and Kathy Cunningham and
Lee Schlenker to his left, Kupers' appears to head
a lonely quartet.

youngsters who are taught
songs, fingerpainting, drawing,
when they aren't climbing on,
or destroying, the playground
equipment. Babysitting is easily
arranged with the employees.
The afternoon features Kid
die Beach, supervised swimming
for the children.
During the pre-dinner Happy
Hour the Recreation staff
reads stories while the parents
adjourn for relaxation and re
covery from the rigors of the
outdoors.
Organized But Optional
Your time is your own. In the
evening movies, campfires,
folk dancing, faculty lectures,
teen dances, and a grand "Fun
Night" talent show are scat
tered throughout the week.
A large fire warms the lobby
where coffee is served late at
night, and Bridge, chess, read
ing, and singing can co-exist, not
offensive to the peace.
Just a few minutes from the
camp are golf, horseback rid

The most popular sport is wa
ter skiing, and free beginning
instruction is offered. Other wa
terfront activities include swim
ming, boating, and fishing.
Boats can be rented at all hours.
Safe, Sane, Satisfying
If you're not out on the ten
nis courts or hiking through
the towering Sierra-Nevadas,
you may be devouring the glor
ious cuisine. Prepared by facul
ty and students from San Fran
cisco City College, the meals are
a highpoint of the day.
On Sunday the afternoon buf
fet is served in the tradition of
the finest restaurants, often in
cluding crab, shrimp, and fresh
strawberries (not in one dish,
however).
Waitresses in red skirts and
white blouses serve the large
meals family style, and the large
redwood dining room is condu*
cive to "good talk" and relaxa
tion.
A special bonus: there is no

poison oak, and rattlesnakes
have yet to be reported.
A Big Deal
Each family usually stays for
a week, though some have
stayed for three. Considering
the would-be expense of motels
and eating out, costs at the
camp are minimal.
Exact information can be ob
tained from the Alumni Asso
ciation at Bowman Alumni
House. The camp opens this
June IB and closes September
10.
No dogs, cats or other pets
are allowed. Everyone dresses
extremely casually, in sport
clothes or jeans, sweatshirts and
shifts.
Each family has its own cab
in, either on the side of the hill
or down by the lake. A foun
tain offers everything from
sodas to shaving cream, with a
diverse and enticing selection of
paperbacks thrown in.
If all the camp programs
aren't enough, Jack Benny
might be playing at Harrah's,
or you might drive up to Emer
ald Bay or all the way around
the lake or rent a Honda and
go over to Carson City—there
is no end to the possibilities.

You won't find it on a map. And no signs direct you to its se

away on the south shore of Fallen Leaf Lake, just five miles from
Lake Tahoe, the casinos, and Mt. Tallac.
Offering delicious food, refreshing company, and a bevy of ac

many faculty, alumni, and administrators have yet to take advan
tage of the fine family facilities.

Soon to be under the control

Safe, Sane, Satisfying
If you're not out on the ten
nis courts or hiking through
the towering Sierra-Nevadas,
you may be devouring the glor
ious cuisine. Prepared by facul
ty and students from San Fran
cisco City College, the meals are
a highpoint of the day.
On Sunday the afternoon buf
fet is served in the tradition of
the finest restaurants, often in
cluding crab, shrimp, and fresh
strawberries (not in one dish,
however).
Waitresses in red skirts and
white blouses serve the large
meals family style, and the large
redwood dining room is condu*
cive to "good talk" and relaxa
tion.
A special bonus: there is no

poison oak, and rattlesnakes
have yet to be reported.
A Big Deal
Each family usually stays for
a week, though some have
stayed for three. Considering
the would-be expense of motels
and eating out, costs at the
camp are minimal.
Exact information can be ob
tained from the Alumni Asso
ciation at Bowman Alumni
House. The camp opens this
June IB and closes September
10.
No dogs, cats or other pets
are allowed. Everyone dresses
extremely casually, in sport
clothes or jeans, sweatshirts and
shifts.
Each family has its own cab
in, either on the side of the hill
or down by the lake. A foun
tain offers everything from
sodas to shaving cream, with a
diverse and enticing selection of
paperbacks thrown in.
If all the camp programs
aren't enough, Jack Benny
might be playing at Harrah's,
or you might drive up to Emer
ald Bay or all the way around
the lake or rent a Honda and
go over to Carson City—there
is no end to the possibilities.
With the children supervised,
the women relieved of dishes
and menus, the Sierra Camp of
fers stimulating company to any
graduate, teacher, or adminis
trator who takes advantage of
this sound Stanford benefit.


Marshmellows, guitars, firelight, and smog-free
Sierra air combine to set a romantic scene at the
Stanford Sierra Camp. Recreation Director Jeff
Kupers leads parents, children, and staff in popu
lar folk songs. With Branner sponsor Barbie
Burns on his right and Kathy Cunningham and
Lee Schlenker to his left, Kupers' appears to head
a lonely quartet.
