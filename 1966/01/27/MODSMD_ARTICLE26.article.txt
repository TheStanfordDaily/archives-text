# Opportunity To Earn, Learn

### MARSHA COOK Feature Editor 
Who benefits most â€” the
Sierra Camp guests or the em
ployees? Beyond any doubt, the
waitresses, boat boys, recreation
staff, and office help stand to
gain far more from their stay
in the mountains. Especially if
they are Stanford students.
The camp is now hiring stu
dents for summer work, and
anyone who applies at Bowman
Alumni House and is fortunate
enough to qualify will be
plunged into a stimulating, grat
ifying job, as the author can
well attest.
Leisure is the pivotal factor
which makes the vast difference
between talking to professors
on campus and being with them
during their vacation. The bar
riers are gone; Dr. Christian
Bay can say, "Just call me
Christian."
The camp is a mccca for suc
cesful alumni and prominent
men on campus. Dr. Charles
Beye, Dean Smith, Dr. Robert
Helliwell, Dr. Ronald Bracewell,
Robert Setrakian, and others
bring family and friends.
Last summer the staff played
cards with Dean Bob Gordon
and his wife Betty, learned geol
ogy from Dr. Benjamin Page,
played tennis with Coach Mac,
and enjoyed the myriads of in
teresting and interested people
who visited.
Marriage and the Family
For eleven weeks eleven dif
ferent groups of people come
and go, and the camp is a lesson
in Marriage and the Family,
fascinating from a sociological
standpoint. In a week's time,
each conglomeration of guests
develops a composit personality.

Some groups are spiritless, some
are amazing in their enthus
iasm. Within each are families
wliich are often composed of
two intelligent parents and
some exceptionally bright chil
dren. Yet there is no guarantee
of compatibility or happiness
with minds alone.
Working with and for these
people is a pleasure. They are
relaxed, under not pressure to
hop from motel to motel or
the like. And on vacation every
one is more agreeable. Interest
on the employee's part is all
that's necessary to insure an
educational, satisfying relation
ship with a guest.
Parties, Too
The summer is not simply
academic. The guests often
throw parties in their cabins,
and the staff gets together for
midnight hikes, folksinging,
dances, and whipped cream
fights.
But on the whole, most em
ployees agree that the alumni
and faculty are the most im
portant features. Without the
weekly change and constantly
revitalized population the camp
might lose its charm. For in
fact it is an ideal community of
the elite. The "real world" is
never like this, especially in ref
erence to absence of pressure.
Time To Think
The staff is not paid a king's
ransom, but it eats king's gour
met meals. With only one day
off a week you can't travel far,
but then you may not want to
leave at all All the recreation
facilities are open, including
waterskiing.
The staff finds time for read
ing, writing, and healing blis
ters. Hiking in the mountains

and up the falls and lakes is a
favorite pasttime. And the
working hours are quite reason
able.
With a pitch like this, anyone
might be concerned that the
camp is desparate for workers.
Not so. What it needs, though,
is more competition for jobs. In
the past only a fraction of the
staff has been composed of
Stanford students. Most of us
have never even heard of Stan
ford Sierra Camp, let alone real
ize its potential for a full, profit

able summer job.
When the students return to
Stanford the campus is a dif
ferent one indeed. Suddenly for
merly distant names, like Spitz,
Allyn, Huntly, and Kennedy, are
old friends. Better still, their
wives invite you over for meals.
The administrators, faculty,
and especially the alumni serve
as examples that people can
graduate from college and lead
solid lives, not intellectually as
much as humanly, warmly.
They also show that some
people can't. For this revelation
alone the summer is valuable.
