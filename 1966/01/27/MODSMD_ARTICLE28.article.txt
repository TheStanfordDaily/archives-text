# THREATEN USC
## Swimmers Improve 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimmers
advanced significantly last week
in the AAWU statistical rank
ings in warming up to a possi
ble dethroning of USC as the
kingpins of American college
swimming.
The Indians placed three new
men, Bob Momsen, Mark Parm
ley and Bill Meyer in the list
ings, and Olympian Mike Wall
cut a full twelve seconds off his
500 yard freestyle time to 5:01.0
to edge out Roy Saari of USC
for the conference lead.
Momsen turned a time of
2:18.6 in the 200-yard breast
stroke, Meyer reported a 22.6
clocking in the 50-yard freestyle,
and Parmely grabbed spots in
three events with a 1:48.6 in the
200 free, a 2:05.6 in the indivi
dual medley, and a 2:04.9 in the
200-yard Butterfly.
The Indians two relay teams

placed third and fourth respec
tively with a 3:46.5 medley time,
and a 3:20.9 freestyle time.
Southern Cal—or more cor
rectly, Roy Saari — continued
strong and is still the team to
beat, though UCLA is making
some threatening strokes. Saari
leads the conference in four de
partments: The 200 freestyle
(1:47.5), the 50 freestyle (22.4),
the 200 individual medley
(2:02.7), and the 200-backstroke
(2:07.9). Saari is also second
in the 100 and 500 freestyle
races.
The progress of AAWU marks
over last year is remarkable, es
pecially when one considers that
the league was the toughest in
the nation at that time. In every
event except the 50 free, times
are markedly better than they
were at a comparable time a
year ago.
