# Indian's Boxing Team Remains Of Great Era
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Being one of four colleges in
the country that participate in
intercollegiate boxing, Stanford
is presently sitting with a 1-1
season record with improvement
expected.
If the Indians have a prob
lem it is the lack of experienced
fighters. Thus far there has
been little indication of this
weakness.
After making a fine showing
in the Novice Boxing Tourna
ment here at Stanford, the In
dians fell to Cal because of for
fiets in four bouts. In the bouts
they fought Stanford held a 5-4
point edge.
Revealing outstanding ring
knowledge were George Bellows,
Tom Jenks, and Eric de Gooyer.
De Gooyer and Jenks were
awarded technical knockouts
illustrating the style of boxing
that has been typical of all of
Stanford's boxers this year.
Jenks also garnered a knockout
in last Thursday's meet against
the 12th Naval District.
Sinks Navy
With everyone showing im
provement, Stanford won last
week's meet, 4%-2 y 2 . Stanford
lost only one bout.
Displaying a vast amount of
Improvement were Jim Marlar
at 156 and Delos Brown in the
heavyweight. Brown has fought
to two draws in his two varsity
bouts.
Stanford will meet Chico
State a week from Saturday
here at Stanford. The bouts are
held in Encina Gym with the
limited seating space usually
filled to capacity.
Boxing Interest High
Boxing interest has always
been basically intense here at
Stanford not only spectator wise
but also in a competitive sense.
Boxing coach Ray Lunny stated
that his boxing classes havÂ«
aiways been filled with more
students showing interest every
year.
Boxing fell out of the colleg
iate competitive scene about six
years ago when a boxer lost his
life in a college bout. Numerous

instances before this event
helped to intensify the severity
of this accident. Colleges began
to reevaluate their athletic pro
grams and boxing was subse
quently dropped by most col
leges in the East.
Boxing Disappears
With lack of competition and
public support boxing also be
gan to disappear on the West
Coast.
Surviving this coup were Stan
ford, the University of Califor
nia, Chico State, and Nevada.
These are the only colleges re
maining with varsity boxing.

Needless to say, competition
is slim for Stanford, Stanford
has five meets this year. Besides
the meet with Chico State Stan
ford will meet the University of
Nevada, February 11 and Cal,
February 17. Both will be away
matches.
This year's boxing squad has
onlv two fighters with any rela
tive boxing experience. Bellow*
at 155 pounds and John Price
at 165 are the only returning
varsity performers. Bellows is
undefeated in his two bouts
while Price lost one to Cal's
Jim Moore.
