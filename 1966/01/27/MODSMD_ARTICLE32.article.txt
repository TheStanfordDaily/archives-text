# Letters To The Editor
## Hoskins 'Go-Go Girls' Sue For Peace 
### 
Kditor, The Daily:
We were offered the fortunate
opportunity to read Mr. Pinho's
well-worded and tasteful criti
cism (Jan. 25) of the "Go-Go"
life led by the inhabitants of
Elsewhere (vis-a-vis the idyllic
Somewhere of Escondido Vil
lage). Cut to the quick by his
execration, we are bound to
acknowledge the superior posi
tion of the young marrieds in
Stanford's hierarchical Chain of
Being, and humbly offer our
thanks for his setting us on the
path of virtuous normalcy. In
short, we have seen the light.
We herewith offer our apology,
vowing to henceforth:
• Restrain our hands when
they involuntarily clutch the
fire alarm levers (certainly an
understandable t em p t a t i on

when one is confined in an "In
sane Asylum").
• Provide a Christian burial
for the helpless infants massa
cred in The Battle of the Park
ing Lot and those stricken with
tetanus while frisking in their
"only play area," namely, the
glass-ridden moat that sepa
rates the inmates from the
Healthy People.
• Notify our gentleman solic
itors that they must now find
employment Somewhere Else.
In return, we ask only that
our superiors exercise a mini
mal amount of parental author
ity in restraining their children
from setting off fire alarms ("a
funny joke" that occurred on
January 23) and casting stones
at our windows, balconio* and
admittedly reprehensible selves.
To alleviate the inconvenience
this effort will entail, we are
willing to confine our demands
to Sundays and national holi
days.
In recognition of the fact that
Every Day Is Study Day at Es
condido, we shall henceforth
sublimate our aggressions in
joining the children's war being
fought in our yard. We rest as
sued that the war will continue
to escalate, as "the future long
months of hard study" necessi
tate childless, quiet village
homes.

• Dailies To Mrs. Bates
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mrs. Henry G.
Bates' letter of Jan. 25 con
cerning too much sex in The
Daily, the members of Kappa
Sigma fraternity have decided
to give Mrs. Bates the oppor
tunity to reconsider her posi
tion.
We feel that by a more ex
tensive and less emotional per
usal of our campus publication,
Mrs. Bates could not help but
realize the true, virtuous em
phasis that lurks between the
lines of The Daily.
For lack of other devices, The
Daily might after all, upon
more careful consideration, "in
some small measure bring her
(our) children closer."
Consequently, in order to give
Mrs. Bates (who renounced her
subscription) the opportunity to
reevaluate her attitudes, we
have decidcd to offer her, gra
tis, four Daily subscriptions for
the remainder of the quarter.

• Old Timer Fizzles
Editor, The Daily:
I'm highly discouraged with
the Old Timer who would like
the Museum to revert to its pre
vious state: a dingy series of
rooms where you could easily
trip over some "collector's
item." No! Nein! Non! Nix! As
a lowly undergrad I say three
cheers for Dr. Eitner and the
Department of Art and Archi
tecture. The building contains a
great deal of floor space, and
they have turned it into an as
set to Stanford. If Old Timer
had looked carefully he would

have seen that the best of the
good old days is still there —
only it is now disguised in a
usable and enjoyable format
(for instance, the collection of
objects from Egyptian antiqui
ty).
Stanford does not have a
"great" collection of paintings,
but it is a very usable and il
lustrative one for students. The
University also has a very good
collection of graphic works
which are displayed at the Mu
seum from time to time. Both

collections can now be thorough
ly enjoyed in their remodelled
home. Furthermore, modern art
—that "polygot mixture of beat
nik nonsense" — has a definite
place in our culture. Not dis
playing it will not make it dis
appear. One should study it,
even if only to be able to criti
cize it. Perhaps, in time, a well
constructed, well-lit gallery will
attract what would seem to
some of us to be exhibitions of
more rational art.
The Stanford Museum does

not exist for the convenience
of local school teachers and
their charges who wish to study
early California history. Nor is
it a curiosity shop for the chil
dren of Stanford Alumni. It ex
ists primarily for the Stanford
community along with the Stan
ford Libraries and all the rest
of the University's educational
facilities. If old and new books
can be better employed in a
new library — so too with art.
Congratulations to Dr. Eitner.

• Dailies To Mrs. Bates
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mrs. Henry G.
Bates' letter of Jan. 25 con
cerning too much sex in The
Daily, the members of Kappa
Sigma fraternity have decided
to give Mrs. Bates the oppor
tunity to reconsider her posi
tion.
We feel that by a more ex
tensive and less emotional per
usal of our campus publication,
Mrs. Bates could not help but
realize the true, virtuous em
phasis that lurks between the
lines of The Daily.
For lack of other devices, The
Daily might after all, upon
more careful consideration, "in
some small measure bring her
(our) children closer."
Consequently, in order to give
Mrs. Bates (who renounced her
subscription) the opportunity to
reevaluate her attitudes, we
have decidcd to offer her, gra
tis, four Daily subscriptions for
the remainder of the quarter.

• Old Timer Fizzles
Editor, The Daily:
I'm highly discouraged with
the Old Timer who would like
the Museum to revert to its pre
vious state: a dingy series of
rooms where you could easily
trip over some "collector's
item." No! Nein! Non! Nix! As
a lowly undergrad I say three
cheers for Dr. Eitner and the
Department of Art and Archi
tecture. The building contains a
great deal of floor space, and
they have turned it into an as
set to Stanford. If Old Timer
had looked carefully he would

have seen that the best of the
good old days is still there —
only it is now disguised in a
usable and enjoyable format
(for instance, the collection of
objects from Egyptian antiqui
ty).
Stanford does not have a
"great" collection of paintings,
but it is a very usable and il
lustrative one for students. The
University also has a very good
collection of graphic works
which are displayed at the Mu
seum from time to time. Both

collections can now be thorough
ly enjoyed in their remodelled
home. Furthermore, modern art
—that "polygot mixture of beat
nik nonsense" — has a definite
place in our culture. Not dis
playing it will not make it dis
appear. One should study it,
even if only to be able to criti
cize it. Perhaps, in time, a well
constructed, well-lit gallery will
attract what would seem to
some of us to be exhibitions of
more rational art.
The Stanford Museum does

not exist for the convenience
of local school teachers and
their charges who wish to study
early California history. Nor is
it a curiosity shop for the chil
dren of Stanford Alumni. It ex
ists primarily for the Stanford
community along with the Stan
ford Libraries and all the rest
of the University's educational
facilities. If old and new books
can be better employed in a
new library — so too with art.
Congratulations to Dr. Eitner.

"How can I explain "How can I explain

Kditor, The Daily:
We were offered the fortunate

well-worded and tasteful criti
cism (Jan. 25) of the "Go-Go"
life led by the inhabitants of
Elsewhere (vis-a-vis the idyllic
Somewhere of Escondido Vil

acknowledge the superior posi

Stanford's hierarchical Chain of
Being, and humbly offer our
thanks for his setting us on the
path of virtuous normalcy. In
short, we have seen the light.
We herewith offer our apology,
vowing to henceforth:
• Restrain our hands when
they involuntarily clutch the
fire alarm levers (certainly an
understandable t em p t a t i on

when one is confined in an "In
sane Asylum").
• Provide a Christian burial
for the helpless infants massa
cred in The Battle of the Park

tetanus while frisking in their
"only play area," namely, the
glass-ridden moat that sepa

cerning too much sex in The
Daily, the members of Kappa
Sigma fraternity have decided
to give Mrs. Bates the oppor
tunity to reconsider her posi
tion.
We feel that by a more ex
tensive and less emotional per
usal of our campus publication,
Mrs. Bates could not help but
realize the true, virtuous em
phasis that lurks between the
lines of The Daily.
For lack of other devices, The
Daily might after all, upon
more careful consideration, "in
some small measure bring her
(our) children closer."
Consequently, in order to give
Mrs. Bates (who renounced her
subscription) the opportunity to
reevaluate her attitudes, we
have decidcd to offer her, gra
tis, four Daily subscriptions for
the remainder of the quarter.

• Old Timer Fizzles
Editor, The Daily:
I'm highly discouraged with
the Old Timer who would like
the Museum to revert to its pre
vious state: a dingy series of
rooms where you could easily
trip over some "collector's
item." No! Nein! Non! Nix! As
a lowly undergrad I say three
cheers for Dr. Eitner and the
Department of Art and Archi
tecture. The building contains a
great deal of floor space, and
they have turned it into an as
set to Stanford. If Old Timer
had looked carefully he would

have seen that the best of the
good old days is still there —
only it is now disguised in a
usable and enjoyable format
(for instance, the collection of
objects from Egyptian antiqui
ty).
Stanford does not have a
"great" collection of paintings,
but it is a very usable and il
lustrative one for students. The
University also has a very good
collection of graphic works
which are displayed at the Mu
seum from time to time. Both

collections can now be thorough
ly enjoyed in their remodelled
home. Furthermore, modern art
—that "polygot mixture of beat
nik nonsense" — has a definite
place in our culture. Not dis
playing it will not make it dis
appear. One should study it,
even if only to be able to criti
cize it. Perhaps, in time, a well
constructed, well-lit gallery will
attract what would seem to
some of us to be exhibitions of
more rational art.
The Stanford Museum does

not exist for the convenience
of local school teachers and
their charges who wish to study
early California history. Nor is
it a curiosity shop for the chil
dren of Stanford Alumni. It ex
ists primarily for the Stanford
community along with the Stan
ford Libraries and all the rest
of the University's educational
facilities. If old and new books
can be better employed in a
new library — so too with art.
Congratulations to Dr. Eitner.

"How can I explain "How can I explain
it to the Stalinists?" it to the Birehers?"
Kditor, The Daily:
We were offered the fortunate
opportunity to read Mr. Pinho's
well-worded and tasteful criti
cism (Jan. 25) of the "Go-Go"
life led by the inhabitants of
Elsewhere (vis-a-vis the idyllic
Somewhere of Escondido Vil
lage). Cut to the quick by his
execration, we are bound to
acknowledge the superior posi
tion of the young marrieds in
Stanford's hierarchical Chain of
Being, and humbly offer our
thanks for his setting us on the
path of virtuous normalcy. In
short, we have seen the light.
We herewith offer our apology,
vowing to henceforth:
• Restrain our hands when
they involuntarily clutch the
fire alarm levers (certainly an
understandable t em p t a t i on

when one is confined in an "In
sane Asylum").
• Provide a Christian burial
for the helpless infants massa
cred in The Battle of the Park
ing Lot and those stricken with
tetanus while frisking in their
"only play area," namely, the
glass-ridden moat that sepa
rates the inmates from the
Healthy People.
• Notify our gentleman solic
itors that they must now find
employment Somewhere Else.
In return, we ask only that
our superiors exercise a mini
mal amount of parental author
ity in restraining their children
from setting off fire alarms ("a
funny joke" that occurred on
January 23) and casting stones
at our windows, balconio* and
admittedly reprehensible selves.
To alleviate the inconvenience
this effort will entail, we are
willing to confine our demands
to Sundays and national holi
days.
In recognition of the fact that
Every Day Is Study Day at Es
condido, we shall henceforth
sublimate our aggressions in
joining the children's war being
fought in our yard. We rest as
sued that the war will continue
to escalate, as "the future long
months of hard study" necessi
tate childless, quiet village
homes.
