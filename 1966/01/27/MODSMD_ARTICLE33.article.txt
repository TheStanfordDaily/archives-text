# TWO MINUTES OF BAIT
## Winds Of Freedom Revisited 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
The ancient maxim that there
is more than one way to skin
an issue has passed yet another
test.
When the Winds of Freedom
Foundation, an arch - conserva
tive alumni organization, at
tempted in their bulletin to en
lighten Stanford alumni about
the "public record" of liberal
professor, Dr. Christian Bay, it
opened the way for enterprising
issue-grubbers to follow.
Consistent Conservative
And last week, one of the Uni
versity's most consistent conser
vatives, former Daily editor
Robert Naylor, raised a per
plexing issue—what issue was
in fact at issue. At first sight,
it seemed as great a discovery
for issueless issue-grabbers as
money for banks. The possibili
ties would be unlimited.
"The controversy," Naylor
wrote in The Daily, further ob
scuring the issue, "provides a
perfect lesson in How To Ob
scure a Vital Issue, with both
antagonists, along with The
Daily, and a respected profes
sor of religion (Robert McAf
fee Brown), at fault." All, Nay
lor postulated, had unhappily
"missed the issue and raised
false issues in its place."
On closer scrutiny, however,
it was clear that Naylor, in
claiming sole proprietorship,
had struck a great blow at free

enterprise in the issue-grubbers
trade.
He excluded academic auto
nomy as a possibility and award
ed his blue ribbon for the really
"basic issue" of the controver
sy to academic imbalance. On
what basis had he made his
choice?
Tactics and Intentions
Naylor distinguished between
the "tactics" of the Foundation,
which he admitted were "open
to criticism," and its ultimate
intentions which he found laud
able. It was their ultimate in
tent—a desire to redress alleged
academic imbalance at Stanford
—which Naylor singled out as
the basic issue.
But "tactics" or intentions,
the Foundation's actions were
an attempt to undermine aca
demic autonomy.
In making an example of
Bay's liberalism, the Foundation
hoped to rally alumni in sup
port of earlier proposals it made
to the Board of Trustees. In the
bulletin, it said: "During 1963
and 1964 Winds of Freedom
made five proposals to the Trus
tees of Stanford with the aim
of bringing one eminent scholar
whose stature and convictions
might add some balance to those
of Dr. Bay and others of simi
lar leanings in the Political Sci
ence Department."
Subject to Challenge
And it continued, "While
Stanford would not accept in

its Political Science Department
professors of conservative con
victions, yet it did find a place
for Dr. Bay, whose viewpoint is
certainly subject to challenge."
The purpose behind the Foun
dation's criticism of Bay was
therefore to force the Univer
sity to accept Its earlier propo
sals, proposals which would com
promise the academic autonomy
of the University.
These proposals offered funds
to the University with the stip
ulation that the use of the funds
be designated or approved by
the Foundation at a later date.
Such stipulations differ mark
edly from other "strings-at
tached" gifts where the condi
tions are set forth in advance,
which the Trustees are free to
accept or reject.
False Issues
Yet, according to Naylor, the
controversy "is not over wheth
er alumni should play a part
in determining academic pol
icy." For him, such issues are
"false issues."
But Naylor's favoritism for
the "basic issue" to the exclu
sion of all others reflects his
earlier committment to the
same issue. In the first issue of
The Daily this year, Naylor ex
pressed concern in a "welcome
frosh" message for the deprived
liberal in the unfortunate state
of academic imbalance.
He also observed, "The most
noticeable result is that the
conservative student activist is
a major disadvantage vis-a-vis
his liberal counterpart, for he is
fighting the whole trend of the
teaching , or most professors,
and does not enjoy the moral
and sometimes tangible support
of the activist faculty members.
In such circumstances, one is
easily discouraged."

No Justification

Discouragment, however, is
no justification for issue-grub
bing exclusiveness.
Significantly, the Foundation
has gone only half way in rais
ing the "basic issue" of aca
demic imbalance which Naylor
raised again last week. Certain
ly, it has established the exist
ence on campus of an outspoken
liberal professor, but it has not
yet established the absence of
card-carrying conservative pro
fessors.
In raising the issue again,
Naylor contends the University
sports no conservative profess
ors, and he cites the political
science, economic and sociology
departments as proof. (Note to
issue-grubbers: the Hoover In
stitute is on the Stanford cam
pus.)
If Naylor can prove this point,
then it is for the issue-grubbers
to skin the question of why.

The Daily Is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
ever, letters should not exceed
300 words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on 65-space
lines and double-spaced.

Foundation, an arch - conserva
tive alumni organization, at
tempted in their bulletin to en
lighten Stanford alumni about
the "public record" of liberal
professor, Dr. Christian Bay, it
opened the way for enterprising
issue-grubbers to follow.
Consistent Conservative
And last week, one of the Uni
versity's most consistent conser
vatives, former Daily editor
Robert Naylor, raised a per
plexing issue—what issue was
in fact at issue. At first sight,
it seemed as great a discovery
for issueless issue-grabbers as
money for banks. The possibili
ties would be unlimited.
"The controversy," Naylor
wrote in The Daily, further ob
scuring the issue, "provides a
perfect lesson in How To Ob
scure a Vital Issue, with both
antagonists, along with The
Daily, and a respected profes
sor of religion (Robert McAf
fee Brown), at fault." All, Nay
lor postulated, had unhappily
"missed the issue and raised
false issues in its place."
On closer scrutiny, however,
it was clear that Naylor, in
claiming sole proprietorship,
had struck a great blow at free

enterprise in the issue-grubbers
trade.
He excluded academic auto
nomy as a possibility and award
ed his blue ribbon for the really
"basic issue" of the controver
sy to academic imbalance. On
what basis had he made his
choice?
Tactics and Intentions
Naylor distinguished between
the "tactics" of the Foundation,
which he admitted were "open
to criticism," and its ultimate
intentions which he found laud
able. It was their ultimate in
tent—a desire to redress alleged
academic imbalance at Stanford
—which Naylor singled out as
the basic issue.
But "tactics" or intentions,
the Foundation's actions were
an attempt to undermine aca
demic autonomy.
In making an example of
Bay's liberalism, the Foundation
hoped to rally alumni in sup
port of earlier proposals it made
to the Board of Trustees. In the
bulletin, it said: "During 1963
and 1964 Winds of Freedom
made five proposals to the Trus
tees of Stanford with the aim
of bringing one eminent scholar
whose stature and convictions
might add some balance to those
of Dr. Bay and others of simi
lar leanings in the Political Sci
ence Department."
Subject to Challenge
And it continued, "While
Stanford would not accept in

its Political Science Department
professors of conservative con
victions, yet it did find a place
for Dr. Bay, whose viewpoint is
certainly subject to challenge."
The purpose behind the Foun
dation's criticism of Bay was
therefore to force the Univer
sity to accept Its earlier propo
sals, proposals which would com
promise the academic autonomy
of the University.
These proposals offered funds
to the University with the stip
ulation that the use of the funds
be designated or approved by
the Foundation at a later date.
Such stipulations differ mark
edly from other "strings-at
tached" gifts where the condi
tions are set forth in advance,
which the Trustees are free to
accept or reject.
False Issues
Yet, according to Naylor, the
controversy "is not over wheth
er alumni should play a part
in determining academic pol
icy." For him, such issues are
"false issues."
But Naylor's favoritism for
the "basic issue" to the exclu
sion of all others reflects his
earlier committment to the
same issue. In the first issue of
The Daily this year, Naylor ex
pressed concern in a "welcome
frosh" message for the deprived
liberal in the unfortunate state
of academic imbalance.
He also observed, "The most
noticeable result is that the
conservative student activist is
a major disadvantage vis-a-vis
his liberal counterpart, for he is
fighting the whole trend of the
teaching , or most professors,
and does not enjoy the moral
and sometimes tangible support
of the activist faculty members.
In such circumstances, one is
easily discouraged."

No Justification

Discouragment, however, is
no justification for issue-grub
bing exclusiveness.
Significantly, the Foundation
has gone only half way in rais
ing the "basic issue" of aca
demic imbalance which Naylor
raised again last week. Certain
ly, it has established the exist
ence on campus of an outspoken
liberal professor, but it has not
yet established the absence of
card-carrying conservative pro
fessors.
In raising the issue again,
Naylor contends the University
sports no conservative profess
ors, and he cites the political
science, economic and sociology
departments as proof. (Note to
issue-grubbers: the Hoover In
stitute is on the Stanford cam
pus.)
If Naylor can prove this point,
then it is for the issue-grubbers
to skin the question of why.

The Daily Is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
ever, letters should not exceed
300 words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on 65-space
lines and double-spaced.
The ancient maxim that there
is more than one way to skin
an issue has passed yet another
test.

issue-grubbers to follow.
Consistent Conservative
And last week, one of the Uni
versity's most consistent conser
vatives, former Daily editor
Robert Naylor, raised a per
plexing issue—what issue was
in fact at issue. At first sight,
it seemed as great a discovery
for issueless issue-grabbers as
money for banks. The possibili
ties would be unlimited.
"The controversy," Naylor
wrote in The Daily, further ob
scuring the issue, "provides a
perfect lesson in How To Ob
scure a Vital Issue, with both
antagonists, along with The
Daily, and a respected profes
sor of religion (Robert McAf
fee Brown), at fault." All, Nay
lor postulated, had unhappily
"missed the issue and raised
false issues in its place."
On closer scrutiny, however,
it was clear that Naylor, in
claiming sole proprietorship,
had struck a great blow at free

enterprise in the issue-grubbers
trade.
He excluded academic auto
nomy as a possibility and award
ed his blue ribbon for the really
"basic issue" of the controver
sy to academic imbalance. On
what basis had he made his
choice?
Tactics and Intentions
Naylor distinguished between
the "tactics" of the Foundation,
which he admitted were "open
to criticism," and its ultimate
intentions which he found laud
able. It was their ultimate in
tent—a desire to redress alleged
academic imbalance at Stanford
—which Naylor singled out as
the basic issue.
But "tactics" or intentions,
the Foundation's actions were
an attempt to undermine aca
demic autonomy.
In making an example of
Bay's liberalism, the Foundation
hoped to rally alumni in sup
port of earlier proposals it made
to the Board of Trustees. In the
bulletin, it said: "During 1963
and 1964 Winds of Freedom
made five proposals to the Trus
tees of Stanford with the aim
of bringing one eminent scholar
whose stature and convictions
might add some balance to those
of Dr. Bay and others of simi
lar leanings in the Political Sci
ence Department."
Subject to Challenge
And it continued, "While
Stanford would not accept in

its Political Science Department
professors of conservative con
victions, yet it did find a place
for Dr. Bay, whose viewpoint is
certainly subject to challenge."
The purpose behind the Foun
dation's criticism of Bay was
therefore to force the Univer
sity to accept Its earlier propo
sals, proposals which would com
promise the academic autonomy
of the University.
These proposals offered funds
to the University with the stip
ulation that the use of the funds
be designated or approved by
the Foundation at a later date.
Such stipulations differ mark
edly from other "strings-at
tached" gifts where the condi
tions are set forth in advance,
which the Trustees are free to
accept or reject.
False Issues
Yet, according to Naylor, the
controversy "is not over wheth
er alumni should play a part
in determining academic pol
icy." For him, such issues are
"false issues."
But Naylor's favoritism for
the "basic issue" to the exclu
sion of all others reflects his
earlier committment to the
same issue. In the first issue of
The Daily this year, Naylor ex
pressed concern in a "welcome
frosh" message for the deprived
liberal in the unfortunate state
of academic imbalance.
He also observed, "The most
noticeable result is that the
conservative student activist is
a major disadvantage vis-a-vis
his liberal counterpart, for he is
fighting the whole trend of the
teaching , or most professors,
and does not enjoy the moral
and sometimes tangible support
of the activist faculty members.
In such circumstances, one is
easily discouraged."

No Justification

Discouragment, however, is
no justification for issue-grub
bing exclusiveness.
Significantly, the Foundation
has gone only half way in rais
ing the "basic issue" of aca
demic imbalance which Naylor
raised again last week. Certain
ly, it has established the exist
ence on campus of an outspoken
liberal professor, but it has not
yet established the absence of
card-carrying conservative pro
fessors.
In raising the issue again,
Naylor contends the University
sports no conservative profess
ors, and he cites the political
science, economic and sociology
departments as proof. (Note to
issue-grubbers: the Hoover In
stitute is on the Stanford cam
pus.)
If Naylor can prove this point,
then it is for the issue-grubbers
to skin the question of why.

The Daily Is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
Due to space problems, how
ever, letters should not exceed
300 words. It is helpful if they
are typewritten on 65-space
lines and double-spaced.
The ancient maxim that there
is more than one way to skin
an issue has passed yet another
test.
When the Winds of Freedom
Foundation, an arch - conserva
tive alumni organization, at
tempted in their bulletin to en
lighten Stanford alumni about
the "public record" of liberal
professor, Dr. Christian Bay, it
opened the way for enterprising
issue-grubbers to follow.
