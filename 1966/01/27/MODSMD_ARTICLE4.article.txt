# LASSU To Consider Education, Draft Bills
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
Two bills calling for educational
experimentation and a resolution de
nouncing the draft of college students
will be among the legislation intro
duced at LASSU tonight.
A bill sponsored by Ilmar Waldner
seeks to establish an ASSU Commis
sion on Education, the purposes of
which would be "to encourage study
of the purposes of education, and al
ternative plans to achieve those pur
poses," and "to encourage an experi
mental attitude toward education."
Every department at Stanford is
urged to offer at least one non-direct
ed course in a resolution submitted
by Lars Gantzel. A non-directed
course, according to an attachment
to the resolution, is one in which
"the students take over the class,
express their ideas freely, and push
each other toward clarity of think
ing and depth of knowledge."

Both pieces of legislation will be
referred to committee.
Draft is Contrary
The anti-draft resolution proposes
that LASSU show its disapproval of
the drafting of students and call for
the "universal application of the 11-S
deferment."
It also requests that the Legisla
ture call upon "President Sterling, as
the highest officer of the Stanford
Community, to protest the violation
of the interests of his community
represented by the draft of students."
Other legislation includes a bill
appropriating $200 for a Wilbur Pro
fessor-of-the-Month, to be referred
to the Finance Committee, and a bill
reported favorably from the same
committee, giving $1000 to the NSA
Ravenswood tutorial project.
The meeting will be at 7:30 in room
320.
