But the mother-mountain is to be
at the same time "terrible, desolate,
terrifying place", in Mr. Hay's words.
This "bitter, bleak ravine" must sug
gest that Zeus, in creating the terrific
place for Prometheus' punishment,
has thrust this huge, cold, magnified
rock crystal up out of the primeval
earth, and left an open wound with
the marks of the savage birth frozen
in flames on the face of the moun
tain.
Thrust Stage
The decision to use an inverted
mountain shape meant that the whole
structure, since its base is small, must
be moved to a central location on the
stage and that this be done Without

Aeschylus's "Prometheus Bound",
to be presented next week by the
Stanford Repertory Company, in
volves an approach to Greek tragedy
quite different from the usual classic
one to which we are accustomed. The
director, Eric Vos, has visualized the
action as taking place in a primitive
world as yet untouched by men.
The costume and set designs ex
press visually both this primitive
world and the elemental conflict be
tween Prometheus and Zeus which
goe.< - on within it. The designs also
describe and suggest the symbolic
extension of the characters. The Rep
ertory Company's set designer, Rich
ard Hay, and costume designer,
Douglas Russell, spent weeks in con
ference with the director discovering
the exact elements necessary to vis
ually express Mr. Vos' interpretation
of the play.
Unconventional
The result of these conferences be
gins with a distinctly unconventional
V-shaped mountain. The shape came
to the designer "in a flash, although
it took a little longer than that," after
he had been laboring unsuccessfully
with the possibilities of a convention
al pyramidal mountain. The visual
image for the structure was a woman
buried head down in the earth up to
her waist with her legs spread apart
and Prometheus chained between the
legs. This seems exactly right since
the earth is the mother of Prometh
eus; from her he is generated and
by her he is consumed at the end of
the play.

wasting valuable acting space. The
entire set is, in fact, thrust forward
from behind the proscenium into the
auditorium in such an expanse that
it covers the first six rows of seats.
This immediacy welds the audience
and the performers into the same
space, allows much better sound and
intensifies the dramtic involvement
of the audience. The involvement is
strengthened further by the steep
slope of the stage toward the audi
ence, to enable them to see the geo
metrically patterned movements of
the chorus.

The costumes, in addition to reflect
ing the primeval world, restate the
conflict of forces within the play. The
characters are Greek gods, but not
the familiar ones of the Acropolis.
They are primitive, elemental, per
sonifications of the substance of a
newly created world. They are not
realistic or romantic or human. Their
forms and shapes are reminiscent of
extinct prehistoric creatures. The ad
jectives the costume designer, Mr.
Russell, used most frequently to de
scribe them were "earth-like" and
"elemental".
Natural Elements
In fact, the visual images for both
the sets and costumes derive from

natural elements. While trying to
achieve the right statement the direc
tor and designers discovered a beau
tiful boo c of illustrations of precious
gems and minerals. Here in the hard,
lustrous, impersonal beauty of pre
cious stones was found the visual ex
pression for their theatrical ideas.
These pictures of natural elements
were the sources for the colors and
textures of the design. The mountain
for example, was drawn from a rock
crystal, and the chorus costumes from
malachite.
The costumes also suggest the con

flict between Zeus and Prometheus.
The forces of Zeus are cold â€” "hard
and pitiless". Their costumes are
smooth, faceted with the cold edges
of gems. Mr. Russell describes the
other costumes as having the look
of "eroded encrustation". Neither the
sets nor the costumes are meant to
have a soft romantic look. They are
cold and terrifying; the materializa
tion of a primal battle of the gods
in a time before man.
They are objects of horror and fas
cination; grandeur and cruelty, and
reflect the proportions of Promethe
us' crime in giving to man the se
cret of fire.
