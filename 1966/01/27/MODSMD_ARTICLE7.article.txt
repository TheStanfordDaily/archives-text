# ARFEP Urges 'Synthesis,' Recognition Of Red China
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
The Stanford Chapter of Ameri
cans for Reappraisal of Far Eastern
Policy (ARFEP) is sponsoring a full
page advertisement in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle calling for U. S. rec
ognition of Red China.
The ad maintains that "a large
scale land war with China will be
avoided only if we succeed in creating
non - military means for the settle
ment of our differences."
The purpose of the ad is to lend

support to a group of Congressmen
and Senators who have "privately ex
pressed a desire to initiate a debate
in Congress on our China policy."
ARFEP hopes to raise the $5,000
dollars needed for the ad through
student and faculty contributions.
Copies of the ad have been mailed to
all Stanford faculty members. In ad
dition, members of ARFEP hope to
reach the entire student body through
desks on Quad and through informal
talks in the living groups.

The ad is similar to one which the
Eastern chapters of ARFEP spon
sored in The New York Times and
The Washington Post last December.
In addition to the ad, ARFEP Is
co-sponsoring the visit of National
Committee member the Reverend
Sloane Coffin to Stanford. Rev. Cof
fin, chaplain at Yale, will be Wilbur
Hall Guest-in-Residence next week
and will also speak for ARFEP.
Rev. Coffin's visit and the Chronicle
ad are the first major endeavors of
ARFEP since their 40-campus closed
circuit conference held October 24,
1965. Since then they have stuck to
their policy of seeking what Profes
sor Otis Pease called "a point of syn
thesis" in Far Eastern affairs.
Stanford senior David Shookoff re
marked that ARFEP's purpose is to
"elicit as broad a base as possiMfc for
a moderate position. A number of key
people are sympathetic to a 'new
look' in our Asian policy, but they
fear lack of public support."
Debate Overdue
Seconding this feeling, the Chroni
cle ad states that "a national debate
on our China policy is long overdue...
We believe that the United States' re
fusal to recognize China is detrimen
tal not only to the cause of world
peace, but to our own national inter
est."
ARFEP's national Committee mem
bers include (in addition to Rev. Cof
fin), Professor John Fairbank (Direc
tor of Far Eastern Studies, Harvard),
Dr. John C. Bennett (President of
Union Theological Seminary), Allard
Lowenstein, John Hersey, and Profes
sor David Riesnstnr
