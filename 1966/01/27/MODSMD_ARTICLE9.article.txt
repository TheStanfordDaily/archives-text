# Magazine Discloses Marijuana On Farm
## 
### DICK BALLANTINE Acting Managing Editor 
An article describing marijuana ac
tivities at Stanford has appeared in
the January issue of San Francisco
magazine. The story, entitled "Mari
juana, Who's Turned On?", claims
that "In at least two Stanford fra
ternities, about eight students regu
larly use marijuana."
The article, written by Jann Wen
ner, combines excerpts from the La
Guardia Report with the descriptions
of marijuana incidents at Bay area
high schools and colleges.
The Report is a 30G page "medical
and sociological publication" com
pleted by the New York Academy of
Medicine in the 1940'5. Wenner claims
that it is "the best scientific report
on the subject."
Berkeley Student
Wenner is a junior English major
at the University of California (Berk
eley). The section of the San Fran
cisco magazine article concerning
Stanford is reprinted here in full:
"On the Stanford campus, social life
is dominated by the fraternities. All
students must live in a dormitory
their freshman year and then they
may join fraternities or move off
campus. In at least two Stanford fra
ternities, about eight students regu
larly use marijuana.
"A student there might be intro
duced to marijuana through a fresh
man year residence hall friend who
has become a member of Stanford's
growing left bank. This is a, very dis
tinct fringe group living in Palo Alto
and the La Honda hills. With this
group are students, non-students, and
faculty, many of them associated with
some Liberal Arts departments.

"One student said his friendship
with his teachers came through week
end 'pot parties.' His story was con
firmed by another: 'I turned on many
times with Stanford teachers. Those
in the Art, Classics, English, and Mu
sic departments are the cool ones. At
every party, there were professors
smoking grass.'
"A few of this Stanford group have
marijuana gardens in their back
yards, but most drive up to San Fran
cisco to make a 'connection' in the
Fillmore district. Some of the mari
juana is then sold to a few Menlo
Park students. The rest is passed
around at. parties. Because the mari
juana smoking crowd is small and in
grown, there is comparatively little
real 'pushing' on the campus."
Telephone Interview
In a telephone interview yesterday
with Wenner, he said that he had ob
tained some of his information from
"six or seven Stanford students and
one member of the faculty." It was
compiled last summer, he added.
Wenner also said that he had spent
some time on the Stanford campus.
Wenner said that "Berkeley is the
major center for dumping drugs in
the Bay area, more so than San Fran
cisco State." He also revealed that
there is a connection between "the
growing left bank at Stanford" and
those at Berkeley.
In "Marijuana, Who's turned On?",
Wenner also mentions Woodside High
School, Mills College, San Francisco
State and Berkeley as having recent
ly had incidents involving students
using marijuana.
The San Francisco magazine is pub
lished monthly and has a circulation
of about 18,000.
