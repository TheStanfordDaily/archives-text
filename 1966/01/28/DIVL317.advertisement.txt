God Loves You
"Love" has become such a misused word that it is almost out of style
to say "I love you." To say that "God is love" hardly produces a response
from anyone any more. But the Bible not only says that God is love, but also
makes it clear that He who is love is quite prepared to demonstrate that love
in uniquely personal ways any individual can understand and experience.
God is never much interested in man-made theories which try to explain what
He is like, but He is always glad to enrich an empty soul and fill an empty
heart until it overflows with love. Dismissing the high-towered claims of con
temporary theologians, Jesus Christ said, "Truly I say to you whoever does not
receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it" (Mark 10:15). The
love which God offers is experienced by those who come to Jesus Christ in
simple childlike faith and trust. Intellectual arguments and human reasonings
get one nowhere with Him!
To those who mistakenly believe that God is a vengeful father-figure in
the clouds, the Bible assures us that this all-powerful Being is totally unselfish,
and that He lives forever only for the benefit of others. His love, which knows
no bounds, is fully demonstrated for all to see at the cross where Jesus Christ
voluntarily died to give His life in exchange for yours. "Herein is love, not that
we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation
for our sins" (I John 4:10). On the very night of His betrayal Jesus Christ
himself told his disciples, "This is my commandment that you love one an
other as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friends" (John 15:12-13).
God always meets us man-to-man, and the Good News of the Bible is
that God loves you, and that Jesus Christ as your invisible Friend is prepared
to carry your sins and worries upon Himself to that timeless and eternal event
of His cross where He suffers and dies that you might live forever. Have you
discovered this love? Do you really know how much God cares? A simple
prayer will bring this love to you today.
