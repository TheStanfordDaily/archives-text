# HR Rides Herd On Diverse Programs
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY (Second in a Series 
In recent years, the Institute of Interna
tional Relations (IIR) has grown into a mul
ti-office, multi-project organization, with four
major vice-presidents and many varied pro
grams operating simultaneously.
Twenty years ago, the lIR founders spent
most of their time rounding up used clothing
to be sent to war-torn countries. Today, Insti
tute activities range from setting up three
day conferences to publishing pamphlets.
According to lIR President Mike Pillsbury,
the organization is divided into four major
groups: Area Projects, Conferences, Informa
tion and Affiliations and International Stu
dents.
Seventeen Desks
"Area projects," says Vice-President Curt
Keck, "began in 1961 when a group of stu
dents set up a 'desk' to study Africa and its
problems." Since then, seventeen separate
"desks" have been created to increase student
interest in foreign countries and establish con
tact with students abroad.
In addition to the original African desk,
committees concerned with Europe, Asia, La

tin America, the Middle East and Soviet coun
tries have been organized. Each of these com
mittees sponsors it's particular "week" during
the year during which special programs are
carried out featuring students from the coun
tries involved.
"The Area Projects division," Keck com
mented, "has been responsible for setting up
exchange programs with Makero College in
Kenya, Keio University in Japan, the Free Uni
versity of Berlin in Germany, and Guanabara
College in Brazil."
Other Area projects desks are involved in
projects variously titled "Crossroads," "Crisis
Committee," "Overseas Book," ' People to Peo
ple," "Mexicali Project," and "Foreign Lan
guage Coffee Hour."

The Conference Division of lIR is similarly
involved in numerous extensive projects, and
is, according to an Institute propaganda sheet,
"the showcase of the IIR."
Conferences, headed by Joel Kuglemas, con
centrates its efforts in two areas—the attend
ance of "external" conventions and organiza
tion of campus conferences.
Each year, for example, the lIR sends a

number of students to represent Stanford at
the annual Conference of the Collegiate Coun
cil for the United Nations (CCUN) held at
UN headquarters in New York. The CCUN
conference is attended by representatives
from over 250 schools from around the world,
who gather to see the United Nations in ac
tion and to meet the people who run it.
Regional Mun
The lIR also sends delegates to the regional
Model United Nations held annually at differ
ent west coast colleges. The Institute is also
the leading organization member of the Asso
ciation of International Relations Clubs, and
usually sends a delegate to the yearly AIRC
convention in Chicago.
The most successful and ambitious program
undertaken by the lIR has been its series of
campus conferences, the latest of which fea
tured Senator Frank Church of Idaho as main
speaker.
The Stanford Foreign Policy Institute (FPI)
began in May 1958 when columnist James Res
ton of the New York Times spoke on "Ameri
can Foreign Policy." Since then, the FPI has
presented speakers from various affiliations,
including Gardner Patterson, director of

Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Inter
national Affairs, and Averell Harriman, who
spoke on Soviet - American Peaceful Coexist
a nee.
Policy Speech
In 1961, Dr. Ralph Bunche, who had planned
to discuss African Affairs, arrived on campus
the same day that the Congo crisis broke.
Bunche drew a crowd of over 3,500 to deliver a
speech which became actual U. S. policy dur
ing the crisis.
The fifth FPI, in 1962, inaugurated a new
analysis in depth: former Secretary of State
Christian Herter introduced the theme "Peace
ful Coexistence," and his address was fol
lowed by three days of additional speeches
by authorities on Soviet and American is
sues. The same procedure has been followed
to the present, and the FPI has hosted such
personalities as Chester Bowles, William Ran
dolph Hearst Jr., Allen S. Whitney, James
Coleman and St. Clair Drake.
"The llR's biggest problem with speakers,"
commented former Vice-President Jeff Mason,
"is actually a good problem to have. It's that
speakers cancel at the last minute because

they're so important the government needs
them right away if a crisis breaks.
Williams Cancels
"For instance," he said, "the main speaker
in 19G4 was to be G. Mennen Williams, Assist
ant Secretary of State. He had his ticket and
was packed to come, and twelve hours before
he was supposed to speak, he called the lIR
and said he would have to cancel the engage
ment, than an important crisis had broken in
Africa, and that he was called to confer with
the President.
"We asked him if he would send some
body to speak in his place, and he told us to
meet the same plane he was to have come on,
that he would send a substitute.
"He must have yelled to an aide to get some
one, as he was leaving on his way to Wash
ington," Mason said. "His assistant, J. Wayne
Fredricks arrived on the plane, unshaven —he
had written his speech on the plane coming
out here. Fredricks had to wait before he
could give out his speech in a news confer
ence, because they were sending it to Wash
ington over the wire to be okayed as official
U. S. African Policy," he said.

that he would send a substitute.
"He must have yelled to an aide to get some
one, as he was leaving on his way to Wash
ington," Mason said. "His assistant, J. Wayne
Fredricks arrived on the plane, unshaven —he
had written his speech on the plane coming
out here. Fredricks had to wait before he
could give out his speech in a news confer

ington over the wire to be okayed as official
U. S. African Policy," he said.
In recent years, the Institute of Interna
tional Relations (IIR) has grown into a mul
ti-office, multi-project organization, with four
major vice-presidents and many varied pro
grams operating simultaneously.
Twenty years ago, the lIR founders spent
most of their time rounding up used clothing
to be sent to war-torn countries. Today, Insti
tute activities range from setting up three
day conferences to publishing pamphlets.
According to lIR President Mike Pillsbury,
the organization is divided into four major
groups: Area Projects, Conferences, Informa
tion and Affiliations and International Stu
dents.
Seventeen Desks
"Area projects," says Vice-President Curt
Keck, "began in 1961 when a group of stu
dents set up a 'desk' to study Africa and its
problems." Since then, seventeen separate
"desks" have been created to increase student
interest in foreign countries and establish con
tact with students abroad.
In addition to the original African desk,
committees concerned with Europe, Asia, La

tin America, the Middle East and Soviet coun
tries have been organized. Each of these com
mittees sponsors it's particular "week" during
the year during which special programs are
carried out featuring students from the coun
tries involved.
"The Area Projects division," Keck com
mented, "has been responsible for setting up
exchange programs with Makero College in
Kenya, Keio University in Japan, the Free Uni
versity of Berlin in Germany, and Guanabara
College in Brazil."
Other Area projects desks are involved in
projects variously titled "Crossroads," "Crisis
Committee," "Overseas Book," ' People to Peo
ple," "Mexicali Project," and "Foreign Lan
guage Coffee Hour."
lIR Showease
The Conference Division of lIR is similarly
involved in numerous extensive projects, and
is, according to an Institute propaganda sheet,
"the showcase of the IIR."
Conferences, headed by Joel Kuglemas, con
centrates its efforts in two areas—the attend
ance of "external" conventions and organiza
tion of campus conferences.
Each year, for example, the lIR sends a

number of students to represent Stanford at
the annual Conference of the Collegiate Coun
cil for the United Nations (CCUN) held at
UN headquarters in New York. The CCUN
conference is attended by representatives
from over 250 schools from around the world,
who gather to see the United Nations in ac
tion and to meet the people who run it.
Regional Mun
The lIR also sends delegates to the regional
Model United Nations held annually at differ
ent west coast colleges. The Institute is also
the leading organization member of the Asso
ciation of International Relations Clubs, and
usually sends a delegate to the yearly AIRC
convention in Chicago.
The most successful and ambitious program
undertaken by the lIR has been its series of
campus conferences, the latest of which fea
tured Senator Frank Church of Idaho as main
speaker.
The Stanford Foreign Policy Institute (FPI)
began in May 1958 when columnist James Res
ton of the New York Times spoke on "Ameri
can Foreign Policy." Since then, the FPI has
presented speakers from various affiliations,
including Gardner Patterson, director of

Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Inter
national Affairs, and Averell Harriman, who
spoke on Soviet - American Peaceful Coexist
a nee.
Policy Speech
In 1961, Dr. Ralph Bunche, who had planned
to discuss African Affairs, arrived on campus
the same day that the Congo crisis broke.
Bunche drew a crowd of over 3,500 to deliver a
speech which became actual U. S. policy dur
ing the crisis.
The fifth FPI, in 1962, inaugurated a new
analysis in depth: former Secretary of State
Christian Herter introduced the theme "Peace
ful Coexistence," and his address was fol
lowed by three days of additional speeches
by authorities on Soviet and American is
sues. The same procedure has been followed
to the present, and the FPI has hosted such
personalities as Chester Bowles, William Ran
dolph Hearst Jr., Allen S. Whitney, James
Coleman and St. Clair Drake.
"The llR's biggest problem with speakers,"
commented former Vice-President Jeff Mason,
"is actually a good problem to have. It's that
speakers cancel at the last minute because

they're so important the government needs
them right away if a crisis breaks.
Williams Cancels
"For instance," he said, "the main speaker
in 19G4 was to be G. Mennen Williams, Assist
ant Secretary of State. He had his ticket and
was packed to come, and twelve hours before
he was supposed to speak, he called the lIR
and said he would have to cancel the engage
ment, than an important crisis had broken in
Africa, and that he was called to confer with
the President.
"We asked him if he would send some
body to speak in his place, and he told us to
meet the same plane he was to have come on,
that he would send a substitute.
"He must have yelled to an aide to get some

in 19G4 was to be G. Mennen Williams, Assist
ant Secretary of State. He had his ticket and
was packed to come, and twelve hours before
he was supposed to speak, he called the lIR
and said he would have to cancel the engage
ment, than an important crisis had broken in
Africa, and that he was called to confer with
the President.
"We asked him if he would send some
body to speak in his place, and he told us to
meet the same plane he was to have come on,
that he would send a substitute.
"He must have yelled to an aide to get some
one, as he was leaving on his way to Wash
ington," Mason said. "His assistant, J. Wayne
Fredricks arrived on the plane, unshaven —he
had written his speech on the plane coming
out here. Fredricks had to wait before he
could give out his speech in a news confer
ence, because they were sending it to Wash
ington over the wire to be okayed as official
U. S. African Policy," he said.
In recent years, the Institute of Interna
tional Relations (IIR) has grown into a mul
ti-office, multi-project organization, with four
major vice-presidents and many varied pro
grams operating simultaneously.
Twenty years ago, the lIR founders spent
most of their time rounding up used clothing
to be sent to war-torn countries. Today, Insti
tute activities range from setting up three
day conferences to publishing pamphlets.
According to lIR President Mike Pillsbury,
the organization is divided into four major
groups: Area Projects, Conferences, Informa
tion and Affiliations and International Stu
dents.
Seventeen Desks
"Area projects," says Vice-President Curt
Keck, "began in 1961 when a group of stu
dents set up a 'desk' to study Africa and its
problems." Since then, seventeen separate
"desks" have been created to increase student
interest in foreign countries and establish con
tact with students abroad.
In addition to the original African desk,
committees concerned with Europe, Asia, La

tin America, the Middle East and Soviet coun
tries have been organized. Each of these com
mittees sponsors it's particular "week" during
the year during which special programs are
carried out featuring students from the coun
tries involved.
"The Area Projects division," Keck com
mented, "has been responsible for setting up
exchange programs with Makero College in
Kenya, Keio University in Japan, the Free Uni
versity of Berlin in Germany, and Guanabara
College in Brazil."
Other Area projects desks are involved in
projects variously titled "Crossroads," "Crisis
Committee," "Overseas Book," ' People to Peo
ple," "Mexicali Project," and "Foreign Lan
guage Coffee Hour."
lIR Showease
The Conference Division of lIR is similarly
involved in numerous extensive projects, and
is, according to an Institute propaganda sheet,
"the showcase of the IIR."
Conferences, headed by Joel Kuglemas, con
centrates its efforts in two areas—the attend
ance of "external" conventions and organiza
tion of campus conferences.
Each year, for example, the lIR sends a

number of students to represent Stanford at
the annual Conference of the Collegiate Coun
cil for the United Nations (CCUN) held at
UN headquarters in New York. The CCUN
conference is attended by representatives
from over 250 schools from around the world,
who gather to see the United Nations in ac
tion and to meet the people who run it.
Regional Mun
The lIR also sends delegates to the regional
Model United Nations held annually at differ
ent west coast colleges. The Institute is also
the leading organization member of the Asso
ciation of International Relations Clubs, and
usually sends a delegate to the yearly AIRC
convention in Chicago.
The most successful and ambitious program
undertaken by the lIR has been its series of
campus conferences, the latest of which fea
tured Senator Frank Church of Idaho as main
speaker.
The Stanford Foreign Policy Institute (FPI)
began in May 1958 when columnist James Res
ton of the New York Times spoke on "Ameri
can Foreign Policy." Since then, the FPI has
presented speakers from various affiliations,
including Gardner Patterson, director of

Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Inter
national Affairs, and Averell Harriman, who
spoke on Soviet - American Peaceful Coexist
a nee.
Policy Speech
In 1961, Dr. Ralph Bunche, who had planned
to discuss African Affairs, arrived on campus
the same day that the Congo crisis broke.
Bunche drew a crowd of over 3,500 to deliver a
speech which became actual U. S. policy dur
ing the crisis.
The fifth FPI, in 1962, inaugurated a new
analysis in depth: former Secretary of State
Christian Herter introduced the theme "Peace
ful Coexistence," and his address was fol
lowed by three days of additional speeches
by authorities on Soviet and American is
sues. The same procedure has been followed
to the present, and the FPI has hosted such
personalities as Chester Bowles, William Ran
dolph Hearst Jr., Allen S. Whitney, James
Coleman and St. Clair Drake.
"The llR's biggest problem with speakers,"
commented former Vice-President Jeff Mason,
"is actually a good problem to have. It's that
speakers cancel at the last minute because

they're so important the government needs
them right away if a crisis breaks.
