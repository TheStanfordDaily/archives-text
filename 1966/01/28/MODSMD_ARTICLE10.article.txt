# Gold To Relate Novelist's Life
## 
### 
Herbert Gold, essayist and short
story writer, will present the second
program of the Freshman Dialogue
Series in Tresidder's Large Lounge
today at 4:15. His topic, "The Novel
ist's Way of Life and the Way of Life
in Novels," should stimulate discus
sion among the audience participants,
said Charlotte Morse, member of the
Freshman English staff.
Gold, who lives in San Francisco,
is represented in Stanford's freshman
English readings by his work, "Death
in Miami Beach." He is described in
Personal Voice, which was edited by
Professor Albert Guerard and others,
as a novelist who uses the precise
analysis of a social critic.
