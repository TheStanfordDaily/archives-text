# SU VARSITY, FROSH SWIM
## Santa Clara SC Tests Tankers 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Santa Clara Swim Club, the
aquatic prodigy that has been
synonymous with United States
superlative swimming through
out the 1960'5, barges into the
Farm Pond at 2:00 tomorrow.
The Stanford varsity and
freshmen squads take on the
Santa Clarans in a double dual
meet that will be broadcast over
KZSU AM-FM.
Santa Clara, which was re
sponsible for more than half of
the United States Olympic swim
ming team, has completely dom
inated outdoor AAU competi
tion for the last five years.
Santa Clara Coach George
Haines will have a bundle of
surprises to offer on Saturday,
one of which is Mark Spitz.
Spitz is following in Don
Schollander's footsteps, and per
haps finding the strides a little
snort for his style. The high
school star has already turned
in a 17 minute flat 1500 meters
freestyle in a workout this sea
son.
Hot Water Spitz
Spitz will be involved in some
water-boiling races tomorrow.
The 500 freestyle field will in
clude Mike Wall and Gary

Sheerer of the Stanford varsity
and Dick Roth of the frosh, as
well as Spitz.
Wall, member of the 1964
Olympic team, and Roth, Olym
pic gold-medalist and world rec
ord holder, will be looking to
drop Spitz into the third-place
cuspidor. (Both Wall and Roth,
incidentally, spend their sum
mers with the Santa Clara Swim
Club.)
The 200 freestyle will feature
Wall and Spitz, as well as All-
American Paul Meyer of the
Stanford frosh.
The individual medley event
should prove interesting. The
Stanford frosh have 4 of the na
tion's top five high school IM
men to choose from. Mark Par
mely will navigate the 200 yard
course for the varsity.
Greg Buckingham, American
400 yard individual medley rec
ord holder, will not swim for
Santa Clara because he is com
peting in Bremen, Germany.
Stanford freshman Luis Nicolao,
world record 100 meter butter
flier, won't make the meet for
the same reason.
Slippery Schilling
Dave Schilling, a promising
high school breaststroker, will

have to contend with Bob Mom
sen of the varsity and Steve Fal
us of the frosh. Momsen took
fourth in the 200 meters breast
stroke in the outdoor nationals
last summer.
Mitch Ivey will give Stanford
backstrokers a run for their
money like they haven't seen
this year. Varsity captain Bill
Schubach and freshman holder
Bill Kee will try to tear down
the Ivey League.
Stanford sprinters will have
their hands full, though not for
very long. Bill Meyer and Bill
Derrig will blast at the 50 free
for the varsity. Phil Brown, who
has recorded a best time of
21.9, will take off for the frosh.
Morgan Manning, top high

school 100 freestyler last year
(47.8), will go for the frosh at
that distance. Tim Cummings
of Santa Clara will try to outdo
Manning, as will two sprinters
from the varsity.
The opening event of the af
ternoon, the 400 medley relay,
will be a major determining fac
tor in the meet. With a win on
the varsity or freshman levels,
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
will be able to do some line-up
juggling.
According to Gaughran's pre
meet prognostications, the meet
between Santa Clara and the
varsity, as well £s the frosh-
SCSC meet, should go unde
cided into the final relay, the
400 freestyle relay.

Stanford frosh.
The individual medley event
should prove interesting. The
Stanford frosh have 4 of the na
tion's top five high school IM
men to choose from. Mark Par
mely will navigate the 200 yard
course for the varsity.
Greg Buckingham, American
400 yard individual medley rec
ord holder, will not swim for
Santa Clara because he is com
peting in Bremen, Germany.
Stanford freshman Luis Nicolao,
world record 100 meter butter
flier, won't make the meet for
the same reason.
Slippery Schilling
Dave Schilling, a promising
high school breaststroker, will

have to contend with Bob Mom
sen of the varsity and Steve Fal
us of the frosh. Momsen took
fourth in the 200 meters breast
stroke in the outdoor nationals
last summer.
Mitch Ivey will give Stanford
backstrokers a run for their
money like they haven't seen
this year. Varsity captain Bill
Schubach and freshman holder
Bill Kee will try to tear down
the Ivey League.
Stanford sprinters will have
their hands full, though not for
very long. Bill Meyer and Bill
Derrig will blast at the 50 free
for the varsity. Phil Brown, who
has recorded a best time of
21.9, will take off for the frosh.
Morgan Manning, top high

school 100 freestyler last year
(47.8), will go for the frosh at
that distance. Tim Cummings
of Santa Clara will try to outdo
Manning, as will two sprinters
from the varsity.
The opening event of the af
ternoon, the 400 medley relay,
will be a major determining fac
tor in the meet. With a win on
the varsity or freshman levels,
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
will be able to do some line-up
juggling.
According to Gaughran's pre
meet prognostications, the meet
between Santa Clara and the
varsity, as well £s the frosh-
SCSC meet, should go unde
cided into the final relay, the
400 freestyle relay.
Santa Clara Swim Club, the
aquatic prodigy that has been
synonymous with United States
superlative swimming through

Farm Pond at 2:00 tomorrow.
The Stanford varsity and
freshmen squads take on the
Santa Clarans in a double dual
meet that will be broadcast over
KZSU AM-FM.
Santa Clara, which was re
sponsible for more than half of
the United States Olympic swim
ming team, has completely dom
inated outdoor AAU competi
tion for the last five years.
Santa Clara Coach George
Haines will have a bundle of
surprises to offer on Saturday,
one of which is Mark Spitz.
Spitz is following in Don
Schollander's footsteps, and per
haps finding the strides a little
snort for his style. The high
school star has already turned
in a 17 minute flat 1500 meters
freestyle in a workout this sea
son.
Hot Water Spitz
Spitz will be involved in some
water-boiling races tomorrow.
The 500 freestyle field will in
clude Mike Wall and Gary

Sheerer of the Stanford varsity
and Dick Roth of the frosh, as
well as Spitz.
Wall, member of the 1964
Olympic team, and Roth, Olym
pic gold-medalist and world rec
ord holder, will be looking to
drop Spitz into the third-place
cuspidor. (Both Wall and Roth,
incidentally, spend their sum

Club.)
The 200 freestyle will feature
Wall and Spitz, as well as All-
