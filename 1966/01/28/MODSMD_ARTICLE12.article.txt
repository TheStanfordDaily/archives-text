# Indian Gymnasts Take On Powerful Sacramento St.
## 
### HUGH WEST 
Stanford's gymnasts take their
second crack at the toughest
schedule in Farm acrobatic his
tory when they tangle with Sac
ramento State this Saturday in
the Pavilion.
The meet will begin at 1:30
p.m .
Sacramento State boasts one
of the better State College units
and should have no real trouble
with the depth-less Cards. Most
observers place the Hornets sec
ond among the California Col
leges, and they have already dis
posed of Long Beach State by
a score of 164-152 (a 7.8 aver
age).
Stanford coach John Gilmore
was pleased with the individual
performances of his gymnasts
in the opening loss to Arizona
State two weeks ago, but a derth
of bodies placed the Indians on
the short end of a 174-99 score.
Standouts for the Indians where
hard - working Bob Cook, who
never participated in gymnastics
before coming to Stanford, with
a 43.15 total in the Ail-Around
and Pete Gibson, who did well
in his first collegiate contest.
Gilmore expects continued im
provement with experience from
Gibson and sophomore Bill
Fischer.
Shade Below
On an individual scoring
basis, the present Tribe contin
gent is a mere shade below the
individual year average of last
year's 6.2 outfit. But the loss of
trampoline man Ted Anstedt be
cause of health reasons aggra
vates the nagging depth prob
lem.

The Hornets will bring several
top-notch performex-s to the pa
vilion. Steve Pleau's 48.95 in the
Ail-Around ranks second in the
State college rankings and he
has an 8.75 in the parallel bars
and a 9.1 in the long horse to
his credit.
