# Indians On Prowl For Wildcats, Sun Devils
## DAILY Sports 
### PROEBYL FROSTRUM 
Stanford's basketball team
after a week's rest will invade
Arizona for a game against
Arizona Friday and Arizona
State Saturday.
Hopefully for the Indians,
these games will smooth off all
the rough edges in preparation
for the final drive for the
AAWU championship. The Tribe
will play Oregon and Oregon
State next weekend in the Pa
vilion.
Presently, Stanford is in a
three-way tie for first place.
Stanford, UCLA, and Oregon
State all have 3-1 conference
records.
All three teams, Stanford, Ari
zozna, and Arizona State, have

had a hot and cold season, al
though the Indians have been
mostly hot lately.
Hot And Cold
Stanford has an 8-5 record in
cluding wins over such highly
regarded teams as USF, USC,
UCLA, and Washington State.
Among the five losses, though,
are defeats at the hands of San
Jose State and the same Wash
ington State team whom they
had beaten two weeks before.
Arizona's Wildcats have been
mostly cold of late. They have
lost four of their last five games.
The Wildcats do have wins over
California, 62-58, and San Jose
State, 56-47, though. Their rec
ord thus far is 8-7.
Stanford has a five game win

ning streak against the Wild
cats. The last time the two
teams met was in 1959 when
the Tribe downed Arizona, 74-59.
Stanford's win streak is five
games out of five games.
Sun Devils Beat Wolverines
The Arizona State Sun Devils
also have an 8-7 season record.
The top win for them, of course,
is their Christmas holidays vic
tory over Michigan. Right next
to that is last weekend's close
68-65 win over Arizona which
reversed an opening game loss
to their rival.
The Sun Devils are 1-1 against
the Indians. Stanford won in
1958 and Arizona State won in
1964 to snap a five-game win
ning streak by the Tribe. Joe
Caldwell, an all-American, tip
ped in a shot at the buzzer to
give the Sun Devils a 61-60 win
over Stanford.
Winning Line-Up
Indian Coach Howie Dallmar
will go with his new found line
up which upset the Trojan's and
Bruin's applecart. Dallmar will
start Art Harris and Gary Pet
ersmeyer at guards and Bob
Bedell at forward as usual. At
the other two spots he has done
some shifting.
Rich Baker, previously the
starting center who was injured
the week before the USC, UCLA
series, is able to play again, but
he will have to watch for awhile
as Ray Kosanke has moved
from his forward spot into the
center position. Howard Hassen
fills in at Kosanke's vacated
place.
Top Three
Harris (15.7), Bedell (16.1),
and Kosanke (14.5) shoulder
the scoring burden for the In
dians, but Hassen and Peters
meyer do their share, too.
Both play fine defense and
Hassen is an aggressive re
bounder, while Petersmeyer
quite often comes up with the
crucial play. In the USF game
he hit a jumper in the last sec
onds which tied it.
An interesting sidelight is
that 6'9" Ray Kosnke will be
playing in his home town,
Tucson for the first time as a
collegian. He was an all-Ameri
can at Tucson High School.
