# FACE OLYMPIC CLUB
## Ruggers Try Again 
### 
Stanford's varsity ruggers end
a rough week of practice to take
on the San Francisco Olympic
Club Saturday at 1:30 on the
Stanford rugby field.
The Indians put forth a dis
appointing showing last week,

scoring only six points against
the Peninsula Ramblers who
amassed 16. It was the first
time the Ramblers have won the
series dating back to 1939.
Stanford rugby mentor Pete
Kmetovic, disappointed with

overall team effort and hustle,
has spent the week trying to re
vitalize the Stanford offensive
scoring punch.
Bruce Kehrli has come up
from the JV squad and Tim
Abena, formerly on the JV
squad, will probably see action
tomorrow.
Kmetovic singled out Randy
Vahan, six year rugby veteran
for his performance last week.
Joe Neal, Blaine Nye, and Bob
Newberry also got the nod for
strong efforts on a dismal after
noon.
The Card ruggers are now
1-1-1 for the season. They opened
the year with a 41-0 rout of
Santa Clara, then tied Peacock
Gaap 17-17, then met the Ram
blers.
