ticipate in the Focus Program Mon
day night, and will lead a series of
seminars in various Wilbur houses.
Monday night's program will em
phasize the moral issues in Vietnam
and the influence of China on Ameri
can policy. Other issues to be dis
cussed by Coffin at various programs
include civil rights and sex.
Coffin was one of the first freedom
riders and a leader in the Crossroads
Africa program. In addition, he
was one of the founders of ARFEP,
of which he is now a member of the
national committee.
Speaking on civil rights, Coffin
has said that "From any religious or

moral point of view, integration is
the only acceptable goal, for the
brotherhood of man is a farce if it
is not finally a matter of the heart.
Moreover, in an explosive world, in
tegration may well be an absolute
necessity, but the fact that a thing
is right and necessary still does not
make it possible, for racial discrimin
ation or prejudice of any kind, for
that matter, is deeply rooted in a
sense of individual insecurity."
The Focus Program, usually taking
place on Wednesday nights, will be
held this Monday so that Coffin may
speak. In addition a panel headed by
Stanford professors Nobutaka Ike
and Richard Brody will discuss the
spech and recognize questions from
the audience. The program will start
at 8 p.m. in Cubberly Auditorium.
Described by Stanford professor of
Religion Dr. Robert McAfee Brown as
"one of the most sought-after college
speakers in the country," the Rev. Mr.
Coffin did secret work behind enemy
lines during World War 11, and was
chaplain at Williams College before
going to Yale.
The Rev. Mr. Coffin has worked in
the Peace Corps, training members
overseas. He has also been active in
the Operation Crossroads Africa pro
gram, and is currently executive sec
retary of the National Committee of
Clergy Concerned about Vietnam.
