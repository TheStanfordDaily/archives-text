# Stanford May Buy All Of Hospital
## 
### 
Stanford University Officials
are contemplating taking over
Palo Alto's share of the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital, and the

city is awaiting a decision so
that it can formulate its medical
care plans.
A committee of the university
board of trustees is reviewing
recommendations made by the
dean of the Stanford Medical
school.
Last Spring, President J. E.
Wallace Sterling asked the City
council to permit the university
to review its possible interest
in taking over the entire 400
bed hospital.
