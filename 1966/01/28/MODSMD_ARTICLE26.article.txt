# Ursula Good Huntin' In 'The 10th Victim'
## 
### CURT KECK 
A wild comedy that pits Mar
cello Mastroianni against Ursu
la Andress in an international
game of "kill or be killed" makes
Carlo Ponti's "The Tenth Vic
tim" a movie well worthy of at
tention.
The Hunt Club is an organi
zation which plans to divert
mass war by handing over the
reins of hostility and destruc
tion to individuals. By computer
processing the Club selects per
fect mates, a hunter and a hunt
ed, who then must fight it out.
But it is not who wins or loses
alone that counts. How the
game is played, how elaborately
the victim is dispatched is an
important point of etiquette and
prestige.
The action opens with a hunt
er in hot pursuit. This is hardly
surprising when one sees the
game—game and voluptuous
Ursula Andress. The chase winds
through alleys and back streets
ending up in a studio full of ap
prentice hunters learning the in
tricacies of the hunt game.
Glittering: Bikini
There Ursula disguises herself
in a glittering bikini and mask
and writhes into a throbbing
dance. This, naturally, allures
the hunter off guard. A volley
of shots from two little, hidden
persuaders in her bikini end the
pursuit—and she wasn't shoot
ing from the hip.
In her tenth and final hunt,
Ursula turns huntress and Mas
troianni is selected to be the
victim. She tracks down Mas
troianni in Rome and uses her
female wiles to entice him into
a trap. Ah, but Mastroianni, on
whose chest never a false hair

grew, has his own plans about
staying alive.
The acting of Marcello Mas
troianni is unquestionably ex
cellent. His role fits him well.
He is the devil-may-care Italian
sought after by three beauties,
his wife, mistress, and Ursula.
During the course of his amours
he plots to rid himself of all
three — a tricky situation for
any man and one compounded
by his own incompetence.
Andress Rewarding
Miss Andress' performance is
especially rewarding. Gone is
the awkwardness that plagued
her role in "Doctor No," as here
she emerges a cool kitten with
the kind of claws that make one
want to become a table leg. She
masterfully portrays the sexy
huntress-intent on making Mas
troianni her finale victim.
Part of the dialogue is in Eng
lish while the bulk is in Italian
with English subtitles. When
the audience must divert its at
tention from the actors to read
the subtitles, the actor is han
dicapped in that certain of his
gestures and facial expressions
may be missed. However, the
interplay of the two languages
does give the romance an inter
national flavor which under
scores the movie's jet set ap
peal.
Certainly two enjoyable fea
tures of the production are the
music and photography. In the
opening scen£_a .female vocalist
whirls into a frenzied beat of
"Die, Die, Die." Somebody has
composed a score that compli
ments the action and even takes
over during the chase sequen
ces. Rome, of course, lends it
self readily to photography. The
frantic escapades cover the
Eternal City with colorful verve.
Parody and Satire
Finally, of course, in the
midst of all the wild fun "The
Tenth Victim" is parody and
satire. Following in the kill or
be killed, love or make love syn
drome of current espionage
films, "The Tenth Victim" mim
ics its own disregard for human
life. In the climactic scenes Ur
sula Andress kills Mastroianni,
or so she thinks; and Mastroi
anni kills Andress, or so he
thinks.
Both the supposed murders
are in cold blood and each killer
artfully contrives to have his
killing done live for a TV tea
commercial. This hardly enhan
ces the love story but the fact
that it actually is a love story
gives the callousness a bite un
encountered with James Bond
and other assorted super-killers.

Eternal City with colorful verve.
Parody and Satire
Finally, of course, in the
midst of all the wild fun "The
Tenth Victim" is parody and
satire. Following in the kill or
be killed, love or make love syn
drome of current espionage
films, "The Tenth Victim" mim
ics its own disregard for human
life. In the climactic scenes Ur
sula Andress kills Mastroianni,
or so she thinks; and Mastroi
anni kills Andress, or so he
thinks.
Both the supposed murders
are in cold blood and each killer
artfully contrives to have his
killing done live for a TV tea
commercial. This hardly enhan
ces the love story but the fact
that it actually is a love story
gives the callousness a bite un
encountered with James Bond
and other assorted super-killers.
A wild comedy that pits Mar
cello Mastroianni against Ursu
la Andress in an international
game of "kill or be killed" makes
Carlo Ponti's "The Tenth Vic
tim" a movie well worthy of at
tention.
The Hunt Club is an organi
zation which plans to divert
mass war by handing over the
reins of hostility and destruc
tion to individuals. By computer
processing the Club selects per
fect mates, a hunter and a hunt
ed, who then must fight it out.
But it is not who wins or loses
alone that counts. How the
game is played, how elaborately
the victim is dispatched is an
important point of etiquette and
prestige.
The action opens with a hunt
er in hot pursuit. This is hardly
surprising when one sees the
game—game and voluptuous
Ursula Andress. The chase winds
through alleys and back streets
ending up in a studio full of ap
prentice hunters learning the in
tricacies of the hunt game.
Glittering: Bikini
There Ursula disguises herself
in a glittering bikini and mask
and writhes into a throbbing
dance. This, naturally, allures
the hunter off guard. A volley
of shots from two little, hidden
persuaders in her bikini end the
pursuit—and she wasn't shoot
ing from the hip.
In her tenth and final hunt,
Ursula turns huntress and Mas
troianni is selected to be the
victim. She tracks down Mas
troianni in Rome and uses her
female wiles to entice him into
a trap. Ah, but Mastroianni, on
whose chest never a false hair

grew, has his own plans about
staying alive.
The acting of Marcello Mas
troianni is unquestionably ex
cellent. His role fits him well.
He is the devil-may-care Italian
sought after by three beauties,
his wife, mistress, and Ursula.
During the course of his amours
he plots to rid himself of all
three — a tricky situation for
any man and one compounded
by his own incompetence.
Andress Rewarding
Miss Andress' performance is
especially rewarding. Gone is
the awkwardness that plagued
her role in "Doctor No," as here
she emerges a cool kitten with
the kind of claws that make one
want to become a table leg. She
masterfully portrays the sexy
huntress-intent on making Mas
troianni her finale victim.
Part of the dialogue is in Eng
lish while the bulk is in Italian
with English subtitles. When
the audience must divert its at
tention from the actors to read
the subtitles, the actor is han
dicapped in that certain of his
gestures and facial expressions
may be missed. However, the
interplay of the two languages
does give the romance an inter
national flavor which under
scores the movie's jet set ap
peal.
Certainly two enjoyable fea
tures of the production are the
music and photography. In the
opening scen£_a .female vocalist
whirls into a frenzied beat of
"Die, Die, Die." Somebody has
composed a score that compli
ments the action and even takes
over during the chase sequen
ces. Rome, of course, lends it
self readily to photography. The
frantic escapades cover the
Eternal City with colorful verve.
