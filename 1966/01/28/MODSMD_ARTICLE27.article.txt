### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
THEATER
In case you have by a supreme effort of self-discipline managed
to ignore the Repertory Theater's upcoming production of PRO
METHEUS BOUND, you're trapped. Because it's opening on Wed
nesday, with a preview Tuesday. It will be shocking, maybe even
gross; but will it be art? Go and see. And never let it be said that
we don't love the Repertory Theater, 'cause we do, we do.
FILMS
Friday's Tresidder movie is HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR, an
adaptation of John Hersey's novel of the same name. It's about
love and the Bomb, the first bomb but probably not the first love.
MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, Louis, Meet me at the fair. Please
don't say the lights are shining anyplace but there, and all that,
is Saturday's Tresidder epic. It is another Great American Musical,
which is why they're showing it, I guess.
The Biggest Bust, otherwise known as CLEOPATRA, is coming
to the Flicks Sunday. In this movie Elizabeth Taylor is a high-class
whore, as opposed to later appearances, where she is definitely
low-class, or even lower, maybe. Also, here her cups are only mod
erately running over; and besides, after Rex Harrison gets killed
you can always cut out and go book for a while.
The Bijou has a fine pair, TOM JONES and IRMA LA DOUCE,
The thing to do is listen carefully for the innuendoes in "Tom" and
just watch Irma carefully.
The Fine Arts has LORD LOVE A DUCK, the George Axlerod
comedy which Paino Knickerbocker didn't like much, but then who
pays any attention to him. With it is YOUR PAST IS SHOWING.
The Guild has THE 10th VICTIM, starring The Magnificent Mas
troianni, and Ursula Andress and Her Shooting Bra. In this futuris
tic manhunt, Ursula, in her Flash Gordon underwear, gives it to
some poor slob with both barrels.
The Paris has THE MARRIED WOMAN and CIRCLE OF LOVE.
Sex, sex, sex. And more sex for good measure. Like underdressed
and overdone.
Forget the Park.
Forget the Stanford.
And speaking of boobies, James Bond and the girls are still lay
ing around at the Varsity. It's a THUNDERBALL or something.
OTHER
And the Editor will rage for the last time (sounds of rejoicing
all over the place) before a select few at the Daily Banquet on Sat
urday. Masses of gas will be handed out all around; the Entertain
ment Editor will get his fingers chopped off and his eyes gouged
out by irate staffers. Fare thee well.
