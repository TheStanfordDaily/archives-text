# How To Scare Thousands: 'Writhe Some More, Pro!'
## 
### 
My name is John Wright. Nor
mally, I am a graduate student,
a husband, a father. I have
friends and a life on the outside.
For the last three months, how
ever, I have only been one thing
—assistant to the Director, Erik
Vos, on the production of Prome
theus Bound.
The result of all this sweat
and strain — what has been
created — is important and a lit
tle overwhelming. I hope that
large numbers of people come
and see it, not only because we
want to share it, but also be
cause I fear for the safety of
small audiences. So much crea
tive energy, money, and hard
labor has gone into this produc
tion that I seriously doubt if
anything less than 1,000 spec
tators at a performance will be
able to bear the impact.
Facetious
This remark is not as faceti
ous as it seems. We have no
ticed as we work, day by day,
that sometimes such powerful
forces are released that we are
frightened. The immense stage
seems to flow out into the thea
ter and engulf the audience. On
stage, the masked and costumed
players are spectres of myth

and savagery. The air of the
auditorium is twisted by the in
tense, dissonant music.
Towering above everything —
the imprisoned audience, the
ghostly players, the disturbing
sound, is The Rock—the incred
ible ROCK — jutting out of the
gaping hole in center stage; and
within the Rock, the tortured,
masked jeweled thief of fire—
Prometheus. He writhes in his
chains, punished for his gift to
man. And sometimes the whole
scene writhes with him. At those
times the play is not frighten
ing; it is terrifying.
Share the Shock
So I hope that large numbers
attend, to share the shock and
also to intensify it. In the final
theatrical sense the forces will
not reach their potential until
there is a large audience present
to react to and reinforce the
power. An audience gives life to
a play. An audience is the final
catalyst that releases the buried
power.
All of us, the director, com
poser, designers, cast, orchestra
and crews have done the prelim
inary mining of the forces in
this barbarous play. The audi
ence must finish the job.
