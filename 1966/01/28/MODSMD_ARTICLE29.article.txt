# Ordeal Of Change

Transition is, by nature, a painful process —
and thus it is, and will be, at Stanford.
Many years ago, this community —particul-
arly its administrators —made what was essen
tially a courageous and visionary decision to
transform this University from a Farm into a
national university, from a "Princeton of the
West" into a "Harvard of the West." Thus PACE,
with its financial and philosophical commitment
to excellence in the faculty and physical plant
of the university.
Today, the University finds itself in a post-
PACE era of introspection. The mundane —
though admittedly fundamental —physical prob
lems are no longer primary. Philosophical ques
tions now confront us: how big are we to be
come, what are we to teach and learn and how
is this to be done, how valid is the philosophy
of in loeo parentis, and—we think equally im
portant —what role are the students to have in
the formulation of these policies?
It should neither surprise, nor personally of
fend, administrators to discover that many stu
dents are profoundly interested in policies which
directly affect them —be they social regulations
or concepts of residential living. We are aware
of the fact that if students are granted access
to the decision-making process, then that process
will not function as quickly as it has heretofore.
It is for this reason —as well as the assumption
that administrators know what is best for the
comunity —that requests for anything more
than informal and sporadic student consulta

tion meet such resistance from the Administra
tion and, on occasion, the faculty.
This resistance is not abnormal; it is typical
of nearly all bureaucracies —a term which is not
necessarily pejorative. Yet we think progress has
been made in gaining access to this bureaucracy,
and that more progress will be made in the fu
ture if for no other reason than a pragmatic
realization that in many instances students will
no longer passively accept ex ileus machina pro
nouncements on matters directly concerning
them.
The time-consuming Union controversy would
never have taken place if students had been
consulted prior to the announcement of closure.
When the Committee of 15 finally resolved the
issue in the Administration's favor —with a ma
jority of the students on that Committee in agree
ment with this decision —a seal of legitimacy
was affixed to the entire operation. We did not
particularly like the decision, but we accepted
its validity.
We would hope that in the future such con
sultation will take place prior to announcements,
so that the entire community can assess the
merits of each proposal and not be repeatedly
reactions to the process of decision-making fol
engulfed by initial — and legitimate-negative
lowed in each instance.
In the past decade this University has gone
from relative provincialism to "the edge of great
ness." To finally achieve this nebulous goal will
take vision and a willingness to reason together
—on the part of the entire community.
