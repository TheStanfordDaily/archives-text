Congress shall make no laic . . . abridging the

First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
Although it may seem presumptous for The
Daily to offer a brief refresher course in elemen
tary civics to a member of the Stanford faculty,
especially when that person happens to be the
Faculty Master of Wilbur Hall, we think the
case warrants it.
On Wednesday a member of the Daily staff
atempted to procure a list of freshmen for a poll
he wished to conduct for publication in The
Daily. lie was denied access to the list, at least
until the Faculty Master quizzed him on the
validity of the questions to be put to the fresh
men. Although not entirely satisfied that our
staffer had made the most adequate preparation
possible—he had talked to four graduate stu
dents in statistics and a professor of sociology,
but the Faculty Master was of the opinion that
another professor should have been consulted—
the Master did finally authorize the distribution
of the survey.
To put it concisely, this is intolerable —from a
journalist's viewpoint, if no other.
If the poll was inadequate, or even 'rigged',
we think this community would have the intelli
gence to perceive it. Moreover, there is always
the opportunity for rebuttal in the 'Letters' col
umn of The Daily; or, if the grievance cannot

he assauged thusly, one can appeal to the Publi
cations Board, the Legislature of the ASSU and
the student body to which this paper —its editors
and staffers —is ultimately responsible.
Perhaps the Faculty Master was operating
under Point 12 of his General Policy Statement
for Wilbur (distributed in the Fall), which states
in part: "At the outset it should be made clear
that the Wilbur men are not 'fair game' for the
efforts and enthusiasm of zealots, neither are
the Wilbur Houses to be used as convenient
places on campus for the expression of such zeal.
The Houses are meant for House programs, not
for campus-wide activities." Using this policy
guideline he admonished a sponsor who allowed
a national leader of ARFEP (Americans for Re
appraisal of Far Eastern Policy) to use one of the
Wilbur lounges to express his zeal, as did one
of his faculty residents in rebuking another spon
sor for making a dinner-time statement on the
need for student support of the Delano grape
strike.
We think this paternalistic attitude is inimical
to any philosophy of education —for freshmen
as well as upperclassmen. We would suggest that
the committee which eventually re-evaluates the
Wilbur system recommend to the Faculty Mas
ter that Point 12 be removed from the General
Policy Statement.
The First Amendment would be more appro
priate.

he wished to conduct for publication in The
Daily. lie was denied access to the list, at least
until the Faculty Master quizzed him on the
validity of the questions to be put to the fresh
men. Although not entirely satisfied that our
staffer had made the most adequate preparation
possible—he had talked to four graduate stu
dents in statistics and a professor of sociology,
but the Faculty Master was of the opinion that
another professor should have been consulted—
the Master did finally authorize the distribution
of the survey.
To put it concisely, this is intolerable —from a
journalist's viewpoint, if no other.
If the poll was inadequate, or even 'rigged',
we think this community would have the intelli
gence to perceive it. Moreover, there is always
the opportunity for rebuttal in the 'Letters' col

the student body to which this paper —its editors
and staffers —is ultimately responsible.
Perhaps the Faculty Master was operating
under Point 12 of his General Policy Statement
for Wilbur (distributed in the Fall), which states
in part: "At the outset it should be made clear
that the Wilbur men are not 'fair game' for the
efforts and enthusiasm of zealots, neither are
the Wilbur Houses to be used as convenient
places on campus for the expression of such zeal.
The Houses are meant for House programs, not
for campus-wide activities." Using this policy
guideline he admonished a sponsor who allowed
a national leader of ARFEP (Americans for Re
appraisal of Far Eastern Policy) to use one of the
Wilbur lounges to express his zeal, as did one
of his faculty residents in rebuking another spon
sor for making a dinner-time statement on the
need for student support of the Delano grape
strike.
We think this paternalistic attitude is inimical
to any philosophy of education —for freshmen
as well as upperclassmen. We would suggest that
the committee which eventually re-evaluates the
Wilbur system recommend to the Faculty Mas
ter that Point 12 be removed from the General
Policy Statement.

Although it may seem presumptous for The
Daily to offer a brief refresher course in elemen
tary civics to a member of the Stanford faculty,
especially when that person happens to be the
Faculty Master of Wilbur Hall, we think the
case warrants it.
