## Grads Protest Whitaker's 'Carrot-Stick' Proposal 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This is by way of a warning
to all graduate students and to
anyone else interested in the
quality of graduate education.
At a meeting of department
heads this week, Dean of Grad
uate Division Virgil K. Whitaker
proposed a new financial ar
rangement for graduate stu
dents. Under the proposed plan,
graduate students would pay
full tuition for two years or un
til their course work is com
pleted. After that time they
would, instead of going on ter
minal registration at $40 a quar
ter, pay $200 a quarter until
their dissertations are com
pleted and approved. Let us
make this crystal clear: if a se
rious scholar takes five years
to complete his dissertation, he
will owe the university $3000.
The principle behind this change
is, as Dr. Whitaker is reported
to have expressed it at the meet
ing, "the carrot and the stick."
Aside from the tremendous
strain that this kind of econom
ic sanction is apt to create in
the personal lives of young
scholars already going through
a period of voluntary poverty,
measures of this sort damage
the most serious ideals of schol
arship and of the university.
They are negative production
bonuses in the academic factory.
They sacrifice the life of the
intellect to the prestige of the
university and to the demands
of the academic labor market.
Precedent will be cited when
and if the administration acts
on this proposal. A similar move
has been made at Columbia Uni
versity. In the furor that fol
lowed opponents were quick to
list some of the teachers and
scholars who had taken an un
seemly length of time to com

plete their studies. Vice-Presi
dent of Columbia Lawrence H.
Chamberlain took 15 years to
get a Ph.D., Lionel Trilling took
13, Robert Brustein 9, Meyer
Schapiro 12, Richard E. Neu
stadt 12, and Lewis Leary, Chair
man of the Department of Eng
lish and Comparative Litera
ture, 13. One could go on, but
the point is quite simple: the
proposal is outrageous, unfair,
detrimental to true scholarship,
and should not be countenanced
by anyone who cares more about
education than production.
It is particularly distressing
that such a plan should come
from so admirable a scholar as
Professor Whitaker, but it is
not altogether surprising since
administrators all over the coun
try are finding themselves
forced to yield to the pressures
which Paul Goodman described
in writing about Berkeley: "the
labor of intelligent youth is
needed and they are accordingly
subjected to tight scheduling,
speedup, and other factory meth
ods. It is frivolous to tell them
to go elsewhere if they don't like
the rules, for they have no
choice but to go to college, and
one factory is like another."
Therefore, we urge graduate
students and their professors
to do everything in their power
to dissuade the administration
from carrying out this proposal.
There is no need to force grad
uate students to do sloppy dis
sertations; it is merely more
convenient. The trend which has
sacrificed the life of the intellect
to administrative convenience
must be stopped as soon as pos
sible, by whatever means neces
sary.

ture, 13. One could go on, but
the point is quite simple: the
proposal is outrageous, unfair,
detrimental to true scholarship,
and should not be countenanced
by anyone who cares more about
education than production.
It is particularly distressing
that such a plan should come
from so admirable a scholar as
Professor Whitaker, but it is
not altogether surprising since
administrators all over the coun
try are finding themselves
forced to yield to the pressures
which Paul Goodman described
in writing about Berkeley: "the
labor of intelligent youth is
needed and they are accordingly
subjected to tight scheduling,
speedup, and other factory meth
ods. It is frivolous to tell them
to go elsewhere if they don't like
the rules, for they have no
choice but to go to college, and
one factory is like another."
Therefore, we urge graduate
students and their professors
to do everything in their power
to dissuade the administration
from carrying out this proposal.
There is no need to force grad
uate students to do sloppy dis
sertations; it is merely more
convenient. The trend which has
sacrificed the life of the intellect
to administrative convenience
must be stopped as soon as pos
sible, by whatever means neces
sary.

Editor, The Daily:
This is by way of a warning
to all graduate students and to
anyone else interested in the
quality of graduate education.
At a meeting of department
heads this week, Dean of Grad
uate Division Virgil K. Whitaker
proposed a new financial ar
rangement for graduate stu
dents. Under the proposed plan,
graduate students would pay
full tuition for two years or un
til their course work is com
pleted. After that time they
would, instead of going on ter
minal registration at $40 a quar
ter, pay $200 a quarter until
their dissertations are com
pleted and approved. Let us
make this crystal clear: if a se
rious scholar takes five years
to complete his dissertation, he
will owe the university $3000.
The principle behind this change
is, as Dr. Whitaker is reported
to have expressed it at the meet
ing, "the carrot and the stick."
Aside from the tremendous
strain that this kind of econom
ic sanction is apt to create in
the personal lives of young
scholars already going through
a period of voluntary poverty,
measures of this sort damage
the most serious ideals of schol
arship and of the university.
They are negative production
bonuses in the academic factory.
They sacrifice the life of the
intellect to the prestige of the
university and to the demands
of the academic labor market.
Precedent will be cited when
and if the administration acts
on this proposal. A similar move
has been made at Columbia Uni
versity. In the furor that fol
lowed opponents were quick to
list some of the teachers and
scholars who had taken an un
seemly length of time to com

plete their studies. Vice-Presi
dent of Columbia Lawrence H.
