# MACKENZIE REPORTS
## Evaluating The Wilbur Sponsor System 
### 
(Editor's Note: Following- is
the text of ASSU President San
dy Mackenzie's speech to the
Legislature last night on the
situation in Wilbur Hall.)
"I'd like to say a few words
about the current unrest in Wil
bur Hall which has reached dan
gerous proportions and threat
ens to jeopardize the fine work
which has been done there in
past years.
"Throughout the past quarter
considerable concern has been
expressed over the situation at
Wilbur. This concern has been
centered around the role to be
played by the Sponsors in the
newly instituted Faculty Master
Program. This issue has been
clouded and confused by partial
knowledge and misinformation.
It has been further obscured by
the fact that although we have
known for some time that cer
tain administrators and faculty
members connected with Wilbur
have questioned aspects of the
sponsor system, they have not as
yet seen fit to deliniate their
concerns in a fashion that would
permit objective examination
and discussion. The resulting
confusion is apparent to all.
"Although the sponsor system
has functioned well for several
years and has received praise
from freshmen, faculty, and ad
ministrators, I believe along
with Dr. Hutchinson, Dr. Wert,
and other members of the Uni

versity Community, including
the sponsors themselves, that a
comprehensive evaluation of
this program could be benefi
cial. The freshman program has
changed considerably since the
initiation of the sponsor sys
tem, and more improvements
will no doubt be forthcoming in
the future. Only through con
stant examination and evalua
tion can a single institution be
long maintained in a progres
sive educational system.
"Certainly, however, no rea
sonable evaluation can be initi
ated without the full participa
tion of the sponsors. Over the
past years it has been recog
nized on many occasions that
the considered opinions of the
sponsors based on their first
hand experience living in Wil
bur constitutes the best source
of information on conditions
there. To ignore them or to al
low them only token participa
tion would be a serious mistake.
"Further, if evaluation leads
to changes at Wilbur Hall, and
if the sponsor system is to con
tinue to exist, it is inconceiva
ble that such changes could be
put into effect without partici
pation by the sponsors in deci
sions on how best to implement
such changes. They are the
group most fully aware of the
role various institutions play in
the lives of freshmen. They
would be best able to gauge the

merits of alternative means of
changing these institutions.
They should be included in any
negotiations which seek to im
prove the Wilbur system.
"I strongly support the spon
sor system. There is no need to
go into detail on the benefits of
their presence in Wilbur; there
has been adequate testimonial to
this from numerous areas in the
university. They are consistantly
cited for the constructive role
they play in helping freshmen
adjust to the university and
formulate their educational ob-

jectives. I believe that it is car
dinal to the continued success
ful operation of this institution
that the means by which spon
sors are chosen guarantees max
imum autonomy to the selection
committee.
"The Sponsor Selection Bill
(#65-6-59), currently in the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, indi
cates the willingness of the spon
sors to reevaluate their own ex
istence with respect to better
serving the 750 residing in Wil
bur. The smooth integration of
Freshmen into the intellectual

community should be the pri
mary concern of all those in
volved in the Wilbur program.
With this in mind, sponsors have
shown themselves willing to ac
comodate to numerous changing
policiesâ€”as long; as the changes
contribute to and do not jeopar
dize this integration.
"In this they have my full
support. A great university
should be able to see beyond its
organizational charts to the val
ues of a personal and effective
program."
