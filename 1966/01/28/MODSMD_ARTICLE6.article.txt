# Kerensky Reviews Eisenstein Movie
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
Alexander Kerensky, Prime Minis
ter of the Russian Provisional Gov
ernment and now a Stanford History
Professor, last night described Ten
Days That Shook the World, S. M.
Eisenstein's "propaganda" film about
the Russian Revolution, as almost
"pure fantasy."
He was speaking on Quad to a
group of about 70 people gathered to
discuss the movie, which was shown
to an audience of 600 Wednesday
night in Cubberley in connection with
Dr.. George Stoney's Communication
312 seminar.
Stoney called the film "an attempt
to make Dr. Kerensky the Benedict
Arnold of the Russian Revolution."
Eisenstein, who was a 17-year-old
student in St. Petersburg at the time
of the October Revolution, made Ten
Days in 1927-28 to celebrate the Revo
lution's tenth anniversary.
Fight For Freedom
Kerensky agreed with Stoney's init
ial praise of Eisentein's technique. He
said that he had viewed the film "with
pleasure" and was even moved by
the "masses of simple people in their
fight for the restoration of freedom
against a very bad tyrant."
He emphasized, however, that

"practically the movement was much
different."
"When in a movie of Eisenstein,"
he said, "you see how all soldiers
and sailors and even people in general
support this movement, it is not true.
Practically the movement was stop
ped in the beginning. It was finished
without shedding a drop of blood.
"The consequence of childish con
spiracy," he said, "is very bad. The
conspirators created a legend that I
was a member of the conspiracy and
I betrayed my frieYids out of fear of
the Soviets. I understood what hap
pened, but this was the beginning of
the decomposition of the democratic
powers."
Villain's Report
Stoney introduced Kerensky's
speech as "a report from the villian
of the piece." He said that Ten Days
originally had two heroes, Lenin and
Trotsky. After Trotsky was discredit
ed by the Communists, Eisenstein
spent five months working to elimin
ate Trotsky almost completely from
the film.
"Many of you who saw the film
last night were wondering who that
man with the floppy hat was," said
Stoney. "Well, he was the remnant of
Trotsky."

"practically the movement was much
different."
"When in a movie of Eisenstein,"
he said, "you see how all soldiers
and sailors and even people in general
support this movement, it is not true.
Practically the movement was stop
ped in the beginning. It was finished
without shedding a drop of blood.
"The consequence of childish con
spiracy," he said, "is very bad. The
conspirators created a legend that I
was a member of the conspiracy and
I betrayed my frieYids out of fear of
the Soviets. I understood what hap
pened, but this was the beginning of
the decomposition of the democratic
powers."
Villain's Report
Stoney introduced Kerensky's
speech as "a report from the villian
of the piece." He said that Ten Days
originally had two heroes, Lenin and
Trotsky. After Trotsky was discredit
ed by the Communists, Eisenstein
spent five months working to elimin
ate Trotsky almost completely from
the film.
"Many of you who saw the film
last night were wondering who that
man with the floppy hat was," said
Stoney. "Well, he was the remnant of
Trotsky."
Alexander Kerensky, Prime Minis
ter of the Russian Provisional Gov
ernment and now a Stanford History
Professor, last night described Ten
Days That Shook the World, S. M.
Eisenstein's "propaganda" film about
the Russian Revolution, as almost
"pure fantasy."
He was speaking on Quad to a
group of about 70 people gathered to
discuss the movie, which was shown
to an audience of 600 Wednesday
night in Cubberley in connection with
Dr.. George Stoney's Communication
312 seminar.
Stoney called the film "an attempt
to make Dr. Kerensky the Benedict
Arnold of the Russian Revolution."
Eisenstein, who was a 17-year-old
student in St. Petersburg at the time
of the October Revolution, made Ten
Days in 1927-28 to celebrate the Revo
lution's tenth anniversary.
Fight For Freedom
Kerensky agreed with Stoney's init
ial praise of Eisentein's technique. He
said that he had viewed the film "with
pleasure" and was even moved by
the "masses of simple people in their
fight for the restoration of freedom
against a very bad tyrant."
He emphasized, however, that

"practically the movement was much
different."
"When in a movie of Eisenstein,"
he said, "you see how all soldiers
and sailors and even people in general
support this movement, it is not true.
Practically the movement was stop
