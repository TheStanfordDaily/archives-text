# LASSU Accepts Hours Revision
## 
### JAMES VIRGIL SELNA 
Assistant Editor
In a hectic session last night the
Legislature passed a resolution ex
tending the overnight signout dead
line for women.
The resolution will permit fresh
man and sophomore women to sign
for an overnight as late as 2:30 a.m.
and upper class women as late as 6
a.m. Speaker of the Legislature Jay
Kadane said that the resolution pre
sented by the Social Regulations Com
mittee constituted an interpretation
of the existing by-laws. Thus the new
deadlines will take effect immediate
ly-
In his message to the Legislature
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
said that no realistic evaluation of the
Sponsor Program could be made with
out assistance of the sponsors. Calling
for a comprehensive reevaluation of
the program, Mackenzie stated that
"the considered opinion of the spon
sors" was one of the "best sources
of information."
Beyond the Charts
"A great university should be able
to see beyond its organizational
chart," the ASSU President noted.
Much of the Legislature's evening
was spent in discussing appropriation
measures. The body unanimously ap
proved a $1000 grant to the Ravens
wood Tutorial Project for expansion
and evaluation of the program.
Dick Williams, sponsor of the meas-

ure, told the Legislature that the
funds would aid in transforming the
tutorial into a community project ra
ther than a University undertaking.
According to Williams part of $500,-
000 in federal funds would be availa
ble to the tutorial if it were a com
munity project.
A good deal of the early session was
spent in haggling over the terms of
a loan to Fremont which would ena
ble the Stern house to purchase a
color television. After a 40 minute de
bate, well strewn with tongue-in
cheek questions directed at Mike Cou
zens, sponsor of the measure, the loan
was approved.
The Central Issue
Consideration of measure to pay off
the debt incurred by Cardinal Board
as a result of Big Game Bonfire was
overwhelmingly defeated. The central
issue was whether LASSU should au
thorize payment of expenditures over
and above those contracted by the
Cardinal Board through the issuance
of a purchase order to the University
Plants.
The University billed the Board for
clean-up expenses well in excess of
the amount of their purchase order.
Part of the additional costs, though
not authorized, were due to the mud
and inclement conditions which
caused delays, according to a Cardi
nal Board spokesman.
Having done a bit of investigation
on his own, LASSU representative
Martin Gerry of the Law School pre
sented figures to show that the Uni
versity charges campus organiza
tions 4.20 per hour for unskilled labor
for which the University pays only
2.79.
As a result of this and other dis
crepancies in the University billing,
LASSU set up an investigation com
mittee to look into the situation.

In his message to the Legislature
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
said that no realistic evaluation of the
Sponsor Program could be made with
out assistance of the sponsors. Calling
for a comprehensive reevaluation of
the program, Mackenzie stated that
"the considered opinion of the spon
sors" was one of the "best sources
of information."
Beyond the Charts
"A great university should be able
to see beyond its organizational
chart," the ASSU President noted.
Much of the Legislature's evening
was spent in discussing appropriation
measures. The body unanimously ap
proved a $1000 grant to the Ravens
wood Tutorial Project for expansion
and evaluation of the program.
Dick Williams, sponsor of the meas-

ure, told the Legislature that the
funds would aid in transforming the
tutorial into a community project ra
ther than a University undertaking.
According to Williams part of $500,-
000 in federal funds would be availa
ble to the tutorial if it were a com
munity project.
A good deal of the early session was
spent in haggling over the terms of
a loan to Fremont which would ena
ble the Stern house to purchase a
color television. After a 40 minute de
bate, well strewn with tongue-in
cheek questions directed at Mike Cou
zens, sponsor of the measure, the loan
was approved.
The Central Issue
Consideration of measure to pay off
the debt incurred by Cardinal Board
as a result of Big Game Bonfire was
overwhelmingly defeated. The central
issue was whether LASSU should au
thorize payment of expenditures over
and above those contracted by the
Cardinal Board through the issuance
of a purchase order to the University
Plants.
The University billed the Board for
clean-up expenses well in excess of
the amount of their purchase order.
Part of the additional costs, though
not authorized, were due to the mud
and inclement conditions which
caused delays, according to a Cardi
nal Board spokesman.
Having done a bit of investigation
on his own, LASSU representative
Martin Gerry of the Law School pre
sented figures to show that the Uni
versity charges campus organiza
tions 4.20 per hour for unskilled labor
for which the University pays only
2.79.
As a result of this and other dis
crepancies in the University billing,
LASSU set up an investigation com
mittee to look into the situation.
