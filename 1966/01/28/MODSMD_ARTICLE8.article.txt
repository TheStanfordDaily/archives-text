### TINA PRESS 
A member of the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam was beaten
yesterday while distributing anti
napalm leaflets near the Coyote com
pany which manufactures the gas.
Anthony Libby, teaching assistant
in English, said that a man not con
nected with the plant drove up and
began striking him in the face. "Hit
ting me was his protest," said Libby.
"After reading a leaflet which he had
gotten the day before, he apparently
decided we were true Communists
and had to react."
The SCPV has been leafletting near
