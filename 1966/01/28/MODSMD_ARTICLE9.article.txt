• Big Victory For Laborites
HULL, England — Prime Minister
Harold Wilson's Labor party dealt a
smashing defeat to Conservatives in
a crucial election here Thursday for
a House of Commons seat. The victo
ry margin, 5,361 votes, was far higher
than anyone predicted.
In London, Wilson's prestige re
ceived an added boost Thursday night
in a House of Commons vote that
beat back opposition attacks on the
government's economic policy.
In the Hull contest, the percentage
shift to Labor was the largest in any
special election since Wilson became
prime minister in 1964. A similar
swing throughout the country would
give Labor a heavy majority in na
tional elections.
The victory of Labor candidate Ke
vin MeNamara, 31, a law lecturer,
boosted Wilson's majority in Com
mons to four votes.
The Hull outcome represented a
personal slap for Edward Heath, lead
er of the Conservative party.
Both national leading parties had
invested prestige heavily in the cam
paign.
The result brought a collapse of
hopes for radical leftists pressing
Wilson to take a tougher stand against

U. S. policy in Vietnam.
Conservatives had conceded in ad
vance that a Labor victory of any
magnitude would damage their party
for months. But neither side had fore
seen a Labor triumph like this.
• Atomic Device Still Lost
ALMERIA, Spain — A fleet of U.S.
and Spanish navy ships stood by
Thursday as a two-man bathysphere
dived repeatedly into the Mediterran
ean hunting a nuclear device missing
since a U.S. 852 bomber and its jet
tanker collided last week. The device
was believed on the bottom 1,000 feet
down. The bathysphere's maximum
depth was about 300 feet, but an
other diving bell capable of i-eaching
the bottom was reported en route
from the United States.
• War On Crime Boosted
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Brown said
Thursday he has budgeted $901,000 for
1966-67 to finance use of modern tech-

nological advances in a stepped up
war on crime.
Biggest share of the money—sslo,-
000—would pay for design of a state
wide information system to link state,
city and county law enforcement ag
encies with the courts and prisons.
The plan grew out of one of the
four special aerospace study con
tracts, conducted under a $100,000
state contract last year.
Brown said the programs are an at
tempt to use up-to-date concepts in
battling crime. He said studies have
shown that "the answer to the crime
problem ... is not always a greater
quantity of existing forces.
The governor said an improved
communications network linking law
enforcement agencies, the courts and
prisons could sharply reduce criminal
record search operations, provide up
to-the-minute analyses of crime pat
terns and result in better statistical in
formation on offenders.

• Baseball Squabble Looms
MILWAUKEE, Wis. — Wisconsin
won a court order Thursday directing
the National League to maintain ma
jor league baseball in Milwaukee in
1966 and thereafter.
But the action by Circuit Judge El
mer W. Roller, who already has ruled
that his court has jurisdiction in
State Atty. Gen. Bronson C. LaFol
lette's antitrust action directed at the
foundation structure of the game, left
the way open for an alternative.
The National League still has time
to decide whether it wants to submit
its 44-year old immunity to the perils
of a new test in a trial court, when
settlement is only a franchise away.
And there were some indications,
in the journey of Milwaukee repre
sentatives to New York, that the
league might after long resistance be
exploring the alternative of awarding
a new franchise to the city to replace
the Atlanta-bound Braves.
LaFollet had asked that, as one al
ternative to binding the Braves fran
chise to Milwaukee.
In Atlanta, Braves Board Chairman
William Bartholomay insisted the
Braves would open the season April
12 in Atlanta under a Fulton County
Court order.

• Baseball Squabble Looms
MILWAUKEE, Wis. — Wisconsin
won a court order Thursday directing
the National League to maintain ma

But the action by Circuit Judge El
mer W. Roller, who already has ruled
that his court has jurisdiction in
State Atty. Gen. Bronson C. LaFol

the way open for an alternative.
The National League still has time

of a new test in a trial court, when
settlement is only a franchise away.
And there were some indications,

a new franchise to the city to replace

• Big Victory For Laborites
HULL, England — Prime Minister
Harold Wilson's Labor party dealt a
smashing defeat to Conservatives in
a crucial election here Thursday for
a House of Commons seat. The victo
ry margin, 5,361 votes, was far higher
than anyone predicted.
In London, Wilson's prestige re
ceived an added boost Thursday night
in a House of Commons vote that
beat back opposition attacks on the
government's economic policy.
In the Hull contest, the percentage
shift to Labor was the largest in any
special election since Wilson became
prime minister in 1964. A similar
swing throughout the country would
give Labor a heavy majority in na
tional elections.
The victory of Labor candidate Ke
vin MeNamara, 31, a law lecturer,
boosted Wilson's majority in Com
mons to four votes.
The Hull outcome represented a
personal slap for Edward Heath, lead
er of the Conservative party.
Both national leading parties had
invested prestige heavily in the cam
paign.
The result brought a collapse of
hopes for radical leftists pressing
Wilson to take a tougher stand against

U. S. policy in Vietnam.
Conservatives had conceded in ad
vance that a Labor victory of any
magnitude would damage their party
for months. But neither side had fore
seen a Labor triumph like this.
• Atomic Device Still Lost
ALMERIA, Spain — A fleet of U.S.

Thursday as a two-man bathysphere

since a U.S. 852 bomber and its jet
tanker collided last week. The device
was believed on the bottom 1,000 feet

• War On Crime Boosted
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Brown said
Thursday he has budgeted $901,000 for
1966-67 to finance use of modern tech-

war on crime.
Biggest share of the money—sslo,-

The plan grew out of one of the
