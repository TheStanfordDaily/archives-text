Correction
Dr. Alexander Kerensky was
quoted in Friday's DAILY as say
ing, "when in a movie of Eisen
stein you see how all soldiers and
sailors and even people in gen
eral support tills movement, it
is not true. Practically the move
ment was stopped in the begin
ning. It was finished without
shedding a drop of blood." This
remark refers not, as implied, to
the October Revolution, but to the
earlier revolt led by General L. G.
Kornilov.
