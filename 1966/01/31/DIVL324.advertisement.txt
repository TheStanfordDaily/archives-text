Sources and Sinks
A "source" is a point of origin, an initiating locus, such as a fountain
or well. A "sink" is a sump or drain where flow disappears.
People are sources or sinks. Every man is either part of the poblem, or
part of the solution. Some people are sources, where life and love spring forth.
Others are sinks of death, persons who soak up energy living for themselves
alone. The former man gives freely without expecting reward, the latter digs
his own hole and pulls it in after him.
Sources of life in the world of people are called "Christians," because
of their Leader, Jesus Christ, who told them, "He who believes in me, as
the Scripture has said, out of his innermost being will come rivers of living
water" (John 7:38).
Sinks of life are called in the Bible "sinners." Sinners we all are, by .
birth, action, and choice, until reconciled to God. "Everyone who commits sin
is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that Jesus Christ ap
peared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides iin
him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. Little children let
no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous. He who commits sin is
of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. No one born of God
commits sin, for God's nature abides in him and he cannot sin because he is
born of God. By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are
the children of the devil:; whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he wfio
does not love his neighbor" (I John 3:4-10).
To become a source instead of a sink, a saint instead of a sinner, all
anyone need do is apply personally and directly to the Lord Jesus Christ. This
brings the necessary internal readjustments which make it possible to love our
neighbors as ourselves. The Bible says, "Jesus Christ died for all, so that those
who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake
died and was raised."
Are you part of the world's problems or part of the answer? Losing your
life for Jesus' sake will bring you to power you need to do something real in
this world. There is hell to pay for staying wrong.
