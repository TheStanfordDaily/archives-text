• A-Bomb Hunt Continues
ALMERIA, Spain — Posibly spurred
by fear that Communist agents might
find it first, U. S. experts continued
their search Sunday for a nuclear
bomb missing after the crash of a
852 bomber.
Another reason for urgency was
the worry that other countries might
follow Spain's lead and ban the flight
of nuclear-armed U.S. planes over
their territory if it seemed possible
a bomb could be permanently lost.
