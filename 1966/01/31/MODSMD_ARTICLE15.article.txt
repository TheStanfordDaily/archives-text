# Bruin Parking Row Faces Courtrooms
## 
### 
Limited parking facilities have
become an ever-growing problem
for college campuses throughout
the nation. At UCLA students
are taking their case to court.
The problem at UCLA, accord
ing to a recent article in the
Los Angeles Times, stems from
a dispute between students and
property owners around the
campus.
Students contend nearby
homeowners pressured the city
of Westwood to restrict parking
on residential streets because
they considered students a nuis
ance. Responding to these re
strictions, the students have
challenged the ordinances as dis
regarding the general public in
terest and have taken their case
to the Superior Court.
Short 1,100 Spaces
UCLA oficials say there is a
present shortage of more than
1,100 parking spaces for stu
dents alone, and that student
cars spill into the residential
areas.
The college is not permitted
by State law to use public funds
for parking lots, and a $G a
month fee is charged to help fi
nance a $20 million program to
end the shortage by 1970.
But until the program is com
pleted, the students have to
rely on surrounding street area.
Now most of those spaces are
banned to students.
Traffic courts, according to
the Times article, have dismiss
ed parking tickets against stu
dents where restricted parking
/ones were established strictly
on petitions from property own
ers.
The city, however, has refused
to remove restrictions and police
continue to ticket cars.
Special Ilearing
Before the Superior Court
takes the case, a special hearing
has been scheduled by the City
Traffic Department to attempt
a compromise.
"We don't want anyone to
think we are just going to give

in completely to the students,"
said Traffic Manager S. S. Tay
lor. He said each side would pre
sent its views and a final study
would be made.
Residents acting through the
Westside Community Planning
Committee, have been adamant
in their stand. They have re
fused to enter negotiations
which would result in the lower
ing of parking restrictions. They
contend they are paying for the
university's failure to provide
adequate student parking if
campus drivers are allowed to
use residential streets for park
ing.
Chancellor Franklin D. Mur
phy commented, "UCLA is do
ing more and spending more
money to solve this problem
than any other university in the
United States."
'We are neither so impractic
al nor selfish as to expect that
every square foot of space
should be made available to us
on an unrestricted basis," said
Steven Adritto, 22, who repre
sents the Associated Students.
Student Demands
"But we feel the present sys
tem is neither equitable nor le
gal, and our position has been
supported by three different
judges," he said. "What we are
after is a 50 per cent availability
on the public streets. On one
side of each street, parking
should be unrestricted from 8
a.m. to 1 p.m., but the other
side should be under a one-hour
restriction.
"This would consider the in
terests of both segments of the
public. It would be a reasonable
solution," Arditto, a second-year
law student stated.
The city traffic manager said
that a final decision on the case
will come about two weeks fol
lowing the hearing.

Before the Superior Court
takes the case, a special hearing
has been scheduled by the City
Traffic Department to attempt
a compromise.
"We don't want anyone to
think we are just going to give

in completely to the students,"
said Traffic Manager S. S. Tay
lor. He said each side would pre
sent its views and a final study
would be made.
Residents acting through the
Westside Community Planning
Committee, have been adamant
in their stand. They have re
fused to enter negotiations
which would result in the lower
ing of parking restrictions. They
contend they are paying for the
university's failure to provide
adequate student parking if
campus drivers are allowed to
use residential streets for park
ing.
Chancellor Franklin D. Mur
phy commented, "UCLA is do
ing more and spending more
money to solve this problem
than any other university in the
United States."
'We are neither so impractic
al nor selfish as to expect that
every square foot of space
should be made available to us
on an unrestricted basis," said
Steven Adritto, 22, who repre
sents the Associated Students.
Student Demands
"But we feel the present sys
tem is neither equitable nor le
gal, and our position has been
supported by three different
judges," he said. "What we are
after is a 50 per cent availability
on the public streets. On one
side of each street, parking
should be unrestricted from 8
a.m. to 1 p.m., but the other
side should be under a one-hour
restriction.
"This would consider the in
terests of both segments of the
public. It would be a reasonable
solution," Arditto, a second-year
law student stated.
The city traffic manager said
that a final decision on the case
will come about two weeks fol
lowing the hearing.
Limited parking facilities have
become an ever-growing problem
for college campuses throughout
the nation. At UCLA students
are taking their case to court.
The problem at UCLA, accord
ing to a recent article in the
Los Angeles Times, stems from
a dispute between students and
property owners around the
campus.
Students contend nearby
homeowners pressured the city
of Westwood to restrict parking
on residential streets because
they considered students a nuis
ance. Responding to these re
strictions, the students have
challenged the ordinances as dis
regarding the general public in
terest and have taken their case
to the Superior Court.
Short 1,100 Spaces
UCLA oficials say there is a
present shortage of more than
1,100 parking spaces for stu
dents alone, and that student
cars spill into the residential
areas.
The college is not permitted
by State law to use public funds
for parking lots, and a $G a
month fee is charged to help fi
nance a $20 million program to
end the shortage by 1970.
But until the program is com
pleted, the students have to
rely on surrounding street area.
Now most of those spaces are
banned to students.
Traffic courts, according to
the Times article, have dismiss
ed parking tickets against stu
dents where restricted parking
/ones were established strictly
on petitions from property own
ers.
The city, however, has refused
to remove restrictions and police
continue to ticket cars.
