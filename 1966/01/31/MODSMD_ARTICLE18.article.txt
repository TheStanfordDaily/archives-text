# Expert Cites Stalinist Gains In Kremlin Power Struggles
## 
### 
Hard-line Stalinists may be
gaining ground in the grim
power struggle now going on
in the Kremlin, increasing the
danger of war, exiled Russian
socialist Boris I. Nicolaevsky
said in an interview this week at
his home here.
Nicolaevsky, who has been
called "the greatest authority in
the Western world on Soviet
politics." is now a curator at the
Hoover Institution on War, Rev
olution and Peace at Stanford.
The interview was in connec
tion with his latest book, Power
and the Soviet Elite.
"The stronger dictatorship
grows, the greater becomes the
danger of war," he said som
berly. "Throughout history dic
tatorship and wars have been
closely tied together."
Among the signs of Stalinist

strength in the Soviet govern
ment he cited:
• The arrest, for the first
time since Stalin's death, of
"some very important Russian
writers," Andrei Sinyavsky and
Yuli M. Daniel.
• Increasingly prominent
mention of A. N. Shelepin and
M. A. Suslov. Nicolaevsky de
scribed Shelepin as "a totalitar
ian." Suslov, he said, "was and
remains the most influential
Stalinist" in the top government
ruling group.
It was Suslov, he added, who
revealed by a slip of the tongue
that ex-premier Nikita Khrush
chev narrowly escaped being put
to trial instead of allowed to re
tire peacefully, after his fall
from power in October, 1964.
Nicolaevsky, a man of mas
sive frame, is now in his eight
ies. He has never shared the
comfortable view so widely ex
pressed after Khrushchev's
forced retirement that the new
government is a fairly stable ex
tension of its predecessor, with
perceptible tendencies toward
liberalization.
The Liberal Kosygln
He finds ample evidence that
current Premier Alexsei Kosy
gin, who leans toward the more
"liberal" wing of the Commun
ist Party dictatorship, has his
hands full trying to maintain
this position.
Shelepin played a major role
in "bringing down Khrushchev,"
Nicolaevsky asserted. Probably
he as well as Suslov favored
putting the deposed premier on
trial. Obviously Kosygin suc
ceeded in blocking this, at least
for the time being.
That Suslov had pushed for a
trial became evident, Nicolaev
sky explained, when a French
delegation went to Moscow re
questing an interview with
Khrushchev in retirement. The
French press reported that Sus
lov rejected the request, saying,
"You can hear him talk at his
trial."
No mention of such a trial ap
peared in the Soviet press. And
little notice was taken of the
single fleeting report in France.
Hopeful View
Although pessimistic about
the immediate prospect of lib
eralization in Russia, Nicolaev
sky takes a far more hopeful

long range view. Even if Stalin
ists should get the upper hand,
conditions are not the same in
.Russia as in 1934.
"The intellectuals and the
scientists all favor liberaliza
tion," he declared. "This is an
important factor, especially be
cause of the big successes of
technical science with the cos
monauts and other projects in
space."
Of course there is no direct
channel in Russia through
which public opinion can affect
government policy. Neverthe
less, the increased size and con
sequence of the educated seg
ment of Soviet society today is
known and felt, he thinks.
The arrests of the Russian
writers Sinyavsky and Daniel
were not reported in the Soviet
press. Yet in December a wire
service dispatch told of a dem
onstration by 200 Russian stu
dents in Moscow on behalf of
Sinyavsky, a teacher at the
Gorki Institute of World Litera
ture as well as writer and critic.
Varied Career
"There is an old Russian pro
verb that says you cannot take
onto your bayonets the ideas of
freedom—but only the people
who express the ideas," said
Nicolaevsky.
The exiled writer has made
a career of observing Soviet
trends and collecting relevant
historical data ever since the
Bolsheviks banished him in 1922
with other Menshevik moder
ates. Before the revolution of
1917, he was arrested eight
times by the Czarist govern
ment and exiled three times to
Siberia. He escaped twice.

scribed Shelepin as "a totalitar
ian." Suslov, he said, "was and
remains the most influential
Stalinist" in the top government
ruling group.
It was Suslov, he added, who
revealed by a slip of the tongue
that ex-premier Nikita Khrush
chev narrowly escaped being put
to trial instead of allowed to re
tire peacefully, after his fall
from power in October, 1964.
Nicolaevsky, a man of mas
sive frame, is now in his eight
ies. He has never shared the
comfortable view so widely ex
pressed after Khrushchev's
forced retirement that the new
government is a fairly stable ex
tension of its predecessor, with
perceptible tendencies toward
liberalization.

He finds ample evidence that
current Premier Alexsei Kosy
gin, who leans toward the more
"liberal" wing of the Commun
ist Party dictatorship, has his
hands full trying to maintain
this position.
Shelepin played a major role
in "bringing down Khrushchev,"
Nicolaevsky asserted. Probably
he as well as Suslov favored
putting the deposed premier on
trial. Obviously Kosygin suc
ceeded in blocking this, at least
for the time being.
That Suslov had pushed for a
trial became evident, Nicolaev
sky explained, when a French
delegation went to Moscow re
questing an interview with
Khrushchev in retirement. The
French press reported that Sus
lov rejected the request, saying,
"You can hear him talk at his
trial."
No mention of such a trial ap
peared in the Soviet press. And
little notice was taken of the
single fleeting report in France.
Hopeful View
Although pessimistic about
the immediate prospect of lib
eralization in Russia, Nicolaev
sky takes a far more hopeful

long range view. Even if Stalin
ists should get the upper hand,
conditions are not the same in
.Russia as in 1934.
"The intellectuals and the
scientists all favor liberaliza
tion," he declared. "This is an
important factor, especially be
cause of the big successes of
technical science with the cos
monauts and other projects in
space."
Of course there is no direct
channel in Russia through
which public opinion can affect
government policy. Neverthe
less, the increased size and con
sequence of the educated seg
ment of Soviet society today is
known and felt, he thinks.
The arrests of the Russian
writers Sinyavsky and Daniel
were not reported in the Soviet
press. Yet in December a wire
service dispatch told of a dem
onstration by 200 Russian stu
dents in Moscow on behalf of
Sinyavsky, a teacher at the
Gorki Institute of World Litera
ture as well as writer and critic.
Varied Career
"There is an old Russian pro
verb that says you cannot take
onto your bayonets the ideas of
freedom—but only the people
who express the ideas," said
Nicolaevsky.
The exiled writer has made
a career of observing Soviet
trends and collecting relevant
historical data ever since the
Bolsheviks banished him in 1922
with other Menshevik moder
ates. Before the revolution of
1917, he was arrested eight
times by the Czarist govern
ment and exiled three times to
Siberia. He escaped twice.
Hard-line Stalinists may be
gaining ground in the grim
power struggle now going on
in the Kremlin, increasing the
danger of war, exiled Russian
socialist Boris I. Nicolaevsky
said in an interview this week at
his home here.
Nicolaevsky, who has been
called "the greatest authority in
the Western world on Soviet
politics." is now a curator at the
Hoover Institution on War, Rev
olution and Peace at Stanford.
The interview was in connec
tion with his latest book, Power
and the Soviet Elite.
"The stronger dictatorship
grows, the greater becomes the
danger of war," he said som
berly. "Throughout history dic
tatorship and wars have been
closely tied together."
Among the signs of Stalinist

strength in the Soviet govern
ment he cited:
• The arrest, for the first
time since Stalin's death, of
"some very important Russian
writers," Andrei Sinyavsky and
Yuli M. Daniel.
• Increasingly prominent

putting the deposed premier on
trial. Obviously Kosygin suc
ceeded in blocking this, at least
for the time being.
That Suslov had pushed for a
trial became evident, Nicolaev
sky explained, when a French
delegation went to Moscow re
questing an interview with
Khrushchev in retirement. The
French press reported that Sus
lov rejected the request, saying,
"You can hear him talk at his
trial."
No mention of such a trial ap
peared in the Soviet press. And
little notice was taken of the
single fleeting report in France.
Hopeful View
Although pessimistic about
the immediate prospect of lib
eralization in Russia, Nicolaev
sky takes a far more hopeful

long range view. Even if Stalin
ists should get the upper hand,
conditions are not the same in
.Russia as in 1934.
"The intellectuals and the
scientists all favor liberaliza
tion," he declared. "This is an
important factor, especially be
cause of the big successes of
technical science with the cos
monauts and other projects in
space."
Of course there is no direct
channel in Russia through
which public opinion can affect
government policy. Neverthe
less, the increased size and con
sequence of the educated seg
ment of Soviet society today is
known and felt, he thinks.
The arrests of the Russian
writers Sinyavsky and Daniel
were not reported in the Soviet
press. Yet in December a wire
service dispatch told of a dem
onstration by 200 Russian stu
dents in Moscow on behalf of
Sinyavsky, a teacher at the
Gorki Institute of World Litera
ture as well as writer and critic.
Varied Career
"There is an old Russian pro
verb that says you cannot take
onto your bayonets the ideas of
freedom—but only the people
who express the ideas," said
Nicolaevsky.
The exiled writer has made
a career of observing Soviet
trends and collecting relevant
historical data ever since the
Bolsheviks banished him in 1922
with other Menshevik moder
ates. Before the revolution of
1917, he was arrested eight
times by the Czarist govern
ment and exiled three times to
Siberia. He escaped twice.
