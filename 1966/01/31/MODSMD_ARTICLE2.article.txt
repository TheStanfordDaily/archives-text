# New Guidelines For Student Deferments To Be Established
## 
### 
Lt. General Lewis Hershey, national
director of the Selective Service, an
nounced Friday that new guidelines
for student deferments, based on
class rank and test scores, would soon
go into effect.
Due to increasd draft calls in re
cent months, local boards have been
forced to look to the 1.8 million col
leg students holding 11-2 deferments
in order to fill their quotas. Although
no details were made public about the
new criteria, standards will probably
be similar to those used during the
Korean War.
Commenting earlier this week Stan
ford National Service Adviser, Walter
J. Findeisen, stressed the need for an
"intelligent, cohesive deferment pro
gram that would eliminate student
concern." Findeisen noted that much
of student anxiety was caused by the
uncertainity about criteria for a de
ferment.
Unnecessary Worry
Presently, a student is eligible for
a 11-2 deferment if his local board
deems his education is in the best na
tional interest. Wide variance in in
terpretations by local boards have
caused more worry than necessary,
Findeisen noted.
Findeisen said that Stanford stu
dents in good standing academically
would have little trouble meeting de
ferment standards used during the
Korean war, rgardless of class rank.
Students not in the required percentile

would be given an opportunity to
qualify for a deferment on the basis
of Selective Service test scores.
Under the Korean War standards
which were in use until 1963, qualifi
cation tests were designed to test the
skill of graduating high school seniors.
In light of Stanford's admissions
standards, Findeisen said the test
would not pose a problem for students
unable to qualify for deferment on
the basis of class rank.
Only A Guideline
However Findeisen emphasized that
the new standard would merely serve
as advisory guidelines for local draft
officials. Regardless of a student's
performance, the ultimate decision
ahout deferments is the sole responsi
bility of the local board.
General Hershey plans to initiate
Selective Service tests for college stu
dents by the end of this school year.
Additional tests may be given next
fall also.
Recent reports have suggested that
mismanagement of current man
power pools by the Selective Service
have made it necessary to start draft
ing college students. Findeisen told
The Daily he seriously doubted the
Selective Service could meet its
quotas without calling college stu
dents because of a sheer lack of avail
able men rather than any mishandl
ing.
Although 150,000 men are added to
the manpower pool each month, the
Stanford National Service Advisor
estimated that no more than 10-20 per
cent of these men could be drafted.
With draft calls likely to rise well
above the present 30,000 per month
in a continuing Vietnam crisis, Find
eisen termed it inevitable that Selec
tive Service officials dip into the col
lege ranks.

With draft calls likely to rise well
above the present 30,000 per month
in a continuing Vietnam crisis, Find
eisen termed it inevitable that Selec
tive Service officials dip into the col
lege ranks.
Lt. General Lewis Hershey, national
director of the Selective Service, an
nounced Friday that new guidelines
for student deferments, based on
class rank and test scores, would soon
go into effect.
Due to increasd draft calls in re
cent months, local boards have been
forced to look to the 1.8 million col
leg students holding 11-2 deferments
in order to fill their quotas. Although
no details were made public about the
new criteria, standards will probably
be similar to those used during the
Korean War.
Commenting earlier this week Stan
ford National Service Adviser, Walter
J. Findeisen, stressed the need for an
"intelligent, cohesive deferment pro
gram that would eliminate student
concern." Findeisen noted that much
of student anxiety was caused by the
uncertainity about criteria for a de
ferment.
Unnecessary Worry
Presently, a student is eligible for
a 11-2 deferment if his local board
deems his education is in the best na
tional interest. Wide variance in in
terpretations by local boards have
caused more worry than necessary,
Findeisen noted.
Findeisen said that Stanford stu
dents in good standing academically
would have little trouble meeting de
ferment standards used during the
Korean war, rgardless of class rank.
Students not in the required percentile

would be given an opportunity to
qualify for a deferment on the basis
of Selective Service test scores.
Under the Korean War standards
which were in use until 1963, qualifi
cation tests were designed to test the
skill of graduating high school seniors.
In light of Stanford's admissions
standards, Findeisen said the test
would not pose a problem for students
unable to qualify for deferment on
the basis of class rank.
Only A Guideline
However Findeisen emphasized that
the new standard would merely serve
as advisory guidelines for local draft
officials. Regardless of a student's
performance, the ultimate decision
ahout deferments is the sole responsi
bility of the local board.
General Hershey plans to initiate
Selective Service tests for college stu
dents by the end of this school year.
Additional tests may be given next
fall also.
Recent reports have suggested that
mismanagement of current man
power pools by the Selective Service
have made it necessary to start draft
ing college students. Findeisen told
The Daily he seriously doubted the
Selective Service could meet its
quotas without calling college stu
dents because of a sheer lack of avail
able men rather than any mishandl
ing.
Although 150,000 men are added to
the manpower pool each month, the
Stanford National Service Advisor
estimated that no more than 10-20 per
cent of these men could be drafted.
