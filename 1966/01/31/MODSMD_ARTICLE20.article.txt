"The paper is in error," said
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
commenting on a report pub
lished Saturday in the Palo Alto
Times that he had been be
queathed use of the Atherton
home by a friend of the family.
Sterling added that "the home
has been left to the University,"
while denying that the 2220
Stockbridge Ave. residence was
intended for his use.
According to the Times' ver
sion of the story, Mrs. Mae
Vrooman Forbes, who died Jan.
23 at age 89, made the bequest
with the stipulation (hat Dr.
Sterling must be allowed to live
in the home if he so desires.
If the conditions are breached
the property will revert to Mrs.
Forbes' heirs, the Times stated.
The Sterlings' residence is 623
Mirada Ave., the former Lou
Henry Hoover home.
Mrs. Forbes' will was filed for
probate Friday in San Mateo
County Superior Court, Red
wood City. The Times estimated
the estate's value at $1.5 million.
Daughter of the late Henry
Vrooman, a former state sena
tor and Stanford trustee, Mrs.
Forbes was the widow of
Cleaveland Forbes, a retired en
gineer for the Spring Valley
Water Co.
The Forbes property includes
some four acres, part of it or
chard west of Alameda de Las
Pulgas. The home itself, reports
indicated, was erected in 1926.

In a previous gift to the Uni
versity, Mrs. Forbes had given
$100,000 to the Law School in
memory of her father.
