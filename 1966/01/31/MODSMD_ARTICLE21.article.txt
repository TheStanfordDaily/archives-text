NEW HAVEN, Conn. (CPS)â€”
Staughton Lynd, an assistant
professor at Yale, has hinted
that he is considering resigning
from the Yale faculty as a result
of comment concerning his re
cent trip to North Vietnam.
Lynd said as an individual he
could take the trip in all good
conscience but that "Yale has to
answer the telephone."
He indicated in a speech that
some alumni and others were
very upset about his trip. "I
have asked myself if I should
resign and I haven't decided yet,"
he said.
He indicated that no pressure
had been put on him by the
school's administration.
