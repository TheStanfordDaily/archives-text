# POOR SHOOTING
## Tribe Drops Two 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
Variety may bo the spice of
life, but it is unwelcome season
ing in a winning basketball rec
ord. To a team like the Indiana
who have scored impressive vic
tories over such highly rated
squads as USF, Southern Cal and
UCLA and who are soon to en
ter a tight and furious struggle
for conference laurels, losses at
the hands of Arizona and Ari
zona State this weekend were
about as unwelcome as they
come.
To say that Stanford's cagers
have been inconsistent this year
is probably an understatement.
The Indians have had the right
wins and the wrong losses, as
is manifest in the two successive
basketball weekends they have
just completed.
The weekend of January 14-15
saw the varsity quintet sweep
a crucial series from USC and
UCLA. Netting 52 per cent from
the field, they bounced the for
mer 73-64 and turned over the
latter 74-69. Ruining the nation
al championship Bruins' 36
game AAWU winning skein
made the Braves contenders for
the conference along with that
team and Oregon State.
In Precarious Position
But the Indians did a com
plete turnabout when next they
saw action. What should have
been a sandpapered supplement
to the victories of two weeks ear
lier in preparing for the upcom
ing contests in Oregon, turned

into a pair of setbacks which
puts the nature of next week's
play in a precarious position.
Stanford fell first on Friday to
a sharpshooting Arizona squad,
94-54. The Wildcats, who had
lost all five previous encounters
with Stanford, popped 01.8 per
cent out of their field goal at
tempts to Stanford's 33.
Arizona, Leads, 17-8
With a minyon of minutes
gone in the first period, Arizona
had marked up a 17-8 lead, and
proceeded to expand their favor
able spread into the halftime
tally of 43-22. Clearing her
bench, Arizona put oft the fin
ishing touches to her 94-54 vic
tory in the second half and
when the final buzzer sounded,
she had accrued a venerable
61.8 field goal percentage with
42 of 68 attempts through the
net.
The next night in Tempe the
Indians lowered their field goal
percentage to 24 and handed
Arizona State a 82-71 victory.
This game was a bit tighter, but
Stanford's poor shooting was
easily and effectively turned to
the Sun Devils' advantage. The
Indians left Arizona with two
losses, luckily non-conference.
Still 3-1 in the AAWU, Stan
ford travels to Oregon next
week to see which of the three
squads now tied for first place-
Stanford, Oregon State, and
UCLA—will remain there. They
meet Oregon on Friday night,
and Oregon State on Saturday.

Indians left Arizona with two
losses, luckily non-conference.
Still 3-1 in the AAWU, Stan
ford travels to Oregon next
week to see which of the three
squads now tied for first place-
Stanford, Oregon State, and
UCLA—will remain there. They
meet Oregon on Friday night,
and Oregon State on Saturday.
Variety may bo the spice of
life, but it is unwelcome season
ing in a winning basketball rec
ord. To a team like the Indiana
who have scored impressive vic
tories over such highly rated
squads as USF, Southern Cal and
UCLA and who are soon to en
ter a tight and furious struggle
for conference laurels, losses at
the hands of Arizona and Ari
zona State this weekend were
about as unwelcome as they
come.
To say that Stanford's cagers
have been inconsistent this year
is probably an understatement.
The Indians have had the right
wins and the wrong losses, as
is manifest in the two successive
basketball weekends they have
just completed.
The weekend of January 14-15
saw the varsity quintet sweep
a crucial series from USC and
UCLA. Netting 52 per cent from
the field, they bounced the for
mer 73-64 and turned over the
latter 74-69. Ruining the nation
al championship Bruins' 36
game AAWU winning skein
made the Braves contenders for
the conference along with that
team and Oregon State.
In Precarious Position
But the Indians did a com
plete turnabout when next they
saw action. What should have
been a sandpapered supplement
to the victories of two weeks ear
lier in preparing for the upcom
ing contests in Oregon, turned

into a pair of setbacks which
puts the nature of next week's
play in a precarious position.
Stanford fell first on Friday to
a sharpshooting Arizona squad,
94-54. The Wildcats, who had
lost all five previous encounters
with Stanford, popped 01.8 per
cent out of their field goal at
tempts to Stanford's 33.
Arizona, Leads, 17-8
With a minyon of minutes
gone in the first period, Arizona
had marked up a 17-8 lead, and
proceeded to expand their favor
able spread into the halftime
tally of 43-22. Clearing her
bench, Arizona put oft the fin
ishing touches to her 94-54 vic
tory in the second half and
when the final buzzer sounded,
she had accrued a venerable
61.8 field goal percentage with
42 of 68 attempts through the
net.
The next night in Tempe the
Indians lowered their field goal
percentage to 24 and handed
Arizona State a 82-71 victory.
This game was a bit tighter, but
Stanford's poor shooting was
easily and effectively turned to
the Sun Devils' advantage. The
Indians left Arizona with two
losses, luckily non-conference.
