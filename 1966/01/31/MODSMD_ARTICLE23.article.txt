# Indian Wrestlers Pound Santa Clara Matmen, 34-3
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity wrestlers
picked up their first dual meet
victory of the young 1966 sea
son, pinning a 34-3 defeat on
Santa Clara last Thursday
night.
Coach Bill Leland's grapplers
pinned four of their Santa Clara
opponents, and dropped only one
decision.
The Indians hope to extend
their newly bom winning streak
to four with meets against San
Jose this Wednesday and UCSB
and UCLA this Friday.
John Hazelton opened the
Santa Clara meet on a high note,
pinning his 123 pound opponent.
Hazelton worked his man over
for most of the match, then
stuck him late in the round.
Boyan Skates
Steve Boyan and George Mc-
Neally battled a close 130 pound
match for the full nine minutes.
Boyan fell behind in the middle
of his match, but rallied toward
the end. Boyan was awarded
points for riding time to break
a tie at the end of the match,
giving Boyan the decision.
Jack Clementson took a 12-6
decision in a fast-moving match
against 137 pound Brian Barr of
Santa Clara.
Tom Rajala faced a tough op
ponent in Larry Palla, 145
pounder from Santa Clara. In
the low-scoring bout, Palla held
a 6-4 advantage over Rajala
with 30 seconds remaining in
the match. Rajala reversed him
to tie the score, but Palla was
awarded the match on the basis
of riding time.
Silver Threads, Golden Pin
Doug Gunesch made quick
work of his 152 pound oppo
nent. After feeling out his Santa
Clara adversary in the first
round, he pinned him early in
the second.
Wrestling at 160 pounds, Bill
Vogelpohl blanked his mat mate.
Vogelpohl stayed on top for the
entire match, tossing the Santa
Claran at will.
Frank Pratt got a slow start

that almost proved fatal in the
167 division match. Bob Ernst
of Santa Clara scored a take
down and nearly pinned Pratt at
the end of the first round. Down
5-0, Pratt went for the pin and
succeeded midway through the
second round.
Davison Wails
Mike Davison, Stanford co
captain, handled his man with
little difficulty. Davison accumu
lated a 15-0 point count on the
177 pound Santa Claran before
pinning him.
Rick Lindsley did not need to
work up a sweat to win his
match. Santa Clara could not
put up a man to wrestle the
Stanford heavyweight.
Coach Leland looks optimisti
cally toward this week's match
es. All three teams, San Jose,
USCB, and UCLA, have strong
well-balanced teams, but Leland
will have what he estimates the
strongest dual meet lineup he
has had at Stanford.
Toughest Line-up
Tom Rajala will move down
to 137, and Bill Vogelpohl will
hit 152. Steve Schaum, AAWU
runner-up last year, will wrestle
at 160. Mike Davison and Bud
Hollingbery will decide in wres
tle-off who will take on the 177
pound burden.
The Stanford frosh and JV's
will meet San Jose's junior divi
sion at 6:30, Wednesday night in
the Pavilion. The varsity meets
the Sparatans at 8:00 p.m.
Friday, UCSB invades the En
cina Gym at 4:00. UCLA will
hit the Encina mats at 8:00 p.m.
