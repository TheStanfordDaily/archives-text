# Card Swimmers Dunk Santa Clara Swim Club
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Encina Pool and its sur
rounding atmosphere were bare
ly distinguishable last Saturday,
as both the Stanford varsity
and the Stanford freshman
swimming teams passed up the
famed Santa Clara Swim Club.
The varsity triumphed, 59-35,
while the frosh beat the same
team, 50-44.
Dick Roth turned in the out
standing individual performance
of the rainy afternoon, as he
churned to a 2:00.7, NCAA frosh
record-setting performance in
the 200 yard individual medley.
Mike Wall started his day
with a 1:48.8 200 freestyle, then
topped it off with a Stanford
varsity record 4:59.8 500 free
style jaunt.
Ivey Sprouts
Mitch Ivey, a high school jun
ior, led off the Santa Clara med
ley relay with a pool record 55.1
for 100 yards backstroke. Ivey
later won the 200 backstroke
event in 2:02.6—a second off
the pool record held by Chuck
Bittick of USC.
The meet was run as a dou
ble-dual tilt. Competitors from
all three teams swam at the
same time, but the meet was
scored as two separate dual
meets: Stanford varsity vs. San
ta Clara and Stanford frosh vs.
Santa Clara.
Santa Clara took the first
event, the 400 medley relay
largely on the strength of Ivey's
swift backstroke leg. The var
sity rebounded with 1-3 finishes
in the next three events to hold
a two point edge on the Santa
Clarans going into the diving.
Santa Clara scored a 1-2 set
back against the frosh in the
second event of the day, the 200
freestyle to take a 15-1 advan
tage. P. K. Brown won the 50

freestyle in 22.5 and Jeff Ham
mett grabbed second.
Dick Roth carried the indi
vidual medley and Morgan Man
ning placed second in 2:04.7 to
tie the swim club, 18-18 at the
start of the diving event.
Freeman Wins Diving
Bill! Freeman topped the diving
for the varsity and Dave Dux
bury for the frosh as the Stan
ford divers bounced unopposed.
The varsity held on to the
lead gained in the diving and
controlled the meet from there
on, winning five of the next six
events.
Doug Miller took the 200 but
terfly in 2:06.6 and Mark Par
mely won the 100 free in 49.8.
Ivey won the 200 backstroke for
Santa Clara to slow down the
Stanford express.
Mike Wall blasted out in the
500, followed by Gary Sheerer
in second place to spell doom
for Sainta Clara. Bob Momsen
won Ihe 200 breaststroke in
2:19.5 to clinch the meet for the
Indians:. The varsity 400 free re
lay passed the Santa Clara four
some to make the final tally 59-
35.
Frosh Sweat
The irosh had a rougher road
to follow. Pete Siebert won the
200 fly in 2:04.8, but the frosh
suffered a 1-2 drubbing at the
100 freestyle. Ivey topped fresh
man Bill Keo in the 200 back
stroke, to wipe out the margin
opened up in the diving.
Dick Roth and Tom Jamison
placed 1-3 in the 500 free to re
gain a tv/o-point edge.
Not to be outdone, Santa Clara
took 1-3 in the breaststroke,
leaving the frosh one point be
hind going into the final event.
Morgan Manning, Jeff Ham

mett, P. K. Brown, and Paul
Meyer made no bones about
their business, however, and
passed the Santa Clara tandem
by more than three seconds.
Two in Germany
Two factors that would have
altered the meet outlook slight
ly were one, Luis Nicolao, and
two, Greg Buckingham. Nicolao,
world record butterflier, and
Buckingham, national 400 yard
individual medley record-holder,
were competing in an interna
tional invitational swimming
meet in Bremen, Germany.
Buckingham, a transfer stu
dent at Stanford, would have
swum for Santa Clara. Nicolao
for the frosh. The two would
have mixed things up in the re
lays, the individual medley, the
butterfly, and the distance free
style races.
Chilly Weather Hurts
The cold weather hurt a num
ber of individual efforts in the
meet, particularly in the short
sprints. Swimmers were barely
loosened up by the time the race
ended.
Varsity coach Jim Gaughran
did not take the team through
a period of pre-meet let-off, or
"sprinting down." At the pres
ent time, continued intensive
conditioning is more important
than a single dual meet.
Gaughran looks to the high
pressure meets with USC and
UCLA next month as the peak
points of the dual meet season.
The tankers will be busy next
Saturday with the Stanford re
lays. Six teams, including the
Stanford varsity and freshmen
and the Santa Clara Swim Club,
will race in the annual event.
Foothill College, last year's win
ner, will be present to defend its
title in the meet to be broadcast
over KZSU.

individual medley record-holder,
were competing in an interna
tional invitational swimming
meet in Bremen, Germany.
Buckingham, a transfer stu
dent at Stanford, would have
swum for Santa Clara. Nicolao
for the frosh. The two would
have mixed things up in the re
lays, the individual medley, the
butterfly, and the distance free
style races.
Chilly Weather Hurts
The cold weather hurt a num
ber of individual efforts in the
meet, particularly in the short
sprints. Swimmers were barely
loosened up by the time the race
ended.
Varsity coach Jim Gaughran
did not take the team through
a period of pre-meet let-off, or
"sprinting down." At the pres
ent time, continued intensive
conditioning is more important
than a single dual meet.
Gaughran looks to the high
pressure meets with USC and
UCLA next month as the peak
points of the dual meet season.
The tankers will be busy next
Saturday with the Stanford re
lays. Six teams, including the
Stanford varsity and freshmen
and the Santa Clara Swim Club,
will race in the annual event.
Foothill College, last year's win
ner, will be present to defend its
title in the meet to be broadcast
over KZSU.
The Encina Pool and its sur
rounding atmosphere were bare
ly distinguishable last Saturday,
as both the Stanford varsity
and the Stanford freshman
swimming teams passed up the
famed Santa Clara Swim Club.
The varsity triumphed, 59-35,
while the frosh beat the same
team, 50-44.
Dick Roth turned in the out
standing individual performance
of the rainy afternoon, as he
churned to a 2:00.7, NCAA frosh
record-setting performance in
the 200 yard individual medley.
Mike Wall started his day
with a 1:48.8 200 freestyle, then
topped it off with a Stanford
varsity record 4:59.8 500 free
style jaunt.
Ivey Sprouts
Mitch Ivey, a high school jun
ior, led off the Santa Clara med
ley relay with a pool record 55.1
for 100 yards backstroke. Ivey
later won the 200 backstroke
event in 2:02.6—a second off
the pool record held by Chuck
Bittick of USC.
The meet was run as a dou
ble-dual tilt. Competitors from
all three teams swam at the
same time, but the meet was
scored as two separate dual
meets: Stanford varsity vs. San
ta Clara and Stanford frosh vs.
Santa Clara.
Santa Clara took the first
event, the 400 medley relay
largely on the strength of Ivey's
swift backstroke leg. The var
sity rebounded with 1-3 finishes
in the next three events to hold
a two point edge on the Santa
Clarans going into the diving.
Santa Clara scored a 1-2 set
back against the frosh in the
second event of the day, the 200
freestyle to take a 15-1 advan
tage. P. K. Brown won the 50

freestyle in 22.5 and Jeff Ham
mett grabbed second.
Dick Roth carried the indi
vidual medley and Morgan Man
ning placed second in 2:04.7 to
tie the swim club, 18-18 at the
start of the diving event.
Freeman Wins Diving
Bill! Freeman topped the diving
for the varsity and Dave Dux
bury for the frosh as the Stan
ford divers bounced unopposed.
The varsity held on to the
lead gained in the diving and
controlled the meet from there
on, winning five of the next six
events.
Doug Miller took the 200 but
terfly in 2:06.6 and Mark Par
mely won the 100 free in 49.8.
Ivey won the 200 backstroke for
Santa Clara to slow down the
Stanford express.
Mike Wall blasted out in the
500, followed by Gary Sheerer
in second place to spell doom
for Sainta Clara. Bob Momsen
won Ihe 200 breaststroke in
2:19.5 to clinch the meet for the
Indians:. The varsity 400 free re
lay passed the Santa Clara four
some to make the final tally 59-
35.
Frosh Sweat
The irosh had a rougher road
to follow. Pete Siebert won the
200 fly in 2:04.8, but the frosh
suffered a 1-2 drubbing at the
100 freestyle. Ivey topped fresh
man Bill Keo in the 200 back
stroke, to wipe out the margin
opened up in the diving.
Dick Roth and Tom Jamison
placed 1-3 in the 500 free to re
gain a tv/o-point edge.
Not to be outdone, Santa Clara
took 1-3 in the breaststroke,
leaving the frosh one point be
hind going into the final event.
Morgan Manning, Jeff Ham

mett, P. K. Brown, and Paul
Meyer made no bones about
their business, however, and
passed the Santa Clara tandem
by more than three seconds.
Two in Germany
Two factors that would have
altered the meet outlook slight
ly were one, Luis Nicolao, and
two, Greg Buckingham. Nicolao,
world record butterflier, and

Indians:. The varsity 400 free re
lay passed the Santa Clara four
some to make the final tally 59-
35.
Frosh Sweat
The irosh had a rougher road
to follow. Pete Siebert won the
200 fly in 2:04.8, but the frosh
suffered a 1-2 drubbing at the
100 freestyle. Ivey topped fresh
man Bill Keo in the 200 back
stroke, to wipe out the margin
opened up in the diving.
Dick Roth and Tom Jamison
placed 1-3 in the 500 free to re
gain a tv/o-point edge.
Not to be outdone, Santa Clara
took 1-3 in the breaststroke,
leaving the frosh one point be
hind going into the final event.
Morgan Manning, Jeff Ham

mett, P. K. Brown, and Paul
Meyer made no bones about
their business, however, and
passed the Santa Clara tandem
by more than three seconds.
Two in Germany
Two factors that would have
altered the meet outlook slight
ly were one, Luis Nicolao, and
two, Greg Buckingham. Nicolao,
world record butterflier, and
Buckingham, national 400 yard
individual medley record-holder,
were competing in an interna
tional invitational swimming
meet in Bremen, Germany.
Buckingham, a transfer stu
dent at Stanford, would have
swum for Santa Clara. Nicolao
for the frosh. The two would
have mixed things up in the re
lays, the individual medley, the
butterfly, and the distance free
style races.
Chilly Weather Hurts
The cold weather hurt a num
ber of individual efforts in the
meet, particularly in the short
sprints. Swimmers were barely
loosened up by the time the race
ended.
Varsity coach Jim Gaughran
did not take the team through
a period of pre-meet let-off, or
"sprinting down." At the pres
ent time, continued intensive
conditioning is more important
than a single dual meet.
Gaughran looks to the high
pressure meets with USC and
UCLA next month as the peak
points of the dual meet season.
The tankers will be busy next
Saturday with the Stanford re
lays. Six teams, including the
Stanford varsity and freshmen
and the Santa Clara Swim Club,
will race in the annual event.
Foothill College, last year's win
ner, will be present to defend its
title in the meet to be broadcast
over KZSU.
The Encina Pool and its sur
rounding atmosphere were bare
ly distinguishable last Saturday,
as both the Stanford varsity
and the Stanford freshman
swimming teams passed up the
famed Santa Clara Swim Club.
The varsity triumphed, 59-35,
while the frosh beat the same
team, 50-44.
Dick Roth turned in the out
standing individual performance
of the rainy afternoon, as he
churned to a 2:00.7, NCAA frosh
record-setting performance in
the 200 yard individual medley.
Mike Wall started his day
with a 1:48.8 200 freestyle, then
topped it off with a Stanford
varsity record 4:59.8 500 free
style jaunt.
Ivey Sprouts
Mitch Ivey, a high school jun
ior, led off the Santa Clara med
ley relay with a pool record 55.1
for 100 yards backstroke. Ivey
later won the 200 backstroke
event in 2:02.6—a second off
the pool record held by Chuck
Bittick of USC.
The meet was run as a dou
ble-dual tilt. Competitors from
all three teams swam at the
same time, but the meet was
scored as two separate dual
meets: Stanford varsity vs. San
ta Clara and Stanford frosh vs.
Santa Clara.
Santa Clara took the first
event, the 400 medley relay
largely on the strength of Ivey's
swift backstroke leg. The var
sity rebounded with 1-3 finishes
in the next three events to hold
a two point edge on the Santa
Clarans going into the diving.
Santa Clara scored a 1-2 set
back against the frosh in the
second event of the day, the 200
freestyle to take a 15-1 advan
tage. P. K. Brown won the 50

freestyle in 22.5 and Jeff Ham
mett grabbed second.
Dick Roth carried the indi
vidual medley and Morgan Man
ning placed second in 2:04.7 to
tie the swim club, 18-18 at the
start of the diving event.
Freeman Wins Diving
Bill! Freeman topped the diving
for the varsity and Dave Dux
bury for the frosh as the Stan
ford divers bounced unopposed.
The varsity held on to the
lead gained in the diving and
controlled the meet from there
on, winning five of the next six
events.
Doug Miller took the 200 but
terfly in 2:06.6 and Mark Par
mely won the 100 free in 49.8.
Ivey won the 200 backstroke for
Santa Clara to slow down the
Stanford express.
Mike Wall blasted out in the
500, followed by Gary Sheerer
in second place to spell doom
for Sainta Clara. Bob Momsen
won Ihe 200 breaststroke in
2:19.5 to clinch the meet for the
Indians:. The varsity 400 free re
