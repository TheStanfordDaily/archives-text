## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford rugby team, de
spite a driving rain that contin
ued the length of the game,
sloshed to a 11-5 victory over
the San Francisco Olympic Club
Saturday.
Both the Olympic Club de
fense, scored on only oncc in the
last three games, and the rain
seriously hampered the Stan
ford track. Much of the game's
action was in the middle of the
field as fumbles kept both
teams from organizing a sus
tained offense.
Bob Newberry opened the scor
ing for Stanford with perhaps
the most electrifying individual
play of the season.
Newberry Starts Scoring
Newberry took a pass from
Blaine Nye deep in his own ter
ritory. Hemmed in by the alert
Olympic defense, h" was forced
to kick. The punt traveled 40
yards where it was fielded by
the Olympic fullback.
Newberry, chasing his own
kick, reached the fullback at
about the same time, and
blocked the return kick. He then
picked up the rolling ball and
ran the last 20 yards to the end
zone for the try.
The entire play covered 70
yards and though the conversion
kick attempt by Mike Grace was
wide, the Indians had a 3-0 lead.
Newberry Again
At this point both defenses
stiffened and the half would
have ended with the 3-0 score
but for an alert play by New
berry. The Olympic Club had
controlled a five-yard scrum, but
the pass to their backfield was
fumbled.
Before the Olympic first %
could regain his footing New
berry was on the ball in the end
zone. This time Mike Grace
made his conversion from a dif
ficult angle and the game stood
at 8-0 at halftime.
The Olympic Club started the

second half with renewed
strength and dominated the op
ening minutes of play. The
Olympic ruggers had one score
called back early in the half.
Olympians Score
Jim Ward finally put the Club
on the scoreboard when he
scored after his squad forced
Stanford into a five-yard scrum
situation. The conversion kick
was good and the Card lead was
cut to 8-5.
With the going getting slop
pier with every scrum, the game
lapsed into a defensive struggle.
Seldom did either team complete
more than three passes without
a fumble.
The fine play of Chip Green
ing, in his first game at full
back, kept the ball safely out
of Stanford territory, and the
powerful Stanford scrum was
able to find the traction to push
the Olympians.
Grace Ends Scoring
The only other scoring of the
game came late in the game as
Mike Grace kept his feet for a
40 yard romp through most of
the Olympic team. However he
missed the conversion and the
game ended in the 11-5 Stanford
victory.
Coach Pete Kmetovic was
pleased with the performance
of the ruggers in their second
win of the year against one tie
and one defeat.
Kmetovic said, "Of course the
rain slowed them down, but the
play of our somewhat makeshift
lineup was encouraging. Tim
Abena and Greg Howell were
playing their first varsity games
and several of the boys found
themselves at different posi
tions.
"The scrum looked real tough
and simply hung on for the en
tire game." Kmetovic said he
looked for better weather but
another difficult game next
week with Sacramento State
College.
