"I feel we can beat UCLA."
George Ireland, coach of the
Chicago Loyola college basket
ball team, made that prediction
Tuesday. His players fulfilled
his prophecy Friday night with
a come-from-behind 102-96 over
time victory over the national
collegiate basketball champion.
Jim Coleman, a little guy at
5-foot-10, popped in a basket
with 30 seconds left to tie the
regulation game at 94-94 and
sank another at the start of the
extra period to pace the Ram
blers to their 12th straight vic
tory and an overall 14-1 record.
In contrast it was the fifth de
feat in 15 games for the Bruins
compared to their 30-0 record in
1964 and 28-2 last season.
Eight Points Back
A capacity crowd of 18,193 at
Chicago Stadium saw Loyola,
seventh-ranked in the Associated
Press poll, come from eight
points back at 77-69 midway in
the second half to defeat the
lOth-ranked Uclans.
Illinois, paced by Don Free
man's 33 points, handed Notre
Dame its 11th straight defeat in

the second game 120-92.
Loyola won the national
championship in 1963, but Ira
land says his current team
"shoots better, is quicker and is
faster. Our tactics are simple.
We keep the pressure on. We
press, press, press." .
That is just what the Ram
blers did when they were eight
points down. They went ahead
88-87 with less than two minutes
left. UCLA bounced back in
front 93-90 on Mike Lynn's free
throws and led 94-92 on another
Lynn charity toss with 45 sec
onds left before Coleman popped
in the tying basket.
Dominate Overtime
The Ramblers dominated the
overtime. Two quick goals by
Coleman and Alan Miller put
them ahead to stay and avenged
their 85-72 defeat to UCLA on
the same court last season.
Coleman scored 29 points al
together on 12 field goals and
five of nine free throws. Doug
Wardlaw, another little guy at
5-foot-ll also got 12 field goals
and two of four foul tries for 26
points. Mike Warren, also 5-
foot-11, was high for UCLA with
25.
