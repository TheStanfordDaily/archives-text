# Frosh Team Drops First
## 
### 
Playing away from the con
fines of the Stanford Pavilion
and succumbing to a quick first
half by their opponent, Stan
ford's frosh basketball team
lost their first game of the sea
son Saturday, 51-48, to Santa
Clara.
Stanford came from behind in
the waning minutes of the con
test but as Cnach Bill Turner
put it, "We were unable to
make the key basket. We had a
couple of chances to tie the score
but were unable to." Santa
Clara led as much as 21-9 at one
time.
After jumping off to their
early lead Santa Clara switched
to a zone and attempted to slow
the tempo of the game down.
However, Stanford just kept nip
ping bits off of Santa Clara's
lead, but the Indians weren't
quite able to satisfy their raging
appetite.
Stanford played the contest
in San Jose and high school Ail-
American Dave Pouliot caused
Stanford considerable trouble.
Mai McElwain had 13 points
for the Indians and Ed Martin
had 11.
The Frosh will play the Uni
versity of California Medical
Center at Stanford this Friday
at 6:00.
