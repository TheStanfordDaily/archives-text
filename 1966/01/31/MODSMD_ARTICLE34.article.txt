# Quest For Meaning In The University
## 
### 
In the beginning, God created the earth, and
he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness.
And Cod said, "Let us make living creatures
out of mud, so the mud can see what we have
done." And God created every living creature
that now rnovcth, and. one was man. Mud as
man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud
as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man
blinked. "What is the purpose of all this?" he
asked politely.
"Everything must fuwe a purpose?" asked
God.
"Certainly," said man.
"Then I leave it to you to think of one for all
this," said God. And he went away.

One of the more fascinating quirks of man's
existence for the past million or so years has
been his continual search for a stable and co
herent order in life. This search has led man to
martyrdom, to riches, and to the present, but
rarely or never to his elusive goal.
The university, as the seat of the search for
meaning, forms the pinnacle of this particular
aspect of human existence. Its primary occupa
tion is, or at least ought to be, to delineate for
the present generations those solutions to the
question of meaning which past generations
have discovered, and then to encourage the stu
dent to come to his own conclusions.
Stanford has done a reasonably good job in
fulfilling this role, and in the aftermath of PACE
is showing signs of doing even better. In the
classroom, as well as in Mississippi, students are
encouraged to challenge ideas and beliefs; the
process leads to mental conflict — intellectual
ferment, if you prefer—and finally a synthesis
is reached. The student emerges from Stanford
a Christian, a cynic, a Republican, or perhaps
an agnostic. His ideas may be no different from
the day he first drove up Palm Drive, but at least
they have been challenged—and the student has
participated actively in the search for order and
meaning. Stanford, for him, has "worked."
But the university has a secondary responsi
bility, one that is closely intertwined with the
first. The student, to be free to examine the ideas
of other people and other times, must be free

from the strictures of the present society. That
liis conclusions may he his own, lie must be al
lowed to conduct his introspection unhindered.
By guaranteeing such freedom, the University
would serve as an example for the greater so
ciety : the respect of one scholar for the ideas
of another scholar could be translated into the
mutual toleration —and understanding—of hu
man beings for one another.
In this preoccupation, Stanford has met with
far less than a real success.
Students are still subject to a set of social reg
ulations and open-house rules which seem to
have no raison d'etre other than the opinion of
the outside world. Non-Protestant students are
subject to a Victorian religion policy which has
connotations of a dogmatism not entirely unlike
that of the Spanish Inquisition. And even 35-
year-old graduate students are subject to a
stance on liquor which defies all but the most
imaginative for a reasonable explanation. We
could go on, but suffice it to say that all of these
play a major role in suppressing the student's
opportunity to experiment and learn and find
meaning.
And so, in our own search for a consistent
meaning to it all, we ask for some explanation
of this seeming inconsistency between the Uni
versity's purpose and the University's practice.
As we see it, there are two possible expiations.
The first is that a free university —one in which
the student is completely unchained —is an im
possible goal; even the pinnacle of the search
for order and coherent meaning is subject to
clironic disorders and incoherence.
The alternative explanation is that meaning
itself is a pipe dream, that the search for it is
simply the phantom play of humanity, and that
all attempts at searching for it are simply the
ephemeral pantomime of clowns in pursuit of
invisible butterflies. If this were the case, the
University itself would have no reason for ex
istence.
We sincerely hope that the former is the case,
and that a university whose existence is as close
as possible to its ideal essence can and should
be a constant goal. But too often we feel that an
accommodation with perfection is not to be had;
at times like those the latter seems to be the only
reality.
