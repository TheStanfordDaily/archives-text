# Today And Tomorrow
## Terms Of Vietnam Peace Must Reflect War Reality 
### Walter Lippman 
The reason why the peace of
fensive failed is most cogently
revealed in the Mansfield report
on the state of the war. Presi
dent Johnson has been trying to
obtain by propaganda the vic
tory which he has not been able
to obtain on the battlefield —
that is to say, the acceptance in
the whole of South Vietnam of
a government which has lost
control of a very large part of
South Vietnam.
The peace offensive was bound
to fail, and the grave decisions
which the President hoped to
circumvent and avoid are now
before him.
Military Reality
If he is to make these deci
sions wisely, he must recognize
that in international politics
peace settlements are possible
only as and when they reflect the
real balance of power. In the
world war, for example, Chur
chill and Roosevelt had to settle
with Stalin for a Soviet political
frontier in the midst of Germany
and of Europe. That is where
the Red army had arrived when
the peace negotiations began.
The same principle will hold
in Vietnam. There will be no
settlement until the terms of
peace reflect the military reality.
The President will be disap
pointed again and again as long
as he and Secretary Rusk ask
for a settlement which in effect
demands that the defeat of the
Saigon forces be transmuted at
the conference table into a vic
tory for the Saigon forces. Nor
should he indulge in any illusion
that the informed opinion of
mankind really thinks as Secre
tary Rusk talks, merely because
American envoys have been po
litely and sympathetically re
ceived in so many capitals.
No Alternative
What then should the Presi
dent do? It is often said by the
President's supporters that his
critics propose no alternative to
what he is doing. If that was
ever true, it is no longer true to
day. It is not true since the
Mansfield report and since the
Gavin statement.

The President should reduce
his war aims, which today are
impossibly high in the light of
the conditions described in the
Mansfield report. He should al
ter his strategy along the lines
proposed by Gen. Gavin, making
it a holding operation pending
the eventual negotiation of a
political settlement.
The Mansfield report shows
that Rusk's objective — the rule
of Gen. Ky or his successor over
the whole of South Vietnam—is
unattainable no matter how
much the war is escalated. The
burden of disproving the conclu
sions of the Mansfield report is
on those who have been proved
wrong about the escalation of
last summer, on those who are
now asking for another escala
tion in order to redeem their
failure, on those who want to re
double the stakes in order to re
coup their losses.
Revise Stand
If the Mansfield report con
tains the truth of the matter, it
follows inevitably that our war
aims should be reduced and our
strategy revised. We should put
aside the hopeless task of search
ing out and destroying the Viet
Cong, and we should take our
stand, as Gen. Gavin advises, on
a holding operation in the coast
al cities.
This is not a policy for a glori
ous victory or for some kind of
dazzling political triumph. It is
no trick for pulling rabbits out
of a hat. It is a formula for
liquidating a mistake, for end
ing a war that cannot be won at
any tolerable price, for cutting
our losses before they escalate
into bankruptcy and for listen
ing to common sense rather
than to war whoops and tom
toms.
Because we are neither om
niscient nor omnipotent, we,
even we Americans, cannot al
ways win. But I cannot help feel
ing in my bones that a display
of common sense by a proud and
imperious nation would be a
good moral investment for the
future.

pointed again and again as long
as he and Secretary Rusk ask
for a settlement which in effect
demands that the defeat of the
Saigon forces be transmuted at
the conference table into a vic
tory for the Saigon forces. Nor
should he indulge in any illusion
that the informed opinion of
mankind really thinks as Secre
tary Rusk talks, merely because
American envoys have been po
litely and sympathetically re
ceived in so many capitals.
No Alternative
What then should the Presi
dent do? It is often said by the
President's supporters that his
critics propose no alternative to
what he is doing. If that was
ever true, it is no longer true to
day. It is not true since the
Mansfield report and since the
Gavin statement.

The President should reduce
his war aims, which today are
impossibly high in the light of
the conditions described in the
Mansfield report. He should al
ter his strategy along the lines
proposed by Gen. Gavin, making
it a holding operation pending
the eventual negotiation of a
political settlement.
The Mansfield report shows
that Rusk's objective — the rule
of Gen. Ky or his successor over
the whole of South Vietnam—is
unattainable no matter how
much the war is escalated. The
burden of disproving the conclu
sions of the Mansfield report is
on those who have been proved
wrong about the escalation of
last summer, on those who are
now asking for another escala
tion in order to redeem their
failure, on those who want to re
double the stakes in order to re
coup their losses.
Revise Stand
If the Mansfield report con
tains the truth of the matter, it
follows inevitably that our war
aims should be reduced and our
strategy revised. We should put
aside the hopeless task of search
ing out and destroying the Viet
Cong, and we should take our
stand, as Gen. Gavin advises, on
a holding operation in the coast
al cities.
This is not a policy for a glori
ous victory or for some kind of
dazzling political triumph. It is
no trick for pulling rabbits out
of a hat. It is a formula for
liquidating a mistake, for end
ing a war that cannot be won at
any tolerable price, for cutting
our losses before they escalate
into bankruptcy and for listen
ing to common sense rather
than to war whoops and tom
toms.
Because we are neither om
niscient nor omnipotent, we,
even we Americans, cannot al
ways win. But I cannot help feel
ing in my bones that a display
of common sense by a proud and
imperious nation would be a
good moral investment for the
future.

The reason why the peace of
fensive failed is most cogently
revealed in the Mansfield report
on the state of the war. Presi
dent Johnson has been trying to
obtain by propaganda the vic
tory which he has not been able
to obtain on the battlefield —
that is to say, the acceptance in
the whole of South Vietnam of
a government which has lost
control of a very large part of
South Vietnam.
The peace offensive was bound
to fail, and the grave decisions
which the President hoped to
circumvent and avoid are now
before him.
Military Reality
If he is to make these deci
sions wisely, he must recognize
that in international politics
peace settlements are possible
only as and when they reflect the
real balance of power. In the
world war, for example, Chur
chill and Roosevelt had to settle
with Stalin for a Soviet political
frontier in the midst of Germany
and of Europe. That is where
the Red army had arrived when
the peace negotiations began.
The same principle will hold
in Vietnam. There will be no
settlement until the terms of
peace reflect the military reality.
The President will be disap
pointed again and again as long
as he and Secretary Rusk ask
