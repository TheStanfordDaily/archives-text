# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## PACE And Princeton-Of-The-West 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to congratulate
The Daily for its editorial calling
for introspection after a period
of change. I detect, however, in
this and previous editorials a
certain tendency to indulge in
self - congratulations. While I am
certain that P.A.C.E. has con
tributed to making Stanford a
first-rate University of national
importance and I admit that I
do not know what Stanford was
like before I arrived on the fac
ulty two years ago, it seems to
me that Stanford is now more
like Princeton of the West ra
ther that the Harvard of the
West. I say this as a Princeton
Ph.D, and one who disliked the
Princeton environment.
Like Princeton, Stanford suf
fers from being in a small, dull
town that is committed to not
being a "college" town. Like
Princeton, the Stanford campus
lacks the intellectual excitement
of Harvard— and Chicago, Ber
keley, Columbia, Michigan and
Wisconsin. Similarly, some of my
bright students have admitted
to an anti-intellectualism in the
student body. For many students
college education is only a nec
essary step to getting a degree
and "getting ahead," with little
interest in intellectual or cul
tural pursuits. Also, there is an
unfortunate tendency toward
"splendid isolation" (last year's
vote preventing LASSU from de
ciding about off-campus issues).
Finally, the socio-economic, ra
cial and religious homogenity of
the student body is hardly com

parable to Harvard and may ex
plain some of what I have criti
cized above.
In any case, Stanford is the
Stanford of the West and the
ifidiuvidious comparisons with
the Ivy League universities
seems to stem for self-indul
gence and a sense of insecurity.
If Stanford wants to keep pace
with Harvard, perhaps what is
now needed is a reconsideration
of the student body on the en
vironment at Stanford.

• Deus Ex Machina
Editor, The Dally:
At the risk of seeming very
pedantic, I would like to point
out that the editor ostensibly
made an error in the editorial of
January 28, entitled "Ordeal of
Change." Then I would like to
qualify my accusation in self
defense as well as in order to
give the editor the benefit of
the doubt.
In this editorial, he wrote "ex
deus machina." This is a reversal
of the standard expression, "deus
ex machina," which comes from
Greek theater. Gods were there
introduced through the air by
a crane, most often to enter un
expectedly, as it were "out of the
blue," and bring about an unex
pected change of events. Hence
the application of the term to
situations in which an author
ity swoops down with a sudden

decree, i.e., the Union affair. In
fact, the editor followed up the
use of the term with this very
example, and thus applied it ad
visedly.
The only catch is that he wrote
it backwards.
So far excruciatingly pedantic.
I can make it even more so by
adding that, if the above explana
tion of the term needs docu
mentation, one can consult,
among other things, the 1965
edition of the Britannica, vol.
VII, p. 632. But—
Perhaps this was all clear to
the editor in the first place. Per
haps it was not an ignorant er
ror, but rather a clever and
very appropriate pun.
Perhaps in reversing "deus ex
machina" to "ex deus machina,"
he was trying to make the fol
lowing indirect comment:
Instead of the normal meaning
of "a god from a machine," he
meant to imply to the University
the concept, "a machine from a
god." A decent interpretation of
this would be that the ideal of
a university, as something god
ly, i.e. noble, lofty, free commu
nity of scholars, etc., has been
transformed into the all too im
personal machine of bureau
cracy.
This interpretation can be sup
ported by other elements in the
editorial itself. It deals with the
problem of access to the ma
chine of bureaucracy as a means
of approaching that nebulous
"edge of greatness." It states
that the mechanical ("mundane

. . . physical problems" process
of the PACE era has put us up
against philosophical problems.
This is preceded by the mention
of the "decision to transform
this University from a Farm into
a national university," (boldface
mine). He admits that this proc
ess dealt with "financial and
philosophical commitment" and
with "faculty and physical
plant." But his attitude toward
the balance of these two factors
is illuminated from another as
pect when he adds that "physi
cal problems are no longer pri
mary." (boldface mine) This of
course infers that they once
were primary. All of this is con
sistent with the concept of trans
forming the university into a
machine.
If, then, the editor was aware
of the reversal he applied to the
term, and if he intentionally
wove it into the fabric of his
editorial as interpreted above, ho
executed a fairly sophisticated
pun which is wonderfully ap
propriate and topical, he pro
duced a finely structured piece
of writing, and he most certainly
deserves congratulations instead
of pedantic scolding.

(Mr. lyoopold has supplied the
following editor's note:
"Unfortunately, it was an 'ig
norant error' of a type which
would undoubtedly send my high
school Latin instructor scurry
ing to the vomitoriuni. However,
Mr. Hodgson, aided by this un
intentionally sophisticated pun,

did correctly perceive what we—
I guess 'I' is more appropriate
now —were trying to say. The
'machine' has been built — al
though it will necessarily need
constant upkeep — the question,
as Mr. Edelstein alludes to
above, is how are we to trans
form the community —all of it,
not just the student body—into
a 'Harvard of the West.'")
• ARFEP Praised
Editor, The Daily:
The problem of China's rela
tions with other nations and
especially with her neighbors
will continue whatever the out
come of the Vietnam conflict.
Many of us feel that there has
been too little thought and dis
cussion about this problem, par
ticularly with regard to the in
tentions of China toward other
Asian countries, and how our
own attitudes and actions to
ward China influence her inten
tions.
It is the purpose of the Ameri
cans for Reappraisal of Far
Eastern Policy to stimulate such
discussion. The specific project
now being conducted on this
campus by ARFEP is to raise
money for an ad in the S.F.
Chronicle stating ARFEP's
point of view. This project de
serves the serious consideration
of everyone.

the editor in the first place. Per
haps it was not an ignorant er
ror, but rather a clever and
very appropriate pun.
Perhaps in reversing "deus ex
machina" to "ex deus machina,"
he was trying to make the fol
lowing indirect comment:
Instead of the normal meaning
of "a god from a machine," he
meant to imply to the University
the concept, "a machine from a
god." A decent interpretation of
this would be that the ideal of
a university, as something god
ly, i.e. noble, lofty, free commu
nity of scholars, etc., has been
transformed into the all too im
personal machine of bureau
cracy.
This interpretation can be sup
ported by other elements in the
editorial itself. It deals with the
problem of access to the ma
chine of bureaucracy as a means
of approaching that nebulous
"edge of greatness." It states
that the mechanical ("mundane

. . . physical problems" process
of the PACE era has put us up
against philosophical problems.
This is preceded by the mention
of the "decision to transform
this University from a Farm into
a national university," (boldface
mine). He admits that this proc
ess dealt with "financial and
philosophical commitment" and
with "faculty and physical
plant." But his attitude toward
the balance of these two factors
is illuminated from another as
pect when he adds that "physi
cal problems are no longer pri
mary." (boldface mine) This of
course infers that they once
were primary. All of this is con
sistent with the concept of trans
forming the university into a
machine.
If, then, the editor was aware
of the reversal he applied to the
term, and if he intentionally
wove it into the fabric of his
editorial as interpreted above, ho
executed a fairly sophisticated
pun which is wonderfully ap
propriate and topical, he pro
duced a finely structured piece
of writing, and he most certainly
deserves congratulations instead
of pedantic scolding.

• ARFEP Praised
Editor, The Daily:
The problem of China's rela
tions with other nations and
especially with her neighbors
will continue whatever the out
come of the Vietnam conflict.
Many of us feel that there has
been too little thought and dis
cussion about this problem, par
ticularly with regard to the in
tentions of China toward other
Asian countries, and how our
own attitudes and actions to
ward China influence her inten
tions.
It is the purpose of the Ameri
cans for Reappraisal of Far
Eastern Policy to stimulate such
discussion. The specific project
now being conducted on this
campus by ARFEP is to raise
money for an ad in the S.F.
Chronicle stating ARFEP's
point of view. This project de
serves the serious consideration
of everyone.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to congratulate
The Daily for its editorial calling
for introspection after a period
of change. I detect, however, in
this and previous editorials a
certain tendency to indulge in
self - congratulations. While I am
certain that P.A.C.E. has con
tributed to making Stanford a
first-rate University of national
importance and I admit that I
do not know what Stanford was
like before I arrived on the fac
ulty two years ago, it seems to
me that Stanford is now more
like Princeton of the West ra
ther that the Harvard of the
West. I say this as a Princeton
Ph.D, and one who disliked the
Princeton environment.
Like Princeton, Stanford suf
fers from being in a small, dull
town that is committed to not
being a "college" town. Like
Princeton, the Stanford campus
lacks the intellectual excitement
of Harvard— and Chicago, Ber
keley, Columbia, Michigan and
Wisconsin. Similarly, some of my
bright students have admitted
to an anti-intellectualism in the
student body. For many students
college education is only a nec
essary step to getting a degree
and "getting ahead," with little
interest in intellectual or cul
tural pursuits. Also, there is an
unfortunate tendency toward
"splendid isolation" (last year's
vote preventing LASSU from de
ciding about off-campus issues).
Finally, the socio-economic, ra
cial and religious homogenity of
the student body is hardly com

parable to Harvard and may ex
plain some of what I have criti
cized above.
In any case, Stanford is the
Stanford of the West and the
ifidiuvidious comparisons with
the Ivy League universities
seems to stem for self-indul
gence and a sense of insecurity.
If Stanford wants to keep pace
with Harvard, perhaps what is
now needed is a reconsideration
of the student body on the en
vironment at Stanford.

• Deus Ex Machina
Editor, The Dally:
At the risk of seeming very
pedantic, I would like to point
out that the editor ostensibly
made an error in the editorial of
January 28, entitled "Ordeal of
Change." Then I would like to
qualify my accusation in self
defense as well as in order to
give the editor the benefit of
the doubt.
In this editorial, he wrote "ex
deus machina." This is a reversal
of the standard expression, "deus
ex machina," which comes from
Greek theater. Gods were there
introduced through the air by
a crane, most often to enter un
expectedly, as it were "out of the
blue," and bring about an unex
pected change of events. Hence
the application of the term to
situations in which an author
ity swoops down with a sudden

decree, i.e., the Union affair. In
fact, the editor followed up the
use of the term with this very
example, and thus applied it ad
visedly.
The only catch is that he wrote
it backwards.
So far excruciatingly pedantic.
I can make it even more so by
adding that, if the above explana
tion of the term needs docu
mentation, one can consult,
among other things, the 1965
edition of the Britannica, vol.
VII, p. 632. But—

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to congratulate
The Daily for its editorial calling
for introspection after a period
of change. I detect, however, in
this and previous editorials a
certain tendency to indulge in
self - congratulations. While I am
certain that P.A.C.E. has con
tributed to making Stanford a
first-rate University of national
importance and I admit that I
do not know what Stanford was
like before I arrived on the fac
ulty two years ago, it seems to
me that Stanford is now more
like Princeton of the West ra
ther that the Harvard of the
West. I say this as a Princeton
Ph.D, and one who disliked the
Princeton environment.
Like Princeton, Stanford suf
fers from being in a small, dull
town that is committed to not
being a "college" town. Like
Princeton, the Stanford campus
lacks the intellectual excitement
of Harvard— and Chicago, Ber
keley, Columbia, Michigan and
Wisconsin. Similarly, some of my
bright students have admitted
to an anti-intellectualism in the
student body. For many students
college education is only a nec
essary step to getting a degree
and "getting ahead," with little
interest in intellectual or cul
tural pursuits. Also, there is an
unfortunate tendency toward
"splendid isolation" (last year's
vote preventing LASSU from de
ciding about off-campus issues).
Finally, the socio-economic, ra
cial and religious homogenity of
the student body is hardly com

parable to Harvard and may ex
plain some of what I have criti
cized above.
In any case, Stanford is the
Stanford of the West and the
ifidiuvidious comparisons with
the Ivy League universities
seems to stem for self-indul
gence and a sense of insecurity.
If Stanford wants to keep pace
with Harvard, perhaps what is
now needed is a reconsideration
of the student body on the en
vironment at Stanford.

• Deus Ex Machina
Editor, The Dally:
At the risk of seeming very
pedantic, I would like to point
out that the editor ostensibly
made an error in the editorial of
January 28, entitled "Ordeal of
Change." Then I would like to
qualify my accusation in self
defense as well as in order to
give the editor the benefit of
the doubt.
In this editorial, he wrote "ex
deus machina." This is a reversal
of the standard expression, "deus
ex machina," which comes from
Greek theater. Gods were there
introduced through the air by
a crane, most often to enter un
expectedly, as it were "out of the
blue," and bring about an unex
pected change of events. Hence
the application of the term to
situations in which an author
ity swoops down with a sudden

decree, i.e., the Union affair. In
fact, the editor followed up the
use of the term with this very
example, and thus applied it ad
visedly.
The only catch is that he wrote
it backwards.
So far excruciatingly pedantic.
I can make it even more so by
adding that, if the above explana
tion of the term needs docu
mentation, one can consult,
among other things, the 1965
edition of the Britannica, vol.
VII, p. 632. But—
Perhaps this was all clear to
the editor in the first place. Per
haps it was not an ignorant er
ror, but rather a clever and
very appropriate pun.
Perhaps in reversing "deus ex
machina" to "ex deus machina,"
he was trying to make the fol
lowing indirect comment:
Instead of the normal meaning
of "a god from a machine," he
meant to imply to the University
the concept, "a machine from a
god." A decent interpretation of
this would be that the ideal of
a university, as something god
ly, i.e. noble, lofty, free commu
nity of scholars, etc., has been
transformed into the all too im
personal machine of bureau
cracy.
This interpretation can be sup
ported by other elements in the
editorial itself. It deals with the
problem of access to the ma
chine of bureaucracy as a means
of approaching that nebulous
"edge of greatness." It states
that the mechanical ("mundane

. . . physical problems" process
of the PACE era has put us up
against philosophical problems.
This is preceded by the mention
of the "decision to transform
this University from a Farm into
a national university," (boldface
mine). He admits that this proc
ess dealt with "financial and
philosophical commitment" and
with "faculty and physical
plant." But his attitude toward
the balance of these two factors
is illuminated from another as
pect when he adds that "physi
cal problems are no longer pri
mary." (boldface mine) This of
course infers that they once
were primary. All of this is con
sistent with the concept of trans
forming the university into a
machine.
If, then, the editor was aware
of the reversal he applied to the
term, and if he intentionally
wove it into the fabric of his
editorial as interpreted above, ho
executed a fairly sophisticated
pun which is wonderfully ap
propriate and topical, he pro
duced a finely structured piece
of writing, and he most certainly
deserves congratulations instead
of pedantic scolding.

adding that, if the above explana
tion of the term needs docu
mentation, one can consult,
among other things, the 1965
edition of the Britannica, vol.
VII, p. 632. But—
Perhaps this was all clear to
the editor in the first place. Per
haps it was not an ignorant er
ror, but rather a clever and
very appropriate pun.
Perhaps in reversing "deus ex
machina" to "ex deus machina,"
he was trying to make the fol
lowing indirect comment:
Instead of the normal meaning
of "a god from a machine," he
meant to imply to the University
the concept, "a machine from a
god." A decent interpretation of
this would be that the ideal of
a university, as something god
ly, i.e. noble, lofty, free commu
nity of scholars, etc., has been
transformed into the all too im
personal machine of bureau
cracy.
This interpretation can be sup
ported by other elements in the
editorial itself. It deals with the
problem of access to the ma
chine of bureaucracy as a means
of approaching that nebulous
"edge of greatness." It states
that the mechanical ("mundane

. . . physical problems" process
of the PACE era has put us up
against philosophical problems.
This is preceded by the mention
of the "decision to transform
this University from a Farm into
a national university," (boldface
mine). He admits that this proc
ess dealt with "financial and
philosophical commitment" and
with "faculty and physical
plant." But his attitude toward
the balance of these two factors
is illuminated from another as
pect when he adds that "physi
cal problems are no longer pri
mary." (boldface mine) This of
course infers that they once
were primary. All of this is con
sistent with the concept of trans
forming the university into a
machine.
If, then, the editor was aware
of the reversal he applied to the
term, and if he intentionally
wove it into the fabric of his
editorial as interpreted above, ho
executed a fairly sophisticated
pun which is wonderfully ap
propriate and topical, he pro
duced a finely structured piece
of writing, and he most certainly
deserves congratulations instead
of pedantic scolding.

• ARFEP Praised
Editor, The Daily:
The problem of China's rela
tions with other nations and
especially with her neighbors
will continue whatever the out
come of the Vietnam conflict.
Many of us feel that there has
been too little thought and dis
cussion about this problem, par
ticularly with regard to the in
tentions of China toward other
Asian countries, and how our
own attitudes and actions to
ward China influence her inten
tions.
It is the purpose of the Ameri
cans for Reappraisal of Far
Eastern Policy to stimulate such
discussion. The specific project
now being conducted on this
campus by ARFEP is to raise
money for an ad in the S.F.
Chronicle stating ARFEP's
point of view. This project de
serves the serious consideration
of everyone.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to congratulate
The Daily for its editorial calling
for introspection after a period
of change. I detect, however, in
this and previous editorials a
certain tendency to indulge in
self - congratulations. While I am
certain that P.A.C.E. has con
tributed to making Stanford a
first-rate University of national
importance and I admit that I
do not know what Stanford was
like before I arrived on the fac
ulty two years ago, it seems to
me that Stanford is now more
like Princeton of the West ra
ther that the Harvard of the
West. I say this as a Princeton
Ph.D, and one who disliked the
Princeton environment.
Like Princeton, Stanford suf
fers from being in a small, dull
town that is committed to not
being a "college" town. Like
Princeton, the Stanford campus
lacks the intellectual excitement
of Harvard— and Chicago, Ber
keley, Columbia, Michigan and
Wisconsin. Similarly, some of my
bright students have admitted
to an anti-intellectualism in the
student body. For many students
college education is only a nec
essary step to getting a degree
and "getting ahead," with little
interest in intellectual or cul
tural pursuits. Also, there is an
unfortunate tendency toward
"splendid isolation" (last year's
vote preventing LASSU from de
ciding about off-campus issues).
Finally, the socio-economic, ra
cial and religious homogenity of
the student body is hardly com

parable to Harvard and may ex
plain some of what I have criti
cized above.
In any case, Stanford is the
Stanford of the West and the
ifidiuvidious comparisons with
the Ivy League universities
seems to stem for self-indul
gence and a sense of insecurity.
If Stanford wants to keep pace
with Harvard, perhaps what is
now needed is a reconsideration
of the student body on the en
vironment at Stanford.

• Deus Ex Machina
Editor, The Dally:
At the risk of seeming very
pedantic, I would like to point
out that the editor ostensibly
made an error in the editorial of
January 28, entitled "Ordeal of
Change." Then I would like to
qualify my accusation in self
defense as well as in order to
give the editor the benefit of
the doubt.
In this editorial, he wrote "ex
deus machina." This is a reversal
of the standard expression, "deus
ex machina," which comes from
Greek theater. Gods were there
introduced through the air by
a crane, most often to enter un
expectedly, as it were "out of the
blue," and bring about an unex
pected change of events. Hence
the application of the term to
situations in which an author
ity swoops down with a sudden

decree, i.e., the Union affair. In
fact, the editor followed up the
use of the term with this very
example, and thus applied it ad
visedly.
The only catch is that he wrote
it backwards.
So far excruciatingly pedantic.
I can make it even more so by
adding that, if the above explana
tion of the term needs docu
mentation, one can consult,
among other things, the 1965
edition of the Britannica, vol.
VII, p. 632. But—
