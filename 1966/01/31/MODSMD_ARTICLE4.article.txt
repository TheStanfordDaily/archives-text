was described as '"nothing new" by
Dr. Robert Hill, hospital chief of
staff.
"It has been anticipated since 1964,"
said Hill.
Dr. John Scholer, a private doctor

not busy.
But gradually the University re
ceived grants to study special diseases.
Scholer felt that it has been increas
ingly difficult for Stanford and Palo
