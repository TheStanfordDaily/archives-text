## Make Love, Not War 
### 
Theodore Morrison, Harvard profes
sor, will deliver the first Edith Mirrie
lees Memorial Lecture at Stanford
this afternoon.
Morrison's topic for the initial talk
will be "An Image for the Writer."
The lecture is open to the public and
scheduled at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Prof. Morrison will remain on cam
pus through Thursday, meeting with
students and faculty of the English
Department and the Creative Writing
Center. Morrison's host for the week
will be Prof. Wallace Stegner, director
of the center.
Miss Mirrielees, an active Stanford
campus figure for 52 years and pro
fessor of English for 35 of them, died
in June, 19G2, at age 83.
The residue of her estate, left to the
Creative Writing Center, has been
usd to establish a lectureship in her
honor.
A professor of English, Morrison
served as director of the Bread Loaf
Writers Conference at Middlebury,
Vermont for 24 years. H ehas been
writing adviser to Harvard's Nicman
Fellowship program for journalists
since 1944.
A journeyman writer himself, Mor
rison has authored Stones of the,
House and other novels, as well as
editer The Viking Portable Chaucer,
a translation of Chaucer's poems into
modern English.

university's report, said Stanford's
hospital space was "not adequate for
the teaching program." Stanford is
receiving a growing number of post
doctoral students, and thus the facili
ties must be enlarged.
Glaser's report said that the univer
sity needs 450 to 500 beds. At present
Stanford has only 220.
Not everyone, however, favors the
proposal.
Richard Stock, nominee for the
president of United Palo Altans, ex
pressed skepticism. Said Stock: "Per
sonally I think the City of Palo Alto
should remain in the hospital busi
ness." The councilman called the uni
versity offer "an exploratory move"
and said the UPA would take several
months to study it.
In discussing the problem of the
clinic, Dr. Scholar also pointed out
that "in an indirect way, Palo Alto
patients have subsidized the Stanford
Medical School." Most hospitals make
money on their X-ray units. In the
case of the clinic, however, the school
has needed more expensive and less
lucrative equipment. Consequently,
Palo Alto is paying for X-ray machin
ery it really docs not need.
Future of Projwsal
Although Stock and others feel that
the question will not be settled for at
least two years, Councilman Comstock
believes that Stanford will make its
next move by offering a more specific
proposal. Comstock noted that the city
cannot decide on the issue until it
knows how much Stanford will pay.
The university's report does not men
tion any special sum, but it does prom
ise to explore the possible ways of es
tablishing a Palo Alto community
hospital. This would happen only if
the city accepts the offer.
The Palo Alto Clinic was established
in 1959 when the old Stanford hospital
was moved from San Francisco. The
city and the university each chose six
board directors and jointly organized
the clinic as a nonprofit organization.
The hospital was given two staffs,
the Stanford doctors and the private
ones from Palo Alto. Presently, some
of these community doctors have fac
ulty positions.

women for an end to intenacine wars.
This is a particularly nasty one.

tablishing a Palo Alto community
hospital. This would happen only if
the city accepts the offer.
The Palo Alto Clinic was established
in 1959 when the old Stanford hospital
was moved from San Francisco. The
city and the university each chose six
board directors and jointly organized
the clinic as a nonprofit organization.
The hospital was given two staffs,
the Stanford doctors and the private
ones from Palo Alto. Presently, some
of these community doctors have fac
ulty positions.

Theodore Morrison, Harvard profes
sor, will deliver the first Edith Mirrie
lees Memorial Lecture at Stanford
this afternoon.
Morrison's topic for the initial talk
will be "An Image for the Writer."
The lecture is open to the public and
scheduled at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Prof. Morrison will remain on cam
pus through Thursday, meeting with
students and faculty of the English
Department and the Creative Writing
Center. Morrison's host for the week
will be Prof. Wallace Stegner, director
of the center.
Miss Mirrielees, an active Stanford
campus figure for 52 years and pro
fessor of English for 35 of them, died
in June, 19G2, at age 83.
The residue of her estate, left to the
Creative Writing Center, has been
usd to establish a lectureship in her
honor.
A professor of English, Morrison
served as director of the Bread Loaf
Writers Conference at Middlebury,
Vermont for 24 years. H ehas been
writing adviser to Harvard's Nicman
Fellowship program for journalists
since 1944.
A journeyman writer himself, Mor
rison has authored Stones of the,
House and other novels, as well as
editer The Viking Portable Chaucer,
a translation of Chaucer's poems into
modern English.

university's report, said Stanford's
hospital space was "not adequate for
the teaching program." Stanford is
receiving a growing number of post
doctoral students, and thus the facili
ties must be enlarged.
Glaser's report said that the univer
sity needs 450 to 500 beds. At present
Stanford has only 220.
Not everyone, however, favors the
proposal.
Richard Stock, nominee for the
president of United Palo Altans, ex
pressed skepticism. Said Stock: "Per
sonally I think the City of Palo Alto
should remain in the hospital busi
ness." The councilman called the uni
versity offer "an exploratory move"
and said the UPA would take several
months to study it.
In discussing the problem of the
clinic, Dr. Scholar also pointed out
that "in an indirect way, Palo Alto
patients have subsidized the Stanford
Medical School." Most hospitals make
money on their X-ray units. In the
case of the clinic, however, the school
has needed more expensive and less
lucrative equipment. Consequently,
Palo Alto is paying for X-ray machin
ery it really docs not need.
Future of Projwsal
Although Stock and others feel that
the question will not be settled for at
least two years, Councilman Comstock
believes that Stanford will make its
next move by offering a more specific
proposal. Comstock noted that the city
cannot decide on the issue until it
knows how much Stanford will pay.
