# Coffin Blasts 'Sin' In Vietnam War
## 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
Reverend William Coffin, Jr., Yale
University chaplain, yesterday con
demned the moral injustices of the
Vietnam War in a morning sermon in
Memorial Church.
His sermon, closely connected to the
Bible lesson on Lamath, accused the
United States of killing without re
morse. " I have killed a man for
striking a young man . . .'"
The moral outrage, he continued, is
American indiscriminate killings. "We
are killing their (Vietnamese) women
and children to save our men," he
said. He felt, however, that the Viet
Cong had restricted their terrorism to
actions necessary in the context of
this ideological war.
Moral righteousness and political
feasibility are not always the same,
Coffin admitted. After expressing the
view that Americans can not immedi
ately withdraw because it would
create chaos, he discussed the neces
sity of negotiation.
How to Negotiate
Coffin, Wilbur's guest-in-residence,
discussed America's inability to settle
the war by diplomacy. Rusk's actions
were related by Coffin to an article
which lie had read, "Just How Not to
Negotiate Without Even Trying." By
placing the issue in a universal set
ting and by denying the Viet Cong its
role in the negotiation, America has
determined the opposition's policy,
"Political settlement must reflect mili
tary realities," he added.
Honesty is the United States' only
recourse at this time. Coffin implored
Americans to realize the irrevocable
errors already made that still plague
today's actions. "The sins of the fa
thers will revisit the sons. The history
of this Vietnam issue proves this still
true." Though there is little hope for
a non-Communist Vietnam, America
should still strive to establish an in
dependent, united Vietnam, Coffin
said.
"We can not believe that God is on

our side because it is the anti-Commu
nist side," stated Coffin. Ho inter
preted the general reaction of Ameri
cans as similar to "a Pavlovian dog
which runs off at the mouth at the
mention of Communism." He claimed
the policy of wholesale punishment
call not continue without serious reper
cussions.
"As tho descendents of Cain, our
progress has been from murder to
murder," Coffin submitted. lie con
cluded his remarks on America's sin
in Vietnam with a prayful plea for
peace.
Reaction to the sermon varied. Pro
fessor John Troxell of the Graduate
School of Business was displeased that
the audience had not been informed
of Reverend Coffin's topics. "Had I
known that he was going to shout his
views about Vietnam, someone else
could have had my seat." He felt that
Stanford Chapel was an improper
place for such a speech because the
captive audience could not refute or
question Coffin's remarks.

Honesty is the United States' only
recourse at this time. Coffin implored
Americans to realize the irrevocable
errors already made that still plague
today's actions. "The sins of the fa
thers will revisit the sons. The history
of this Vietnam issue proves this still
true." Though there is little hope for
a non-Communist Vietnam, America
should still strive to establish an in
dependent, united Vietnam, Coffin
said.
"We can not believe that God is on

our side because it is the anti-Commu
nist side," stated Coffin. Ho inter
preted the general reaction of Ameri
cans as similar to "a Pavlovian dog
which runs off at the mouth at the
mention of Communism." He claimed
the policy of wholesale punishment
call not continue without serious reper
cussions.
"As tho descendents of Cain, our
progress has been from murder to
murder," Coffin submitted. lie con
cluded his remarks on America's sin
in Vietnam with a prayful plea for
peace.
Reaction to the sermon varied. Pro
fessor John Troxell of the Graduate
School of Business was displeased that
the audience had not been informed
of Reverend Coffin's topics. "Had I
known that he was going to shout his
views about Vietnam, someone else
could have had my seat." He felt that
Stanford Chapel was an improper
place for such a speech because the
captive audience could not refute or
question Coffin's remarks.


REV. COFFIN IN OTTERO
Reverend William Coffin, Jr., Yale
University chaplain, yesterday con
demned the moral injustices of the
Vietnam War in a morning sermon in
Memorial Church.
His sermon, closely connected to the
Bible lesson on Lamath, accused the
United States of killing without re
morse. " I have killed a man for
striking a young man . . .'"
The moral outrage, he continued, is
American indiscriminate killings. "We
are killing their (Vietnamese) women
and children to save our men," he
said. He felt, however, that the Viet
Cong had restricted their terrorism to
actions necessary in the context of
this ideological war.
Moral righteousness and political
feasibility are not always the same,
Coffin admitted. After expressing the
view that Americans can not immedi
ately withdraw because it would
create chaos, he discussed the neces
sity of negotiation.
How to Negotiate
Coffin, Wilbur's guest-in-residence,
discussed America's inability to settle
the war by diplomacy. Rusk's actions
were related by Coffin to an article
which lie had read, "Just How Not to
Negotiate Without Even Trying." By
placing the issue in a universal set
ting and by denying the Viet Cong its
role in the negotiation, America has
determined the opposition's policy,
"Political settlement must reflect mili
tary realities," he added.
Honesty is the United States' only
recourse at this time. Coffin implored
Americans to realize the irrevocable
errors already made that still plague
today's actions. "The sins of the fa
thers will revisit the sons. The history
