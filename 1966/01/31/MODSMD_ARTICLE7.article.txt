## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
The Reverend William S. Coffin,
chaplain of Yale University will con
clude a three day guest-in-residence
visit with an address in Cuhberly
Auditorium at 8 tonight. Coffin's
address on "The Moral Implications of
United States Policy in Vietnam"
sponsored by the Americans for a
Reappraisal of Far Eastern Policy
(ARFEP) and the Political Union
as part of the Focus series.
Following the speech, Coffin will
participate in a panel discussion with
Professors Nobutaka Ike and Richard
Brody of the Political Science Depart
ment and Professor William L. Rivers
of the Communications Department.
As a clergyman, Coffin believes it
his duty to see that people are "con
cerned about the dominant moral is
sues" in the Vietnam war. In advo
cating a "morality of candor" he
urges Americans to call their govern
ment to task if they disagree with
present policy and above all, to seek
information.
"Moral Demagoguery"
The Yale chaplain told a freshman
seminar yesterday that the United
States is one of the most ideological
countries in the world. However in
relation to China, he noted that "we
see the Chinese as Reds first and

people second." Taking an overview
of post-war happenings in Southeast
Asia, Coffin said "The United States
has an obligation to love our enemy
(China) because in part we have
made him that way."
While believing the moral issues
are an essential part of the Vietnam
question, he has criticized the use of
"moral demagoguery" by both the
proponents and opponents of the war.
Coffin believes that both sides should
use "the wisdom of the serpent and
the meekness of the lamb."
He is not prepared to see the United
States abandon Vietnam completely.
However, the Yale chaplain favors
immediate negotiation to end the con
flict.
51-49 Every Day
Neither a pacifist nor a war hawk,
Coffin claims that he polls himself
on the question each morning and
generally tallies 51-49 in favor of a
non-pacifist approach. Coffin has
stressed the relativity of Christian
theology by which he means that
each man must interpret his absolute
commitment in terms of real circum
stances.
Coffin has been chaplain at Yale
since 1956, the year he was ordained.
He attended Union Theological Semin
ary and served as chaplain at Wil
liams College before going to Yale.
He is presently a member of the
Board of Directors of the President's
Advisory Council on the Peace Corps.
Following the Programs in Cub
berly, Coffin will participate in a
seminar in the Rinconada lounge. He
will also be available today from 2-2:3
will also be available today from 2-

see the Chinese as Reds first and

people second." Taking an overview
of post-war happenings in Southeast
Asia, Coffin said "The United States
has an obligation to love our enemy
(China) because in part we have
made him that way."
While believing the moral issues
are an essential part of the Vietnam
question, he has criticized the use of
"moral demagoguery" by both the
proponents and opponents of the war.
Coffin believes that both sides should
use "the wisdom of the serpent and
the meekness of the lamb."
He is not prepared to see the United
States abandon Vietnam completely.
However, the Yale chaplain favors
immediate negotiation to end the con
flict.
51-49 Every Day
Neither a pacifist nor a war hawk,
Coffin claims that he polls himself
on the question each morning and
generally tallies 51-49 in favor of a
non-pacifist approach. Coffin has
stressed the relativity of Christian
theology by which he means that
each man must interpret his absolute
commitment in terms of real circum
stances.
Coffin has been chaplain at Yale
since 1956, the year he was ordained.
He attended Union Theological Semin
ary and served as chaplain at Wil
liams College before going to Yale.

"Moral Demagoguery"
The Yale chaplain told a freshman
seminar yesterday that the United
States is one of the most ideological
countries in the world. However in
relation to China, he noted that "we
see the Chinese as Reds first and

people second." Taking an overview
