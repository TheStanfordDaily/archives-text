# Lysistrata To Open Feb. 18
## 
### 
Sold out three weeks in advance
of its first performance, Lysistrata,
Ram's Head's winter offering will
open Feb. 18.
Lysistrata, or Make Love, Not
War!, depicts the sex strike insti
gated to end war by a coalition of
women of the Greek city-states. Led
by Lysistrata, they have been called
the antecedent of today's "Women
for Peace" demonstrators.
The "hard rock" music of the Lav
ender Hill Mob places the fundamen
tal sensuality of Aristophanes' verse
in a modern context.
Lysistrata is staged on a multi
level platform set representing the
Acropolis. According to designer T. J.
McHose, lavender is used to achieve
a feeling of plasticity; his set's prom
inence decreases as the drama intensi
fies.
McHose feels he contributes to the
feeling of unreality through special
lighting effects, using schrim to
soften the impact of the platform and
accentuate the drama's action.
Ram's Head, now upstairs in the
ASSU loft, still has tickets available
for evening performances (beginning
at 8:30) Feb. 19, 24, 25, 26, and for
the 2:30 matinee, Feb. 20. Further in
formation is available from business
manager Robert Stone.
