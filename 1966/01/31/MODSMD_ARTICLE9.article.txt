### PAT McMAHON 
University rigidity, academic
pressures, hiring a professor -
these are all topics discussed at
the Thursday student faculty
luncheon program now entering
its fourth month.
Professor Walter Meyerhoff,
director of the weekly luncheons,
said the Thursday meetings at
Encina Hall provide students
"an opportunity to be heard, to
ask questions, and maybe to get
answers."
Topics are proposed by stu
dents themselves, according to
Meyerhoff. He said the program
is open to all students, although
size is limited to a "comforable
30." All University meal tickets
are transferable to the Encina
Commons, and the Dean of Stu
dents' office pays for other stu
dents.
Reactions to the program by
students and faculty attending
have all been favorable. One
student described it as one of
the few opportunities to meet
faculty and administrators on
an informal basis to discuss
common problems. lie found it
"most rewarding."
Mr. Robert Kincheloe of the
Stanford Electronics Labratory

thought the program was excel
lent. but he felt the need for
"fresh blood, a little more turn
over in the group." He noted
that the "free-wheeling conver
sation" was most valuable.
Professor Arthur Hastings, a
regular participator commented
that he would like to see similar
groups on ( ntupus so that "more
students and, hopefully, more
I'aeulty could be involved."
Robert 11. Eustis, Professor of
Mechanical Engineering and co
director of the program, empha
sized the purpose was "not to
try to settle a problem or to take
action, but to understand the
thinking of various sectors of
the campus."
Meyerhoff, a professor of phy
sics, said the aim was "pure
discussion" but that action
would result in an indirect way
"as each person comes to see
other viewpoints."
Initiated this fall, the program
was an outgrowth of a similar
faculty discussion group that
had met for several years. At
the present luncheons there are
usually as many faculty mem
bers as students.
Meyerhoff said students could
contact his secretary if interest
ed in participating.

Meyerhoff, a professor of phy
sics, said the aim was "pure
discussion" but that action
would result in an indirect way
"as each person comes to see
other viewpoints."
Initiated this fall, the program
was an outgrowth of a similar
faculty discussion group that
had met for several years. At
the present luncheons there are
usually as many faculty mem
bers as students.
Meyerhoff said students could
contact his secretary if interest
ed in participating.
