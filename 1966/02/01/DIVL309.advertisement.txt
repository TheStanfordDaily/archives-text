Don't look now. But a keen machine called Toronado has designs on you. Out to get you
with front wheel drive that puts the traction where the action is! Extra stretch-out room
for six. (Flat floors, you know.) Full-view side windows. Draft-free ventilation. Front and
rear seat belts, back-ups and a raft of other standard safety etceteras. Like we say, Toronado
has designs on you. Or is it the other way around! LOOK TO OLDS FOR THE NEW!
