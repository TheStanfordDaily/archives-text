Pie in the Sky
"If there is no immortality, I shall hurl myself into the sea," wrote
Tennyson. "Without hope of an afterlife, 1 ' Bismarck said, this life is not even
worth the effort of getting dressed in the morning." Freud called the belief
in life beyond the grave "the oldest, strongest, most insistent wish of mankind."
Jesus Christ said, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in
me, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and he who lives and believes
in me shall never die." Eminently well-quaulified to led men through the dark
door of death, Jesus Christ is called in the New Testament, "the author and
finisher of our faith," "the pioneer of our salvation." It is the eternal, resur
rectied Lord Jesus who speaks the words, "Fear not, I am the first and the
last and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive for evermore, and I
have the keys of Death and Hades."
The greatest fact of history, the resurrection from the dead of Jesus
Christ, has in the words of the New Testament, "abolished death and brought
life and immortality to light through the Gospel." The merits and benefits of
Christ's death and resurrection are yours free for the asking. This is the Good
News, or Gospels "The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal
life, through Jesus Christ our Lord," in the words of the Apostle Paul,
PieÂ«fn the Sky when I die? Yes, to be sure, but also and more important,
Jesus Christ offers abundant, rich spiritual life now. Critics who place heaven
in the great beyond have missed the point. For heaven is that dimension of
the Holy Spirit of God, the realm behind the visible where all things have their
origin and sustenance. "Heaven" is entered here and now by faith in Jesus
Christ, and resurrection life is yours today. The work of God which today
begins within, tomorrow changes the outer man as well. And, Jesus Christ has
said, "He who believes in me will never know what it is to die."
To be dead" is to be attempting life without Jesus Christ. Animated and
motivated you may be, but dead you are without the One who said, "I am the
Life." Why die? Why stay dead? An unbeliving world may scorn Jesus Christ
but why should you miss out?
