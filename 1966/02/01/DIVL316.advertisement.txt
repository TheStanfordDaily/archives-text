HOW COLLEGE
STUDENTS VIEW
THE DRAFT
Even administrators of the draft
admit its inequities and imperfec- ;
tions. Many question its fairness.
A special section in the February
ATLANTIC considers all sides: two
college men view the draft in
Taking a McNamara Fellowship
and How to be Patriotic and Live
With Yourself. A third article,
Who Should Serve?, probes the
dilemma and explores improve
ments and alternatives.
Also in this issue: In Defense of
: i the Negro Colleges and Art and
Anti-Art in Painting and Books.
