WASHINGTON — President Johnson or
dered renewed bombing of North Vietnam
Monday and took to the United Nations the
U.S. search for a peaceful settlement of the
conflict.
In resuming the bombing at about the same
level of intensity as before and holding it
"with great care" to military targets, the
President differed from those who wanted to
hit directly at North Vietnamese centers like
Hanoi-Haiphong and from those who wanted
a longer pause.
Johnson Explanation
In a brief midmorning broadcast the Presi
dent explained why he ordered limited air
strikes at "those who direct and supply the
aggression."
"It is our clear duty" to save lives of the
defending troops in South Vietnam in view ox
Hanoi's rejection of America's "most intense

and determined effort" for peace talks, he
said.
"The answer of Hanoi to all," he said, "is
they persist in aggression and they insist
on surrender of South Vietnam to commun
ism. It is plain that there is no readiness to
talk—no readiness for peace—in that regime
today."
Johnson simultaneously pledged that "The
end of the pause does not mean the end of
our pursuit of peace."
On new peace efforts, which the President
himself announced, U. S. Ambassador Arthur
Goldberg called for an immediate meeting of
the U.N. Security Council to hear a report on
the collapse of the U.S. peace offensive and
to receive a resolution for new diplomatic
action.
Extension Offer Refused
Rusk disclosed at the news conference that
the United States had made an offer to North

Vietnam to extend the bombing lull if North
Vietnam would respond to President John
son's peace offensive with some gestures of
its own.
But the only reactions from Hanoi, Rusk
said, were "negative, harsh and unyielding."
He declared Hanoi had rebuffed every attempt
to move toward peace and that the President's
"senior advisers," having first recommended
the bombing lull and peace drive, finally rec
ommended that the bombing be resumed.
By both words and deeds, Rusk said, the
Communists rebuffed the U.S. bid.
Reds Are "Sole Representative"
North Vietnamese President Ho Chi Minh
declared in a letter broadcast Friday that the
National Liberation Front, the Red's political
arm in South Vietnam, must be recognized
as the "sole representative "of the South Viet
namese people, Rusk noted.

In the realm of deeds, Rusk reported that
North Vietnam kept up its infiltration of the
South and Viet Cong terrorism continued at
"the same high level" during the bombing
pause as before.
In still holding the door open for negotia
tions, Rusk said "answers can be found if
they're prepared to sit down and talk like
reasonable men."
Johnson endorsed a weekend peace appeal
from Pope Paul VI, who said that neutral na
tions under U.N. sponsorship might be able
to initiate arbitration.
"A role for neutral countries to explore the
possibilities of peace," Rusk told a news con
ference, "would be entriely agreeable and wel
comed by the United States."
Peace Offensive 'Hoax'
Peking radio said North Vietnam had pro
tested the resumption of the attacks to the

Interntaional Central Commission for Viet
nam. This commission is made up of repre
sentatives from Canada, India and Poland.
In similar commentaries, the Peking and
Moscow radios declared the renewed attacks
proved the (U.S.) peace offensive to be "a
hoax."
In the Vatican, Pope Paul VI was reported
disappointed that his appeal for peace through
U.N. arbitration had failed to avert a resump
tion of the bombing.
Britain Sympathetic
But in London, government officials said the
British government "looks with sympathy on
the reasons that led to the resumption of the
bombings." They said Hanoi had laid down
an impossible new condition for peace talks—
that the Viet Cong be the "sole genuine rep
resentative" of the South Vietnamese at any
peace conference.
