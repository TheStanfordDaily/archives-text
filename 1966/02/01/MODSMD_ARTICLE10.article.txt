# MORRISON ON AUTHORS
## Emotions, Reason Combine 
### 
"The Image of a Creative
Writer is the image of a house
divided, a man with two conflict
ing personalities," one
guided by a reasonable view of
life, the other dominated by emo
tion. This is the picture pre
sented yesterday afternoon to a
small audience in Dinklespiel
Auditorium by Professor Theo
dore Morrison, in the first of the
Edith Mirrielees lectures.
In a highly metaphorical lec
ture, Dr. Morrison likened the
one half of a writer's person to
a "dweller in a penthouse apart
ment" with a view of all the
world and plenty of books at
hand. The other half was char
acterized as a "Scullery boy" liv
ing in the lower part of the
building with no view of the
world at all, guided by his own
need for satisfaction.
Every individual writer must
work out his own balance be
tween these two personalities, or
else his house cannot stand, Mor
rison said. There is no pat math
ematical proportion between
the two forces which applies to
The Writer in general, for that
entity does not exist. There are
only writers, each one very dif
ferent from all the others.
Both of the personalities in
the writer are necessary: the
scullery boy to give the basic
ingredients out of which the
penthouse-dweller can form his
works. The scullery boy gives
life and force, but the other
must give direction and purpose,
Professor Morrison stated.
Although the cruder personal
ity of the two has no verbal lang
uage, his sensations and imagin
ation are the seeds out of which
the poetic form grows. From
him come the myths and arch

types which form a necessary
part of creative writing.
Morrison was careful to
note a writer must never over
look the contributions of one
half of himself in homage to the
other. Today's critics classify the
penthause dweller with "that
most terrible of all titles, 'Aca
demic.' "
They praise the myth and
archetype as the source of true
literature, glorify those writers
who make as few modifications
as possible on the products of
the emotions, and attack those
who look for any conscious fn
tent in the work of authors.
"I take the cause of the pent
house dweller," Dr. Morrison
stated. "He needs the scullery
boy, but he must control the
boy's output." This is only to
maintain some sort of balance
between the two; someday, Mor

rison said, the scullery boy may
need some defence.
