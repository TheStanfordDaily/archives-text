# VIETNAM BOMBED
## Trucks, Barge Blasted

SOUTH VIETNAM (AP) â€”
U. S. warplanes, in their first
attacks on North Vietnam in 37
days, wrecked a truck convoy,
destroyed bridges and pum
melled ferry boat complexes and
barges, the U. S. military an
nounced last night. Air Force
jets raked a main coastal high
way known to bear heavy south
bound traffic during the bomb
ing lull.
Heavy Communist ground fire
brought down one U. S. Navy
jet but the pilot was plucked
from the South China Sea under
a fusillade of Communist shore
fire.
Planes Hit
Radio Hanoi claimed Red gun
ners shot down five planes and
damaged 10 others.
Communist broadcasts pic
tured the resumption of the air
attacks as proof that the U. S.
peace offensive that began be
fore Christmas was a fraud, but
in Washington President John
son said he ordered the bomb
ings resumed to save American
and allied lives in South Viet

nam. He said the United States
would continue its pursuit of
peace and called on the United
Nations Security Council to
help.
Congress Reacts
Johnson's order to renew the
air war over North Vietnam
won approval of U. S. congres
sional leaders. Some expressed
hope the peace moves would con
tinue, while others called for in
tensified military efforts to win
the war.
In South Vietnam, U. S. and
allied ground forces stepped up
offensives in scattered areas de
spite a relative lull in Commu
nist attacks for the past month
or so. Intelligence sources in Sai
gon said the lull was not a re
action to the U. S. peace offers.
The Communist lull followed a
pattern of the past three years:
hit vulnerable targets for
months at a time, then fade into
the jungles, they said.
During the bombing suspen
sion, the Communists rebuilt
roads, bridges and railroads, in
telligence reports say, and ap

parently traffic has flowed free
ly into the South from Hanoi
and Haiphong.
These were the targets that
Air Force and Navy jets went
after in the first attacks since
Christmas Eve.
Planes Gun Convoy
U. S. Air Force fighter bomb
ers screamed over highway No.
1 which runs along North Viet
nam's central coast, destroying
a truck convoy and a bridge.
The closest the planes came to
the Hanoi-Haiphong industrial
complex was about 60 miles.
Flights of Air Force jets ham
mered a highway ferry complex
about 20 miles northeast of
Thanh Hea, a coastal city 80
miles south of Hanoi.
Farther south, other jets dam
aged ferryboat approaches near
Quang Khe and destroyed a
bridge at Dong Hoi.
Groundfire from Dong Hoi
brought down a Navy A-4 Sky
hawk piloted by Lt. Cmdr. Syl
vester Chujley, Lemoore, Calif.
He bobbed in the water with
Communist machine gun bullets
pinging around him for 35 min
utes.
A U. S. Air Force Grumman
Albatross amphibian landed and
picked him up.
