# LBJ Plays Down Further Bombing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
sumption of the bombing of
North Vietnam yesterday had a
this -is - where -we - came-in air
about it as President Johnson
carefully avoided any dramatic
broadening of the air war's
scope.
The targets hit by Air Force
and Navy fighter-bombers were
in the same general areas and of
the same nature as those at
tacked by the first raiders near
ly 12 months ago.
Those targets were bridges,
warehouses, storage facilities,
and truck convoys in the Vinh
and Dong Hoi regions just above
the demilitarized zone separat
ing North Vietnam and South
Vietnam.
Pentagon sources described
the kickoff attack Monday as
light, probably because of ad
verse weather conditions.
37 Day Lull
The loss of a Navy plane to
ground fire indicated the enemy
had concentrated antiaircraft
batteries there during the 37-
day lull.
"We're easing in gently," said
one military official.
Another knowledgeable Penta
gon source suggested the pat
tern of attacks in the immediate
future at least may involve a
lower level of target than just
before the lull began, but heavi
er strikes at these targets in
terms of more planes and
bombs.
During the lull which began
December 24, some members of
Congress and others urged that
when the air strikes were re
newed the target areas be broad
ened to include ports, power
plants and factories — and per
haps even the capital. Hanoi.
Limited Objectives
But President Johnson indi
cated in his broadcast report to
the nation that the target objec
tives probably will continue to
be limited mainly to the infiltra
tion routes.
He stressed, too, that "our air
strikes in North Vietnam from
the beginning, have been aimed
at military targets and have
been controlled with the greatest
of care."

There was speculation that the
President would keep the targets
at a relatively low level — and
that he is underscoring the tight
control — in a bid to encourage
the North Vietnamese to have
second thoughts about negotia
ting.
Where We Were
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
at a news conference following
the President's report, said the
bombing level is "approximately
where we were in December"
when the lull began.
Military sources disputed this,
noting that by degrees as the
air war progressed last year U.S.
warplanes were ranging far to
the north and hitting such tar
gets as power plants.
It also was noted that some
of the raids came very close to
China's borders and within 13
miles of Haiphong, North Viet
nam's chief port.
Haiphong and Hanoi have
been exempt from U. S. bombing
so far and there is no indication
that this will change in the im
mediate future.

37 Day Lull
The loss of a Navy plane to
ground fire indicated the enemy
had concentrated antiaircraft
batteries there during the 37-
day lull.
"We're easing in gently," said
one military official.
Another knowledgeable Penta
gon source suggested the pat
tern of attacks in the immediate
future at least may involve a
lower level of target than just
before the lull began, but heavi
er strikes at these targets in
terms of more planes and
bombs.
During the lull which began
December 24, some members of
Congress and others urged that
when the air strikes were re
newed the target areas be broad
ened to include ports, power
plants and factories — and per
haps even the capital. Hanoi.
Limited Objectives
But President Johnson indi
cated in his broadcast report to
the nation that the target objec
tives probably will continue to
be limited mainly to the infiltra
tion routes.
He stressed, too, that "our air
strikes in North Vietnam from
the beginning, have been aimed
at military targets and have
been controlled with the greatest
of care."

There was speculation that the
President would keep the targets
at a relatively low level — and
that he is underscoring the tight
control — in a bid to encourage
the North Vietnamese to have
second thoughts about negotia
ting.
Where We Were
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
at a news conference following
the President's report, said the
bombing level is "approximately
where we were in December"
when the lull began.
Military sources disputed this,
noting that by degrees as the
air war progressed last year U.S.
warplanes were ranging far to
the north and hitting such tar
gets as power plants.
It also was noted that some
of the raids came very close to
China's borders and within 13
miles of Haiphong, North Viet
nam's chief port.
Haiphong and Hanoi have
been exempt from U. S. bombing
so far and there is no indication
that this will change in the im
mediate future.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
sumption of the bombing of
North Vietnam yesterday had a
this -is - where -we - came-in air
about it as President Johnson
carefully avoided any dramatic
broadening of the air war's
scope.
The targets hit by Air Force
and Navy fighter-bombers were
in the same general areas and of
the same nature as those at
tacked by the first raiders near
ly 12 months ago.
Those targets were bridges,
warehouses, storage facilities,
and truck convoys in the Vinh
and Dong Hoi regions just above
the demilitarized zone separat
ing North Vietnam and South
Vietnam.
Pentagon sources described
the kickoff attack Monday as
light, probably because of ad
verse weather conditions.
