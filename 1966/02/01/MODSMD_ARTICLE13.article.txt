# Congressman Calls A-Bomb Unnecessary

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Rep.
Craig Hesmer, RCalif., recom
mended yesterday against use
of atomic weapons at the current
stage of the Vietnam war.
In a report to the House Re
publican Conference, as chair
man of its Nuclear Affairs Com
mittee, Hesmer concluded that
nuclear weapons are unsuitable
for use in the present circum
stances.
But if Red China enters the
war openly with large military
forces, Hesmer said "use of both
strategic and tactical nuclear
weapons most probably would be
indicated."
Five Reasons to Reject
Hesmer listed five reasons for
rejecting use of atomic weapons
at this stage:
1. Tropical forest areas are not
suitable for effective use of
nuclear explosives.
2. Urban areas of North Viet
nam, including Hanoi and Hai
phong, are too small to indicate
any advantage of nuclear over
conventional weapons.
3. Radioactive fallout.
4. Opportunity for anti-Amer
ican propaganda.
5. Nuclear weapons would be
little more effective than con
ventional explosives in an under
developed country.
