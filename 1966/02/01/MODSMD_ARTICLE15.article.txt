# Poli Union Suggests Vietnam Bibliography
## 
### 
Amidst all the diatribes on the
immorality of bombing North
Vietnam and the howls from the
other side contending that Amer
ica must win the war, one might
almost think that Americans are
concerned about Vietnam.
That is until one puts down
the newspapers and talks to
someone, almost anyone. Unless
he is living in an Intellectual
Asylum, his queries will be met
with vague shrugs of the shoul
ders, an attitude of "I can't real
ly say what I think we should
do because I just don't know
enough about it."
Befuddled Students
To educate these masses of be
fuddled students Political Union
started "Focus," a series of Wed
nesday evening seminars for in
formal discussion between stu
dents and Professors Buss, Man
call, Doolin, and Vanslyke. So
far no more than 30 or 40 stu
dents have appeared. Not to be
thwarted, the Political Union has
prepared a Vietnam Reading
List.
"The best basic book on Viet
nam," according to Professor
Claude Buss of the History De
partment, is Bernard Fall's The
Two Vietnams. The book pre
sents not only an excellent
source for obtaining a broad,
general perspective on the is
sues involved, but it presents—
says Frank Morse, who is doing
his honors paper on Vietnam —
some proposals in the last chap
ter that are still valid. It was
published in 1963 and revised in
1964.
Vietcong Tactics
Although many claim that the
Red Chinese are training the
Vietcong, Buss feels that the
Chinese are going down to
North Vietnam as much to learn
as to teach. The tactics of the
Vietcong are outlined in their
Commanding General's book,
People's War, People's Army.
m contrast to the widespread
attention given to Mao's book
on guerilla warfare, Giap's book
has scarcely been noticed. Yet
the importance of this book.
Morse says, is akin to that of
Hitler's Mein Kampf.
One of the most objective and
comprehensive books on Viet
nam was written by a private
in the French army in Vietnam
and is called appropriately The
Fall of Dien Blen Phu.
Much lighter reading is The
Grwsn Berets, a fictional account

of the efforts of the American
special forces in Vietnam. An
other fiction book but much less
sensational is Morris West's
Ambassador. The latter book
presents a composite picture of
the successive U. S. ambassadors
in Vietnam.
