# U.S. Economy Can Take Vietnam War 'In Stride'
## 
### SAM DAWSON AP News Analyst 
NEW YORK (AP) —Renewed U. S. bombing of North Vietnam
and stepped-up fighting in South Vietnam could mean:
• Increased spending in the period ahead.
• More pressure for tax increases later on.
• More fire under what as of now is only a simmering threat
of further inflation.
President Johnson stresses that the quest for a peaceful solution
continues.
But resumption of full-scale operations in Southeast Asia re
moves for the present one of the uncertainties that have been
plaguing businessmen and congressmen alike.
Small War Indefinite
With peace possibilities apparently still remote, government,
business and the stock market all will make their plans on the sup
position that the United States will proceed for an indefinite period

on a small war basis.
For the economy this fore
shadows:
• Appropriations for the Viet
nam war —slated at $10 billion
—are more likely to be in
creased later on than be trim
med.
• Defense industries can look
for still more orders, more pro

duction, more jobs.
• Increased demand for some
metals in short supply, such as
copper, needed for military
hardware will generate still
more pressure for higher prices.
• Demand for many other
basic materials, even if now in
ample supply, will grow instead
of slacken. This will support
their price levels and promise
increased production schedules.
The U.S. economic growth has
been so rapid over the last five
years that it can easily take the
present scale of the Vietnam
war in stride without cramping
production of civilian goods or
putting the U.S. Treasury under
any great strain.
Reconsider Domestic Costs
But although spending for the
Great Society programs is
scheduled to be stepped up by $3
billion in the next fiscal year,
the appropriation request would
have been more than that with
out the present cost of the Viet
nam war.
Any further escalation of mili
tary efforts might cause Con
gress to reconsider the amounts
to be spared for the domestic
programs. Many communities,
business firms, and citizens
have a stake in these.
Or if both the Great Society
and an increased war effort
were to be sustained together
and financed, Congress might
turn to increasing taxes to keep
the Treasury deficit from
mounting too fast.
Also likely is increased effort
by the administration to hold
down basic prices by insistence
on the government guidelines on
wages and prices.
The threat of inflation will be
watched closer than ever now.

• Increased spending in the period ahead.
• More pressure for tax increases later on.
• More fire under what as of now is only a simmering threat
of further inflation.
President Johnson stresses that the quest for a peaceful solution
continues.
But resumption of full-scale operations in Southeast Asia re
moves for the present one of the uncertainties that have been
plaguing businessmen and congressmen alike.
Small War Indefinite
With peace possibilities apparently still remote, government,
business and the stock market all will make their plans on the sup
position that the United States will proceed for an indefinite period

on a small war basis.
For the economy this fore
shadows:
• Appropriations for the Viet
nam war —slated at $10 billion
—are more likely to be in
creased later on than be trim
med.
• Defense industries can look
for still more orders, more pro

duction, more jobs.
• Increased demand for some
metals in short supply, such as
copper, needed for military
hardware will generate still
more pressure for higher prices.
• Demand for many other
basic materials, even if now in
ample supply, will grow instead
of slacken. This will support
their price levels and promise
increased production schedules.
The U.S. economic growth has
been so rapid over the last five
years that it can easily take the
present scale of the Vietnam
war in stride without cramping
production of civilian goods or
putting the U.S. Treasury under
any great strain.
Reconsider Domestic Costs
But although spending for the
Great Society programs is
scheduled to be stepped up by $3
billion in the next fiscal year,
the appropriation request would
have been more than that with
out the present cost of the Viet
nam war.
Any further escalation of mili
tary efforts might cause Con
gress to reconsider the amounts
to be spared for the domestic
programs. Many communities,
business firms, and citizens
have a stake in these.
Or if both the Great Society
and an increased war effort
were to be sustained together
and financed, Congress might
turn to increasing taxes to keep
the Treasury deficit from
mounting too fast.
Also likely is increased effort
by the administration to hold
down basic prices by insistence
on the government guidelines on
wages and prices.
The threat of inflation will be
watched closer than ever now.
NEW YORK (AP) —Renewed U. S. bombing of North Vietnam
and stepped-up fighting in South Vietnam could mean:
• Increased spending in the period ahead.
• More pressure for tax increases later on.
• More fire under what as of now is only a simmering threat
of further inflation.
