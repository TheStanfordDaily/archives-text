# Campus Reacts To Renewed Raids
## SCPV Impugns Napalm Makers 
### 
"I trust my country and any wea
pon they ask me to make, I'll make,"
stated Barnett R. Adelman, president
of United Technology Center in Sun
nyvale in a closed meeting with six
representatives of Vietnam peace
groups.
The peace group delegation ques
tioned the morality of the UTC pro
duction of napalm, a poisonous gas
used in the war in Vietnam.
Decline To See Press
The management of the Sunnyvale
plant declined to talk to the press.
Cyril Sia, a delegate from the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
related the proceedings.
"There was a very frank exchange
of opinions," said Sia. "But. Mr. Adel
man demonstrated an amazing lack
of knowledge of Vietnam history. At
least 10 minutes of the meeting were
spent in exposition of some of the
basic issues."
According to Sia, Adelman said
there is no distinction between wea
pons, between a bullet and thermo
nuclear bomb or gas-chemical war
fare or napalm.
Usefulness—Only Criteria
"When engaged in war, we're justi
fied in using any weapons at all," the
president was reported as saying.
"The only criteria is how useful the
weapon is."
"When we asked if we could talk
to some employees," reported Sia,
"Adelman answered 'you are talking
to all the employees right now.' "
Two Employees Quit
Mr. Adelman claimed that he had
not heard that one of his engineers
resigned. The SCPV has noted that
two employees quit as a result of the
leaflet campaign the SCPV conducted.
Sia asked the company head to
recognize that the production of na
palm was a public issue, and that the
company should allow discussion and
opposing views in its company maga
zine. Adelman countered that he is
the only one who can publish editor
ials, said Sia.
"He also refused to meet us in a
public debate," said Sia.
Six UTC executives were present
at the meeting, but only Adelman
spoke, according to Sia. Other mem
bers of the peace delegation were
Keith Lowe and Steve Marx of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam; Professor Bruce G. Frank
lin of the Californians for Peace in
Vietnam; and Mrs. Felix Green and
Prof. Lincoln Moses of the Concerned
Citizens of Palo Alto.

"I trust my country and any wea
pon they ask me to make, I'll make,"
stated Barnett R. Adelman, president
of United Technology Center in Sun
nyvale in a closed meeting with six
representatives of Vietnam peace
groups.
The peace group delegation ques
tioned the morality of the UTC pro
duction of napalm, a poisonous gas
used in the war in Vietnam.
Decline To See Press
The management of the Sunnyvale
plant declined to talk to the press.
Cyril Sia, a delegate from the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
related the proceedings.
"There was a very frank exchange
of opinions," said Sia. "But. Mr. Adel
man demonstrated an amazing lack
of knowledge of Vietnam history. At
least 10 minutes of the meeting were
spent in exposition of some of the
basic issues."
According to Sia, Adelman said
there is no distinction between wea
pons, between a bullet and thermo
nuclear bomb or gas-chemical war
fare or napalm.
Usefulness—Only Criteria
"When engaged in war, we're justi
fied in using any weapons at all," the
president was reported as saying.
"The only criteria is how useful the
weapon is."
"When we asked if we could talk
to some employees," reported Sia,
"Adelman answered 'you are talking
to all the employees right now.' "
Two Employees Quit
Mr. Adelman claimed that he had
not heard that one of his engineers
resigned. The SCPV has noted that
two employees quit as a result of the
leaflet campaign the SCPV conducted.
Sia asked the company head to
recognize that the production of na
palm was a public issue, and that the
company should allow discussion and
opposing views in its company maga
zine. Adelman countered that he is
the only one who can publish editor
ials, said Sia.
"He also refused to meet us in a
public debate," said Sia.
Six UTC executives were present
at the meeting, but only Adelman
spoke, according to Sia. Other mem
bers of the peace delegation were
Keith Lowe and Steve Marx of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam; Professor Bruce G. Frank
lin of the Californians for Peace in
Vietnam; and Mrs. Felix Green and
Prof. Lincoln Moses of the Concerned
Citizens of Palo Alto.
