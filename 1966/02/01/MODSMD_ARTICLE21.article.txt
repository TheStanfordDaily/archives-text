# COMMENT ON JOHNSON ACTION
## Senators Split Over Bombing 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
resumption of bombing of North
Vietnam Monday brought a call
by senior Republican senator,
Everett Dirksen, for the United
States to shift to a full wartime
footing — with a universal draft,
higher taxes and economic con
trols.
Sen. George D. Aiken of Ver
mont told the Senate that unless
the danger is far less than it
now appears there is no sense
in President Johnson "waiting
until after the election to recom
mend the inevitable." Waiting,
he declared, "is just another at
tempt to lull the people."
The President's decision to ask
help of the United Nations to
bring the Vietnam conflict to
the negotiating table got solid
support in Congress. Among
those who praised this action
were most of the 16 senators
who had sent him a letter urg
ing a continuation of the bomb
ing lull.
But doubts were voiced on the
move's chance for success in the
United Nations.
Ix>ng Not Confident
The Senate Democratic whip,
Sen. Russell B. Long of Louisi
ana, said:
"I fear we are in for a rather
frustrating experience. Any res
olution we might get to uphold
us in the Security Council will
be vetoed by the Soviet Union.
And, if the General Assembly
should pass a resolution on our
side, the Communists will not
abide by it."
Sen. Wayne Morse, D-Ore.,
said Johnson is "dead wrong in
resuming the bombing and esca
lating the war" and is 2% years
late in going before the United
Nations. He said he hopes the
U. S. government makes clear
that if the Security Council is
blocked by the Soviet veto it

will call for a special session of
the General Assembly.
Johnson Has Erred
Aiken, in urging that the na
tion shift to a wartime footing
now, said he fears the President
"has erred in taking new steps
which may lead to a cataclysmic
world conflict." Now that the
decision has been made, he said,
"we must spare no effort to
avoid defeat and hold our losses
to a minimum."
But "we should think long and
hard before resorting to nuclear
weapons in Southeast Asia," Ai
ken said.
Mansfield Concurs
His speech brought praise
from Senate Democratic leader
Mike Mansfield of Montana, who
said the Vermonter had "per
formed a public service." Mans
field like Aiken had urged John
son to continue the bombing lull
as long as there was any possi
bility of negotiation.
Senate Republican leader
Everette M. Dirksen of Illinois
said there was no choice but to
resume the bombings since "ev
ery effort to get our nose in the
door around the world to get a
peace feeler from Hanoi" has
failed.
The Senate debate over Viet
nam brought a demand for Mc-
Namara's resignation from Sen.
Norris Cotton, R-N.H., who de
clared it would be worth more
than another 500,000 U. S.
troops in South Vietnam.
Cotton praised Johnson's go
ing to the United Nations, say
fng there should be no unilateral
solution to "the problems we
face in Southeast Asia."
Kennedy Cool
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-
N. Y., said in a statement that
urgent pursuit of social and eco
nomic reform in South Vietnam
is more important than bomb

ing. He welcomed the Presi
dent's U. N. approach but said
bombing "is not a policy," add
ing:
"And we should not delude
ourselves that it offers a pain
less method of winning the war
. . . If we regard bombing as
the answer in Vietnam, we are
headed straight for disaster."
House Republican leader Ger
ald R. Ford of Michigan was

among those who said Johnson
had no other choice but to re
sume the bombings "to protect
the lives of 200,000 American
troops in South Vietnam."
Delay Unthinkable
Rep. Carl Albert of Oklahoma,
the House Democratic leader,
said "any further holdup in the
bombing would have been not
only useless but unthinkable un
der the circumstances."
