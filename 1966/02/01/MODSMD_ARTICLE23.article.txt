## NHL Hockey Too Good; WHL Perfectly Lousy 
### BY BOB THIERIOT 
Major league hockey (i.e. the National Hockey League) is plan
ning expansion, probably next season. Both Los Angeles and San
Francisco have been awarded future franchises which will com
bine with four other cities to complete a Western Division.
Some fans are always clamoring for major league teams. The
West Coast yelled and screamed enough to get major league base
ball, so, of course, when minor league hockey came to the area
some (but not as many as in the case of baseball) demanded that
the NHL expand so as to have major league hockey in California.
I have seen a number of Western Hockey League games in person
and on television, and my opinion is that the NHL can stay away.
It may have a better brand of hockey and many nationally known
stars such as Bobby Hull, but the WHL has its own peculiar brand
of entertainment.
Major league hockey is just like major league basketball in that
the players are just too perfect. College basketball is more capti
vating because most of the players can't bomb consistently from 25
feet. Therefore, they are forced to drive, pass, and set up plays.
In the pros the guards dribble the ball upcourt, pass to a team
mate who puts up a shot from 15-25 feet and 40% of the time scores.
The game is stagnant. In the NHL the players are too good to be
very interesting. I'm not saying that they score too often. The op
posite is true. They do not score often enough. The passing is near
perfect, but the defense is magnificent. And this kind of play be
comes very redundant.
Tymsy, But Fun
The WHL is great fun because it offers the fan imperfect hockey.
The passing is usually atrocious; there are generally a great many
penalties. Players are checked illegally and sent flying or sliding
across the ice regularly. The fan is treated to constant intercep
tions, so when a great pass is made he finds a greater appreciation
for it.
The great play is unusual, rather than predestined, so it is await
ed gleefully, rather than expected. Half the enjoyment of the WHL
game is to watch the player make a fool out of himself, and they
do it, constantly. They miss shots from right in front of the goal;
they fail to score on break aways, but they are very colorful and
interesting. The fan never knows what his favorite team can pos
sibly decide to screw-up next.
The Fight
The ultimate at one of these games is the fight. I have yet to see
a game where there has not been at least one, which causes the
fans to stand and create an uproar. Then there are many penalties;
the penalty box is jammed with a standing room crowd. Then the
teams play with only four men on the ice, which makes for a faster
game, and consequently more errors, which are now more obvious
because there are not enough players to hide the action.
The fight usually begins with two players contesting for the puck
and one of them getting the worse of the deal. He then becomes
irate and takes a swing at his opponent with his stick. His opponent
retaliates with similar action. Then both drop their gloves and
sticks and go at it with fists. But since the footing is not very bene
ficial to boxing they end up hugging each other.
Then the rest of the players gather around casually poking at any
and many of the opponents with sticks, skate points, and gloves.
Eventualiy one of the referees ambles over to break up the fight,
only when he is sure that the crowd has been satisfied. Don't ever
leave to get some popcorn when the game is in process. You just
may miss the fight and it is the ultimate.
The fight causes the crowd to come alive, the players to get very
angry. Under this condition they play more furiously. The greatest
proponent of the fight and the penalty is Los Angeles defenseman
Howie Young. He has constantly led whatever league he has played
in in total penalty minutes. The crowd loves to jeer him, and it roars
with glee when he is cited for committing an infraction of the rules.
Isolationism
The hockey buff may try to rebuke me by saying that true hockey
fans will appreciate the better brand of play and that the attend
ance will reflect it. To begin with there are not very many true
hockey fans in California. The crowds will be attracted at first by
the big name players, but then they will lose some interest because
the Western Division will have no real stars and will lose the play
offs year after year to the Eastern Division. West doesn't like to
lose to East, so the fans will become disenchanted with major league
hockey because their division will not be Grade A (nor will it be as
poor or amusing as the WHLK
My other argument is that the present attendance and enthusiasm
for the San Francisco Seals and the Los Angeles Blades is a reflec
tion of the type of hockey the fans desire. The Blades are perennial
doormats. The Seals always have a struggle in the final two weeks
just to make the playoffs. Twice they have finished fourth in the
standings and won the playoffs. But attendance is very good.
The National Hockey League is having tremendous attendance
even in Boston, whose Bruins are miserable. So, the NHL Is not
hurting for money. The WHL is doing very nicely and does not
need to be usurped. The method of expansion is absurd anyhow.
Creating six new teams means that six teams are going to be greatly
deficient in major league material.
Major league hockey will do nothing for either Los Angeles or
San Francisco, except possibly increase their prestige, which neither
city lacks. LA has smog, Alcindor, and the Dodgers; SF the Cable
Car, the Giants, and the Golden Gate.
Thank you NHL for thinking of us, but I would be greatly
pleased if you stayed on the East Coast where you really want to
be anyway. We are doing well and having a great time without you.
