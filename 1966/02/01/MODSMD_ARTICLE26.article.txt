## Gymnasts Drop Tight Meet 
### HUGH WEST 
Stanford's Varsity gymnasts
engaged in something of a
squabble with Dame Fortune,
could not overcome Sacramento
State's depth with depleted
forces Saturday evening and fell
to the Hornets 107.45—79.95.
If the Indians had moved into
the spacious Pavilion with the
same unit that met Arizona
State two weeks ago they would
have given Sacramento State a
very close meet, having scored
99 points in that initial outing.
But the Tribe found themselves
plagued by the loss of Ted An
stedt and Tom Boyce.
The Hornets were also oper
ating without a top performer
in Steve Pleau, who could have
contributed some 40 points to
the Hornets' nest.
Close Individually
On an individual basis, the
scores turned in by both teams
were almost identical, but Hor

nets swarmed the Pavilion gar
nering points. The busiest one
of all was Larry Topping, whose
48.2 Ail-Around total included
an 8.55 in the free exercise, and
8.4 in the horizontal bar, and
an 8.4 in the parallel bars.
Stanford Captain Bob Cook
collected more than half of the
Indians points with a 40.05 All-
Around total.
This evening at 7:30 p.m. at

the Pavilion the Indians will
host two of the best gymnastics
teams in the country, Brigham
Young and California. The Gold
en Bears are once again national
championship contenders, hav
ing taken 66 meets in a row be
fore this contest. The Berkeley
ites should provide about the
best single-team gymnastics per
formance that can be seen in
this country.
