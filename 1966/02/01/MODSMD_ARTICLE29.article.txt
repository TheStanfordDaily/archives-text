# Tragedy Or Hope?

It was no normal clay, January 31, 1966.
The campus —or at least a significant portion
of it —awoke to the expected but still shocking
news that American bombing of North Vietnam
had resumed. It was reminiscent of another win
ter day, November 22, 1963. The sense of un
reality, the sadness, the feeling of emptiness, and
the frustration were all there. But this time, there
was a difference. The frustration was not with
out solution.
Protest, as an integral part of the American tra
dition, dates back beyond the days of H en r y
David Thoreau. Protest, as a weapon to affect
political change when normal channels seem
hopelessly closed, is a newer device, one that re
ceived its baptism in the civil rights movement.
At Stanford —easy-going, apathetic Stanford —
active protest has been infrequent and ineffect
ive, and has usually been dismissed, with some
justification, as the work of a small, militant mi
nority. At least that was the way it was yes
terday morning. The SCPV, one of the newer of
the campus militancies, called for a general boy
cott of classes in protest of the resumption of
bombing. David Ransom, chairman of the SCPV,
explained that teachers were refusing to teach
because they "did not feel as though they could
continue their classroom work during such an
intolerable situation." We can understand Ml.
Ransom's feelings, but that does not negate the
fact that the boycott emerged more as a strike
against the University —in violation of a reason
able University policy—than as a protest against
the actions of the President of the United States.
The boycott tended to obscure the genuine issue
—President Johnson's implied assertion that kill
ing is the only solution to the human conflict of
ideas —and as such was a failure.
But, in the late afternoon, things took a turn for
the moderate and —in this case —for the better.
With a crowd of 800 packed into 500-seat Cub
berly Auditorium, a few individuals began ar
guing for a torch-light march on Moffett Field.
After a while, saner voices began to speak, argu
ing that a more effective protest, one that would
work toward the desired end, would be a letter
and-telegram campaign directed toward Wash
ington. It was reasoned that writing to Johnson
was no longer of any use, as he seems to have
made up his mind. The object of the letters would
instead be the senators and congressmen of the
United States —especially the members of the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee —in the
hope that public encouragement could lead to
a legislative debate that might head off World
War 111.
We strongly agree with this line of reasoning.
A parade on Moffett Field would get headlines,
but would have a deleterious effect on the public
opinion upon which Washington decision-ma
kers rely so strongly. Moreover, military policy
is made in the White House, and not in Califor
nia.
The result of the Cubberly meeting was last
night's march to the Palo Alto Post Office for a
mass mail-in. This, we feel, was a worthy com
promise—and perhaps the beginning of a prom
ising coalition—between political moderates and
those farther to the left. For if there is to be an
acceptable change in American policy in Viet
nam, it will come about apparently only as the
result of the united outcry of all those who dis
agree with the present state of the war. Many
Congressmen, including Senator Frank Church,
who was on campus last week, have said pri
vately that this public support is the only miss
ing prerequisite for a true debate.
Therefore, we urge all those who feel as we
do, as well as those who just feel fed up, to
write, telegraph, or phone their Congressmen
and Senators, as well as members of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, immediately. The
address: Senate Office Building or House Office
Building, Washington 25, D.C.
Telegram forms will be available in White
Memorial Plaza all day today.
Oil Growing Up
At the risk of being accused of perpetuating
stereotypes, we'd like to make a comparison.
When it was announced during dinner at Wil
bur last night that the bombing of North Vietnam
had been resumed, several dining rooms burst
into applause. Earlier, a sign appeared in the
window of one Wilbur House: "Coffin is a mis
informed, immoral, Communist dupe."
Last night, El Capitan Eating Club had a ra
tional discussion of the situation, and voted, by
a two-to-one margin, to send telegrams to Sen
ators Kuchel and Fulbright urging "Senate de
bate of Vietnam policy."
The difference between a freshman and an
upperclassman is far more than that of a year,
it seems.
