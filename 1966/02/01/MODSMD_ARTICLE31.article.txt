## Cleavage And Projection Become A Fashion Bust 
### Art Bucbwald 
Eugenia Sheppard, the New
York Herald Tribune's fashion
editor, who happens to be my
source of information on what
is happening to women these
days, says that "the whole
naughty business of a peek
down a deep dark crevice be
tween a girl's bosoms is about
as dated as a peek at a girl's
garters which, if any, have been
out in the open for a long time.
Who's to worry about cleavage
when so many other areas are
bare? The sexy new look,
though, is definitely the halter
type dress, bathing suit, or
whatever, cut in towards the
neckline. It leaves the sides wide
open and almost all of the bos
oms in full view under the
arms."
Miss Sheppard reveals that
the latest arrangement ior bos
oms calls for a new bra which,
instead of pushing forward and
projecting, must now flatten
and widen.
I had been so busy worrying
about Vietnam that I didn't
realize what the designers were
up to until I read Miss Shep
pard's article. Otherwise I
would have done something
about it before now.
Cleavaffe
The question once again
arises: who decides in what di
rection the bosom must go?
I have always been a "push
forward and projection" man
myself and I see no good reason
why they should be flattened
and widened, other than to
please a few designers and the
foundation industry.
But I hate to fight a trend,
so I went to a party the other
night and most of the women
were wearing he new fashion.
It was very disconcerting, to say

the least. At the beginning my
eyes wandered towards the
cleavage of the young lady I
was talking to, but pretty soon
I became bored and tried to get
around to the side of her. She
kept turning with me, which
was very annoing, and finally
I said to her:
"How high can you reach?"
She said I can touch the
chandelier."
I challenged her and, sure
enough, the young lady's bos
oms were exactly where Miss
Sheppard said they would be.
Apparently she realized I had
tricked her, because she said,
"How dare you look under my
arms."
"I had to look somewhere," I
protested.
"But that was very unfair."
"Look, I didn't ask you to put
your bosoms under your arms.
If you hadn't worn that dress,
I would have looked at the chan
delier."
'You weren't supposed to no
tice," she said. She put her arms
down to the side.
"I apologize," I said. "Will you
drink to it?"
She raised her glass and
smiled—then she frowned.
"You tricked me again."
"I just don't know where to
look anymore," I said.
"If I thought there were men
like you at this party, I would
never have worn this dress,"
she said.
"You don't have to worry
about me" I assured her. "I can
see either side of the problem."
Just then my wife walked by.
"Shake hands with my wife." I
said.
The young lady raised her
hand and then she cried, "You
did it to me again."
