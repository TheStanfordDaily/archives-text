# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Pay Forfeit, Tuition Refund Asked 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
While a professor's right to
express his political beliefs pub
licly or privately as he sees fit
is not open to debate, I feel
that a professor's right to ex
press his opposition to the
United States' policy in Vietnam
by not attending classes is cer
tainly questionable. In fact, I
would say that they have no
such right. A faculty member's
obligation to the University and
to the students is much the same
as that of employee to employ
er. The University is paying him
for his services with the stu
dents' money. A professor who
refuses to teach as a protest to
Vietnam policy should be treat
ed as any other employee who
refuses to work—he should be
fired. If the Administration is
not willing to fire the faculty
members in question, then it
should give the students a re
fund on their tuition to cover
the classes that were missed and
the striking faculty members
should forfeit a portion of their
salary.
This is not a question of aca
demic freedom but a question of
whether or not students should
have to pay for classes not of
fered and whether or not facul
ty members have the right to
refuse to teach as a means of
political expression.

Editor, The Daily:
I should like to call on all for
eign students to support the
strike called by the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
and any other actions they ini
tiate in protest against the re
sumed bombing of North Viet
nam.
Many foreign students feel
that it is not their business to
interfere in the politics of a
country which is their host. How

ever, by taking on the role of
world policeman (or, rather, pro
tector of the status quo) the
United States has itself pro
claimed that its actions are of
concern to the whole world.
Foreign students' participa
tion is effective because:
1) they swell the numbers of
those protesting,
2) Johnson's "peace offensive"
has shown, in its dispatch of
roving ambassadors the world
over, that he is sensitive to
foreign opinion — it might
even be argued, after the
snub to Congressional opin
ion that resumption of bomb
ing constituted, more sensi
tive to foreign opinion,
3) many of you are here be
cause the United States gov
ernment hopes that you will
return to your countries
with pro-American attitudes
—demonstrate, to help con
vince the government that
they cannot act as they do
in Vietnam and still hope to
favorably influence world
opinion.

Since protest seems to have
become a "camp" pastime in re
cent years, I would like to regis
ter publicly my disappointment
in those professors who felt it
necessary to cancel their class
es yesterday in response to our
government's resumption of
bombing raids in North Viet
nam. This was a selfish act com
mitted by men pursuing per
sonal rather than professional
ends. I certainly do not begrudge
these men their right to express
their dissatisfaction with govern
ment policy and to propose al
ternative courses of action; how
ever, I do feel that professors
have an obligation to their stu

dents as binding as that between
doctor and patient. Few of those
men would or should place edu
cation below medicine as a so
cially valuable commodity; yet,
how many of them would con
done a general strike of doc
tors under similar circumstan
ces? Those immediately affected
by the "strike" were not the of
ficials against whom the pro
tests were directed, but the stu
dents seeking some significant
quantum of truth in their cho
sen course of study. Those of us
who sincerely support our gov
ernment's position were denied a
portion of that truth yesterday.
I suggest that the "strikers" re
evaluate their motives for strik
ing and attempt to reconcile
them with the raisou <r etre of
their profession.

Editor, The Dally:
Amid all the opinions current
ly being heard on campus (and
around the world) concerning
what Christianity is and particu
larly what Christianity should
become, it is perhaps not inap
propriate to attempt the very
difficult task of summarizing
what any profession called
"Christianity" must be. At
tempts to formulate new the
ologies are within the option of
men, but the effort to claim the
name of "Christianity" for theo
logical positions without God,
Christ, or the Bible does vio
lence to semantic honesty.
Christianity exists because a
person, Jesus Christ, lived, died,
and appeared to his followers
after the tomb in which he was
buried was found to be empty.
Without these simple yet pro
found historical events, there
would be no basis for Christiani
ty. If the dead body of Christ
had remained in the tomb, or If
it had been produced by the ear

ly enemies of Christianity, there
would never have been any
Christian church. The Christian
church consists of those indi
viduals who have responded to
the events of Christ's death and
resurrection and to the person
involved in those events. They
have experienced in their own
lives what it means to know
the living: Christ today.
If man's greatest need on the
human level is to overcome his
natural estrangement from him
self and from his fellow men,
the only real and lasting basis
for this achievement is the over
coming of his natural estrange
ment from God. This estrange
ment shows up most clearly in
the placing of self-gratification
in the control center of life,
rather than being willing to be
one through whom God's work
is done in the world. When a
man chooses self-rule, his own
life becomes meaningless and
purposeless, because he cannot
accomplish the goals for which
he was intended as a human be
ing. All of his highest aspira
tions for improving the human
situation turn to disillusionment
and despair. It is through rela
tionship with the Christ of his
tory that this estrangement from
God can be overcome.
The Christian has a vital con
cern for the problems of this
world. He is desperately opposed
to social injustice, man's inhu
manity to man, and any situa
tion that violates the dignity of
a human being. Yet his response
is not one of love for the in
jured and hate for the injuring.
He realizes that the man guilty
of perpetrating injustice is
probably more in need of the
regenerating power of Christian
love than even the one suffering
injustice. His participation in
such causes arises from his own
personal love for Christ and
from his realization that "inas

much as you have done it unto
the least of one of these, my
brethren, you have done it unto
Me." The Christian also knows
that the best thing he can do
for anyone is to make them
alive to the meaning of recon
ciliation with God through
Christ — for if he were success
ful in righting social wrongs
only, without bringing a new
spirit of Christ into the lives of
individual men, the world would
not be really, nor for long, a
better place at all.

I would like to commend Chap
lain Minto and the Berry Fund
for helping bring two such un
conventional and stimuating
men as Dr. Alan Watts and
Rev. William Sloan Coffin to
this campus as Guests-in-Resi
dence.
The Dean's Office has long
been convinced of the value of
the various guest-in-residence
programs. It is heartening to
see that other sources of finan
cial assistance arc now voting
with dollars for these student
run programs, which have
(along with the Tresidder Un
ion Divisions and the Interna
tional Club) grown in the past
year or two into a force that
is bringing this campus to its

bombing raids in North Viet

Amid all the opinions current
ly being heard on campus (and
around the world) concerning
what Christianity is and particu
larly what Christianity should
become, it is perhaps not inap
propriate to attempt the very
difficult task of summarizing
what any profession called
"Christianity" must be. At
tempts to formulate new the
ologies are within the option of
men, but the effort to claim the
name of "Christianity" for theo
logical positions without God,
Christ, or the Bible does vio
lence to semantic honesty.
Christianity exists because a
person, Jesus Christ, lived, died,
and appeared to his followers
after the tomb in which he was
buried was found to be empty.
Without these simple yet pro
found historical events, there
would be no basis for Christiani
ty. If the dead body of Christ
had remained in the tomb, or If
it had been produced by the ear

ly enemies of Christianity, there
would never have been any
Christian church. The Christian
church consists of those indi
viduals who have responded to
the events of Christ's death and
resurrection and to the person
involved in those events. They
have experienced in their own
lives what it means to know
the living: Christ today.
If man's greatest need on the
human level is to overcome his
natural estrangement from him
self and from his fellow men,
the only real and lasting basis
for this achievement is the over
coming of his natural estrange
ment from God. This estrange
ment shows up most clearly in
the placing of self-gratification
in the control center of life,
rather than being willing to be
one through whom God's work
is done in the world. When a
man chooses self-rule, his own
life becomes meaningless and
purposeless, because he cannot
accomplish the goals for which
he was intended as a human be
ing. All of his highest aspira
tions for improving the human
situation turn to disillusionment
and despair. It is through rela
tionship with the Christ of his
tory that this estrangement from
God can be overcome.
The Christian has a vital con
cern for the problems of this
world. He is desperately opposed
to social injustice, man's inhu
manity to man, and any situa
tion that violates the dignity of
a human being. Yet his response
is not one of love for the in
jured and hate for the injuring.
He realizes that the man guilty
of perpetrating injustice is
probably more in need of the
regenerating power of Christian
love than even the one suffering
injustice. His participation in
such causes arises from his own
personal love for Christ and
from his realization that "inas

much as you have done it unto
the least of one of these, my
brethren, you have done it unto
Me." The Christian also knows
that the best thing he can do
for anyone is to make them
alive to the meaning of recon
ciliation with God through
Christ — for if he were success
ful in righting social wrongs
only, without bringing a new
spirit of Christ into the lives of
individual men, the world would
not be really, nor for long, a
better place at all.

bombing raids in North Viet

Amid all the opinions current
ly being heard on campus (and
around the world) concerning
what Christianity is and particu
larly what Christianity should
become, it is perhaps not inap
propriate to attempt the very
difficult task of summarizing
what any profession called
"Christianity" must be. At
tempts to formulate new the
ologies are within the option of
men, but the effort to claim the
name of "Christianity" for theo
logical positions without God,
Christ, or the Bible does vio
lence to semantic honesty.
Christianity exists because a
person, Jesus Christ, lived, died,
and appeared to his followers
after the tomb in which he was
buried was found to be empty.
Without these simple yet pro
found historical events, there
would be no basis for Christiani
ty. If the dead body of Christ
had remained in the tomb, or If
it had been produced by the ear

ly enemies of Christianity, there
would never have been any
Christian church. The Christian
church consists of those indi
viduals who have responded to
the events of Christ's death and
resurrection and to the person
involved in those events. They
have experienced in their own
lives what it means to know
the living: Christ today.
If man's greatest need on the
human level is to overcome his
natural estrangement from him
self and from his fellow men,
the only real and lasting basis
for this achievement is the over
coming of his natural estrange
ment from God. This estrange
ment shows up most clearly in
the placing of self-gratification
in the control center of life,
rather than being willing to be
one through whom God's work
is done in the world. When a
man chooses self-rule, his own
life becomes meaningless and
purposeless, because he cannot
accomplish the goals for which
he was intended as a human be
ing. All of his highest aspira
tions for improving the human
situation turn to disillusionment
and despair. It is through rela
tionship with the Christ of his
tory that this estrangement from
God can be overcome.
The Christian has a vital con
cern for the problems of this
world. He is desperately opposed
to social injustice, man's inhu
manity to man, and any situa
tion that violates the dignity of
a human being. Yet his response
is not one of love for the in
jured and hate for the injuring.
He realizes that the man guilty
of perpetrating injustice is
probably more in need of the
regenerating power of Christian
love than even the one suffering
injustice. His participation in
such causes arises from his own
personal love for Christ and
from his realization that "inas

much as you have done it unto

I would like to commend Chap

for helping bring two such un
conventional and stimuating
men as Dr. Alan Watts and
Rev. William Sloan Coffin to
this campus as Guests-in-Resi

The Dean's Office has long
been convinced of the value of
the various guest-in-residence
programs. It is heartening to
see that other sources of finan
cial assistance arc now voting
with dollars for these student
run programs, which have
(along with the Tresidder Un

year or two into a force that
is bringing this campus to its

While a professor's right to
express his political beliefs pub
licly or privately as he sees fit
is not open to debate, I feel
that a professor's right to ex
press his opposition to the
United States' policy in Vietnam
by not attending classes is cer
tainly questionable. In fact, I
would say that they have no
such right. A faculty member's
obligation to the University and
to the students is much the same
as that of employee to employ
er. The University is paying him
for his services with the stu
dents' money. A professor who
refuses to teach as a protest to
Vietnam policy should be treat
ed as any other employee who
refuses to work—he should be
fired. If the Administration is
not willing to fire the faculty
members in question, then it
should give the students a re
fund on their tuition to cover
the classes that were missed and
the striking faculty members
should forfeit a portion of their
salary.
This is not a question of aca
demic freedom but a question of
whether or not students should
have to pay for classes not of
fered and whether or not facul
ty members have the right to
refuse to teach as a means of
political expression.

I should like to call on all for
eign students to support the
strike called by the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
and any other actions they ini
tiate in protest against the re
sumed bombing of North Viet
nam.
Many foreign students feel
that it is not their business to
interfere in the politics of a
country which is their host. How

ever, by taking on the role of
world policeman (or, rather, pro
tector of the status quo) the
United States has itself pro
claimed that its actions are of
concern to the whole world.
Foreign students' participa
tion is effective because:
1) they swell the numbers of
those protesting,
2) Johnson's "peace offensive"
has shown, in its dispatch of
roving ambassadors the world
over, that he is sensitive to
foreign opinion — it might
even be argued, after the
snub to Congressional opin
ion that resumption of bomb
ing constituted, more sensi
tive to foreign opinion,
3) many of you are here be
cause the United States gov
ernment hopes that you will
return to your countries
with pro-American attitudes
—demonstrate, to help con
vince the government that
they cannot act as they do
in Vietnam and still hope to

Since protest seems to have
become a "camp" pastime in re
cent years, I would like to regis
ter publicly my disappointment
in those professors who felt it
necessary to cancel their class
es yesterday in response to our
government's resumption of
bombing raids in North Viet
nam. This was a selfish act com
mitted by men pursuing per
sonal rather than professional
ends. I certainly do not begrudge
these men their right to express
their dissatisfaction with govern
ment policy and to propose al
ternative courses of action; how
ever, I do feel that professors
have an obligation to their stu

dents as binding as that between
doctor and patient. Few of those
men would or should place edu
cation below medicine as a so
cially valuable commodity; yet,
how many of them would con
done a general strike of doc
tors under similar circumstan
ces? Those immediately affected
by the "strike" were not the of
ficials against whom the pro
tests were directed, but the stu
dents seeking some significant
quantum of truth in their cho
sen course of study. Those of us
who sincerely support our gov
ernment's position were denied a
portion of that truth yesterday.
I suggest that the "strikers" re
evaluate their motives for strik
ing and attempt to reconcile
them with the raisou <r etre of

Editor, The Dally:
Amid all the opinions current
ly being heard on campus (and
around the world) concerning
what Christianity is and particu
larly what Christianity should
become, it is perhaps not inap
propriate to attempt the very
difficult task of summarizing
what any profession called
"Christianity" must be. At
tempts to formulate new the
ologies are within the option of
men, but the effort to claim the
name of "Christianity" for theo
logical positions without God,
Christ, or the Bible does vio
lence to semantic honesty.
Christianity exists because a
person, Jesus Christ, lived, died,
and appeared to his followers
after the tomb in which he was
buried was found to be empty.
Without these simple yet pro
found historical events, there
would be no basis for Christiani
ty. If the dead body of Christ
had remained in the tomb, or If
it had been produced by the ear

ly enemies of Christianity, there
would never have been any
Christian church. The Christian
church consists of those indi
viduals who have responded to
the events of Christ's death and
resurrection and to the person
involved in those events. They
have experienced in their own
lives what it means to know
the living: Christ today.
If man's greatest need on the
human level is to overcome his
natural estrangement from him
self and from his fellow men,
the only real and lasting basis
for this achievement is the over
coming of his natural estrange
ment from God. This estrange
ment shows up most clearly in
the placing of self-gratification
in the control center of life,
rather than being willing to be
one through whom God's work
is done in the world. When a
man chooses self-rule, his own
life becomes meaningless and
purposeless, because he cannot
accomplish the goals for which
he was intended as a human be
ing. All of his highest aspira
tions for improving the human
situation turn to disillusionment
and despair. It is through rela
tionship with the Christ of his
tory that this estrangement from
God can be overcome.
