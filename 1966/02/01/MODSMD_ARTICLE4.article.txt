# Some Profs Cancel Classes To Protest
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
Faculty opinions expressed yester
day concerning the resumption of
bombings in North Vietnam varied
widely, but according to a university
spokesman not more than half a dozen
teachers cancelled classes.
And most of those who did not hold
classes will make them up, said Ken
Mills, graduate student and teaching
assistant in philosophy.
Mills, speaking at a noon rally in
White Plaza, added "The regulations
are to see that the kids get classes.
The kids will be taught anyway. We
intend to make up all classes."
But most of the 31 other professors,
instructors, and teaching assistants,
speaking at the rally did not agree
that the proper way to protest the re
newal of bombing was to call off class
es.
Guerard Comments
The response of Albert Guerard, co
director of the Freshman English
program, was typical of the majority
of those speaking.
He stated that "It is not proper to
cancel classes; that is more a protest
against the University than against
the bombings. But in every other re
spect, I endorse what has been said
here today."
Avram Goldstein, professor of
pharmacology, noted that "The ques
tion of classes or no classes is trivial.
This rally is an impressive sight, and
we should convey this feeling to the
community and to Washington."
Alfred Appel, the other co-director
of Freshman English, suggested that
if his students in a seminar on the
grotesque in art and literature were
not content to take the afternoon off.
they might look at pictures of napalm
bombing and consider it lab time.
University rules, adopted in 1961

after faculty consultation, permit
campus demonstrations provided they
"do not interfere with classes, sched
uled meetings or with other educa
tional processes of the University."
Professor Ernest R. Hilgard, chair
man of the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council, agreed with
Guerard on the impropriety of cancel
ling classes.
"The general position I would take
as a member of the executive commit
tee is that for a member of the fac
ulty to use his platform as a teacher
for political purposes is a violation
of his academic duty," said Hilgard.
"I think that most of the members
of the faculty agree with me on this,"
he continued, "but I'm inclined to be
lieve that the strike today was on such
a small scale that no action will be
necessary.
"However, if it continues, we would
probably have to call a meeting of
the faculty to discuss the problem,"
Hilgard concluded.
Opposed To Strike
Speaking against the strike, Gordon
Craig, Professor of history, said "I'm
unhappy that there is a renewal of
the bombing. However, I feel certain
that this is due to the fact that the
President sees no possibility that addi
tional delay will further peace nego
tiations."
Commenting on this morning's class
protest, Craig said "I think that the
idea of a strike is sentimentality of
the worst kind."
"I think I'm as concerned as the
next person about Vietnam," contin
ued Craig, "but I'm here primarily to
teach the students. I think that there
are plenty of opportunities for stu
dents and faculty to discuss the war,
but classes should go on. At nine
o'clock in the morning when I'm sup
posed to lecture, I Intend to lecture."
