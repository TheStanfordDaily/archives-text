# Day Of Protest Explodes With Strike, March, Rally
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Managing Editor 
With startling swiftness a vigorous
and widespread protest m o v e m e nt
emerged here yesterday in reaction to
the resumption of United S t a t e s'
bombings of North Vietnam.
The protest included a march last
night of 800 persons, the largest In
Stanford history, to a rally at the Palo
Alto Post Office. At two mass meet
ings during the day faculty speakers,
before crowds of more than 700 in
White Memorial Plaza and some 800
in Cubberly Auditorium, denounced
the decision to resume bombing and
called for protests.
The noon meeting in White Memo
rial Plaza was announced in leaflets
distributed by the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam (SCVP) yes
terday morning. These leaflets urged
faculty and students to boycott their
classes and said 20 professors had
agreed in early-morning phone calls
to cancel their classes.
Not Common Times
"These are not common times," the
leaflet said, "We cannot go on with
common business. Therefore we refuse
to continue in the daily affairs of the
university."
It appeared last night, however, that
no more than a few professors had ac
tually cancelled classes. Such action
would violate official University pol
icy, which prohibits demonstrations on
campus that interfere with classes.
Yet 32 professors and teaching as
sistants did verbally announce their
support for the protest movement at
the noon rally. According to one
source, more than 50 faculty members

have endorsed its position.
Kenneth Mills, a philosophy teach
ing assistant and a member of the
SCPV steering committee, explained
yesterday that its purpose, and the
purpose of the strike, was to "m a k e
the University realize what was hap
pening.
Although he could "not predict what
would come next, he said the protests
were intended "to bring pressure to
bear on Jresident Johnson."
The protest yesterday seemed to
gain strength as the day progressed.
At the noon rally the crowd was
grim-faced and attentive. Heckling
that had characterized earlier SCPV
protests was absent, and they general
ly applauded the speakers' remarks.
At that time, the speakers discussed
the urgency of the situation.
"The time has now come when the
individual should publicly address the
administration," said Rev. William
Sloane Coffin, Yale University chap
lain and Wilbur Hall guest-in-resident.
Another speaker, Stanford history
professor Barton Bernstein, asserted
"one had to go on record." He added,
"Before getting involved in a war with
China, I must draw the line."
At the Cubberly meeting, where
some students stood in the lobby for
most of the two-hour session, the as
sembly voted almost unanimously to
march into Palo Alto to protest. This
decision was reached after several
students had objected to stronger pro
posals such as demonstrations at Mof
fit Field Airport.
It was reported last night that 211
telegrams and 107 post cards, which
were available at the meeting, were

sent to representatives, particularly to
members of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee.
Forcing China to Act
Also, a total of more than $500 was
reportedly collected b SCPV and
Americans for the Reappraisal of Far-
Easterti Policy (ARFEP), another
group opposed to the resumption of
bombings.
At the afternoon rally, Mark Man
call, a Stanford history professor,
acknowledged the "awareness that we
are facing a crisis" in the crowd.
Citing his overall pessimism, he
said, "We are on the verge of taking
certain actions which will force the
Chinese to take actions, which might
well lead to a direct conflict."
Parade Without Incident
The "torch-light" parade to Palo
Alto last night was orderly and with
out incident, but in numbers of march
ers it was significant. Similar SCPV
parades have attracted at most 300
participants previously.
At the post office, Professor Etzioni
and Rev. William Sloane Coffin, Jr.
addressed the protestors from atop a
12-foot ladder.
Repeating many of the same re
marks he made earlier fn the evening
at Cubberly, Coffin told the crowd the
American rationalization for the war
was "simplistic and an insult to intel
ligence."
In another development last night,
ASSU President Sandy MacKenzie an
nounced he was organizing students
to visit the living groups at dinner
tonight to urge the sending of tele
grams to members of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee. Mackenzie
will speak at a noon rally in White
Memorial Plaza today.
Student Reaction Varied
Student reaction to the protest
ranged from strong support to indif
ference. The vast majority of the stu
dent body made no outward expres
sion of their feelings, although most
demonstrations were against the re
sumption of bombings.
One group of six or eight students,
all from the same fraternity, did burn
an effigy of North Vietnamese Pre
mier Ho Chi Minh last night in White
Memorial Plaza.
"I have always been against the war
in Vietnam," said one co-ed, "but I
have been lazy before. Now I want to
protest against my own apathy. I
joined the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam today because of
the renewed bombing and because of
Rev. Coffin's sermon (Sunday in Me
morial Church.)"
The SCPV plans rallies at noon in
White Memorial Plaza each day this
week, Dave Ransom, its chairman
said yesterday.
