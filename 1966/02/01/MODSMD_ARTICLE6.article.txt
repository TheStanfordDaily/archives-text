# Coffin Denounces LBJ For Vietnam Thinking
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
.Reverend William S. Coffin blasted
President Johnson in an address in
Cubberly Auditorium last night for
"knotting the dove and putting his
money on the hawk" with the resump
tion of bombing in North Vietnam.
Speaking in conjunction with the
Political Union's Focus series and
the Americans for a Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy (ARFEP), Coffin
said America must recognize that
"we should never have been in Viet
nam in th e first place, and try to
negotiate our way out. Our errors are
not self-corrective."
Resumption of bombing "has shut
the door to negotiations, if indeed we
ever opened it." Coffin called the
American refusal to negotiate with
the Viet Cong tantamount to demand
ing that they "accept a defeat which
they have not suffered."
Cruel Chess Board
Coffin lashed out at present think
ing in the State and Defense Depart
ments as "an abstract, therefore,
cruel view of a chess board on which
you can move people around." Guided
by "crack-pot reality which is imprac
tical immorality," Administration
strategists have abstracted them
selves from the moral issues in the
Vietnam situation.
"Rusk cannot see Chinese without
seeing red—ln both senses of the
word," Coffin said. He scored the
Secretary of State for his failure to
delineate the nationalist issue in the
Vietnamese war.
The Yale Chaplain told the audience
the only reason for U.S. presence in
Vietnam was fear of China. However
he noted that escalation of the war
was driving the North Vietnamese
into the hands of the Chinese. "Ameri
can policy is self-defeating," he said.

Reviewing the post-war history of
the country, Coffin asserted that U.S.
refusal to abide by the Geneva Agree
ments in 1956 came out of fear that
a coalition government would be dom
inated by Ho Chi Minh and eventually
go Communist. By not capitalizing
on the nationalistic elements of a
coalition in a united Vietnam, the
U.S. eliminated the possibility of a
"Tito-like bastion against interna
tional Communism in Southeast
Asia."
"What is important is not that
South Vietnam be non-Communist
but that Vietnam be united and inde
pendent," he said.
Coffin called Johnson's attempt to
turn the Vietnam problem over to
the United Nation "the worst insult."
By bringing the issue before the
Security Council, the United States
has forced Russia to rigidify her posi
tion behind the North.
Turning to the moral issues of war,
Coffin said the thinking of most
Americans "has been motivated by
fear of the truth rather than love of
the truth." He called for a morality
of candor.
The Highest Priority
"The main job of current protests
is to make the war in Vietnam an
item of the highest priority in the
minds of the American public," Cof
fin noted. Only by such action, he
maintained, would the Congress be
forced to give prime attention to the
war. He accused many Congressmen
of skirting the unpopular war issue
because their constituencies were un«
concerned.
He called for the churches and
synagogues to speak out on the moral
issues in the war regardless of pop
ular feelings. "Not until thoy put
themselves in jeopardy, do their
words become credible," the Chaplain
said.
