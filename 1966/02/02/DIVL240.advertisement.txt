Offer To Teach
I have met the usual skepticism
and doubts that have always
plagued scientists who discovered
and developed new and true con
ceptions of nature's phenomer^s.
As people could not visualize
how an internal combustion en
gine could be made, or how man
could fly, how radios, telephones
and televisions could be made,
people now seem unable to see
how magnetism can be made to
insulate mass against the effects
of gravity.
I can see how, and I can predict
that magnetism and gravity will
present the world with its greatest
source of power in the time to
come.
My discoveries are in nuclear
physics, astronomy, general phys
ics, meteorology, and art. If some
thing should happen to me and if
I were the only person to know
about these discoveries, it might
be 10,000 years before someone
else comes along to re-discover
them.
It is imperative that more
people be made aware of my
theories. I propose to conduct
classes FREE to members of the
faculty, graduate students and
undergrads. I propose that the uni
versity provide the class room.
Class No. 1 Would Be:
Astronomy. In this class I will
show how the planets were cre
ated. I will explain magnestron
omy, "the science of magnetic ef
fects upon celestial mechanics." I
will explain how gravity works.
I'll dispute abstract humbug such
as Einstein who failed to note
what effects a person would ex
perience if he were to travel as
fast as light.
If you were to travel as fast as
light you would notice two things:
you would note that objects in
front of you would be twice as
bright; and if you turned around
and looked behind you, there
would only be darkness because
the light would not be catching
up. Only if you looked to the sides
of your path would objects appear
normal. I urge the professors of
the Physics and Astronomy De
partments to bring these classes
into being. They will be able to
understand their subjects and
teach them better.
The class on general physics will
explain how and why the density
in mass is not the agent causing
its weight. It will show how to
insulate mass from the effects of
gravity.
From this will come weightless
trains carrying freight and pass
engers, with one off shot "perpet
ual motion", then eventually true
space ships utilizing an anti-grav
ity technique.
The class on art will be a two
hour demonstration on the crea
tion of art "painting" in which I
will paint a beautiful 24 x 36 paint
ing of scenery. I'll explain the way
to do it in such a way that a stu
dent will learn more about how to
paint than he would get from four
years of college art majoring.
The knowledge you possess is
in the books you learned from,
and that sums up the total of your
knowledge. That's your doctorate.
Some of us our creator inspires
from nature itself. This finds its
way into curriculum over obstac
les eventually.
