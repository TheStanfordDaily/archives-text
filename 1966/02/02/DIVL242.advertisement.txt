Noah's Boat
Somewhere around five thousand years ago an old man named Noah
began to build a boat, an ark, a great big ship. With three sons his ship
building firm worked perhaps a hundred years to build a vessel measuring
something like 450 feet long, 75 feet in beam, with three large decks, a roof
on top, and a massive door. Today, as then, such nonsense as an ark by
Noah is dismissed as madness or the ultimate in folly.
We know little about the ancient world before the flood of Noah. Quite
possibly that world of old had several billion persons and extensive civiliza
tions with art and science not unlike our own. No one took seriously the work
of Noah, nor the persistent Word of God broadcast to a doomed and lost race
warning of the flood to come. And the rains came!
Noah had an inner secret in his life. He knew God personally. So does
every Christian today. Noah's God is our God, the unchanging and eternal
holy God of the Bible. To know God personally is to be clued in on life, to
understand the secrets of the universe. The inside dope that Noah had from
God brought a life of faith and deep commitment which saved his life and
condemned an unbelieving ancient world.
The New Testament says of this man Noah, "Without faith it is impos
sible to please God. For whoever would come to God must believe that He
exists and that He rewards those who seek Him. By faith Noah, being warned
by God concerning the events yet unseen, took heed and constructed an ark
for the saving of his household; by this he condemned the world and became
heir of the righteousness which comes by faith" (Hebrews 1 1:6-7).
Perhaps you've been kidding yourself about your relationship to God.
Like lots of folks today you hope for a bright future and an end of war. But
the flood of Noah came when it was too late for those who had "forgotten"
God. To know God personally is to receive Him into your life and heart as
Lord and Master and to walk daily with Him as His child. John's Gospel says
of Jesus Christ, "To all who received Him, who believed in His name, He
the power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the
will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."
Jesus Christ, God's Ark of Refuge, His Ship of Safety from the storms of
life is the one who said, "He who comes to me I will in no way cast out."
Have you come to Jesus Christ? What are you waiting for? Why sink?

Noah's Boat
Somewhere around five thousand years ago an old man named Noah
began to build a boat, an ark, a great big ship. With three sons his ship
building firm worked perhaps a hundred years to build a vessel measuring
something like 450 feet long, 75 feet in beam, with three large decks, a roof
on top, and a massive door. Today, as then, such nonsense as an ark by
Noah is dismissed as madness or the ultimate in folly.
We know little about the ancient world before the flood of Noah. Quite
possibly that world of old had several billion persons and extensive civiliza
tions with art and science not unlike our own. No one took seriously the work
of Noah, nor the persistent Word of God broadcast to a doomed and lost race
warning of the flood to come. And the rains came!
Noah had an inner secret in his life. He knew God personally. So does
every Christian today. Noah's God is our God, the unchanging and eternal
holy God of the Bible. To know God personally is to be clued in on life, to
understand the secrets of the universe. The inside dope that Noah had from
God brought a life of faith and deep commitment which saved his life and
condemned an unbelieving ancient world.
The New Testament says of this man Noah, "Without faith it is impos
sible to please God. For whoever would come to God must believe that He
exists and that He rewards those who seek Him. By faith Noah, being warned
by God concerning the events yet unseen, took heed and constructed an ark
for the saving of his household; by this he condemned the world and became
heir of the righteousness which comes by faith" (Hebrews 1 1:6-7).
Perhaps you've been kidding yourself about your relationship to God.
Like lots of folks today you hope for a bright future and an end of war. But
the flood of Noah came when it was too late for those who had "forgotten"
God. To know God personally is to receive Him into your life and heart as
Lord and Master and to walk daily with Him as His child. John's Gospel says
of Jesus Christ, "To all who received Him, who believed in His name, He
the power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the
will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."
Jesus Christ, God's Ark of Refuge, His Ship of Safety from the storms of
life is the one who said, "He who comes to me I will in no way cast out."
Have you come to Jesus Christ? What are you waiting for? Why sink?
