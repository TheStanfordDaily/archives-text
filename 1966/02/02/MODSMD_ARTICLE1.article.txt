MOSCOW — The Soviet-Chinese
quarrel reached a new level of harsh
ness yesterday. An anti-Kremlin blast
came from Peking and there was
word in Moscow that Soviet leaders
are preparing their nation for a pos
sible formal split in the world Com
munist movement.
The Peking People's Daily, in a
broadcast article, accused Soviet
leaders of helping the United States
to contain Red China through a series
of actions in Asia.
Communist sources in Moscow said
that for the last two weeks a long
Kremlin letter against China has been
circulated to Communist party
groups, preparing them for a decision
that reconciliation with Peking is
impossible. A showdown, these in
formants said, could come at the
Communist party congress in Moscow
starting March 29.
