# SECC Unity Movement Begun
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
To unify the sporadic ecumen
ical efforts and to serve as a ve
hicle for coordinating student
initiative in religious affairs, the
Stanford Ecumenical Coordina
ting Committee has been found
ed.
Responding to the increased
united religious work of the de
nominational ministers and to
the interest in religious affairs
generated last quarter, a group
of representatives from the de
nominations formed the organi
zation as a hostel held Friday
and Saturday.
Committees have been appoint
ed and work will begin this week
in the fields of social action;
and lectures, discussions, and
study groups; and a project to
establish a coffee house.
Stanford has been without an
interfaith group this year be
cause of the death last spring
of the two previous organiza
tions, the Committee on Reli
gious Affairs and the Stanford
Christian Council.
Student Initiated
"Rather than breathing life
into old structures, it was
thought best to begin again at
a common point of interest and
concern," UCCM minister Rich
ard Roe explained yesterday.
"The old groups were staff
initiated. It was felt last spring
that a more viable and vital
program could be developed by
letting students create an or
ganization that they felt would
be most appropriate and useful
out of their own experience. It
was felt that the decision should
come out of the students' own
concerns and ideas," he said.
Dennis Rothhaar, UCCM stu
dent chairman and one of the
chief organizers of the new
group, cites increased coopera
tion among the ministers and
the activities of the ASSU reli
gion committee as providing the
impetus for the formation of
the new group.
Ministers Aid Chaplain
"With the naming of the min
isters this fall as chaplain's as
sociates, the united ministry to
the campus has reached an un
precedented level," Rothhaar
said. "The formation of this
group is an effort to duplicate
on the student level the high

level of cooperative work among
the ministers."
"The activities of the Associ
ated Students religion commit
tee, the high-level consideration
of freedom of worship, and the
hint that the Memorial Church
staff may be expanded soon to
include a Dean of the Chapelâ€”
all these have made this a cru
cial time for solidifying religious
activities at Stanford," he said.
"We recognized at the hostel
that we have a lot in common
and, as is true with the Ecumeni
cal Movement, that there is no
sense in acting divided."
Channels Interfaith Energy
"The Ecumenical Coordinating
Committee will absorb some
committees to eliminate duplica
tion and will create some to re
spond to suggestions of new
areas of concern. It will be open
to groups for their cooperation
as they see fit; rather than be
ing coercive, it will serve as the
vehicle for channelling energies
best used through an interfaith
structure," Rothhaar, a member
of President Sterling's religion
committee, stated.
Lecture Series Continues
Harry Parker of Canterbury
is organizing lectures, discus
sions and study groups. "Ours
will be a common effort to com
bine the sporadic and disjointed
efforts of the past." The group
will begin plans immediately on
the ecumenical lecture series for
next quarter.
In addition, Parker's group
will attempt to coordinate Bible
study groups and to re-activate
dorm - centered discussion
groups.
The Coffee House Project, un
der the chairmanship of Norma
Graham, would provide "an in
formal, casual setting in which
there can be an exploration and
articulation of contemporary
experience and the vital issues
of our time," as was stated last

spring in a proposal by UCCM
minister Jim Corson and As
sistant Chaplain Ken Sulston. A
meeting was held this fall to or
ganize the project, but was un
successful because of the "un
defined structure of religion at
Stanford at that time," Roth
haar said.
Link Christian, Academic Life
The Coffee House would fea
ture art exhibits, folk singing,
jazz, poetry readings, etc. in an
effort to solve the problem of
"limited communication be
tween the so-called 'committed'
Christian community and the
whole."
In addition to the three areas

already delineated, the Commit
tee will probably conduct an ex
pansion study to determine how
other colleges have created
united religious programs and
their applicability to Stanford.
"There seems to be agreement
already that a Church House is
a necessity as a place out of
which to run the program,"
Rothhaar said.
"The Committee will not
serve as a group of representa
tives of religious groups but
will rather try to further coop
eration between all people ap
proaching life with a religious
commitment," Rothhaar con
cluded.
