# CRAPPLERS SEEK NO. 2
## Cards Face San Jose 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Riding high after last week's
34-3 munching of Santa Clara,
Stanford's varsity matmen look
forward to a tough three game
schedule this week. The grap
plers face San Jose State to
night at 8:00 in the Pavilion.
Stanford's promising freshman
squad host San Jose's frosh and
JV squads at 6:30.
Stanford should have a slight
edge over the Spartans on the
basis of performance in the
Northern California Open Tour
nament last December. The In
dians took third in the field of
13 teams, while San Jose placed
fifth some 30 points behind the
Cards.
San Jose's toughest man will
be Loren Miller at 160 pounds.
Miller reached the second round
in the NCAA tournament last
year.
Miller Steam
Miller will have to tangle
with Stanford co-captain Steve
Schaum. Schaum, conference
silver medalist in 1965, won his
division in the Nor Cal tourney.

Ron Matheson will probably be
San Jose's ace in the hold. Mathe
son, wrestling at 137 pounds, will
take on Tom Rajala. Rajala, who
has had tough breaks in his last
two matches, will be looking to
break his jinx against a tough
opponent.
Stanford coach Bill Leland
has what he considers his strong
est dual meet lineup to throw
against the Spartans.
At 123, John Hazelton will hit
the mats with San Jose's light
man, Dennis Runyon. Hazelton
pinned his man in the Santa
Clara meet last week.
No Salva Silva
Steve Boyan will tie into Joe
Silva, the Spartan's 130 punder.
Boyan has beaten Silva before,
and is interested in making a
habit of it.

Marshall Ott has moved down
to the 145 pound level, where
he will pit strength with San
Jose's John Wallbrink.
Doug Gunesch will handle
Gary Scardina at 152 pounds.
Gunesch pinned his Bronco op
ponent last week.
Frank Pratt, who broke hi s
Bronco last week after a near
spill, should take 167 pound Mike
Herschfelt of San Jose well in
hand.
Indian co-captain Mike Davi
son will wrestle a tough man in
San Jose's Paul Hatling. The
Stanford 177 pounder stuck his
Santa Clara adversary early in
the second round in his most re
cent outing.
Rick Lindsley will have a
hard unlimited division match
against Spartan Rich Popejoy.


MIKE WALL leaps away from
the starting- blocks with his new
innovation, the liigh-rise start.
He won the 300-yard and 400-
yard freestyle events in last Sat
urday's meet against Santa Cla
ra Swim Club.
