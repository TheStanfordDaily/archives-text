# Ski Squad Travels North, Takes Fifth In First Meet
## 
### 
The Stanford Ski Team jour
neyed north last weekend to
Bend, Oregon to compete in the
University of Oregon Invitation
al. It was the first team meet of
the season for Stanford.

Entering only two of the three
scheduled events, Stanford still
placed fifth in a field of thirteen
schools.
Sierra College swept the meet
with a total of 98.37 percentage
points, followed by the Univer
sity of Oregon, Pacific Lutheran,
College of the Siskiyous, and
Stanford.
Near blizzard conditions ham
pered the competitors in the al
pine events. In the slalom, Dana
More and Steve Anderson placed
fourteenth and fifteenth respec
tively for Stanford, despite falls
on both runs. Colin Mathews also
finished in the points for the In
dians. In the downhill, which had
to be shortened after ID competi
tors were injured in the trials,
Dick Drace, More, and Anderson
all placed high on the list of fin
ishers. Alan Rubenstein left the
course at a high speed and re
ceived severe cuts on his face.
Stanford's lone entry in the
women's division, Charlotte Far
ber, raced very well under the
adverse conditions and placed in
the top ten, although the event
did not contribute to the team
totals.
The Ski Team will face Sierra
College and other California
Schools this weekend in the
Northern California Invitational,
in which the Indians will enter
four events and thus hope to be
in contention for a win.
The team's good showing in
Bend bodes will for a successful
season.
