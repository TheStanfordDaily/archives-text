# Grad Fees Up, Time Allowed Down?
## 
### JAN WELLS 
An increase in graduate "terminal registration"
fees accompanied by a decrease in Ph.D. resi
dence requirements might soon be adopted.
Dean of Graduate Division Virgil K. Whitaker
suggested at a meeting of department chairmen
last week that terminal registration fees be in
creased from $40 per quarter of dissertation
work to $200 per quarter. At the same time,
Ph.D. candidates would pay tu : tion for a mini
mum of two, rather than three, years of univer
sity residence.
The present $40 fee for binding dissertations
would be eliminated and Ph.D. candidacy would
expire seven years after admission to graduate
school, whether or not the student had completed
the degree requirements. The seven year limit,
however, could be extended upon petition of the
student's department.
Encourages Proficiency
The Dean's proposal, if adopted, would benefit
the student with the maximum efficiency and en
courage slower workers to complete their dis
sertations more quickly. At present, it is neces
sary for a student who completes his course re

quirements in two years and the dissertation in
another year to pay $4765, while under the new
system he would pay $3750. On the other hand,
if the student spent five years on his disserta
tion, he might pay over $6000. The Dean hopes
that few students would have to do this as the
purpose is to speed up the process.
There are two major reasons for the suggested
change. It would be fairer to the efficient stu
dent, who now pays proportionately more for
time spent on his dissertation. According to Dean
Whitaker, the student "may cost the university
more during work on his dissertation than at any
other time, especially when library costs repre
sent a major portion of the costs." A fairly
lengthy letter from a professor to a student
working on his dissertation away from the uni
versity costs $20 or more. Furthermore, a slow
student is more likely to need advising and re
peated reading of the dissertation, all of which
add to the expense of slow dissertations.
A letter from 33 graduate students which ap
peared in last Friday's Daily stated that "the
trend which has sacrificed the life of the in

tellect to administrative convenience must be
stopped. ... It is distressing that such a plan
should come from . . . Prqfessor Whitaker, but
it is not altogether surprising since administra
tors all over the country are finding themselves
forced to yield to . . . pressures . . ."
Won't Yield
Dean Whitaker emphasizes, however, "I am
not yielding to any pressures. I am merely re
sponding to simple justice and my conscience.
The student who costs the university more
should have to pay more; the price should be
proportionate to the costs. The proposed plan
is a juster arrangement and one more likely to
encourage students to get the job done."
Some critics of the plan have pointed out how
long it took many members of the faculty to
complete their dissertations. "I dwadle around
and wasted about a year," the Dean admitted,
"and then wrote it quickly when money was
about to run out. I've published six books, and
never finished any until I was right up to the
wire facing some external pressure." Apparently,
he feels that many "serious scholars" are actual
ly dawdling around and wasting their time. "I

know by my experience that I am no different
from undergraduate students, or graduates
writing their dissertations."
Different Situation
Furthermore, Dean Whitaker asserts that the
situation is not the same as when many faculty
members received their degrees. "Within re
cent years," since the Dean received his Doc
torate, "several important things have hap
pened. First, Ph.D. requirements have been sim
plified and it is no longer assumed that the dis
sertation is the equivalent of a mature, finished
book. Secondly, enormous efforts have been
made by the university and the federal govern
ment, to help the graduate student financially.
... A student who accepts aid, whether from the
federal government or the university, has an ob
ligation to get his degree and get out into the
world."
The Dean pointed out that at present the uni
versity has no definite plans to implement his
recommendations. "We are aware of some diffi
culties in the proposal; one reason fro circulating
it was to find out if there were other difficulties
we were not aware of."

trend which has sacrificed the life of the in

tellect to administrative convenience must be
stopped. ... It is distressing that such a plan
should come from . . . Prqfessor Whitaker, but
it is not altogether surprising since administra
tors all over the country are finding themselves
forced to yield to . . . pressures . . ."
Won't Yield
Dean Whitaker emphasizes, however, "I am
not yielding to any pressures. I am merely re
sponding to simple justice and my conscience.
The student who costs the university more
should have to pay more; the price should be
proportionate to the costs. The proposed plan
is a juster arrangement and one more likely to
encourage students to get the job done."
Some critics of the plan have pointed out how
long it took many members of the faculty to
complete their dissertations. "I dwadle around
and wasted about a year," the Dean admitted,
"and then wrote it quickly when money was
about to run out. I've published six books, and
never finished any until I was right up to the
wire facing some external pressure." Apparently,
he feels that many "serious scholars" are actual
ly dawdling around and wasting their time. "I

know by my experience that I am no different
from undergraduate students, or graduates
writing their dissertations."
Different Situation
Furthermore, Dean Whitaker asserts that the
situation is not the same as when many faculty
members received their degrees. "Within re
cent years," since the Dean received his Doc
torate, "several important things have hap
pened. First, Ph.D. requirements have been sim
plified and it is no longer assumed that the dis
sertation is the equivalent of a mature, finished
book. Secondly, enormous efforts have been
made by the university and the federal govern
ment, to help the graduate student financially.
... A student who accepts aid, whether from the
federal government or the university, has an ob
ligation to get his degree and get out into the
world."
The Dean pointed out that at present the uni
versity has no definite plans to implement his
recommendations. "We are aware of some diffi
culties in the proposal; one reason fro circulating
it was to find out if there were other difficulties
we were not aware of."
An increase in graduate "terminal registration"
fees accompanied by a decrease in Ph.D. resi
dence requirements might soon be adopted.
Dean of Graduate Division Virgil K. Whitaker
suggested at a meeting of department chairmen
last week that terminal registration fees be in
creased from $40 per quarter of dissertation
work to $200 per quarter. At the same time,
Ph.D. candidates would pay tu : tion for a mini
mum of two, rather than three, years of univer
sity residence.
The present $40 fee for binding dissertations
would be eliminated and Ph.D. candidacy would
expire seven years after admission to graduate
school, whether or not the student had completed
the degree requirements. The seven year limit,
however, could be extended upon petition of the
student's department.
Encourages Proficiency
The Dean's proposal, if adopted, would benefit
the student with the maximum efficiency and en
courage slower workers to complete their dis
sertations more quickly. At present, it is neces
sary for a student who completes his course re

quirements in two years and the dissertation in
another year to pay $4765, while under the new
system he would pay $3750. On the other hand,
if the student spent five years on his disserta
tion, he might pay over $6000. The Dean hopes
that few students would have to do this as the
purpose is to speed up the process.
There are two major reasons for the suggested
change. It would be fairer to the efficient stu
dent, who now pays proportionately more for
time spent on his dissertation. According to Dean
Whitaker, the student "may cost the university
more during work on his dissertation than at any
other time, especially when library costs repre
sent a major portion of the costs." A fairly
lengthy letter from a professor to a student
working on his dissertation away from the uni
versity costs $20 or more. Furthermore, a slow
student is more likely to need advising and re
peated reading of the dissertation, all of which
add to the expense of slow dissertations.
A letter from 33 graduate students which ap
peared in last Friday's Daily stated that "the
trend which has sacrificed the life of the in

tellect to administrative convenience must be
