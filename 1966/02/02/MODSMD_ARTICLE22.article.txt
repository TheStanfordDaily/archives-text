# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						Vietnam Debate 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, expressing its
concern and frustration over the
expansion of the war in Viet
nam, is urging all students to
"continue to boycott classes."
In imperative language stu
dents at Stanford are told to
leave their classes since what is
vital to them now is being
spoken of elsewhere. The edu
cational process, we are told,
has been transferred from the
classroom to White Plaza. Stan
ford students are seduced to be
lieve that an expression of moral
concern over the war in Vietnam
must be accomplished by means
of the disruption of the educa
tional process.
Surely the time has come to
impress upon those that have
never known, to remind those
that have forgotten, and to
speak for those that have not
spoken, that regard and respect
for the processes of higher edu
cation are the very foundation
upon which the democratic proc
ess operates. The question is not
whether the issue in Vietnam is
sufficiently vital to justify a
boycott of glasses. The point is
that by subverting the one we
are destroying the basis for the
other.
I respectfully hope that those
few instructors who chose to
call off classes, will reconsider
the ramifications of the action
which they have taken in this
controversy.

• SCPV And The G.I.
Editor, The Daily:
The SCPV may have the
right to protest American for
eign policy and the current ac
tion in Vietnam, but they have
overstepped their so - called
rights when their actions are
aimed at interfering with the
safety and tactical strategy of
our soldiers in Vietnam. The at
tack upon the management of
United Technology Center is a
manifestation of a reprehensible
lack of concern for the men who
must fight in Southeast Asia.
The Committee is taking out
its hostility toward American
Foreign Policy on men whose
lives depend upon the use of just
such weapons as napalm. Inno
cent people are going to be hurt,
but I wonder who suffers the
longest, the woman who is in
cinerated by napalm, the G.I.
impaled on a North Vietnam
booby trap, or the woman who
sits home waiting for a tele
gram that will tell her that her
husband has been blown to bits
in an obscure rice paddy. Every
one caught in the war is an in
nocent victim. The G.l.'s are
not in that God-forsaken hole
in Southeast Asia because they
enjoy killing.
if the result of our stopping
the bombing in Vietnam for one
month cost the lives of our sol
diers upon the resumption of
battle, then the government
has truly committed a moral er
ror. No man in the armed ser
vices should be forced to fight
without the maximum protec
tion the government can af
ford.
SCPV, stick to your speech
ma kin g and self - righteous
idealism, but do not let your
moral indignation of the war
cost American lives.

• Moderation Needed
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial of yester
day morning spoke directly to
the point of the new campus in
the war in Vietnam. Moderate
view point on campus is begin
ning to turn to real criticism of
administration policy toward the
Asian war. People who have
found a decision difficult to
come to are beginning to make
up their minds that the admin
istration's efforts for peace are
perhaps not as sincere as they
could be, and that perhaps the
president and his advisors are
deceiving themselves on some
of the basic issues of the war.
The difficulty is that the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, and maybe ARFEP,
do not realize what is happen
ing. Broad criticism of Adminis
tration policy on questions of
the Geneva Accords and the
NLF at the conference table
drew the full support of those
people who participated in the
4 p.m. rally and the evening
march. However, recommenda
tions for action against napalm
plants and the suggestion of a
full scale battle with the San
Mateo draft board scared
droves of people away. The
march Monday night was a clear
warning. What started so aus
piciously with the largest Stan
ford support yet for such an
activity ended with the audience
dribbling away while radical
suggestions for action were be
ing proposed. Concerned mid
dle-class Stanford students who
oppose Administration policy do
not wish to become the dupes
of radical liberals.
I would suggest to the SCPV,
and any other interested groups,
that they contain their moral
fervor, no matter how justified
they feel it is, for the sake of
broad University support. (I am
by no means suggesting a cut
ting down of action, I'm only
commenting on kinds of ac
tion.) Political realism calls for
numbers, and numbers are what
influence the President and the
men in Congress. If you are
dedicated to seeing an end to
the war in Vietnam, build on
this amazing new support that
you have, don't destroy it. The
support for a teacher's strike
and the heavy emphasis on di
rect action against napalm will
land the campus back where it
was before the recommence
ment of the bombing—inaction.
You don't seem to realize that
the Stanford student body is not
turning more radical; the
change has come about because
people are becoming more con
cerned after the events of the
last few days.

• Ex Deo Macliina
Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of seeming very
pedantic, we would like to point
out that Mr. Hodgson's response
to Mr. Leopold's editorial of the
28th of January, while hitting
the nail on the head from a se
mantic and logical point of view,
for which in all fairness the
laurel wreath must be proof
fered, nevertheless ignores the
basic syntactical and grammati
cal relation which must obtain
in Latin between ex and a fol

lowing noun which is its ob
ject. Let the expression read
ex deo machina, lest our broth
ers in the Classics department
surmise that we are slipping.

• 'Occabot' Exposed
Editor, The Daily:
Many who read this letter al
ready know that an extremely
dangerous drug, known among
the more backward addicts as
occabot, is rampant on the Stan
ford campus. Why, then, no
warning from faculty, adminis
tration, health service? Unlike
marijauna it is physiologically
addictive. Could it be that many
in high places are hooked? The
trembling hand can hardly be
uplifted.
Without mentioning honored
names and honorable depart
ments, I can say that there have
been seminars which seemed
more like occabot dens, in which
professor and teen age students
hip to the drug freely indulged
together — "to help the mind
flow. . .
Occabot may be sniffed or
masticated, but is more often in
gested gaseously through a
sheath. Considering the form of
the container together with the
sucking and blowing involved,
some psychoanalysts, couching
their opinions in terms I blush
to quote, think that the drug si
multaneously assuages repressed
genital, oral and anal needs. Yet
this supposed psychological cure
all is linked by other researchers
with cancer, heart disease, etc.
etc. But on such important is
sues we should perhaps consult
only the highest authorities of
the Great Society. The A.M.A.,
partly helped by a $25,000 dona
tion from the pushers for re
search, have been able to arrive
at practically no conclusion.
Because billions of dollars are
involved in maintaining addic
tion, one might expect pushers
to appeal directly to the mush
rooming teen age population,
but they have magnanimously
eschewed this, playing up the
mature, secure and successful
particularly hip to it.
Though not openly sold as an
aphrodysiac, occabot is clandes
tinely associated with conquest
and pleasure. One hesitates, how
ever, to rband it as Un-Christian
and Un-American, since to give
it its due, it is one of the main
stays of our culture, having
something of a stranglehold on
the entertainment world through
its sponsorship of television. Yet
in a sense (to be carefully de
fined in a later letter) it is dis
tinctly Un-Christian and Un-
American, having come original
ly from savage Amerinds, whose
peacemongers used it in a kind
of brainwashing ceremony. In
any case it is clearly subversive,
having wormed its way into the
armed services, so that teen age
draftees are said to crave it even
in the midst of battle.
Remember occabot, O-C-C-A-
B-O-T. Just slip your coins in
those little slots and you can
get it in your favorite form with
out even seeing the pusher.

• 'Occabot' Exposed
Editor, The Daily:
Many who read this letter al
ready know that an extremely
dangerous drug, known among
the more backward addicts as
occabot, is rampant on the Stan
ford campus. Why, then, no
warning from faculty, adminis
tration, health service? Unlike
marijauna it is physiologically
addictive. Could it be that many
in high places are hooked? The
trembling hand can hardly be
uplifted.
Without mentioning honored
names and honorable depart
ments, I can say that there have
been seminars which seemed
more like occabot dens, in which
professor and teen age students
hip to the drug freely indulged
together — "to help the mind
flow. . .
Occabot may be sniffed or
masticated, but is more often in
gested gaseously through a
sheath. Considering the form of
the container together with the
sucking and blowing involved,
some psychoanalysts, couching
their opinions in terms I blush
to quote, think that the drug si
multaneously assuages repressed
genital, oral and anal needs. Yet
this supposed psychological cure
all is linked by other researchers
with cancer, heart disease, etc.
etc. But on such important is
sues we should perhaps consult
only the highest authorities of
the Great Society. The A.M.A.,
partly helped by a $25,000 dona
tion from the pushers for re
search, have been able to arrive
at practically no conclusion.
Because billions of dollars are
involved in maintaining addic
tion, one might expect pushers
to appeal directly to the mush
rooming teen age population,
but they have magnanimously
eschewed this, playing up the
mature, secure and successful
particularly hip to it.
Though not openly sold as an
aphrodysiac, occabot is clandes
tinely associated with conquest
and pleasure. One hesitates, how
ever, to rband it as Un-Christian
and Un-American, since to give
it its due, it is one of the main
stays of our culture, having
something of a stranglehold on
the entertainment world through
its sponsorship of television. Yet
in a sense (to be carefully de
fined in a later letter) it is dis
tinctly Un-Christian and Un-
American, having come original
ly from savage Amerinds, whose
peacemongers used it in a kind
of brainwashing ceremony. In
any case it is clearly subversive,
having wormed its way into the
armed services, so that teen age
draftees are said to crave it even
in the midst of battle.
Remember occabot, O-C-C-A-
B-O-T. Just slip your coins in
those little slots and you can
get it in your favorite form with
out even seeing the pusher.

Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, expressing its
concern and frustration over the
expansion of the war in Viet
nam, is urging all students to
"continue to boycott classes."
In imperative language stu
dents at Stanford are told to
leave their classes since what is
vital to them now is being
spoken of elsewhere. The edu
cational process, we are told,
has been transferred from the
classroom to White Plaza. Stan
ford students are seduced to be
lieve that an expression of moral
concern over the war in Vietnam
must be accomplished by means
of the disruption of the educa
tional process.
Surely the time has come to
impress upon those that have
never known, to remind those
that have forgotten, and to
speak for those that have not
spoken, that regard and respect
for the processes of higher edu
cation are the very foundation
upon which the democratic proc
ess operates. The question is not
whether the issue in Vietnam is
sufficiently vital to justify a
boycott of glasses. The point is
that by subverting the one we
are destroying the basis for the
other.
I respectfully hope that those
few instructors who chose to
call off classes, will reconsider
the ramifications of the action
which they have taken in this
controversy.

• SCPV And The G.I.
Editor, The Daily:
The SCPV may have the
right to protest American for
eign policy and the current ac
tion in Vietnam, but they have
overstepped their so - called
rights when their actions are
aimed at interfering with the
safety and tactical strategy of
our soldiers in Vietnam. The at
tack upon the management of
United Technology Center is a
manifestation of a reprehensible
lack of concern for the men who
must fight in Southeast Asia.
The Committee is taking out
its hostility toward American
Foreign Policy on men whose
lives depend upon the use of just
such weapons as napalm. Inno
cent people are going to be hurt,
but I wonder who suffers the
longest, the woman who is in
cinerated by napalm, the G.I.
impaled on a North Vietnam
booby trap, or the woman who
sits home waiting for a tele
gram that will tell her that her
husband has been blown to bits
in an obscure rice paddy. Every
one caught in the war is an in
nocent victim. The G.l.'s are
not in that God-forsaken hole
in Southeast Asia because they
enjoy killing.
if the result of our stopping
the bombing in Vietnam for one
month cost the lives of our sol
diers upon the resumption of
battle, then the government
has truly committed a moral er
ror. No man in the armed ser
vices should be forced to fight
without the maximum protec
tion the government can af

• Moderation Needed
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial of yester
day morning spoke directly to
the point of the new campus in
the war in Vietnam. Moderate
view point on campus is begin
ning to turn to real criticism of
administration policy toward the
Asian war. People who have
found a decision difficult to
come to are beginning to make
up their minds that the admin
istration's efforts for peace are
perhaps not as sincere as they
could be, and that perhaps the
president and his advisors are
deceiving themselves on some
of the basic issues of the war.
The difficulty is that the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, and maybe ARFEP,
do not realize what is happen
ing. Broad criticism of Adminis
tration policy on questions of
the Geneva Accords and the
NLF at the conference table
drew the full support of those
people who participated in the
4 p.m. rally and the evening
march. However, recommenda
tions for action against napalm
plants and the suggestion of a
full scale battle with the San
Mateo draft board scared
droves of people away. The
march Monday night was a clear
warning. What started so aus
piciously with the largest Stan
ford support yet for such an
activity ended with the audience
dribbling away while radical
suggestions for action were be
ing proposed. Concerned mid
dle-class Stanford students who
oppose Administration policy do
not wish to become the dupes
of radical liberals.
I would suggest to the SCPV,
and any other interested groups,
that they contain their moral
fervor, no matter how justified
they feel it is, for the sake of
broad University support. (I am
by no means suggesting a cut
ting down of action, I'm only

concern and frustration over the
expansion of the war in Viet
nam, is urging all students to
"continue to boycott classes."
In imperative language stu
dents at Stanford are told to
leave their classes since what is
vital to them now is being
spoken of elsewhere. The edu
cational process, we are told,
has been transferred from the
classroom to White Plaza. Stan
ford students are seduced to be
lieve that an expression of moral
concern over the war in Vietnam
must be accomplished by means
of the disruption of the educa
tional process.
Surely the time has come to
impress upon those that have
never known, to remind those
that have forgotten, and to
speak for those that have not
spoken, that regard and respect
for the processes of higher edu
cation are the very foundation
upon which the democratic proc
ess operates. The question is not
whether the issue in Vietnam is
sufficiently vital to justify a
boycott of glasses. The point is
that by subverting the one we
are destroying the basis for the
other.
I respectfully hope that those
few instructors who chose to
call off classes, will reconsider
the ramifications of the action
which they have taken in this
controversy.

• SCPV And The G.I.
Editor, The Daily:
The SCPV may have the
right to protest American for
eign policy and the current ac
tion in Vietnam, but they have
overstepped their so - called
rights when their actions are
aimed at interfering with the
safety and tactical strategy of
our soldiers in Vietnam. The at
tack upon the management of
United Technology Center is a
manifestation of a reprehensible
lack of concern for the men who
must fight in Southeast Asia.
The Committee is taking out
its hostility toward American
Foreign Policy on men whose
lives depend upon the use of just
such weapons as napalm. Inno
cent people are going to be hurt,
but I wonder who suffers the
longest, the woman who is in
cinerated by napalm, the G.I.
impaled on a North Vietnam
booby trap, or the woman who
sits home waiting for a tele
gram that will tell her that her
husband has been blown to bits
in an obscure rice paddy. Every
one caught in the war is an in
nocent victim. The G.l.'s are
not in that God-forsaken hole
in Southeast Asia because they
enjoy killing.
if the result of our stopping
the bombing in Vietnam for one
month cost the lives of our sol
diers upon the resumption of
battle, then the government
has truly committed a moral er
ror. No man in the armed ser
vices should be forced to fight
without the maximum protec

• Moderation Needed
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial of yester
day morning spoke directly to
the point of the new campus in
the war in Vietnam. Moderate
view point on campus is begin
ning to turn to real criticism of
administration policy toward the
Asian war. People who have
found a decision difficult to
come to are beginning to make
up their minds that the admin
istration's efforts for peace are
perhaps not as sincere as they
could be, and that perhaps the
president and his advisors are
deceiving themselves on some
of the basic issues of the war.
The difficulty is that the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, and maybe ARFEP,
do not realize what is happen
ing. Broad criticism of Adminis
tration policy on questions of
the Geneva Accords and the
NLF at the conference table
drew the full support of those
people who participated in the
4 p.m. rally and the evening
march. However, recommenda
tions for action against napalm
plants and the suggestion of a
full scale battle with the San
Mateo draft board scared
droves of people away. The
march Monday night was a clear
warning. What started so aus
piciously with the largest Stan
ford support yet for such an
activity ended with the audience
dribbling away while radical
suggestions for action were be
ing proposed. Concerned mid
dle-class Stanford students who
oppose Administration policy do
not wish to become the dupes
of radical liberals.
I would suggest to the SCPV,
and any other interested groups,
that they contain their moral
fervor, no matter how justified
they feel it is, for the sake of
broad University support. (I am
by no means suggesting a cut
ting down of action, I'm only
commenting on kinds of ac
tion.) Political realism calls for
numbers, and numbers are what
influence the President and the
men in Congress. If you are
dedicated to seeing an end to
the war in Vietnam, build on
this amazing new support that
you have, don't destroy it. The
support for a teacher's strike
and the heavy emphasis on di
rect action against napalm will
land the campus back where it
was before the recommence
ment of the bombing—inaction.
You don't seem to realize that
the Stanford student body is not
turning more radical; the
change has come about because
people are becoming more con
cerned after the events of the
last few days.

• 'Occabot' Exposed
Editor, The Daily:
Many who read this letter al
ready know that an extremely
dangerous drug, known among
the more backward addicts as
occabot, is rampant on the Stan
ford campus. Why, then, no
warning from faculty, adminis
tration, health service? Unlike
marijauna it is physiologically
addictive. Could it be that many
in high places are hooked? The
trembling hand can hardly be
uplifted.
Without mentioning honored
names and honorable depart
ments, I can say that there have
been seminars which seemed
more like occabot dens, in which
professor and teen age students
hip to the drug freely indulged
together — "to help the mind
flow. . .
Occabot may be sniffed or
masticated, but is more often in
gested gaseously through a
sheath. Considering the form of
the container together with the
sucking and blowing involved,
some psychoanalysts, couching
their opinions in terms I blush
to quote, think that the drug si
multaneously assuages repressed
genital, oral and anal needs. Yet
this supposed psychological cure
all is linked by other researchers
with cancer, heart disease, etc.
etc. But on such important is
sues we should perhaps consult
only the highest authorities of
the Great Society. The A.M.A.,
partly helped by a $25,000 dona
tion from the pushers for re
search, have been able to arrive
at practically no conclusion.
Because billions of dollars are
involved in maintaining addic
tion, one might expect pushers
to appeal directly to the mush
rooming teen age population,
but they have magnanimously
eschewed this, playing up the
mature, secure and successful
particularly hip to it.
Though not openly sold as an
aphrodysiac, occabot is clandes
tinely associated with conquest
and pleasure. One hesitates, how
ever, to rband it as Un-Christian
and Un-American, since to give
it its due, it is one of the main
stays of our culture, having
something of a stranglehold on
the entertainment world through
its sponsorship of television. Yet
in a sense (to be carefully de
fined in a later letter) it is dis
tinctly Un-Christian and Un-
American, having come original
ly from savage Amerinds, whose
peacemongers used it in a kind
of brainwashing ceremony. In
any case it is clearly subversive,
having wormed its way into the
armed services, so that teen age
draftees are said to crave it even
in the midst of battle.
Remember occabot, O-C-C-A-
B-O-T. Just slip your coins in
those little slots and you can
get it in your favorite form with
out even seeing the pusher.

• 'Occabot' Exposed
Editor, The Daily:
Many who read this letter al
ready know that an extremely
dangerous drug, known among
the more backward addicts as
occabot, is rampant on the Stan
ford campus. Why, then, no
warning from faculty, adminis
tration, health service? Unlike
marijauna it is physiologically
addictive. Could it be that many
in high places are hooked? The
trembling hand can hardly be
uplifted.
Without mentioning honored
names and honorable depart
ments, I can say that there have
been seminars which seemed
more like occabot dens, in which
professor and teen age students
hip to the drug freely indulged
together — "to help the mind
flow. . .
Occabot may be sniffed or
masticated, but is more often in
gested gaseously through a
sheath. Considering the form of
the container together with the
sucking and blowing involved,
some psychoanalysts, couching
their opinions in terms I blush
to quote, think that the drug si
multaneously assuages repressed
genital, oral and anal needs. Yet
this supposed psychological cure
all is linked by other researchers
with cancer, heart disease, etc.
etc. But on such important is
sues we should perhaps consult
only the highest authorities of
the Great Society. The A.M.A.,
partly helped by a $25,000 dona
tion from the pushers for re
search, have been able to arrive
at practically no conclusion.
Because billions of dollars are
involved in maintaining addic
tion, one might expect pushers
to appeal directly to the mush
rooming teen age population,
but they have magnanimously
eschewed this, playing up the
mature, secure and successful
particularly hip to it.
Though not openly sold as an
aphrodysiac, occabot is clandes
tinely associated with conquest
and pleasure. One hesitates, how
ever, to rband it as Un-Christian
and Un-American, since to give
it its due, it is one of the main
stays of our culture, having
something of a stranglehold on
the entertainment world through
its sponsorship of television. Yet
in a sense (to be carefully de
fined in a later letter) it is dis
tinctly Un-Christian and Un-
American, having come original
ly from savage Amerinds, whose
peacemongers used it in a kind
of brainwashing ceremony. In
any case it is clearly subversive,
having wormed its way into the
armed services, so that teen age
draftees are said to crave it even
in the midst of battle.
Remember occabot, O-C-C-A-
B-O-T. Just slip your coins in
those little slots and you can
get it in your favorite form with
out even seeing the pusher.

The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, expressing its
concern and frustration over the
expansion of the war in Viet
nam, is urging all students to
"continue to boycott classes."
In imperative language stu
dents at Stanford are told to
leave their classes since what is
vital to them now is being
spoken of elsewhere. The edu
cational process, we are told,
has been transferred from the
classroom to White Plaza. Stan
ford students are seduced to be
lieve that an expression of moral
concern over the war in Vietnam
must be accomplished by means
of the disruption of the educa
tional process.
Surely the time has come to
impress upon those that have
never known, to remind those
that have forgotten, and to
speak for those that have not
spoken, that regard and respect
for the processes of higher edu
cation are the very foundation
upon which the democratic proc
ess operates. The question is not
whether the issue in Vietnam is
sufficiently vital to justify a
boycott of glasses. The point is
that by subverting the one we
are destroying the basis for the
other.
I respectfully hope that those
few instructors who chose to
call off classes, will reconsider
the ramifications of the action
which they have taken in this
controversy.

• SCPV And The G.I.
Editor, The Daily:
The SCPV may have the
right to protest American for
eign policy and the current ac
tion in Vietnam, but they have
overstepped their so - called
rights when their actions are
aimed at interfering with the
safety and tactical strategy of
our soldiers in Vietnam. The at
tack upon the management of
United Technology Center is a
manifestation of a reprehensible
lack of concern for the men who
must fight in Southeast Asia.
The Committee is taking out
its hostility toward American
Foreign Policy on men whose
lives depend upon the use of just
such weapons as napalm. Inno
cent people are going to be hurt,
but I wonder who suffers the
longest, the woman who is in
cinerated by napalm, the G.I.
impaled on a North Vietnam
booby trap, or the woman who
sits home waiting for a tele
gram that will tell her that her
husband has been blown to bits
in an obscure rice paddy. Every
one caught in the war is an in
nocent victim. The G.l.'s are
not in that God-forsaken hole
in Southeast Asia because they
enjoy killing.
if the result of our stopping
the bombing in Vietnam for one
month cost the lives of our sol
diers upon the resumption of
battle, then the government
has truly committed a moral er
ror. No man in the armed ser
vices should be forced to fight
without the maximum protec
tion the government can af
ford.
SCPV, stick to your speech

moral indignation of the war

• Moderation Needed
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial of yester
day morning spoke directly to
the point of the new campus in
the war in Vietnam. Moderate
view point on campus is begin
ning to turn to real criticism of
administration policy toward the
Asian war. People who have
found a decision difficult to
come to are beginning to make
up their minds that the admin
istration's efforts for peace are
perhaps not as sincere as they
could be, and that perhaps the
president and his advisors are
deceiving themselves on some
of the basic issues of the war.
The difficulty is that the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, and maybe ARFEP,
do not realize what is happen
ing. Broad criticism of Adminis
tration policy on questions of
the Geneva Accords and the
NLF at the conference table
drew the full support of those
people who participated in the
4 p.m. rally and the evening
march. However, recommenda
tions for action against napalm
plants and the suggestion of a
full scale battle with the San
Mateo draft board scared
droves of people away. The
march Monday night was a clear
warning. What started so aus
piciously with the largest Stan
ford support yet for such an
activity ended with the audience
dribbling away while radical
suggestions for action were be
ing proposed. Concerned mid
dle-class Stanford students who
oppose Administration policy do
not wish to become the dupes
of radical liberals.
I would suggest to the SCPV,
and any other interested groups,
that they contain their moral
fervor, no matter how justified
they feel it is, for the sake of
broad University support. (I am
by no means suggesting a cut
ting down of action, I'm only
commenting on kinds of ac
tion.) Political realism calls for
numbers, and numbers are what
influence the President and the

"continue to boycott classes."
In imperative language stu
dents at Stanford are told to
leave their classes since what is
vital to them now is being
spoken of elsewhere. The edu
cational process, we are told,
has been transferred from the
classroom to White Plaza. Stan
ford students are seduced to be
lieve that an expression of moral
concern over the war in Vietnam
must be accomplished by means
of the disruption of the educa
tional process.
Surely the time has come to
impress upon those that have
never known, to remind those
that have forgotten, and to
speak for those that have not
spoken, that regard and respect
for the processes of higher edu
cation are the very foundation
upon which the democratic proc
ess operates. The question is not
whether the issue in Vietnam is
sufficiently vital to justify a
boycott of glasses. The point is
that by subverting the one we
are destroying the basis for the
other.
I respectfully hope that those
few instructors who chose to
call off classes, will reconsider
the ramifications of the action
which they have taken in this
controversy.

• SCPV And The G.I.
Editor, The Daily:
The SCPV may have the
right to protest American for
eign policy and the current ac
tion in Vietnam, but they have
overstepped their so - called
rights when their actions are
aimed at interfering with the
safety and tactical strategy of
our soldiers in Vietnam. The at
tack upon the management of
United Technology Center is a
manifestation of a reprehensible
lack of concern for the men who
must fight in Southeast Asia.
The Committee is taking out
its hostility toward American
Foreign Policy on men whose
lives depend upon the use of just
such weapons as napalm. Inno
cent people are going to be hurt,
but I wonder who suffers the
longest, the woman who is in
cinerated by napalm, the G.I.
impaled on a North Vietnam
booby trap, or the woman who
sits home waiting for a tele
gram that will tell her that her
husband has been blown to bits
in an obscure rice paddy. Every
one caught in the war is an in
nocent victim. The G.l.'s are
not in that God-forsaken hole
in Southeast Asia because they
enjoy killing.
if the result of our stopping
the bombing in Vietnam for one
month cost the lives of our sol
diers upon the resumption of
battle, then the government
has truly committed a moral er
ror. No man in the armed ser
vices should be forced to fight
without the maximum protec
tion the government can af
ford.
SCPV, stick to your speech
ma kin g and self - righteous
idealism, but do not let your
moral indignation of the war
cost American lives.

• Moderation Needed
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial of yester
day morning spoke directly to
the point of the new campus in
the war in Vietnam. Moderate
view point on campus is begin
ning to turn to real criticism of
administration policy toward the
Asian war. People who have
found a decision difficult to
come to are beginning to make
up their minds that the admin
istration's efforts for peace are
perhaps not as sincere as they
could be, and that perhaps the
president and his advisors are
deceiving themselves on some
of the basic issues of the war.
The difficulty is that the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, and maybe ARFEP,
do not realize what is happen
ing. Broad criticism of Adminis
tration policy on questions of
the Geneva Accords and the
NLF at the conference table
drew the full support of those
people who participated in the
4 p.m. rally and the evening
march. However, recommenda
tions for action against napalm
plants and the suggestion of a
full scale battle with the San
Mateo draft board scared
droves of people away. The
march Monday night was a clear
warning. What started so aus
piciously with the largest Stan
ford support yet for such an
activity ended with the audience
dribbling away while radical
suggestions for action were be
ing proposed. Concerned mid
dle-class Stanford students who
oppose Administration policy do
not wish to become the dupes
of radical liberals.
I would suggest to the SCPV,
and any other interested groups,
that they contain their moral
fervor, no matter how justified
they feel it is, for the sake of
broad University support. (I am
by no means suggesting a cut
ting down of action, I'm only
commenting on kinds of ac
tion.) Political realism calls for
numbers, and numbers are what
influence the President and the
men in Congress. If you are
dedicated to seeing an end to
the war in Vietnam, build on
this amazing new support that
you have, don't destroy it. The
support for a teacher's strike
and the heavy emphasis on di
rect action against napalm will
land the campus back where it
was before the recommence
ment of the bombing—inaction.
You don't seem to realize that
the Stanford student body is not
turning more radical; the
change has come about because
people are becoming more con
cerned after the events of the
last few days.

• Ex Deo Macliina
Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of seeming very
pedantic, we would like to point
out that Mr. Hodgson's response
to Mr. Leopold's editorial of the
28th of January, while hitting
the nail on the head from a se
mantic and logical point of view,
for which in all fairness the
laurel wreath must be proof
fered, nevertheless ignores the
basic syntactical and grammati
cal relation which must obtain
in Latin between ex and a fol

lowing noun which is its ob
ject. Let the expression read
ex deo machina, lest our broth
ers in the Classics department
surmise that we are slipping.

• 'Occabot' Exposed
Editor, The Daily:
Many who read this letter al
ready know that an extremely
dangerous drug, known among
the more backward addicts as
occabot, is rampant on the Stan
ford campus. Why, then, no
warning from faculty, adminis
tration, health service? Unlike
marijauna it is physiologically
addictive. Could it be that many
in high places are hooked? The
trembling hand can hardly be
uplifted.
Without mentioning honored
names and honorable depart
ments, I can say that there have
been seminars which seemed
more like occabot dens, in which
professor and teen age students
hip to the drug freely indulged
together — "to help the mind
flow. . .
Occabot may be sniffed or
masticated, but is more often in
gested gaseously through a
sheath. Considering the form of
the container together with the
sucking and blowing involved,
some psychoanalysts, couching
their opinions in terms I blush
to quote, think that the drug si
multaneously assuages repressed
genital, oral and anal needs. Yet
this supposed psychological cure
all is linked by other researchers
with cancer, heart disease, etc.
etc. But on such important is
sues we should perhaps consult
only the highest authorities of
the Great Society. The A.M.A.,
partly helped by a $25,000 dona
tion from the pushers for re
search, have been able to arrive
at practically no conclusion.
Because billions of dollars are
involved in maintaining addic
tion, one might expect pushers
to appeal directly to the mush
rooming teen age population,
but they have magnanimously
eschewed this, playing up the
mature, secure and successful
particularly hip to it.
Though not openly sold as an
aphrodysiac, occabot is clandes
tinely associated with conquest
and pleasure. One hesitates, how
ever, to rband it as Un-Christian
and Un-American, since to give
it its due, it is one of the main
stays of our culture, having
something of a stranglehold on
the entertainment world through
its sponsorship of television. Yet
in a sense (to be carefully de
fined in a later letter) it is dis
tinctly Un-Christian and Un-
American, having come original
ly from savage Amerinds, whose
peacemongers used it in a kind
of brainwashing ceremony. In
any case it is clearly subversive,
having wormed its way into the
armed services, so that teen age
draftees are said to crave it even
in the midst of battle.
Remember occabot, O-C-C-A-
B-O-T. Just slip your coins in
those little slots and you can
get it in your favorite form with
out even seeing the pusher.
