# From The Establishment
## Johnson And The Senate 
### Steve Leopold 
Monday, the United States Senate conducted what the New York
Times called the "first real debate on Vietnam" to be held in that
chamber.
The reasons behind this seemingly incredible delay in the demo
cratic process are neither complex nor conducive to an optimistic

analysis of American foreign
policy in general or the South
east Asian dilemma in particu
lar.
Dual Co-optation
Lyndon B. Johnson is a Dem
ocrat following an essentially
Republican foreign policy. He
has thus co-opted both parties—
one ideologically, the other po
litically. Only the most Neandra
thai Republicans have faulted
President Johnson's actions in
Vietnam and the Dominican Re
public, yet the Republicans—as
members of a party which is not
constrained by the loyalties or
practicalities incumbent upon
members of the President's par
ty — are the only organized
group in Congress which can
safely buck the President.
Until recently, the political
price for all but a few maverick
Democrats has been too high.
President Johnson's well-publi
cized vendettas against Senators
Frank Church and William Ful
bright last year effectively si
lenced any opposition within
his own party.
Spectre of McCarthyism
Other concerned liberals—es
pecially those in the State De
partment — have been fright
ened off by the ever-present
spectre of McCarthyism. The
policy-makers in Foggybottom
will not, in and of themselves,
support a Southeast Asian pol
icy reminiscent of the China
policy of the late 40's; indeed,
the negative reaction of the
American public — expressed in
its acquiescence to the McCar
thy purges of the early '50's—
to even the limited war concept

of containment as it was fol
lowed in Korea has completely
intimidated State. Only the
strong backing of the President
would free State from its fear
of creeping Goldwaterism, yet
this support has obviously not
been forthcoming.
Similarly, McNamara's Penta
gon cannot be expected to in
fluence the President in what
are essentially political deci
sions. Robert Strange McNa
mara is a technician, a fact
which men such as Rev. Wil
liam S. Coffin condemn as "im
moral abstractionism", but
which on the whole is an ex
tremely welcome philosophy for
the Defense Department. McNa
mara gives .. the president mili
tary advice and follows civilian
orders — he neither can nor
should be blamed for the alleged
moral and political failings of
American policy in Vietnam.
No One Left
The Republicans, then, have
been co-opted, the liberal Dem
ocrats have been bludgeoned;
State has been frightened; and
McNamara has been abstracted.
Since, alas, we cannot depend
upon the Supreme Court to gal
vanize the government into ac
tion, it is only from a concerned
electorate — that great Ameri
can mythopaic being — that the
demand for a thorough debate
on U. S. goals and policies in
Vietnam can possibly be initia
ted.
This is the price one pays for
electing a President more com
mitted to consensus than leader
ship.
