# Today And Tomorrow
## The 						Search For Peace 
### Walter Lippmann 
The resumption of bombing in North Vietnam is not a surprise,
indeed it has been inevitable since the diplomatic content of the peace
offensive was set. For on neither side has there been any overt effort
to find the terms of a truce which reflect correctly the actual mili
tary situation.

On both sides there has been
some suggestion of softening
the demands a little. But the
basic objective of our adversar
ies remains the ascendancy of
the Viet Cong in South Vietnam
—and our basic objective, as ar
ticulated repeatedly by Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk, is the
liquidation of the Viet Cong and
the ascendancy of Gen. Ky and
his successors in Saigon.
Attempt Stalled
The whole world-wide attempt
to end the fighting by negotia
tions is stalled on this disparity.
The essential fact about the con
flict of aims is that each side
has a political objective which is
beyond its military capacity.
Insofar as Hanoi and more
certainly Peking are demanding
the withdrawal of the U.S.
forces before there is a political
settlement in Indochina, they
are demanding more than they
have the military power to
achieve. The United States is
able to stand fast and hold on.
On the other hand, insofar as
we are tied to Secretary Rusk's
objectives, to defeat and elimin
ate the Viet Cong, to keep the
2,800 villages permanently
secured against the Viet Cong
and to create a government in
Saigon that, without being an
American colonial government,
is the ruler of the whole of
South Vietnam — insofar as
these are our purposes in Viet
nam—we are fighting a war
which is far beyond our or any
one else's military and political
capacity.
The search for peace, to which
the President rededicated him
self as he announced the end of
the bombing pause, will succeed
or fail as we and they bring war
aims into balance with military
capacity. This will certainly not
be done simultaneously by both

sides. But if one side makes the
first move, it will be difficult
for the other not to follow suit.
Thus, if Hanoi says clearly,
what it has hinted at vaguely,
that the American forces need
not withdraw before negotia
tions bring about an agreed set
tlement, it would be difficult,
indeed impossible in the long
run, for the administration to
deny that the Viet Cong must,
in fact, be a principal party to
a negotiated truce.
Duty And Initiative
It is also within our power to
break the deadlock which has
caused the peace offensive to
fail. And as we are the stronger
power, the more invulnerable, it
is both our duty and to our in
terest to take the initiative.
No one, I suppose, imagines
any longer that the deadlock
can be broken by bombing, by
a little bombing or by a lot of
bombing. And there are few ob
servers of the war who think
that the deadlock can be broken
by doubling or tripling our
forces.
The way to break the dead
lock is to adopt a military strat
egy which, because it has a lim
ited objective, can be made to
prevail by limited means. Thus,
when and if we move to a hold
ing strategy, we shall have re
vised and reduced our war aims
to something more modest, but
more credible than Rusk's un
attainable pursuit of the inde
pendence of the whole of South
Vietnam under Gen. Ky and his
successors in Saigon.
I regard both the bombing
pause and the resumption of the
bombing as irrelevant to the
real problem, which is how to
make a truce which is consist
ent with the military realities.
Some will say that by more and
bigger bombing and by a big
build up of troops we shall be
able to change the military reali
ties in our favor. Experience and
the history of this wretched war
are against that hope. For the
forces against us can be in
creased indefinitely, and the no
tion of a decisive military super
iority over the land powers of
Asia is a dangerous fantasy.
