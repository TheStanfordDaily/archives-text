# Manning Sees Challenge For Legal Process
## 
### SUZANNE LEFRANC 
"We have much too narrow a con
cept of what legal institutions are,"
according to Bayless Manning, Dean
of the Law School.
Speaking to a responsive audience
at the Tuesday Evening Series last
night, Manning proposed the idea
that "Law is almost a working defi
nition of civilization." Taking an
"Olympian view" of the legal proc
ess, he said that law is not static, but
a mirror image of society's problems
and ethical norms.
The legal process, continued Man
ning, is the "accommodation of social
friction"; it succeeds if it absorbs
and responds accurately to an ethical
norm; it will change as society con
fronts new problems, claims, and
counter-claims.
Manning credited our country's
pragmatic skill in "bending like bam
boo" for the United States' historical
success in adjusting legal process to
a changing society.
As the United States continues to
move away from an atomistic society,
said Manning, it confronts a "mass
institutional environment"—one feels
that: "It's all so bloody big, so bloody
faceless."
Manning emphatically pointed to to
day's world, saying that both society
and legal processes must now answer
the question: how do you adjust our
ideological inheritance of individual
ism to an aggregate social order?
"We have socially become a na
tion," he said, and the challenge to le
gal processes is to order new claims,
and find new accommodations among
areas of friction.
