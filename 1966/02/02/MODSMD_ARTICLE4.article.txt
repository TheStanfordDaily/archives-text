# Kerensky Sees Need For Love, Not Bombs
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
Russia and History's Turning
Point, Alexander Kerensky's latest
book was written to speak to "this
generation which must understand
that love and brotherhood must tri
umph over hate, arms, and bombs."
The former Prime Minister of the
Russian provisional government in
1917 explained his book and its con
temporary significance yesterday af
ternoon in Tresidder. A large audi
ence heard a first-hand account of
conditions in Russia 49 years ago.
Kerensky stoutly defended contin
ued Russian participation in World
War I under his government. Many
modern historians have linked this
participation to the fall of the pro
visional government.
Defends Heroic Russians
"I defend the heroic position of the
Russian people and army in World

War I, not myself. It is not true that
Russian participation was practically
nil. Churchill himself admitted that
without Russian help, allied victory
would have been impossible," Keren
sky said.
The first task of the provisional
government was to restore elemen
tary governmental functions, Keren
sky explained. At the same time,
"Russia was forced to continue the
war without outside aid," he said.
"Though we were cut off from the
outside world, we honored our com
mitment to the allies and fought the
Germans on the front."
Kerensky claimed that Lenin used
the "biggest lie in history" to gain
power. "He fought against the gov
ernment under the mask of democ
racy. They promised freedom but be
came lord and master of the country
forever."
"If Lenin had come out and said,
'I hate democracy' as Hitler did, he
would have remained just a laugh."

"My idea for my Russia was equali
ty of the human races," Kerensky
said. "But we were beaten by treason,
not arms. We tried to organize an al
lied conference to discuss war aims,
which had already been determined
by secret agreement. But they would
only listen to us if we had a success
ful offensive."
Discussing the Russian role in
World War 11, Kerensky said that
Stalin knew the Russian people would
not fight for the regime. So he ap
pealed to them to fight for the home
land.
The book was written to present
a "factual, logical account of the
turning point of the history of all of
Europe," according to Kerensky. "It
is not intended for the critics or my
contemporaries, but it is the story of
destruction, which this generation
must heed."
Kerensky was introduced as "th e
last man who symbolized freedom in
Russia" by Dr. Bertram Wolfe of the
Hoover Institute. Wolfe character
ized the book as "history as written
by the survivors."

Stalin knew the Russian people would
not fight for the regime. So he ap
pealed to them to fight for the home
land.
The book was written to present
a "factual, logical account of the
turning point of the history of all of
Europe," according to Kerensky. "It
is not intended for the critics or my
contemporaries, but it is the story of
destruction, which this generation
must heed."
Kerensky was introduced as "th e
last man who symbolized freedom in
Russia" by Dr. Bertram Wolfe of the
Hoover Institute. Wolfe character
ized the book as "history as written
by the survivors."
Russia and History's Turning
Point, Alexander Kerensky's latest
book was written to speak to "this
generation which must understand
that love and brotherhood must tri
umph over hate, arms, and bombs."
The former Prime Minister of the
Russian provisional government in
1917 explained his book and its con
temporary significance yesterday af
ternoon in Tresidder. A large audi
ence heard a first-hand account of
conditions in Russia 49 years ago.
Kerensky stoutly defended contin
ued Russian participation in World
War I under his government. Many
modern historians have linked this
participation to the fall of the pro
visional government.
Defends Heroic Russians
"I defend the heroic position of the
Russian people and army in World

War I, not myself. It is not true that
Russian participation was practically
nil. Churchill himself admitted that
without Russian help, allied victory
would have been impossible," Keren
sky said.
The first task of the provisional
government was to restore elemen
tary governmental functions, Keren
sky explained. At the same time,
"Russia was forced to continue the
war without outside aid," he said.
"Though we were cut off from the
outside world, we honored our com
mitment to the allies and fought the
Germans on the front."
Kerensky claimed that Lenin used
the "biggest lie in history" to gain
power. "He fought against the gov
ernment under the mask of democ
racy. They promised freedom but be
came lord and master of the country
forever."
"If Lenin had come out and said,
'I hate democracy' as Hitler did, he
would have remained just a laugh."
Beaten By Treason
"My idea for my Russia was equali
ty of the human races," Kerensky
said. "But we were beaten by treason,
not arms. We tried to organize an al
lied conference to discuss war aims,
which had already been determined
by secret agreement. But they would
only listen to us if we had a success
ful offensive."
Discussing the Russian role in
World War 11, Kerensky said that
Stalin knew the Russian people would
not fight for the regime. So he ap
pealed to them to fight for the home
land.
