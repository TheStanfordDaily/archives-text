# WORKSHOP REVIEW
## Lengthy But Lacking 
### BOB BJORING 
Length, though undoubtedly a vir
tue in life and snakes, is nevertheless
no measure of the Workshop. The
dime buys a little more this week, but
of what? The verbiage seems to have
been compiled largely in the manlier
of freshman English themes, and, in
deed, one of the offerings is a fresh
man English theme.
This is Cheri Dyck's piece, "Sum
mertime, and The Livin' is Eeasy . . ."
It is a clever title. It is an ironic ti
tle. It is the last note of life struck in
the essay. This, of course, is only
natural, since the next three pages
give a blow-by-blow account of total
boredom. The style in all ways cor
responds to the subject, and one must
respect Miss Dyck's technical compe
tence. Most of us, however, are not
broadened by boredom, since we have
all observed it.
Better Than Crabs
The piece fulfills the role of an
English theme admirably. It is cer
tainly deeper than tales of the crabs
that stupid little brother brought
back from the trip to the seaside. To
print the essay in an undergraduate
magazine is an unfortunate decision.
The same may be said of "Ortho
doxy is Unconsciousness," by Thomas
Zaniello. "It has the true scholastic
stink." Though the source of that
quotation will remain a mystery to
the reader, Mr. Zaniello's sources will
not. His scholarship is undisputably
Teutonic. "The following passage
(quoted by Schcer on page 40) is
from Life (May 13, 1957)—it is from
an article on ex-President Diem . . ."
(emphasis on life and minute cate
gorization of the same, all his.)
The essay is interesting, after its
own fashion, and the argument is put
forward in a logical manner. But it
seems as if it had been written at
gunpoint.
Suspenseful Travelogue
For those of us who have been
waiting, the LA-to-Frisco-on-coffee
and-the-Greyhound-bus story has fi
nally been written, and Workshop
has been kind enough to print it.
After a somewhat slow start (the
author seems to have as much trouble
with his gears as the driver), Pat Fo
ley's "The Man Who Bought Things
and Threw Them Away" develops in
to quite an interesting tale.
Lee Whiting seems not to have
perished over Christmas vacation, and
his latest effort, "The Consolation
Prize," is perhaps the high piece of
the magazine. It depicts God himself,
changing moods, and all in fifteen
short, unrhymed lines. That it is done
at all is miraculous enough, and it is
well done at that.
Tiny Abstractions
Art Fischer's "Various Tiny Poems,"
do not pretend to such a breadth of
scope and are in consequence shorter.

Indeed, one is only two lines long.
Like abstract art, they demand the
mood and tastes of the reader for
their success.
The Workshop is nearly a sampler.
If one can overlook a lack of real
subject matter, there is a style to suit
everyone. And, perhaps, this is the
real object of Workshop. It is not a
preliminary edition of a Great Litera
ture Anthology. Even this, of course,
does not demand everyone's atten
tion. "Doxology" by Barbara Packer
Length, though undoubtedly a vir
tue in life and snakes, is nevertheless
no measure of the Workshop. The

The essay is interesting, after its
own fashion, and the argument is put
forward in a logical manner. But it
seems as if it had been written at
gunpoint.
Suspenseful Travelogue
For those of us who have been
waiting, the LA-to-Frisco-on-coffee
and-the-Greyhound-bus story has fi
nally been written, and Workshop
has been kind enough to print it.
After a somewhat slow start (the
author seems to have as much trouble
with his gears as the driver), Pat Fo
ley's "The Man Who Bought Things
and Threw Them Away" develops in
to quite an interesting tale.
Lee Whiting seems not to have
perished over Christmas vacation, and
his latest effort, "The Consolation
Prize," is perhaps the high piece of
the magazine. It depicts God himself,
changing moods, and all in fifteen
short, unrhymed lines. That it is done
at all is miraculous enough, and it is
well done at that.
Tiny Abstractions
Art Fischer's "Various Tiny Poems,"
do not pretend to such a breadth of
scope and are in consequence shorter.

Indeed, one is only two lines long.
Like abstract art, they demand the
mood and tastes of the reader for
their success.
The Workshop is nearly a sampler.
If one can overlook a lack of real
subject matter, there is a style to suit
everyone. And, perhaps, this is the
real object of Workshop. It is not a
preliminary edition of a Great Litera
ture Anthology. Even this, of course,
does not demand everyone's atten
tion. "Doxology" by Barbara Packer
Length, though undoubtedly a vir
tue in life and snakes, is nevertheless
no measure of the Workshop. The
dime buys a little more this week, but
of what? The verbiage seems to have
been compiled largely in the manlier
of freshman English themes, and, in
deed, one of the offerings is a fresh
man English theme.
This is Cheri Dyck's piece, "Sum
mertime, and The Livin' is Eeasy . . ."
It is a clever title. It is an ironic ti
tle. It is the last note of life struck in
the essay. This, of course, is only
natural, since the next three pages
give a blow-by-blow account of total
boredom. The style in all ways cor
responds to the subject, and one must
respect Miss Dyck's technical compe
tence. Most of us, however, are not
broadened by boredom, since we have
all observed it.
Better Than Crabs
The piece fulfills the role of an
English theme admirably. It is cer
tainly deeper than tales of the crabs
that stupid little brother brought
back from the trip to the seaside. To
print the essay in an undergraduate
magazine is an unfortunate decision.
The same may be said of "Ortho
doxy is Unconsciousness," by Thomas
Zaniello. "It has the true scholastic
stink." Though the source of that
quotation will remain a mystery to
the reader, Mr. Zaniello's sources will
not. His scholarship is undisputably
Teutonic. "The following passage
(quoted by Schcer on page 40) is
from Life (May 13, 1957)—it is from
an article on ex-President Diem . . ."
(emphasis on life and minute cate
gorization of the same, all his.)
