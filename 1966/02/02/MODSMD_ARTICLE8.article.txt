against the United Technology Center

According to Professor Ernest Hil
gard, chairman of the Executive Com

ly any" teachers are still on strike in
protest of the bombing. He added

those teachers who left their class
rooms in violation of University pol
icy.
210 Telegrams
As of late last night, more than
210 telegrams, the majority addressed
to the Foreign Relations Committee
of the United States Senate, had been
channeled through the ASSU. Most
of them protested the bombing and
called for Congressional debate of
U. S. policy in Vietnam.
In addition, 55 faculty members and
graduate students in the Political Sci
ence Department have sent a tele
gram to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee urging "a public and
thorough debate on our involvement
in Vietnam."
The department's telegram also re
quested that "during the debate,
bombing of North Vietnam cease and
there be no further form of esca
lation."
The action was taken yesterday af
ter a mass meeting of the depart
ment.
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
discussed his concern for the mil

lions involved in the Southeast Asia
conflict before a crowd of 200 in
White Memorial Plaza at noon yes
terday.
Mackenzie, who emphasized that
he was speaking as an individual,
said, "The time is particularly ripe
for Americans who feel concern to
express it. We are very fortunate to
have this opportunity.
He outlined a plan for making tele
gram forms available in the dining
rooms of campus living groups.
"If you agree with me, I urge you
to join me," said Mackenzie.
Unpublished Letters
Professor Christian Bay read to the
crowd from two unpublished letters
he' had sent to the San Francisco
Chronicle.
"It is ironic that we say that one
of the reasons that we are in Viet
nam is to show the Chinese that vio
lence doesn't pay," he read. "Which
nation needs most badly to learn that
violence does not pay?"
Bay paraphrased remarks made by
General Lewis B. Hershey, director of
the Selective Service System:
"The U. S. will always need sol
diers so that we can defend all the
nice things we have, for there are a
lot of hungry people in and around
the world who eat one meal a day
and are resentful at us for eating ..."
'Unjust Cause'
The political science professor se
verely criticized Hershey's attitude.
"Is there any wonder that many
young men of courage and integrity
become political pacifists?" he asked.
"What other recourse do they have,
if they cannot bring themselves to
kill for an unjust cause?"
Keith Lowe of the English Depart
ment explained to the crowd the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam's plans for protesting the pro
duction of napalm at the UTC.
"We in a sense are involved in mak
ing napalm," said Lowe in asking the
crowd to join in the protest.
He explained that the SCPV and
three other groups are planning to
leaflet and picket at the main offices
of UTC at 150 East Arques in Sunny
vale today. The protesters will leave
from the ASSU offices at 3 p.m. and
return at 5, according to Lowe.
Tomorrow, said Lowe, the SCPV
will participate in a "witness" and
pass out leaflets at the UTC plant in
Coyote.
'Public Meetings'
The SCPV has announced that
"public meetings" will be held at noon
in White Plaza throughout the week.
William Mendel, KPFA commentator,
journalist, and expert on Russian af
fairs, will speak at today's rally.
Thursday evening the Americans
for the Reappraisal of Far Eastern
Policy will sponsor a program of
speakers who will attempt to present

for Americans who feel concern to
express it. We are very fortunate to
have this opportunity.
He outlined a plan for making tele

rooms of campus living groups.
"If you agree with me, I urge you
to join me," said Mackenzie.
Unpublished Letters
Professor Christian Bay read to the
crowd from two unpublished letters
he' had sent to the San Francisco
Chronicle.
"It is ironic that we say that one
of the reasons that we are in Viet
nam is to show the Chinese that vio
lence doesn't pay," he read. "Which
nation needs most badly to learn that
violence does not pay?"
Bay paraphrased remarks made by
General Lewis B. Hershey, director of
the Selective Service System:
"The U. S. will always need sol
diers so that we can defend all the
nice things we have, for there are a
lot of hungry people in and around
the world who eat one meal a day
and are resentful at us for eating ..."
'Unjust Cause'
The political science professor se
verely criticized Hershey's attitude.
"Is there any wonder that many
young men of courage and integrity
become political pacifists?" he asked.
"What other recourse do they have,
if they cannot bring themselves to
kill for an unjust cause?"
Keith Lowe of the English Depart
ment explained to the crowd the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam's plans for protesting the pro
duction of napalm at the UTC.
"We in a sense are involved in mak

three other groups are planning to
leaflet and picket at the main offices
of UTC at 150 East Arques in Sunny
