Dave joined Ford Motor Company in July, 1961.
Assigned to our steering and controls section, he helped develop a revolu
tionary steering system that will facilitate driving in future Ford-built cars.
Currently a design engineer working on suspension design and analysis,
Dave has been impressed by the extent to which management encourages
personal initiative among recent graduates like himself. Here, management
looks immediately to young engineers, like Dave, for fresh concepts that
reflect their academic training and special abilities. Moreover, when the
idea is accepted for development, the initiator is frequently given the
opportunity to see the job through —from drawing board to production line!
The experience of Dave Tenniswood is not unusual. Ford Motor Company
believes that early incentive is fundamental to individual growth and a
successful career. If you are interested in a job that challenges your abilities
and rewards enterprise, we urge you t<> contact our representative when
he visits your campus.
