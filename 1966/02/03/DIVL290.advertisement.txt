That Flood of Noah
"The world is on a collision course. When the massive force of an ex
ploding world poulation meets the more stable trend of world food production,
something must give. Unless we give increased attention to the impending
collision, many parts of the world will be skirting a disaster of such propor
tion as to threaten the peace and stability of the western world." This warning
comes from internationally recognized agricultural expert, Professor Earl Butz
of Purdue University.
Earth's three billion souls are expected to double their number in 35
years —by 2000 A.D., soaring upwards in a mounting spiral which all-out ef
forts may not be able to stop.
Population records from the past indicate that earth's population has
doubled on the average every 130 to 146 years. Counting backwards in steps
of this order, one comes to the startling discovery that modern man began to
multiple on the earth only in very recent times, perhaps as late as five thousand
years ago! For one race in particular, the Jewish people (who numbered about
1 5 million in 1 922), we find their origin dates back less than 4 thousand years.
The Bible has something to say about population explosions and the prob
lems of men. Bible chronologies place the flood of Noah at about 2686 BC.
when all men died except eight souls. The Bible also gives the origin of the
Jews (God's chosen nation), descendants of Jacob, the son of Abraham, who
lived about 1 800 B.C. The facts of life from the world around us, and the ever
accurate analysis of the Word of God give every indication that the world
today stands once more on the eve of terrible destruction. Th Bible says men
bring judgment and death upon themselves by their ignorance of the basic
facts of life in a universe sustained by a holy, sovereign God.
Two thousand years ago Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible, predicted, "As
were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. For as in
those days before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they did
know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming
of the Son of man. Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one
is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.
Watch therefore for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But
know this, that of the householder had known what part of the night the thief
was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be
broken into. Therefore you must be ready,- for the Son of man is coming at
an hour you do not expect" (Matthew 24:36 44).
Are you ready for THE END which lies ahead? Is your life secure in the
ark of God, Jesus Christ, Strong Deliverer and Solid Rock, the hope of the ages
and the Savior of the world? He's due back anytime.

That Flood of Noah
"The world is on a collision course. When the massive force of an ex
ploding world poulation meets the more stable trend of world food production,
something must give. Unless we give increased attention to the impending
collision, many parts of the world will be skirting a disaster of such propor
tion as to threaten the peace and stability of the western world." This warning
comes from internationally recognized agricultural expert, Professor Earl Butz
of Purdue University.
Earth's three billion souls are expected to double their number in 35
years —by 2000 A.D., soaring upwards in a mounting spiral which all-out ef
forts may not be able to stop.
Population records from the past indicate that earth's population has
doubled on the average every 130 to 146 years. Counting backwards in steps
of this order, one comes to the startling discovery that modern man began to
multiple on the earth only in very recent times, perhaps as late as five thousand
years ago! For one race in particular, the Jewish people (who numbered about
1 5 million in 1 922), we find their origin dates back less than 4 thousand years.
The Bible has something to say about population explosions and the prob
lems of men. Bible chronologies place the flood of Noah at about 2686 BC.
when all men died except eight souls. The Bible also gives the origin of the
Jews (God's chosen nation), descendants of Jacob, the son of Abraham, who
lived about 1 800 B.C. The facts of life from the world around us, and the ever
accurate analysis of the Word of God give every indication that the world
today stands once more on the eve of terrible destruction. Th Bible says men
bring judgment and death upon themselves by their ignorance of the basic
facts of life in a universe sustained by a holy, sovereign God.
Two thousand years ago Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible, predicted, "As
were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. For as in
those days before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they did
know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming
of the Son of man. Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one
is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.
Watch therefore for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But
know this, that of the householder had known what part of the night the thief
was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be
broken into. Therefore you must be ready,- for the Son of man is coming at
an hour you do not expect" (Matthew 24:36 44).
Are you ready for THE END which lies ahead? Is your life secure in the
ark of God, Jesus Christ, Strong Deliverer and Solid Rock, the hope of the ages
and the Savior of the world? He's due back anytime.
