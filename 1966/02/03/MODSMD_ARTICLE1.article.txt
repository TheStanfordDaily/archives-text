• Nuclear Restraint Urged
MOSCOW — Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin called Wednesday for a ban
on use of nuclear weapons against
countries without such weapons on
their territory.
Western diplomatic sources said
the proposal is new and represents a
Soviet attempt to win more support
for a treaty against spreading of nu
clear weapons.
Presumably, it could also be aimed
at forbidding the United States to use
such weapons in wars like the one in
Vietnam.
• UN To Consider Vietnam
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The
United States won its fight Wednes
day for a full-scalc debate in the
U.N. Security Council on Vietnam
But harsh words from the Soviet
Union appeared to rule out chances
for agreement on any peace plan car
rying a U.N. label.
The vote of Jordan, coming after
last-minute instructions from Am
man, gave U.S. Ambassador Arthur
J. Goldberg victory in his drive for
the required nine affirmative votes
for putting the question formally be
fore the council.
• Senate Debates Vietnam
WASHINGTON — A move by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
to reopen hearings at which members
have criticized U. S. policy in Asia
was blocked Wednesday by Sen. Ever
ett M. Dirksen.
The senator from Arkansas, J. W.
Fulbright, arose to say plaintively
that his Foreign Relations Committee
has a lot of Vietnam business and
wouldn't the Senate let it get about
it?
An aisle away, Dirksen, his feet
planted solidly apart, shook his head
determinedly. "No," he said firmly.
Everybody was exceedingly polite
to everybody else as chairman Ful
bright made a pitch to renew the
hearings in which members last week
scorched Secretary of State Dean
Rusk on Asian policies.
Dirksen said he was perfectly will
ing to clear the way for any action
the Senate wants to take on Vietnam
isues. All Mansfield had to do, he
said, was to withdraw the motion to
take up the union shop bill.
• KKK Leaders Censured

overwhelmingly Wednesday for con
tempt of congress citations against
the imperial wizard of the United
Klans of America, Robert M. Shelton,

Klan said they questioned the pro
priety of the process.

for putting the question formally be
fore the council.
• Senate Debates Vietnam
WASHINGTON — A move by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
to reopen hearings at which members
have criticized U. S. policy in Asia
was blocked Wednesday by Sen. Ever
ett M. Dirksen.
The senator from Arkansas, J. W.
Fulbright, arose to say plaintively
that his Foreign Relations Committee
has a lot of Vietnam business and
wouldn't the Senate let it get about
it?
An aisle away, Dirksen, his feet
planted solidly apart, shook his head
determinedly. "No," he said firmly.
Everybody was exceedingly polite
to everybody else as chairman Ful
bright made a pitch to renew the
hearings in which members last week
scorched Secretary of State Dean
Rusk on Asian policies.
Dirksen said he was perfectly will
ing to clear the way for any action
the Senate wants to take on Vietnam
isues. All Mansfield had to do, he
said, was to withdraw the motion to
take up the union shop bill.
• KKK Leaders Censured
WASHINGTON—The House voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday for con
tempt of congress citations against
the imperial wizard of the United
Klans of America, Robert M. Shelton,
and six of his grand dragons and
other state leaders.
Most of what opposition there was
came from liberals, who while ex
pressing distaste for the Ku Klux
Klan said they questioned the pro
priety of the process.
• Nuclear Restraint Urged
MOSCOW — Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin called Wednesday for a ban
on use of nuclear weapons against
countries without such weapons on
their territory.
Western diplomatic sources said
the proposal is new and represents a
Soviet attempt to win more support
for a treaty against spreading of nu
clear weapons.
Presumably, it could also be aimed
at forbidding the United States to use
such weapons in wars like the one in
Vietnam.
• UN To Consider Vietnam
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The
United States won its fight Wednes
day for a full-scalc debate in the
U.N. Security Council on Vietnam
But harsh words from the Soviet
Union appeared to rule out chances
for agreement on any peace plan car
rying a U.N. label.
The vote of Jordan, coming after
last-minute instructions from Am
man, gave U.S. Ambassador Arthur
J. Goldberg victory in his drive for
the required nine affirmative votes
for putting the question formally be
fore the council.
