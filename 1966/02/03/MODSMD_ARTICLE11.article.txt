Claiming "obvious harassment" for
his anti-Vietnam War activities, Alan
Traister, a former Stanford student,
has refused to comply with draft
board requests to show proof that he
has registered for Selective Service.
That refusal could lead Traister on
a quick route to induction as a "de
linquent", a draft board spokesman
told the Palo Alto Times.
Traister received a letter Thursday
night from the San Jose Draft Board
warning him that it would report him
to the United States Attorney General
unless he appeared at the draft board
on or before January 24 with proof
of his draft registration.
Traister, 24, said he registered a
"long time ago" and feels the letter
was an obvious attempt to intimidate
him. Traister has been the subject of

for attempting to pass out anti-Viet
nam war literature in the County Wel
fare Buidling where he is currently
a social worker.
In a telegram sent to the San Jose
board, Traister did not try to prove
his registration but instead told them
that he could not in good honor com
ply with their request which he re
garded as an harassment.
