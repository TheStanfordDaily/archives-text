ing, and disturbing. It spares
none of the stock figures, white

ing for the squeamish ... it is
scatalogical, bawdy and irreve
rent."

the Minstrel Show is "intelli
gent, perceptive and humorous,
giving vivid expression to many
of our civil wrongs . .
Obscenity Charge

strel Show, loted that it "pokes
fun at the 'egro in his exager
rated naturlism and pokes fun
at the whit in his patronizing
manner."
Davis sii the show took
more than :ne months to write,
produce an rehearse. The pro
duction feaires three white
actors and:hree Negro actors,
but all war the traditional
blackface makeup. In addition
the show rcludes two banjo
players andDavis himself in tho

minstrel low with Stephen
Foster .') ng s, tambourines,
crossfire jigs, and a stump

tended engagement. Last year

in Memorial Auditorium, in a
performance of Bertolt Brecht's
"The Exception and the Rule."
George Duscheck of the San
Francisco Examiner described
the show as "funny, penetrat
ing, and disturbing. It spares
none of the stock figures, white
or black ... It is often hilarious,
but just as often savagely bru
tal in making its points. A warn
ing for the squeamish ... it is
scatalogical, bawdy and irreve
rent."
The Chronicle remarked that
the Minstrel Show is "intelli
gent, perceptive and humorous,
giving vivid expression to many
of our civil wrongs . .

rated naturlism and pokes fun
at the whit in his patronizing
manner."
Davis sii the show took
more than :ne months to write,
produce an rehearse. The pro
duction feaires three white
actors and:hree Negro actors,
