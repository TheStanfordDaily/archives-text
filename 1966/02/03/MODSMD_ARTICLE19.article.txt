# Terman Notes Red Tape Entangles Red Engineers

Although Russia is producing
engineers four-to-one over the
United States and plans to turn
them out even faster, the Soviet
technical economy is far smaller
than America's.
"What can they be doing with
all those engineers?" asked Dr.
Frederick E. Terman, scientist
engineer-educator in a campus
interview following his recent
26-day visit to the USSR.
"They are using substantially
greater numbers of engineers in
a smaller economy, and still
there is a lack of craftsmanship
in many places," he said. "We

can only conclude they are not
using them efficiently."
With him on the trip were
two educators from MIT, Mech
anical Engineering Prof. Nor
man Dahl and International Cen
ter specialist Alexander Korol.
Their educational exchange visit
was sponsored by the U.S. Of
fice of Education.
The three Americans visited
Moscow. Leningrad and Kiev.
They talked to administrators
and faculty members of many
Russian educational institutions
concerned with science and en
gineering, from high schools to
the highest university levels.
"Russia is truly a land of con
trasts and contradictions," Dr.
Terman continued. They can put
men in space but their plumbing
doesn't work very well.
"Our Russian jet was a good
one, a highly sophisticated ma
chine. But they still haven't
worked out an adequate ele
vator system for high-rise build
ings. It isn't unusual to wait 20
minutes for an elevator.
Everything in Russia is dom
inated by law, no matter what
the facts. For instance, the 1958
educational reforms instituted

by Khrushchev called for com
bining more on-the-job experi
ence with education.
"It hasn't worked out—as we
could have told them it would
n't," he added with a smile.
"While the Khrushchev reform
policy is still in effect, many
modifications have led to its be
coming largely abandoned. Yet
if you ask a Russian he will
tell you it represented an im
portant step in education.
Students can enter college
only in the fall. They can apply
to only one school, must decide
their major subject before en
tering, and if not accepted for
that major at that school must
wait another year to re-apply.
There are no second or third
choices on the application.
"Student attrition is very low
—sometimes as little as three
per cent from entrance to gradu
aion," said the Stanford ob
server. "It is built into the offi
cial plans. If the state plan calls
for a school to accept 100 fresh
men for a certain speciality and
graduate 95 of them, the school
takes in 100 and graduates 95
in that speciality five years
later."
