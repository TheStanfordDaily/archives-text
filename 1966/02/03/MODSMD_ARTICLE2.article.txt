# ARFEP Features Mancall, Van Slyke On Asia Policy
## 
### 
Professors Mancall and Van Slyke
will speak on "History of United
States Foreign Policy in Asia Since
1900," tonight in Tresidder Union
Room 274 at 8:15 p.m. The program
sponsored by Americans for Reap
praisal of Far Eastern Policy
(ARFEP) will be followed by a ques
tion period.
The program will be an unbiased,
dispassionate report of the situation,
rioted Dave Shookhoff, acting chair
man of ARFEP. He added that this
would facilitate "debate based on fact
rather than response to propaganda."
Shookhoff commented that a new
segment of the student body, as ex
pressed in Alstetter's Letter To The
Editor in yesterday's Daily, is now
concerned with the situation in South
East Asia. Any movement must be
informative, he continued, "rational
and intelligent."

Professor of History Van Slyke who
will speak on The U.S.-Chinese For
eign relations hopes that the speech
es will help students "make up their
minds from the background of the
problem rather than from emotion."
The program was scheduled in
light of the new student reaction to
"perpetuate the new spirit," said
Dave Shookhoff. He considered other
similar programs concerning the Viet
nam situation valuable, but he felt im
mediacy was of prime importance in
order not to alienate the new campus
concern.
