# Talented Bears Tumble Ill-Fated SU Gymnasts
## 
### HUGH WEST 
Ten points are supposed to
make up a perfect score in a
gymnastics event. That means
a team would have to score 210
points for a perfect meet.
Individual gymnasts rarely
approach perfect scores and the
possibilities for a whole team to
achieve perfection are even
rarer.
But Tuesday evening the Uni
versity of California's Golden
Bears came about as close as
possible to team perfection in
a remarkable display of power
against Stanford and Brigham
Young at the Stanford Pavilion.
The Bears racked up 186.9
points, an average of 8.9 points
per man to BYU's 163.9 and
Stanford's 76.9.
Some Didn't Count
As an ultimate gesture, Cal
had several men scoring eight
points and above in some events
who were not even good enough
to count in the team's scoring.
The key to the Bear attack
were two superb Ail-Around
men for structure and men good
in individual events to fill in the
holes in constructing the mas
sive point total.
Sid Freudenstein, the official

Ail-Around man for Berkeley
collected 54.7 points, an average
of 9.1 points for each of the six
events. Freudenstein actually
went all seven events, garnering
7.5 points in the trampoline.
Millmun Stars
Dan Millman also went six
events, though he participated
in the trampoline and missed
the side horse. The 1963 World
Trampoline Champion and 1965
NCAA runner-up and defend
ing NCAA long horse champion,
Millman collected 54.40 points,
through his 8.65 in the parallel
bars was not good enough to
place for Cal.
Fill-in men were the likes of
Josh Robinson, whose phenom
enal ring display earned him a
9.65 rating, the highest score
in the meet. Bill Fijimoto's 9.15
side horse performance beat
Stanford grad student a n d
twice NCAA champion Rusty
Mills, who missed his dismount
and scored an 8.9. Tom Bruce
contributed a 9.0 in the long
horse and Rick Field a 9.05 in
the parallel bars.
Evil Spirit
Stanford, meanwhile, was hav
ing one more bout with the Evil
Spirit. The latest development

in an unending string of cas
ualties was Pete Gibson's
sprained ankle. Gibson dropped
out of two events, but courag
eously went ahead in the par
allel bar competition and hob
bled off with a good 6.55 score.
Bob Cook showed continued
improvement with a best-ever
46-point Ail-Around score. High
light of the evening for Cook
was a much more difficult ring
routine which earned him an 8.3
score.
Brigham Young fielded a very
good team which was only over
shadowed by the greatness of
the Berkeley contingent. Rich
ard Nicholas' 51-point Ail-
Around was excellent and Tom
French contributed a 9.15 in the
Free exercise and a 9.45 in the
long horse, while Perry Guinn
turned in a 9.25 ring routine.
The Indians meet Chico State
this weekend at Chico State.
