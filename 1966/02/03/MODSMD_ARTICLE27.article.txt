# Schollander Readies For Initial Collegiate Plunge
## 
### LOU BLACK Associated Press Sports Writer 
NEW HAVEN, Corm. (AP) —
Don Schollander, the fabulous
winner of four Olympic gold
medals for swimming, makes his
first Yale varsity appearance
Saturday, a splash eagerly
awaited by many.
The blond with the dimples
and a boyish grin has been en
tered in only one event—the
anchor leg in the 400-yard med
ley relay — against undefeated
Navy.
But if the competition is tight,
Coach Phil Moriarty says Schol
lander will be ready for other
tests.
Hardly Can Wait
Among those who barely can
wait for the swim is Schollan
der himself. To Don, who'll be
20 in April, the meet starts a
drive for national and world
honors that will reach its cli
max in the 1968 Olympics in
Mexico City.
The young swimmer from
Lake Oswego, Ore., became eli
gible for varsity only last week.
He didn't start his freshman
year at Yale until February

Schollander, a bout with mo

fine, he said Wednesday. "I've
been swimming every day and
doing as well as I ever did at

His coach said Don is shaping
up excellent. Schollander came
down with mononucleosis — a
disease bringing on fever, gen
eral weakness, headaches and a
swelling of the lymph glands —
last June while in Switzerland.
Schollander resumed swim
ming when he returned to Yale
in September and has been
swimming IVi hours daily—all
he has time for between classes
and studies.

NEW HAVEN, Corm. (AP) —
Don Schollander, the fabulous
winner of four Olympic gold
medals for swimming, makes his
first Yale varsity appearance
Saturday, a splash eagerly
awaited by many.
The blond with the dimples
and a boyish grin has been en
tered in only one event—the
anchor leg in the 400-yard med
ley relay — against undefeated
Navy.
But if the competition is tight,
Coach Phil Moriarty says Schol
lander will be ready for other
tests.
Hardly Can Wait
Among those who barely can
wait for the swim is Schollan
der himself. To Don, who'll be
20 in April, the meet starts a
drive for national and world
honors that will reach its cli
max in the 1968 Olympics in
Mexico City.
The young swimmer from
Lake Oswego, Ore., became eli
gible for varsity only last week.
He didn't start his freshman
year at Yale until February

Mononucleosis
Schollander, a bout with mo
noucleosis behind him, feels
fine, he said Wednesday. "I've
been swimming every day and
doing as well as I ever did at
this time of the year."
His coach said Don is shaping
up excellent. Schollander came
down with mononucleosis — a
disease bringing on fever, gen
eral weakness, headaches and a
swelling of the lymph glands —
last June while in Switzerland.
Schollander resumed swim
ming when he returned to Yale
in September and has been
swimming IVi hours daily—all
he has time for between classes
and studies.

NEW HAVEN, Corm. (AP) —
Don Schollander, the fabulous
winner of four Olympic gold
medals for swimming, makes his
first Yale varsity appearance
Saturday, a splash eagerly
awaited by many.
The blond with the dimples
and a boyish grin has been en
tered in only one event—the
anchor leg in the 400-yard med
ley relay — against undefeated
Navy.
But if the competition is tight,
Coach Phil Moriarty says Schol
lander will be ready for other
tests.
Hardly Can Wait
Among those who barely can
wait for the swim is Schollan
der himself. To Don, who'll be
20 in April, the meet starts a
drive for national and world
honors that will reach its cli
max in the 1968 Olympics in
Mexico City.
The young swimmer from
Lake Oswego, Ore., became eli
gible for varsity only last week.
He didn't start his freshman
year at Yale until February
