# Vietnam: What Next?
## 
### 
I am one of those who believe we are
approaching the point of no return to World
War 111.
Senator Joseph S. Clark
February 2,1966
Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois stood
on the floor of the United States Senate yester
day and, in his usually mellifluous voice, said
no — and thereby blocked, for the time being,
any chance that the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee might resume hearings on United
States policy in Asia.
At the United Nations, Russia was one of two
countries yesterday to vote "no" as the Security
Council voted to open debate on the Vietnam
war. With a veto power over nonprocedural
questions, Russia is exceedingly likely to block
the possibility of any action by the U.N.
And so it appears that chances of any effect
ive debate, on either a national or international
level, have been forestalled.
Whether President Johnson, hiding behind his
mask of "good faith," had a sly foreknowledge
of the day's events can only be conjecture. We
have the feeling, however, that the President's
recently improved relationship with the senator
could have been used, had Johnson so desired,
to pave the way for a national debate over the
expanding war.
So where do we go from here?
The only reasonable answer for those who are

convinced that the people of the United States
—and not just the President —should have a
voice in the future is for those people to make
their voices heard.
As we said Tuesday, this can be done through
telegrams and letters to Washington asking that
the people he told what is going on in Asia and
be allowed to question, through their elected
representatives, the purpose and scope of the
war.
Should such efforts prove ineffective, then
perhaps demonstrations are the only recourse.
And should demonstrations likewise produce
no debate, we might well contemplate resigning
ourselves, like Senator Clark, to the imminence
of World War 111.

Campus Debate

Now that the emotions of the past few days
have begun to ebb, it would be extremely
worthwhile for the various campus organiza
tions concerned with the Vietnam conflict —
SCPV, VDC, CONSCIENCE, ARFEP, and
VIVE —to resume the debates of Autumn Quar
ter.
Many individuals on campus have complained
of an information lack which these groups, by
working in some degree of harmony, could fill.

I am one of those who believe we are
approaching the point of no return to World
War 111.
Senator Joseph S. Clark
February 2,1966
Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois stood
on the floor of the United States Senate yester
day and, in his usually mellifluous voice, said
no — and thereby blocked, for the time being,
any chance that the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee might resume hearings on United
States policy in Asia.
At the United Nations, Russia was one of two
countries yesterday to vote "no" as the Security
Council voted to open debate on the Vietnam
war. With a veto power over nonprocedural
questions, Russia is exceedingly likely to block
the possibility of any action by the U.N.
And so it appears that chances of any effect
ive debate, on either a national or international
level, have been forestalled.
Whether President Johnson, hiding behind his
mask of "good faith," had a sly foreknowledge
of the day's events can only be conjecture. We
have the feeling, however, that the President's
recently improved relationship with the senator
could have been used, had Johnson so desired,
to pave the way for a national debate over the
expanding war.
So where do we go from here?
The only reasonable answer for those who are

convinced that the people of the United States
—and not just the President —should have a
voice in the future is for those people to make
their voices heard.
As we said Tuesday, this can be done through
telegrams and letters to Washington asking that
the people he told what is going on in Asia and
be allowed to question, through their elected
representatives, the purpose and scope of the
war.
Should such efforts prove ineffective, then
perhaps demonstrations are the only recourse.
And should demonstrations likewise produce
no debate, we might well contemplate resigning
ourselves, like Senator Clark, to the imminence
of World War 111.

Campus Debate

Now that the emotions of the past few days
have begun to ebb, it would be extremely
worthwhile for the various campus organiza
tions concerned with the Vietnam conflict —
SCPV, VDC, CONSCIENCE, ARFEP, and
VIVE —to resume the debates of Autumn Quar
ter.
Many individuals on campus have complained
of an information lack which these groups, by
working in some degree of harmony, could fill.
