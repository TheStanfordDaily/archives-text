## Tragedy, Hopeâ€”Or Farce? 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
It was no normal day, Janu
ary 31, 1966, but then, there was
no reason why it should have
been.
The events of January 31,
1966 have been slow in arriving,
but they were expected. Six
teen years ago General Douglas
Mac Arthur predicted what the
events of January 31, 1966
would be. Sixteen years ago
Mac Arthur was "fired" for be
ing right. In sixteen years nei
ther the Government nor a very
vocal part of the people of the
United States have made much
headway in finding out the
truth about Southeast Asia; the
fact that it is a breeding ground
for social discontent and Com
munism.
Isolation and Brinksmanship
Now the United States is
again waging a war to prevent
the spread of Communism. To
say that the War in Vietnam
is unpopular is an understate
ment; to say that the War in
Vietnam is not necessary is
wrong. There are those people
who argue that it is better to let
the Communists have South
Vietnam than to fight for it, but
where is the line to be drawn?
When do we stop giving in?
When China bombs Britain? or
us? The policies of isolation and
brinkmanship no longer have
any place in the United States.
We can no longer give in until
the point where our shores are
the only territory left to de
fend. We can no longer deny our
obligation to the free world.
On January 31, 1966, Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson decided
that the only way to end the
conflict in Vietnam is to win it.
His decision was presumably
based upon having in his pos
session facts which are not and
cannot be known by the general
public, or even by the Senate.
With these facts in his posses
sion President Johnson ordered
that the lull in the bombing of
North Vietnam be lifted.
Anarchy vs. Reason
The uproar that resulted from
this decision was in no way sim
ilar to the despair the nation
felt at the news of President
Kennedy's assassination. Novem
ber 22, 1963 was a brilliant ex
ample of the permanency of the
United States Government. On
a day when anarchy could have
been practicable, reason reigned.
January 31, 1966 was a day
when reason should have
reigned and anarchy did.
Write your Senator was the
battle cry for the day. Urge for
a full Senate Investigation ex
horted the VDC. This was anar
chy. The United States is in a
shooting conflict in South Viet
nam, but it cannot, technically,
be at war. The Constitution of
the United States, the same
document that saw this country

through the crisis of November
22, 1963, has made provisions
for the crisis of January 31,
1966. According to the Constitu
tion only the Senate may de
clare war. In all other circum
stances the Constitution states
that the President shall act as
the Commander-in-Chief of th e
armed forces of the United
States. To question his decisions,
or to ask the Senate to do so, is
to question the Constitution.
This is anarchy.
Debate Not In Order
Those people who are opposed
to the war in Vietnam urge a
public debate of our position
there. Public debate is out of or
der. Inherent in the system of
representative government by
which the United States is gov
erned is the idea that there are
times when the representatives
know more than the people.
Such is the situation now. The
President has acted in the best
interest of the people; the peo

ple elected him to do that. Has
the time come for the people
of the United States to learn
from the past, or are we, as a
nation, once again to fire a man
for being right? Time has made
South Vietnam as important to
the United States as is any State
in the Union. We must defend it
no less vigorously than we
would any State in the Union.
Right of Protest
No one questions the right of
the citizens of the United
States to protest the actions of
the Government as long as
those protests are not detrimen
tal to the Country as a whole.
The time has come however,
when these protests are serious
ly endangering the chances for
peace in Vietnam, the same
peace that is being so ardently
called for. To tolerate this type
of anarchy at a time like this
is unthinkable. To call for it,
like overplayed Greek tragedy,
is farcical.


"Peace efforts will continue even though
the bombings are resumed."

the United States as is any State
in the Union. We must defend it
no less vigorously than we
would any State in the Union.
Right of Protest
No one questions the right of
the citizens of the United
States to protest the actions of
the Government as long as
those protests are not detrimen
tal to the Country as a whole.
The time has come however,
when these protests are serious
ly endangering the chances for
peace in Vietnam, the same
peace that is being so ardently
called for. To tolerate this type
of anarchy at a time like this
is unthinkable. To call for it,
like overplayed Greek tragedy,
is farcical.


"Peace efforts will continue even though
the bombings are resumed."
It was no normal day, Janu
ary 31, 1966, but then, there was
no reason why it should have
been.
The events of January 31,
1966 have been slow in arriving,
but they were expected. Six
teen years ago General Douglas
Mac Arthur predicted what the
events of January 31, 1966
would be. Sixteen years ago
Mac Arthur was "fired" for be
ing right. In sixteen years nei
ther the Government nor a very
vocal part of the people of the
United States have made much
headway in finding out the
truth about Southeast Asia; the
fact that it is a breeding ground
for social discontent and Com
munism.
Isolation and Brinksmanship
Now the United States is
again waging a war to prevent
the spread of Communism. To
say that the War in Vietnam
is unpopular is an understate
ment; to say that the War in
Vietnam is not necessary is
wrong. There are those people
who argue that it is better to let
the Communists have South
Vietnam than to fight for it, but
where is the line to be drawn?
When do we stop giving in?
When China bombs Britain? or
us? The policies of isolation and
brinkmanship no longer have
any place in the United States.
We can no longer give in until
the point where our shores are
the only territory left to de
fend. We can no longer deny our
obligation to the free world.
On January 31, 1966, Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson decided
that the only way to end the
conflict in Vietnam is to win it.
His decision was presumably
based upon having in his pos
session facts which are not and
cannot be known by the general
public, or even by the Senate.
With these facts in his posses
sion President Johnson ordered
that the lull in the bombing of
North Vietnam be lifted.
Anarchy vs. Reason
The uproar that resulted from
this decision was in no way sim
ilar to the despair the nation
felt at the news of President
Kennedy's assassination. Novem
ber 22, 1963 was a brilliant ex
ample of the permanency of the
United States Government. On
a day when anarchy could have
been practicable, reason reigned.
January 31, 1966 was a day
when reason should have
reigned and anarchy did.
Write your Senator was the
battle cry for the day. Urge for
a full Senate Investigation ex
horted the VDC. This was anar
chy. The United States is in a
shooting conflict in South Viet
nam, but it cannot, technically,
be at war. The Constitution of
the United States, the same
document that saw this country

through the crisis of November
22, 1963, has made provisions
for the crisis of January 31,
1966. According to the Constitu
tion only the Senate may de
clare war. In all other circum
stances the Constitution states
that the President shall act as
the Commander-in-Chief of th e
armed forces of the United
States. To question his decisions,
or to ask the Senate to do so, is
to question the Constitution.
This is anarchy.
Debate Not In Order
Those people who are opposed
to the war in Vietnam urge a
public debate of our position
there. Public debate is out of or
der. Inherent in the system of
representative government by
which the United States is gov
erned is the idea that there are
times when the representatives
know more than the people.
Such is the situation now. The
President has acted in the best
interest of the people; the peo

ple elected him to do that. Has
the time come for the people
of the United States to learn
from the past, or are we, as a
nation, once again to fire a man
for being right? Time has made
South Vietnam as important to
the United States as is any State
in the Union. We must defend it

Those people who are opposed
to the war in Vietnam urge a
public debate of our position
there. Public debate is out of or
der. Inherent in the system of
representative government by
which the United States is gov
erned is the idea that there are
times when the representatives
know more than the people.
Such is the situation now. The
President has acted in the best
interest of the people; the peo

ple elected him to do that. Has
the time come for the people
of the United States to learn
from the past, or are we, as a
nation, once again to fire a man
for being right? Time has made
South Vietnam as important to
the United States as is any State
in the Union. We must defend it
no less vigorously than we
would any State in the Union.
Right of Protest
No one questions the right of
the citizens of the United
States to protest the actions of
the Government as long as
those protests are not detrimen
tal to the Country as a whole.
The time has come however,
when these protests are serious
ly endangering the chances for
peace in Vietnam, the same
peace that is being so ardently
called for. To tolerate this type
of anarchy at a time like this
is unthinkable. To call for it,
like overplayed Greek tragedy,
is farcical.


"Peace efforts will continue even though
the bombings are resumed."
It was no normal day, Janu
ary 31, 1966, but then, there was
no reason why it should have
been.
The events of January 31,
1966 have been slow in arriving,
but they were expected. Six
teen years ago General Douglas
Mac Arthur predicted what the
events of January 31, 1966
would be. Sixteen years ago
Mac Arthur was "fired" for be
ing right. In sixteen years nei
ther the Government nor a very
vocal part of the people of the
United States have made much
headway in finding out the
truth about Southeast Asia; the
fact that it is a breeding ground
for social discontent and Com
munism.
Isolation and Brinksmanship
Now the United States is
again waging a war to prevent
the spread of Communism. To
say that the War in Vietnam
is unpopular is an understate
ment; to say that the War in
Vietnam is not necessary is
wrong. There are those people
who argue that it is better to let
the Communists have South
Vietnam than to fight for it, but
where is the line to be drawn?
When do we stop giving in?
When China bombs Britain? or
us? The policies of isolation and
brinkmanship no longer have
any place in the United States.
We can no longer give in until
the point where our shores are
the only territory left to de
fend. We can no longer deny our
obligation to the free world.
On January 31, 1966, Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson decided
that the only way to end the
conflict in Vietnam is to win it.
His decision was presumably
based upon having in his pos
session facts which are not and
cannot be known by the general
public, or even by the Senate.
With these facts in his posses
sion President Johnson ordered
that the lull in the bombing of
North Vietnam be lifted.
Anarchy vs. Reason
The uproar that resulted from
this decision was in no way sim
ilar to the despair the nation
felt at the news of President
Kennedy's assassination. Novem
ber 22, 1963 was a brilliant ex
ample of the permanency of the
United States Government. On
a day when anarchy could have
been practicable, reason reigned.
January 31, 1966 was a day
when reason should have
reigned and anarchy did.
Write your Senator was the
battle cry for the day. Urge for
a full Senate Investigation ex
horted the VDC. This was anar
chy. The United States is in a
shooting conflict in South Viet
nam, but it cannot, technically,
be at war. The Constitution of
the United States, the same
document that saw this country

through the crisis of November
22, 1963, has made provisions
for the crisis of January 31,
1966. According to the Constitu
tion only the Senate may de
clare war. In all other circum
stances the Constitution states
that the President shall act as
the Commander-in-Chief of th e
armed forces of the United
States. To question his decisions,
or to ask the Senate to do so, is
to question the Constitution.
This is anarchy.
