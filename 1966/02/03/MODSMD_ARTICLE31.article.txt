# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						Controversy Continues 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
At the 4 p.m. meeting at Cub
berly Monday afternoon some
thing significant happened: a
"radical" suggestion (marching
on Moffett Field) was rejected
for a "moderate" one (marching
to the Palo Alto Post Office).
I think this attitude is great,
I hope it continues, and I com
mend those who went along with
it even though they thought
that a more dramatic protest
was called for. While I think I
might have been willing to
march on Moffett, I think many
in the crowd would not have.
There were many at the Mon
day night march, including my
self, who had never marched
before. I think everything pos
sible must be done to keep these
people marching, and to get
more like them to march, and
more, and more, and more. And
to write letters, and send tele
grams, and yell as loud as they
can yell. And this means staging
protests that will attract as
many people as possible. Not
breaking laws. Not engaging in
civil disobedience. Not, as was
done Monday, bringing up oth
er questions like Santo Domin
go. If this movement tries to be
a solid ideological front, it has
no hope at all. What I think it
should be, and was somewhat
yesterday, for the first time, is
a big bunch of people, whatever
their stands on other issues,
who want to end the war in
Vietnam.
There are times for throwing
ideology to the winds and just
jumping in and working as hard
as you can and accomodating
yourself to as many people as
you can. I think this is one of
those times; I really think we
are tottering on the brink of ut
ter disaster.
Wire your Congressman!

• Journalistic Bigot
Editor, TTlfe Daily:
Perhaps the difference be
tween an open-minded editor and
a journalistic bigot is not as
great as I once thought. The
pointlessness of your statement
concerning the apparent imma
turity of freshmen is only ex
ceeded by its astounding gen
erality. If you will think back
(it must have been a long time
ago) to when you were a fresh
man, possibly you will remem
ber that you expressed an opin
ion with more spontanaeity and,
perhaps, more forthrightness
than you evidenced in your main
editorial. Did you tear your hair
out, cry, boo, faint, vomit, or
in a similar fashion express
your dismay at the resumption
of bombing in Vietnam? The
more vociferous expression of
the opinion should create no
more of a general impression
than the opinion expressed by
the silence of those who didn't
"burst into applause." Evident
ly it did in this case, however,

as you wasted no time in draw
ing the conclusion that since all
freshman disagree with you, all
freshmen are immature in
thought as well as in action. As
for the sign appearing in one
window in one Wilbur House
putting down Reverend Coffin,
I wonder if the editor made an
attempt to find out what any
one else thought about the man.
Probably he would have stum
bled across the truth, which is
that Coffin is highly respected
by a great many freshmen. Val
uable type space shouldn't be
wasted in expressing the editor's
disgust that anyone would have
the audacity, and obvious stu
pidity, to disagree with him.
CHARLES F. YVELLMAN,

(Editor's note: If IVIr. Well
man will re-read the editorial,
he will note that we were not
disagreeing: with the views ex
pressed by the freshmen, but
rather with the methods l>y
which they were expressed. We
did not mention the eggs and
firecrackers that were thrown
by Wilbur boys at the mareh

seemed overgeneralized, and
suggest that Mr. Wellman read

• Immature Frosh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call attention
to the appalling actions of the
apathetic freshmen of Wilbur
Hall. When a supposedly intel
ligent group of people cheers
the report of renewed bombing
in Vietnam, and jeers the an
nouncement of a rally by sin
cere people questioning this de
velopment, it indicates a very
immature attitude on their part.
A serious situation is develop
ing in Vietnam which deserves
intelligent, thoughtful conside
ration.
If a relatively mature and
concerned group such as this
spontaneously rejects any pro
test as completely irrational and
"Communist-inspired," seriously
or not, then how are the rela
tively immature and uncon
cerned masses of this country to
be expected to think, to question,
to apply themselves to the
"democratic principles" of our
country?
Questions have to be raised
somewhere ... or are we to be
led by Johnson and his s e 1 f
righteous blindfold, right or
wrong?

• Fanaticism
Editor, The Daily:
The first paragraph in Tues
day's editorial is typical of the
misguided fanaticism that is
turning the Peace in Vietnam
movement into a travesty on
legitimate protest. Worse than
that, it is a slight on the char
acter of the American people.
I find it repulsive to corn

pare the resumption of Ameri
can bombing in North Vietnam,
a matter of national concern,
with the assassination of a Pres
ident of the United States, a na
tional tragedy that transcends
political and ideological differ
ences.
DARREL COWAN
• Unity Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford movement to
stop the war in Vietnam ac
quired new strength Monday;
but old mistakes were made
again that will dissipate this
strength if positive, moderate,
counteraction is not taken now.
The crucial question here is
this: Do the leaders really wish
to stop tiie war, or do they
wish to use the movement to
increase their own power, to
salve their consciences, to con
vince themselves and others
that they will still be here after
the holocaust, at which time
they will congratulate them
selves heartily because they
were among the visionary mi
nority all along?
If a program of quiet educa
tion is undertaken in and
around this campus, and if
truly patriotic, nonrevolution
ary Americans are persuaded
that this war is morally unten
able and disastrous to world
safety (the use of nuclear
weapons is being considered),
then if they are shown positive,
practical, political actions that
they may take, this war can be
stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum
ni, administrators, employees,
and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na
tional Coordinating Committee
in October was one instance of a
selfishness that is no longer tol
erable. The SCPV, as leader of
the Stanford movement, is now
being put to the test. Do they
want to stop the war, or do they
want to start a Survivors' Club?

• Sell 'War' Stocks
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is true, as
you have editorialized, that
Monday's faculty strike was
more an action directed against
the university than against
President Johnson. Further
more it was again only a sym
bolic gesture. I suggest that in
order to protest effectively
against Washington's war pol
icy through the university it is
necessary to focus on where
their interests coincide. There
fore I recommend that the facul
ty ask the university to reveal
in detail their stock holdings as
well as the other sources of
their revenue so that the facul
ty might urge that holdings in
war industries and like sources
of income be sold. Furthermore,
and perhaps more importantly,
the faculty should ask that the
nature of all scientific research
projects here be exposed so that
those which benefit the war ma
chine may be cancelled. At Mon
day's White Plaza meeting many
professors lamented the course
of this disastrous war and its
deleterious effect upon Ameri
can universities both practically
and morally. Cancelling a class
or two will change nothing.
What I have suggested might
well improve the state of af
fairs.

GRAHAM BAKER
• Bad Attitude
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. John R.
Mac Donald's letter in the Feb
ruary 1 issue of The Daily, I am
somewhat distressed at the light
ning speed with which he is
ready to advocate firing profes
sors. The punishment he thus
advocates is out of proportion to
the "offense" committed by
those faculty members who can
celled their classes. Firing, as a
panacea for all kinds of ills, real
or imaginary, seems to be the
favorite method of American
Business for dealing with prob
lems, but such thinking should
have no place in an academic en
vironment. A college professor
is, or should be, more, much
more than a mere "employee."
The very nature of education,
the enormous amount of train
ing which goes into the making
of a professor (for which he
never seems to be adequately
compensated), the great and
sometimes contradictory de
mands which are made on him
throughout his career, all these
warrant a different attitude on
the part of students. We are not,
or should not be, your hired
servants. As for the "student's
money" that pays for our sala
ries, I wonder how many stu
dents know that their tuition
(no doubt quite a drain on their
families) pays for only 40 per
cent of the University's operat
ing costs, and ergo, of profes
sors' salaries! This considera
tion would certainly reduce Mr.
Mac Donald's "refund." His quan
titive approach reflects a busi
ness mentality, not a scholarly
one.

• Napalm Facts
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a
statement made in Tuesday's
Dally. Napalm is not a "poison
ess gas." It is a form of jellied
gasoline used as an incendiary
weapon, and a very effective
one, too. However, it will not
kill anyone deader than a bullet,
nor will it disfigure the body
any more than the fancy knife
work (beheading and disem
bowling) which seems to be "in"
with the Viet Cong.
I might add that I am a "war
monger," and that I will follow
the advice of your editorial and
write my senators — to urge
them to support the administra
tion's policy in Vietnam.

stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum

and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na
tional Coordinating Committee
in October was one instance of a
selfishness that is no longer tol
erable. The SCPV, as leader of
the Stanford movement, is now
being put to the test. Do they
want to stop the war, or do they
want to start a Survivors' Club?

• Sell 'War' Stocks
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is true, as
you have editorialized, that
Monday's faculty strike was
more an action directed against
the university than against
President Johnson. Further
more it was again only a sym
bolic gesture. I suggest that in
order to protest effectively
against Washington's war pol
icy through the university it is
necessary to focus on where
their interests coincide. There
fore I recommend that the facul
ty ask the university to reveal
in detail their stock holdings as
well as the other sources of
their revenue so that the facul
ty might urge that holdings in
war industries and like sources
of income be sold. Furthermore,
and perhaps more importantly,
the faculty should ask that the
nature of all scientific research
projects here be exposed so that
those which benefit the war ma
chine may be cancelled. At Mon
day's White Plaza meeting many
professors lamented the course
of this disastrous war and its
deleterious effect upon Ameri
can universities both practically
and morally. Cancelling a class
or two will change nothing.
What I have suggested might
well improve the state of af

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. John R.

somewhat distressed at the light

ready to advocate firing profes

advocates is out of proportion to
the "offense" committed by

Business for dealing with prob

have no place in an academic en

more than a mere "employee."
The very nature of education,
the enormous amount of train

I would like to correct a
statement made in Tuesday's

gasoline used as an incendiary
weapon, and a very effective
one, too. However, it will not
kill anyone deader than a bullet,
nor will it disfigure the body

ROBERT C. JOHNSON
Editor, The Daily:
At the 4 p.m. meeting at Cub
berly Monday afternoon some
thing significant happened: a
"radical" suggestion (marching
on Moffett Field) was rejected
for a "moderate" one (marching
to the Palo Alto Post Office).
I think this attitude is great,
I hope it continues, and I com
mend those who went along with
it even though they thought
that a more dramatic protest
was called for. While I think I
might have been willing to
march on Moffett, I think many
in the crowd would not have.
There were many at the Mon
day night march, including my
self, who had never marched
before. I think everything pos
sible must be done to keep these
people marching, and to get
more like them to march, and
more, and more, and more. And
to write letters, and send tele
grams, and yell as loud as they
can yell. And this means staging
protests that will attract as
many people as possible. Not
breaking laws. Not engaging in
civil disobedience. Not, as was
done Monday, bringing up oth
er questions like Santo Domin
go. If this movement tries to be
a solid ideological front, it has
no hope at all. What I think it
should be, and was somewhat
yesterday, for the first time, is
a big bunch of people, whatever
their stands on other issues,
who want to end the war in
Vietnam.
There are times for throwing
ideology to the winds and just
jumping in and working as hard
as you can and accomodating
yourself to as many people as
you can. I think this is one of
those times; I really think we
are tottering on the brink of ut

• Journalistic Bigot
Editor, TTlfe Daily:
Perhaps the difference be
tween an open-minded editor and
a journalistic bigot is not as
great as I once thought. The
pointlessness of your statement
concerning the apparent imma
turity of freshmen is only ex
ceeded by its astounding gen
erality. If you will think back
(it must have been a long time
ago) to when you were a fresh
man, possibly you will remem
ber that you expressed an opin
ion with more spontanaeity and,
perhaps, more forthrightness
than you evidenced in your main
editorial. Did you tear your hair
out, cry, boo, faint, vomit, or
in a similar fashion express
your dismay at the resumption
of bombing in Vietnam? The
more vociferous expression of
the opinion should create no
more of a general impression
than the opinion expressed by
the silence of those who didn't
"burst into applause." Evident
ly it did in this case, however,

as you wasted no time in draw
ing the conclusion that since all
freshman disagree with you, all
freshmen are immature in
thought as well as in action. As
for the sign appearing in one
window in one Wilbur House
putting down Reverend Coffin,
I wonder if the editor made an
attempt to find out what any
one else thought about the man.
Probably he would have stum
bled across the truth, which is
that Coffin is highly respected
by a great many freshmen. Val
uable type space shouldn't be
wasted in expressing the editor's
disgust that anyone would have
the audacity, and obvious stu
pidity, to disagree with him.
CHARLES F. YVELLMAN,

(Editor's note: If IVIr. Well

he will note that we were not

pressed by the freshmen, but
rather with the methods l>y

did not mention the eggs and

• Immature Frosh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call attention
to the appalling actions of the
apathetic freshmen of Wilbur
Hall. When a supposedly intel
ligent group of people cheers
the report of renewed bombing
in Vietnam, and jeers the an
nouncement of a rally by sin
cere people questioning this de
velopment, it indicates a very
immature attitude on their part.
A serious situation is develop
ing in Vietnam which deserves
intelligent, thoughtful conside
ration.
If a relatively mature and
concerned group such as this
spontaneously rejects any pro
test as completely irrational and
"Communist-inspired," seriously
or not, then how are the rela
tively immature and uncon
cerned masses of this country to
be expected to think, to question,
to apply themselves to the
"democratic principles" of our
country?
Questions have to be raised
somewhere ... or are we to be
led by Johnson and his s e 1 f
righteous blindfold, right or
wrong?

I find it repulsive to corn

DARREL COWAN
• Unity Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford movement to
stop the war in Vietnam ac
quired new strength Monday;
but old mistakes were made
again that will dissipate this
strength if positive, moderate,
counteraction is not taken now.
The crucial question here is
this: Do the leaders really wish
to stop tiie war, or do they
wish to use the movement to
increase their own power, to
salve their consciences, to con
vince themselves and others
that they will still be here after
the holocaust, at which time
they will congratulate them
selves heartily because they
were among the visionary mi
nority all along?
If a program of quiet educa
tion is undertaken in and
around this campus, and if
truly patriotic, nonrevolution
ary Americans are persuaded
that this war is morally unten
able and disastrous to world
safety (the use of nuclear
weapons is being considered),
then if they are shown positive,
practical, political actions that
they may take, this war can be
stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum
ni, administrators, employees,
and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.

day night march, including my
self, who had never marched
before. I think everything pos
sible must be done to keep these
people marching, and to get
more like them to march, and
more, and more, and more. And
to write letters, and send tele
grams, and yell as loud as they
can yell. And this means staging
protests that will attract as
many people as possible. Not
breaking laws. Not engaging in
civil disobedience. Not, as was
done Monday, bringing up oth
er questions like Santo Domin
go. If this movement tries to be
a solid ideological front, it has
no hope at all. What I think it
should be, and was somewhat
yesterday, for the first time, is
a big bunch of people, whatever
their stands on other issues,
who want to end the war in
Vietnam.
There are times for throwing
ideology to the winds and just
jumping in and working as hard
as you can and accomodating
yourself to as many people as
you can. I think this is one of
those times; I really think we
are tottering on the brink of ut
ter disaster.

• Journalistic Bigot
Editor, TTlfe Daily:
Perhaps the difference be
tween an open-minded editor and
a journalistic bigot is not as
great as I once thought. The
pointlessness of your statement
concerning the apparent imma
turity of freshmen is only ex
ceeded by its astounding gen
erality. If you will think back
(it must have been a long time
ago) to when you were a fresh
man, possibly you will remem
ber that you expressed an opin
ion with more spontanaeity and,
perhaps, more forthrightness
than you evidenced in your main
editorial. Did you tear your hair
out, cry, boo, faint, vomit, or
in a similar fashion express
your dismay at the resumption
of bombing in Vietnam? The
more vociferous expression of
the opinion should create no
more of a general impression
than the opinion expressed by
the silence of those who didn't
"burst into applause." Evident
ly it did in this case, however,

as you wasted no time in draw
ing the conclusion that since all
freshman disagree with you, all
freshmen are immature in
thought as well as in action. As
for the sign appearing in one
window in one Wilbur House
putting down Reverend Coffin,
I wonder if the editor made an
attempt to find out what any
one else thought about the man.
Probably he would have stum
bled across the truth, which is
that Coffin is highly respected
by a great many freshmen. Val

• Immature Frosh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call attention
to the appalling actions of the
apathetic freshmen of Wilbur
Hall. When a supposedly intel

the report of renewed bombing
in Vietnam, and jeers the an

A serious situation is develop
ing in Vietnam which deserves

If a relatively mature and

or not, then how are the rela

DARREL COWAN
• Unity Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford movement to
stop the war in Vietnam ac
quired new strength Monday;
but old mistakes were made
again that will dissipate this
strength if positive, moderate,
counteraction is not taken now.
The crucial question here is
this: Do the leaders really wish
to stop tiie war, or do they
wish to use the movement to
increase their own power, to
salve their consciences, to con
vince themselves and others
that they will still be here after
the holocaust, at which time
they will congratulate them
selves heartily because they
were among the visionary mi
nority all along?
If a program of quiet educa
tion is undertaken in and
around this campus, and if
truly patriotic, nonrevolution
ary Americans are persuaded
that this war is morally unten
able and disastrous to world
safety (the use of nuclear
weapons is being considered),
then if they are shown positive,
practical, political actions that
they may take, this war can be
stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum
ni, administrators, employees,
and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na
tional Coordinating Committee
in October was one instance of a
selfishness that is no longer tol
erable. The SCPV, as leader of
the Stanford movement, is now
being put to the test. Do they
want to stop the war, or do they
want to start a Survivors' Club?

• Sell 'War' Stocks
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is true, as
you have editorialized, that
Monday's faculty strike was
more an action directed against
the university than against
President Johnson. Further
more it was again only a sym
bolic gesture. I suggest that in
order to protest effectively
against Washington's war pol
icy through the university it is
necessary to focus on where
their interests coincide. There
fore I recommend that the facul
ty ask the university to reveal
in detail their stock holdings as
well as the other sources of
their revenue so that the facul
ty might urge that holdings in
war industries and like sources
of income be sold. Furthermore,
and perhaps more importantly,
the faculty should ask that the
nature of all scientific research
projects here be exposed so that
those which benefit the war ma
chine may be cancelled. At Mon
day's White Plaza meeting many
professors lamented the course
of this disastrous war and its
deleterious effect upon Ameri
can universities both practically
and morally. Cancelling a class
or two will change nothing.
What I have suggested might
well improve the state of af
fairs.

GRAHAM BAKER
• Bad Attitude
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. John R.
Mac Donald's letter in the Feb
ruary 1 issue of The Daily, I am
somewhat distressed at the light
ning speed with which he is
ready to advocate firing profes
sors. The punishment he thus
advocates is out of proportion to
the "offense" committed by
those faculty members who can
celled their classes. Firing, as a
panacea for all kinds of ills, real
or imaginary, seems to be the
favorite method of American
Business for dealing with prob
lems, but such thinking should
have no place in an academic en
vironment. A college professor
is, or should be, more, much
more than a mere "employee."
The very nature of education,
the enormous amount of train
ing which goes into the making
of a professor (for which he
never seems to be adequately
compensated), the great and
sometimes contradictory de
mands which are made on him
throughout his career, all these
warrant a different attitude on
the part of students. We are not,
or should not be, your hired
servants. As for the "student's
money" that pays for our sala
ries, I wonder how many stu
dents know that their tuition
(no doubt quite a drain on their
families) pays for only 40 per
cent of the University's operat
ing costs, and ergo, of profes
sors' salaries! This considera
tion would certainly reduce Mr.
Mac Donald's "refund." His quan
titive approach reflects a busi
ness mentality, not a scholarly
one.

• Napalm Facts
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a
statement made in Tuesday's
Dally. Napalm is not a "poison
ess gas." It is a form of jellied
gasoline used as an incendiary
weapon, and a very effective
one, too. However, it will not
kill anyone deader than a bullet,
nor will it disfigure the body
any more than the fancy knife
work (beheading and disem
bowling) which seems to be "in"
with the Viet Cong.
I might add that I am a "war
monger," and that I will follow
the advice of your editorial and
write my senators — to urge
them to support the administra
tion's policy in Vietnam.
ROBERT C. JOHNSON
Editor, The Daily:
At the 4 p.m. meeting at Cub
berly Monday afternoon some
thing significant happened: a
"radical" suggestion (marching
on Moffett Field) was rejected
for a "moderate" one (marching
to the Palo Alto Post Office).
I think this attitude is great,
I hope it continues, and I com
mend those who went along with
it even though they thought
that a more dramatic protest
was called for. While I think I
might have been willing to
march on Moffett, I think many
in the crowd would not have.
There were many at the Mon

self, who had never marched

be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na
tional Coordinating Committee
in October was one instance of a
selfishness that is no longer tol
erable. The SCPV, as leader of
the Stanford movement, is now
being put to the test. Do they
want to stop the war, or do they
want to start a Survivors' Club?

• Sell 'War' Stocks
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is true, as
you have editorialized, that
Monday's faculty strike was
more an action directed against
the university than against
President Johnson. Further
more it was again only a sym
bolic gesture. I suggest that in
order to protest effectively
against Washington's war pol
icy through the university it is
necessary to focus on where
their interests coincide. There
fore I recommend that the facul
ty ask the university to reveal
in detail their stock holdings as
well as the other sources of
their revenue so that the facul
ty might urge that holdings in
war industries and like sources
of income be sold. Furthermore,
and perhaps more importantly,
the faculty should ask that the
nature of all scientific research
projects here be exposed so that
those which benefit the war ma
chine may be cancelled. At Mon
day's White Plaza meeting many
professors lamented the course
of this disastrous war and its
deleterious effect upon Ameri
can universities both practically
and morally. Cancelling a class
or two will change nothing.
What I have suggested might
well improve the state of af

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. John R.

somewhat distressed at the light

ready to advocate firing profes

advocates is out of proportion to
the "offense" committed by

favorite method of American
Business for dealing with prob

have no place in an academic en

is, or should be, more, much
more than a mere "employee."
The very nature of education,
the enormous amount of train

of a professor (for which he
never seems to be adequately

sometimes contradictory de

warrant a different attitude on

I would like to correct a
statement made in Tuesday's
Dally. Napalm is not a "poison
ess gas." It is a form of jellied
gasoline used as an incendiary
weapon, and a very effective
one, too. However, it will not
kill anyone deader than a bullet,
nor will it disfigure the body
any more than the fancy knife

ROBERT C. JOHNSON
Editor, The Daily:
At the 4 p.m. meeting at Cub
berly Monday afternoon some
thing significant happened: a
"radical" suggestion (marching
on Moffett Field) was rejected
for a "moderate" one (marching
to the Palo Alto Post Office).
I think this attitude is great,
I hope it continues, and I com
mend those who went along with
it even though they thought
that a more dramatic protest
was called for. While I think I
might have been willing to
march on Moffett, I think many
in the crowd would not have.
There were many at the Mon
day night march, including my
self, who had never marched
before. I think everything pos
sible must be done to keep these
people marching, and to get
more like them to march, and
more, and more, and more. And
to write letters, and send tele
grams, and yell as loud as they
can yell. And this means staging
protests that will attract as
many people as possible. Not
breaking laws. Not engaging in
civil disobedience. Not, as was
done Monday, bringing up oth
er questions like Santo Domin
go. If this movement tries to be
a solid ideological front, it has
no hope at all. What I think it
should be, and was somewhat
yesterday, for the first time, is
a big bunch of people, whatever
their stands on other issues,
who want to end the war in
Vietnam.
There are times for throwing
ideology to the winds and just
jumping in and working as hard
as you can and accomodating
yourself to as many people as
you can. I think this is one of
those times; I really think we
are tottering on the brink of ut

• Journalistic Bigot
Editor, TTlfe Daily:
Perhaps the difference be
tween an open-minded editor and
a journalistic bigot is not as
great as I once thought. The
pointlessness of your statement
concerning the apparent imma
turity of freshmen is only ex
ceeded by its astounding gen
erality. If you will think back
(it must have been a long time
ago) to when you were a fresh
man, possibly you will remem
ber that you expressed an opin
ion with more spontanaeity and,
perhaps, more forthrightness
than you evidenced in your main
editorial. Did you tear your hair
out, cry, boo, faint, vomit, or
in a similar fashion express
your dismay at the resumption
of bombing in Vietnam? The
more vociferous expression of
the opinion should create no
more of a general impression
than the opinion expressed by
the silence of those who didn't
"burst into applause." Evident
ly it did in this case, however,

as you wasted no time in draw
ing the conclusion that since all
freshman disagree with you, all
freshmen are immature in
thought as well as in action. As
for the sign appearing in one
window in one Wilbur House
putting down Reverend Coffin,
I wonder if the editor made an
attempt to find out what any
one else thought about the man.
Probably he would have stum
bled across the truth, which is
that Coffin is highly respected
by a great many freshmen. Val
uable type space shouldn't be
wasted in expressing the editor's
disgust that anyone would have
the audacity, and obvious stu
pidity, to disagree with him.
CHARLES F. YVELLMAN,

(Editor's note: If IVIr. Well

he will note that we were not

pressed by the freshmen, but
rather with the methods l>y
which they were expressed. We
did not mention the eggs and

• Immature Frosh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call attention
to the appalling actions of the
apathetic freshmen of Wilbur
Hall. When a supposedly intel
ligent group of people cheers
the report of renewed bombing
in Vietnam, and jeers the an
nouncement of a rally by sin
cere people questioning this de
velopment, it indicates a very
immature attitude on their part.
A serious situation is develop
ing in Vietnam which deserves
intelligent, thoughtful conside
ration.
If a relatively mature and
concerned group such as this
spontaneously rejects any pro
test as completely irrational and
"Communist-inspired," seriously
or not, then how are the rela
tively immature and uncon
cerned masses of this country to
be expected to think, to question,
to apply themselves to the
"democratic principles" of our
country?
Questions have to be raised
somewhere ... or are we to be
led by Johnson and his s e 1 f
righteous blindfold, right or
wrong?

acter of the American people.
I find it repulsive to corn

pare the resumption of Ameri

DARREL COWAN
• Unity Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford movement to
stop the war in Vietnam ac
quired new strength Monday;
but old mistakes were made
again that will dissipate this
strength if positive, moderate,
counteraction is not taken now.
The crucial question here is
this: Do the leaders really wish
to stop tiie war, or do they
wish to use the movement to
increase their own power, to
salve their consciences, to con
vince themselves and others
that they will still be here after
the holocaust, at which time
they will congratulate them
selves heartily because they
were among the visionary mi
nority all along?
If a program of quiet educa
tion is undertaken in and
around this campus, and if
truly patriotic, nonrevolution
ary Americans are persuaded
that this war is morally unten
able and disastrous to world
safety (the use of nuclear
weapons is being considered),
then if they are shown positive,
practical, political actions that
they may take, this war can be
stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum
ni, administrators, employees,
and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na

no hope at all. What I think it
should be, and was somewhat
yesterday, for the first time, is
a big bunch of people, whatever
their stands on other issues,
who want to end the war in
Vietnam.
There are times for throwing
ideology to the winds and just
jumping in and working as hard

yourself to as many people as
you can. I think this is one of
those times; I really think we
are tottering on the brink of ut

• Journalistic Bigot
Editor, TTlfe Daily:
Perhaps the difference be
tween an open-minded editor and
a journalistic bigot is not as
great as I once thought. The
pointlessness of your statement
concerning the apparent imma
turity of freshmen is only ex
ceeded by its astounding gen
erality. If you will think back
(it must have been a long time
ago) to when you were a fresh
man, possibly you will remem
ber that you expressed an opin
ion with more spontanaeity and,
perhaps, more forthrightness
than you evidenced in your main
editorial. Did you tear your hair
out, cry, boo, faint, vomit, or
in a similar fashion express
your dismay at the resumption
of bombing in Vietnam? The
more vociferous expression of
the opinion should create no
more of a general impression
than the opinion expressed by
the silence of those who didn't
"burst into applause." Evident
ly it did in this case, however,

as you wasted no time in draw
ing the conclusion that since all
freshman disagree with you, all
freshmen are immature in
thought as well as in action. As
for the sign appearing in one
window in one Wilbur House
putting down Reverend Coffin,
I wonder if the editor made an
attempt to find out what any
one else thought about the man.
Probably he would have stum
bled across the truth, which is
that Coffin is highly respected
by a great many freshmen. Val

• Immature Frosh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call attention
to the appalling actions of the
apathetic freshmen of Wilbur
Hall. When a supposedly intel

the report of renewed bombing
in Vietnam, and jeers the an

A serious situation is develop
ing in Vietnam which deserves

If a relatively mature and

DARREL COWAN
• Unity Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford movement to
stop the war in Vietnam ac
quired new strength Monday;
but old mistakes were made
again that will dissipate this
strength if positive, moderate,
counteraction is not taken now.
The crucial question here is
this: Do the leaders really wish
to stop tiie war, or do they
wish to use the movement to
increase their own power, to
salve their consciences, to con
vince themselves and others
that they will still be here after
the holocaust, at which time
they will congratulate them
selves heartily because they
were among the visionary mi
nority all along?
If a program of quiet educa
tion is undertaken in and
around this campus, and if
truly patriotic, nonrevolution
ary Americans are persuaded
that this war is morally unten
able and disastrous to world
safety (the use of nuclear
weapons is being considered),
then if they are shown positive,
practical, political actions that
they may take, this war can be
stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum
ni, administrators, employees,
and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na
tional Coordinating Committee
in October was one instance of a
selfishness that is no longer tol
erable. The SCPV, as leader of
the Stanford movement, is now
being put to the test. Do they
want to stop the war, or do they
want to start a Survivors' Club?

• Sell 'War' Stocks
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is true, as
you have editorialized, that
Monday's faculty strike was
more an action directed against
the university than against
President Johnson. Further
more it was again only a sym
bolic gesture. I suggest that in
order to protest effectively
against Washington's war pol
icy through the university it is
necessary to focus on where
their interests coincide. There
fore I recommend that the facul
ty ask the university to reveal
in detail their stock holdings as
well as the other sources of
their revenue so that the facul
ty might urge that holdings in
war industries and like sources
of income be sold. Furthermore,
and perhaps more importantly,
the faculty should ask that the
nature of all scientific research
projects here be exposed so that
those which benefit the war ma
chine may be cancelled. At Mon
day's White Plaza meeting many
professors lamented the course
of this disastrous war and its
deleterious effect upon Ameri
can universities both practically
and morally. Cancelling a class
or two will change nothing.
What I have suggested might
well improve the state of af
fairs.

GRAHAM BAKER
• Bad Attitude
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. John R.
Mac Donald's letter in the Feb
ruary 1 issue of The Daily, I am
somewhat distressed at the light
ning speed with which he is
ready to advocate firing profes
sors. The punishment he thus
advocates is out of proportion to
the "offense" committed by
those faculty members who can
celled their classes. Firing, as a
panacea for all kinds of ills, real
or imaginary, seems to be the
favorite method of American
Business for dealing with prob
lems, but such thinking should
have no place in an academic en
vironment. A college professor
is, or should be, more, much
more than a mere "employee."
The very nature of education,
the enormous amount of train
ing which goes into the making
of a professor (for which he
never seems to be adequately
compensated), the great and
sometimes contradictory de
mands which are made on him
throughout his career, all these
warrant a different attitude on
the part of students. We are not,
or should not be, your hired
servants. As for the "student's
money" that pays for our sala
ries, I wonder how many stu
dents know that their tuition
(no doubt quite a drain on their
families) pays for only 40 per
cent of the University's operat
ing costs, and ergo, of profes
sors' salaries! This considera
tion would certainly reduce Mr.
Mac Donald's "refund." His quan
titive approach reflects a busi
ness mentality, not a scholarly
one.

• Napalm Facts
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a
statement made in Tuesday's
Dally. Napalm is not a "poison
ess gas." It is a form of jellied
gasoline used as an incendiary
weapon, and a very effective
one, too. However, it will not
kill anyone deader than a bullet,
nor will it disfigure the body
any more than the fancy knife
work (beheading and disem
bowling) which seems to be "in"
with the Viet Cong.
I might add that I am a "war
monger," and that I will follow
the advice of your editorial and
write my senators — to urge
them to support the administra
tion's policy in Vietnam.
ROBERT C. JOHNSON
Editor, The Daily:
At the 4 p.m. meeting at Cub
berly Monday afternoon some
thing significant happened: a
"radical" suggestion (marching
on Moffett Field) was rejected
for a "moderate" one (marching
to the Palo Alto Post Office).
I think this attitude is great,
I hope it continues, and I com
mend those who went along with
it even though they thought
that a more dramatic protest
was called for. While I think I
might have been willing to
march on Moffett, I think many
in the crowd would not have.
There were many at the Mon
day night march, including my
self, who had never marched
before. I think everything pos
sible must be done to keep these
people marching, and to get
more like them to march, and
more, and more, and more. And
to write letters, and send tele
grams, and yell as loud as they
can yell. And this means staging
protests that will attract as
many people as possible. Not
breaking laws. Not engaging in
civil disobedience. Not, as was
done Monday, bringing up oth
er questions like Santo Domin
go. If this movement tries to be
a solid ideological front, it has
no hope at all. What I think it

And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic

The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na

in October was one instance of a

• Sell 'War' Stocks
Editor, The Daily:
I believe that it is true, as
you have editorialized, that
Monday's faculty strike was
more an action directed against
the university than against
President Johnson. Further
more it was again only a sym
bolic gesture. I suggest that in
order to protest effectively
against Washington's war pol
icy through the university it is
necessary to focus on where
their interests coincide. There
fore I recommend that the facul
ty ask the university to reveal
in detail their stock holdings as
well as the other sources of
their revenue so that the facul
ty might urge that holdings in
war industries and like sources
of income be sold. Furthermore,
and perhaps more importantly,
the faculty should ask that the
nature of all scientific research
projects here be exposed so that
those which benefit the war ma
chine may be cancelled. At Mon
day's White Plaza meeting many
professors lamented the course
of this disastrous war and its
deleterious effect upon Ameri
can universities both practically
and morally. Cancelling a class
or two will change nothing.
What I have suggested might
well improve the state of af

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. John R.

somewhat distressed at the light

ready to advocate firing profes

advocates is out of proportion to
the "offense" committed by

panacea for all kinds of ills, real

favorite method of American
Business for dealing with prob

have no place in an academic en

is, or should be, more, much
more than a mere "employee."
The very nature of education,
the enormous amount of train

of a professor (for which he
never seems to be adequately

sometimes contradictory de

• Napalm Facts
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a
statement made in Tuesday's
Dally. Napalm is not a "poison
ess gas." It is a form of jellied
gasoline used as an incendiary
weapon, and a very effective
one, too. However, it will not
kill anyone deader than a bullet,
nor will it disfigure the body
any more than the fancy knife
work (beheading and disem

ROBERT C. JOHNSON
Editor, The Daily:
At the 4 p.m. meeting at Cub
berly Monday afternoon some
thing significant happened: a
"radical" suggestion (marching
on Moffett Field) was rejected
for a "moderate" one (marching
to the Palo Alto Post Office).
I think this attitude is great,
I hope it continues, and I com
mend those who went along with
it even though they thought
that a more dramatic protest
was called for. While I think I
might have been willing to
march on Moffett, I think many
in the crowd would not have.
There were many at the Mon
day night march, including my
self, who had never marched
before. I think everything pos
sible must be done to keep these
people marching, and to get
more like them to march, and
more, and more, and more. And
to write letters, and send tele
grams, and yell as loud as they
can yell. And this means staging
protests that will attract as
many people as possible. Not
breaking laws. Not engaging in
civil disobedience. Not, as was
done Monday, bringing up oth
er questions like Santo Domin
go. If this movement tries to be
a solid ideological front, it has
no hope at all. What I think it
should be, and was somewhat
yesterday, for the first time, is
a big bunch of people, whatever
their stands on other issues,
who want to end the war in
Vietnam.
There are times for throwing
ideology to the winds and just
jumping in and working as hard
as you can and accomodating
yourself to as many people as
you can. I think this is one of
those times; I really think we
are tottering on the brink of ut
ter disaster.

JOE MAYSHARK
• Journalistic Bigot
Editor, TTlfe Daily:
Perhaps the difference be
tween an open-minded editor and
a journalistic bigot is not as
great as I once thought. The
pointlessness of your statement
concerning the apparent imma
turity of freshmen is only ex
ceeded by its astounding gen
erality. If you will think back
(it must have been a long time
ago) to when you were a fresh
man, possibly you will remem
ber that you expressed an opin
ion with more spontanaeity and,
perhaps, more forthrightness
than you evidenced in your main
editorial. Did you tear your hair
out, cry, boo, faint, vomit, or
in a similar fashion express
your dismay at the resumption
of bombing in Vietnam? The
more vociferous expression of
the opinion should create no
more of a general impression
than the opinion expressed by
the silence of those who didn't
"burst into applause." Evident
ly it did in this case, however,

as you wasted no time in draw
ing the conclusion that since all
freshman disagree with you, all
freshmen are immature in
thought as well as in action. As
for the sign appearing in one
window in one Wilbur House
putting down Reverend Coffin,
I wonder if the editor made an
attempt to find out what any
one else thought about the man.
Probably he would have stum
bled across the truth, which is
that Coffin is highly respected
by a great many freshmen. Val
uable type space shouldn't be
wasted in expressing the editor's
disgust that anyone would have
the audacity, and obvious stu
pidity, to disagree with him.
CHARLES F. YVELLMAN,

(Editor's note: If IVIr. Well

he will note that we were not
disagreeing: with the views ex
pressed by the freshmen, but
rather with the methods l>y
which they were expressed. We
did not mention the eggs and
firecrackers that were thrown
by Wilbur boys at the mareh

seemed overgeneralized, and
suggest that Mr. Wellman read
the letter below.)
• Immature Frosh
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to call attention
to the appalling actions of the
apathetic freshmen of Wilbur
Hall. When a supposedly intel
ligent group of people cheers
the report of renewed bombing
in Vietnam, and jeers the an
nouncement of a rally by sin
cere people questioning this de
velopment, it indicates a very
immature attitude on their part.
A serious situation is develop
ing in Vietnam which deserves
intelligent, thoughtful conside
ration.
If a relatively mature and
concerned group such as this
spontaneously rejects any pro
test as completely irrational and
"Communist-inspired," seriously
or not, then how are the rela
tively immature and uncon
cerned masses of this country to
be expected to think, to question,
to apply themselves to the
"democratic principles" of our
country?
Questions have to be raised
somewhere ... or are we to be
led by Johnson and his s e 1 f
righteous blindfold, right or
wrong?

The first paragraph in Tues
day's editorial is typical of the

that, it is a slight on the char
acter of the American people.
I find it repulsive to corn

pare the resumption of Ameri

a matter of national concern,
with the assassination of a Pres

political and ideological differ
ences.
DARREL COWAN
• Unity Necessary
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford movement to
stop the war in Vietnam ac
quired new strength Monday;
but old mistakes were made
again that will dissipate this
strength if positive, moderate,
counteraction is not taken now.
The crucial question here is
this: Do the leaders really wish
to stop tiie war, or do they
wish to use the movement to
increase their own power, to
salve their consciences, to con
vince themselves and others
that they will still be here after
the holocaust, at which time
they will congratulate them
selves heartily because they
were among the visionary mi
nority all along?
If a program of quiet educa
tion is undertaken in and
around this campus, and if
truly patriotic, nonrevolution
ary Americans are persuaded
that this war is morally unten
able and disastrous to world
safety (the use of nuclear
weapons is being considered),
then if they are shown positive,
practical, political actions that
they may take, this war can be
stopped. But if radical, illegal,
naturally alienating tactics are
continued, the protest will flop
and the war will continue. Unity
is necessary, and it must be a
unity that can include any
American with a conscience.
Partisan and factional differ
ences are irrelevant in the face
of this massive emergency and
potential World War.
The crime of this war can be
made evident to Stanford alum
ni, administrators, employees,
and to influential organizations
that are ordinarily considered
conservative. Danger is not only
meaningful to liberals and radi
cals. If a consensus of opposi
tion can be believed in, it can
be achieved. Washington will
have to listen.
It is universally admitted
that China's entrance into the
war is very likely in the event
of American invasion of North
Vietnam, or in the event of
American use of nuclear weap
ons. Both of these actions are
very real immediate possibili
ties. It is hard to imagine that
the Soviet Union would remain
neutral if China were being
bombed—such a bombing would
have the effect of consolidating
the Communist world as no in
ternal force can. Who wins such
a war is irrelevant. The mind
boggles at the thought of the
destruction it would involve.
And the Bay Area, with its de
fense industry plants, would be

an obvious Soviet ICBM target.
This argument is the one with
greatest immediacy for most
people. Few clerks, bookkeep
ers, mechanics, cab drivers,
bankers, real estate salesmen,
contractors, school children,
care if they are part of the
"elite" remaining after "the rev
olutionary tide has receded."
And most of them would rather
not be. But they do want to stay
alive. They want their families
to stay alive. They don't want
their children to be genetic
freaks.
The failure of anti-war groups
to achieve unity under the Na
tional Coordinating Committee
in October was one instance of a
selfishness that is no longer tol
erable. The SCPV, as leader of
the Stanford movement, is now
being put to the test. Do they

want to start a Survivors' Club?
