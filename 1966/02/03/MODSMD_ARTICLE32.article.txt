# The 						Capitol Scene
## Ours Is Not To Reason Why 
### Art Buchwald 
Washington just had one of
the biggest blizzards in its his
tory and, although snow had
been predicted, no one thought

it would be on this scale. One of
the reasons for this is the credi
bility gap where people are sus
picious of everything that is an
nounced in the nation's capital.
I discussed this with a high
government official as he was
digging his car out of the drive
way Monday morning. "Sir, did
you know there was going to
be a blizzard Saturday night?"
"I'm as surprised as any
body," he said. "I heard that
bad weather was in the works,
but I thought this was just a
way of President Johnson mak
ing it easier to announce he was
going to resume the bombing of
North Vietnam."
White House Order
"Who authorized the bliz
zard?"
"It had to come from the
White House. My department
certainly knew nothing about
it. We weren't even consulted."
"Do you think a blizzard was
a good thing to have at this
time of the year?"
"Well, you have to remember
the President is the only one
who can make this agonizing
decision. He has all the facts.
While a blizzard may look like
the worst thing to give the peo
ple, it could, in the long run, be
the best thing we could do un
der the circumstances."
"There are some people who
believe Congress should have
decided whether we should have
had a blizzard or not."
Vote of Confidence
"Congress gave President
Johnson a vote of confidence in
1965 and said they would sup
port any decisions he made con
cerning the weather."
"Yessir, but they thought they
were voting for a light snowfall
or at the most a white Christ
mas. They had no idea the Pres
ident was going to get us into a
blizzard."
"The President didn't want a
blizzard any more than anybody
else. For the last three months

he has done everything to keep
the weather from getting out of
hand. But the elements have
been against him and it is his
opinion that, unless we stand
firm in the face of heavy snow
fall now, we will have a worse
blizzard later on. Everyone in
this Administration is for clear
weather, but it has to be clear
weather with honor."
"Isn't one of the dangers of
a blizzard that the harder you
try to dig out of it, the more
chance you have of getting
stuck in it?"
"Nobody knows the dangers
of a blizzard more than the
President.. He did not arrive at
his decision to have one until he
consulted with many, many peo
ple."
"Was Dean Rusk in on it?"
"I'm sure of it. He had to
notify our Allies what we plan
to do."
"Have they supported him in
the blizzard policy?"
No Snow Plows
"They haven't given snow
plows or road - clearing equip
ment, and there are some of our
friends who asked the President
to hold off on the blizzard inde
finitely and give the elements a
chance. Rut here again the
President had to make the final
decision."
"Could this lead to larger and
larger blizzards?"
"We certainly hope not. The
dropping of snow at this time
should indicate that we mean
business and, although we may
be up to our necks in snow, this
doesn't mean we wouldn't be the
first ones to want it all to melt."
"What happens if the blizzard
doesn't work?"
"We'll have to cook up some
other kind of storm."
"It looks like it's going to
snow some more," I said.
"I'm sure the President would
allow no more snow to drop
than is absolutely necessary."
