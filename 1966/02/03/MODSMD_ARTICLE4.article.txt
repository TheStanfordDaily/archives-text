# LASSU To Consider Draft And Probe Senior Colloquia
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY Editorial Assistant 
Resolutions calling for a revitaliza
tion of the Senior Colloquia program
and a censure of current draft poli
cies will top the Legislature agenda
tonight.
A proposed resolution to be submit
ted by Peggy McFadden and Lars
Gantzel asks for the establishment of
a "Special Education Fund" which
would be used to reorganize Senior
Colloquia, and includes a proposal to
make the special classes voluntary.
Also to be considered will be a bill
creating a Commission on Education,
composed of members of the Stanford
community, which would encourage
an experimental attitude toward edu
cation.
The Legislature will also consider

a resolution of censure of the "prac
tice of drafting members of the aca
demic community into the military
service."
According to John Shippe, sponsor
of the resolution, 187 students out of
640 recently polled on campus have
been classified 1-A by their draft
boards.
Shippe's proposal contains a clause
charging the Selective Service with
drafting students because of ineffi
ciency, not because of real manpower
needs.
Bills will be referred concerning
abolishing AWS and establishing the
Stanford Community Aid Commis
sion, and Social Coordinating Commit
tee.
A bill calling for the appropriation
from an ASSU contingency fund to

open Lake Lagunita on weekends will
also be brought under consideration.
A resolution concerning develop
ments in the Vietnam War may be in
troduced under legislation known to
be controversial, according to Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam
head David Ransom. However, discus
sion of such topics concerning off
campus issues is technically prohibit
ed in LASSU.
The meeting will begin at 7:30 in
room 370.
