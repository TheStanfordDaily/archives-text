# Coffee Hour To Feature Vietnam Discussions
## 
### 
The war in Vietnam will be the
main subject of discussion for a now
student-faculty coffee hour series be
ginning this afternoon. Organized by
a large number of faculty members
who oppose the war in Vietnam, the

informal discussions will be held reg
ularly every Thursday, from 3 tos,
in the small lounge in Tresidder.
According to English Professor Al
bert J. Guerard, "Many of us are re
luctant to use class time to discuss
the various reasons for our opposition
to the war. Now that a larger war
seems likely, it will be more difficult,
but also more important than ever,
to have students and faculty join in
thoughtful, dispassionate examina
tion of our policies and actions."
Nevitt Sanford, Professor of Psy
chology and Director of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems,
also encouraged students and faculty
to attend the informal discussions.
"Many students, confused by the situ
ation in Vietnam, find few opportuni
ties to discuss the various issues and
opinions in relaxed conversations with
their professors."
"About twenty professors, from de
partments throughout the University,
will be at the first coffee hour to
morrow afternoon," Sanford said. "It
would be a shame if students did not
take advantage of the opportunities
offered by this weekly series of dis
cussions."
