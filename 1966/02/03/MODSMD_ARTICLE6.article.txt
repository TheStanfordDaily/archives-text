# VDC Criticizes Faculty Strikes
## 
### 
The Vietnam Defense Committee
yesterday advocated disciplinary ac
tion by the University against faculty
members who participated in the
Vietnam protest strike.
"A Stanford student pays a sub
stantial fee for the privilege of at
tending classes," said Terence Cox,
chairman of the committee. "He has
a right to insist that promised classes
actually occur."
The call for disciplinary action was
approved and passed unanimously by
the Executive Committee of the Viet
nam Defense Committee. A copy of
their resolution was sent to President
Sterling.
The resolution charged that strik
ing instructors were acting in "viola
tion of their contracts," and "such
'strikes,' if allowed to become a regu
lar practice, would be a threat to the
orderly operation of the University."
In addition to taking actions against
those who did not hold classes on
Monday, January 31, the Committee
recommended that "the University
clearly and unequivocally state that
any recurrence of such 'strikes' will
be met with severe disciplinary ac
tion."
Coxon remarked that '*news of the
faculty Vietnam protest strike was
met with great distress by the many
Stanford students who appreciate the
orderly manner in which the business
of the University is usually con
ducted."
