# 'Prometheus' Review
## Triumph Marred By Outdated Script 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Stanford Repertory Theater's production of
Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound is a stunning and
eminently satisfying performance of what is, ulti
mately, a rather boring vehicle.
Aeschylus' work is of interest to the historian,
and to the student of literature. To the contempo
rary theatergoer, however, there is little in the art
form—more ritual than "play"—that involves ei
ther the emotions or the intellect in any meaning
ful way, except for the poetry itself, which in Philip
Vellacott's translation is often very beautiful.
The work is an interpretation of a legend no long
er intrinsincally significant; nor, more damaging,
has it more than a tangential relation to the human
condition (in spite of director Erik Vos' attempt
to justify its relevance in his program notes) ex
cept insofar as it deals with grand passions.
But it deals with them on a superhuman scale
and in the most general terms. There is a certain
Tiaked power in the expression of these passions,
but not enough for a modern audience to relate to.
Unimpeachable
Given the choice of material, though, the pro
duction is a tremendous success. Vos' stylized and
"primitive" interpretation is unimpeachable, and
he imparts rhythms and tensions to the perform
ance which throb and crackle long after its conclu
sion.
John Karlen as Prometheus, the god who defies
Zeus and befriends mankind and who is punished

for his rebellion is properly proud, outraged, tor
tured and ironic. His explosive soliloquies come off
well; more difficult, and equally well handled, are
the subtle modulations he must make to lower
keyed passages.
He must always be more than human, even in
his humbled weakness. Karlen's performance is a
skillful blend of all these tones.
In smaller, but important, roles, Sam Schacht
(Strength), Sheldon Feldner (Violence) and Ron
dolph McKee (Hermes) are all extremely capable.
Jerome Raphel (Hephaestus) and especially Har
old Gould (Oceanus) are worthy of high praise.
Flawed Performance
The sole seriously flawed performance is that
of Juliet Randall as 10, a maiden transformed into
a haunted, maddened half-beast. The part is terri
bly demanding; a mood of high frenzy must be sus
tained throughout. Tuesday night, Miss Randall
began with a carriage and inflection too small for
the feeling she professed. She sometimes reached
the peaks she aimed for, but more often missed.
Similarly, her difficult and extended pantomime,
as she acts out her future suffering as foretold by
Prometheus, was on too small a scale to be a clum
sy and jerky as she played it—or, was too rough
to be played on such a small scale. Whether by Miss
Randall or Vos, an unhappy middle ground was
chosen.
The most impressive performance, Karlen's ex
cellence notwithstanding, was turned in by the

Chorus of 15 women, led by Susan Leich. Their
precise execution of the complex choreography (by
Vos) and their unison and two-part singing, some
times a capella, was a marvel.
They wavered rarely and briefly. Most often they
were a single, dramatically compelling unit which,
in several exchanges with Prometheus made the
ancient and alien stage device of the Chorus come
electrically alive.
Technical Triumph
The play is as much a technical as a dramatic
triumph. Vos' choreography and Humphrey Searle's
original music is artful and appropriate, and inordi
nately well performed. The set, by Richard L. Hay,
is stark, simple and powerful; the rock is a master
piece of its kind.
Most exciting of all are the costumes and masks.
Their bizarre shapes and colors evoke the sense of
mystery and supernatural, elemental conflict neces
sary to Vos' interpretation, and their creators,
Douglas A. Russell (costumes) and William Stew
art Jones (masks) are to be congratulated. Paul
Landry's lighting is less effective. It is appropriate
ly shadowy and mysterious, but its dimness ob
scures much of the fascinating effect of the cos
tumes.
The production is a virtuoso display from almost
every angle. It will be wasted, however, on all save
a limited segment of its potential audience. Despite
Vos' inspired efforts, despite the work's validity as
representative of a cultural idiom of another epoch,
it is anything but living theater.

as she acts out her future suffering as foretold by
Prometheus, was on too small a scale to be a clum
sy and jerky as she played it—or, was too rough
to be played on such a small scale. Whether by Miss
Randall or Vos, an unhappy middle ground was
chosen.
The most impressive performance, Karlen's ex
cellence notwithstanding, was turned in by the

Chorus of 15 women, led by Susan Leich. Their
precise execution of the complex choreography (by
Vos) and their unison and two-part singing, some
times a capella, was a marvel.
They wavered rarely and briefly. Most often they
were a single, dramatically compelling unit which,
in several exchanges with Prometheus made the
ancient and alien stage device of the Chorus come
electrically alive.
Technical Triumph
The play is as much a technical as a dramatic
triumph. Vos' choreography and Humphrey Searle's
original music is artful and appropriate, and inordi
nately well performed. The set, by Richard L. Hay,
is stark, simple and powerful; the rock is a master
piece of its kind.
Most exciting of all are the costumes and masks.
Their bizarre shapes and colors evoke the sense of
mystery and supernatural, elemental conflict neces
sary to Vos' interpretation, and their creators,
Douglas A. Russell (costumes) and William Stew
art Jones (masks) are to be congratulated. Paul
Landry's lighting is less effective. It is appropriate
ly shadowy and mysterious, but its dimness ob
scures much of the fascinating effect of the cos
tumes.
The production is a virtuoso display from almost
every angle. It will be wasted, however, on all save
a limited segment of its potential audience. Despite
Vos' inspired efforts, despite the work's validity as
representative of a cultural idiom of another epoch,
it is anything but living theater.
The Stanford Repertory Theater's production of
Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound is a stunning and
eminently satisfying performance of what is, ulti
mately, a rather boring vehicle.
Aeschylus' work is of interest to the historian,
and to the student of literature. To the contempo
rary theatergoer, however, there is little in the art
form—more ritual than "play"—that involves ei
ther the emotions or the intellect in any meaning
ful way, except for the poetry itself, which in Philip
Vellacott's translation is often very beautiful.
The work is an interpretation of a legend no long
er intrinsincally significant; nor, more damaging,
has it more than a tangential relation to the human
condition (in spite of director Erik Vos' attempt
to justify its relevance in his program notes) ex
cept insofar as it deals with grand passions.
But it deals with them on a superhuman scale
and in the most general terms. There is a certain
Tiaked power in the expression of these passions,
but not enough for a modern audience to relate to.
Unimpeachable
Given the choice of material, though, the pro
duction is a tremendous success. Vos' stylized and
"primitive" interpretation is unimpeachable, and
he imparts rhythms and tensions to the perform
ance which throb and crackle long after its conclu
sion.
John Karlen as Prometheus, the god who defies
Zeus and befriends mankind and who is punished

for his rebellion is properly proud, outraged, tor
tured and ironic. His explosive soliloquies come off
well; more difficult, and equally well handled, are
the subtle modulations he must make to lower
keyed passages.
He must always be more than human, even in
his humbled weakness. Karlen's performance is a
skillful blend of all these tones.
In smaller, but important, roles, Sam Schacht
(Strength), Sheldon Feldner (Violence) and Ron
dolph McKee (Hermes) are all extremely capable.
Jerome Raphel (Hephaestus) and especially Har
old Gould (Oceanus) are worthy of high praise.
Flawed Performance
The sole seriously flawed performance is that
of Juliet Randall as 10, a maiden transformed into
a haunted, maddened half-beast. The part is terri
bly demanding; a mood of high frenzy must be sus
tained throughout. Tuesday night, Miss Randall
began with a carriage and inflection too small for
the feeling she professed. She sometimes reached
the peaks she aimed for, but more often missed.
Similarly, her difficult and extended pantomime,
as she acts out her future suffering as foretold by
Prometheus, was on too small a scale to be a clum
sy and jerky as she played it—or, was too rough
to be played on such a small scale. Whether by Miss
Randall or Vos, an unhappy middle ground was
