# Vietnam Protest Turns To Napalm
## 
### BILL WERTZ Associate Editor 
A campus protest to renewed bomb
ing of North Vietnam that caused
some University professors to cancel
their classes and drew over 800 partic
ipants Monday dwindled to 150 at a
noon rally yesterday.
David Ransom, Chairman of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, said that he had expected
the decrease and did not find it dis
couraging.
"Stanford is a conservative school,"
he said.
Napalm Protest
The SCPV, along with members of
various other Bay Area peace groups,
plans to protest napalm production at
the Coyote plant of United Technolo
gy Center with a "moral witness" to
day.
"This will not be an ordinary dem
onstration because we will not be
massed at the plant gates," Keith
Lowe of the SCPV said.
Lowe said that he hopes to line the
five miles of roadway leading from
the Bayshore Freeway to the plant
with sign-carrying people. The signs
will urge plant workers to stop and

talk to the protesters. The UTC plant
is on Metcalf road, about 15 miles
south of San Jose.
White Plaza Rally
A rally for those attending the
"moral witness" will be held at 2:00
in White Plaza.
Addressing the rally will be As
semblyman William Stanton, in
whose district the UTC plant at Coyo
te falls, and Stokeley Carmichael, a
Student Non â–  violent Coordinating
Committee secretary from Alabama.
Assemblyman Stanton said in a
statement today: "There can never be
a great society as long as we are mak
ing napalm bombs."
Bus rides to Metcalf Road and the
UTC plant are being provided by the
SCPV for one dollar. They leave from
the Tresidder parking lot at 2:30.
Talk to Workers
The protesters plan to talk to as
many plant workers as will stop
along the road. The SCPV will also
distribute a three page leaflet it has
prepared entitled "Why are we here?
What do we want?"
The leaflet shows pictures of wom
en and children who have been horri
bly burned and disfigured by napalm
and describes an incident when na
palm was accidentally dropped on
American troops.
The leaflet urges plant workers to
"display the courage" to follow the
example of two UTC employees who
resigned in protest of the production
of napalm. Barnett Adelman, presi
dent of UTC, is reported in the leaflet
as seeing "no moral difference be
tween making war on soldiers and on
civilian populations." Workers are
asked: "Does Barnett Adelman speak
for you?"
No Comment From Prexy
Adelman has been contacted twice
by the Daily in order to clarify his
position, but he has refused to com
ment.
According to Lowe, the SCPV "is
trying to make a bigger action each
time" in protesting napalm produc
tion.
Lowe said that volunteers were cur
rently being recruited to fast outside
the factory gates from 5:00 this af
ternoon until 5:00 tomorrow after
noon.
In yesterday's noon rally in White
plaza the effects of napalm were dis
cussed, and William Mendel, KPFA
commentator, journalist, and expert
on Russian affairs, expressed his dis
trust of the belief that Russia will
not intervene in the Vietnam war. He
said that recent Russian foreign pol
icy showed that this contention could
not be strongly supported.
