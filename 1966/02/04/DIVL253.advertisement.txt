### 
HAVE A DATE EVERY
SATURDAY NIGHT
You'll finally be able to afford to, if
you get a Honda.
Trade in your gas eo'er for a thrifty
Honda fifty. to 200 miles per gal
lon, and at least that many laughs,
Maybe more.
Hondas are just the ticket for campus
traffic and campus parking, and you'll
notice a big difference in your pocket
book; too. It'll bulge for a change,
so will your date book.
