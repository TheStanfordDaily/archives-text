ALL WET
The Bible says the earth was once under water, that everything was ail
wet. . . And the waters prevailed so mightly upon the earth that all the
high mountains under the whole heaven were covered; the waters prevailed
above the mountains covering them fifteen cubits deep And all flesh died that
moved upon the face of the earth, birds, cattle, be asts, all swarming creatures
that swarm upon the earth, and every man,- everything on the dry land in whose
nostrils was the breath of life died . . . Only Noah was left, and those that were
with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and
fifty days" (Genesis 7).
Perhaps you've wondered about that ancient flood of Noah. From an air
plane the very terrain of earth suggests the washing and silting of great waves,
the overturning and upheaval by enormous masses of water. Graveyards of
bones and the geologic record add their voices of testimony to the great deluge.
Very possibly the earth's axis was changed, the climates altered from sub
tropical to cold and cyclical, and the land configurations greatly altered. At
lantis and lost worlds of ancient myths may have been among the civilizations
of a then-crowded globe destroyed by God and buried in the sands of time.
Judgment hangs over the present world as it did in the days of Noah. Con
tent with ilusions of self sufficiency, man today seeks to be his own God, proudly
exalting hismself before the courts of heaven. But as life decays from within
the human heart, the fires of God must soon descend to consume the rubbish
of so-called "man."
In grace and mercy the God of Life still speaks to his wayward creatures
the message of reconciling love to all who will but come: . . . Remember the
predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ through your apostles. Firest of all you must understand this, that
scoffers will come in the last days, with scoffing, following their own passions
and saying, where is the promise of Christ's coming? For ever since the fathers
fell asleep, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of crea
tion. They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the Word of God heavens existed
long ago, and an earth formed out of water and by means of wate', through
which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But
by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist have been stored up fo
fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. But
do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise
as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any
should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord
will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise,
and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that
ar upon it will be burned up' (2 Peter 3:2-10).
God means what He says. It is schoffers and sketpics, doubters and
hypocrites who are all wet. If you are in doubt about God, why not ask Jesus
Christ into your life and find out for yourself. It is pretty important that you
not stay wrong. The God who made you really cares. His name is Jesus Christ.

God means what He says. It is schoffers and sketpics, doubters and
hypocrites who are all wet. If you are in doubt about God, why not ask Jesus
Christ into your life and find out for yourself. It is pretty important that you
not stay wrong. The God who made you really cares. His name is Jesus Christ.

The Bible says the earth was once under water, that everything was ail
wet. . . And the waters prevailed so mightly upon the earth that all the
high mountains under the whole heaven were covered; the waters prevailed
above the mountains covering them fifteen cubits deep And all flesh died that
moved upon the face of the earth, birds, cattle, be asts, all swarming creatures
that swarm upon the earth, and every man,- everything on the dry land in whose
nostrils was the breath of life died . . . Only Noah was left, and those that were
with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and
fifty days" (Genesis 7).
Perhaps you've wondered about that ancient flood of Noah. From an air
plane the very terrain of earth suggests the washing and silting of great waves,
the overturning and upheaval by enormous masses of water. Graveyards of
bones and the geologic record add their voices of testimony to the great deluge.
Very possibly the earth's axis was changed, the climates altered from sub
tropical to cold and cyclical, and the land configurations greatly altered. At
lantis and lost worlds of ancient myths may have been among the civilizations
of a then-crowded globe destroyed by God and buried in the sands of time.
Judgment hangs over the present world as it did in the days of Noah. Con
tent with ilusions of self sufficiency, man today seeks to be his own God, proudly
exalting hismself before the courts of heaven. But as life decays from within
the human heart, the fires of God must soon descend to consume the rubbish
of so-called "man."
In grace and mercy the God of Life still speaks to his wayward creatures
the message of reconciling love to all who will but come: . . . Remember the
predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ through your apostles. Firest of all you must understand this, that
scoffers will come in the last days, with scoffing, following their own passions
and saying, where is the promise of Christ's coming? For ever since the fathers
fell asleep, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of crea
tion. They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the Word of God heavens existed
long ago, and an earth formed out of water and by means of wate', through
which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But
by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist have been stored up fo
fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. But
do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise
as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any
should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord
will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise,
and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that
ar upon it will be burned up' (2 Peter 3:2-10).
