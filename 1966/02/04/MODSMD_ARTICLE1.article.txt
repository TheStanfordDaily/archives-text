• Lunar Landing Praised
MOSCOW — A Soviet space station
made history's first soft landing on
the moon Thursday, Moscow an
nounced.
British scientists in England said
the unmanned capsule, Luna 9, sent
pictures bacK to earth from the
moon's surface.
A Tass announcement said the land
ing was made at 9:30 p.m. Moscow
time—l:3o p.m. EST —after the ship,
launched Jan. 31, had hurtled through
space for more than three days.
Sir Bernard Lovell, director of the
radiotelescopic observatory at Jodrell
Bank, England, said the feat "puts
the Russians ahead in the space race."
From Washington President John
son sent a personal message to the
Soviet Union on the achievement, say
ing "all mankind applauds" the land
ing.
Four previous Soviet attempts at
a soft landing had failed.
Jodrell observatory scientists said
Luna 9 had sent fascimile pictures
back to earth from the moon's sur

face. This aspect was not immediately
announced in Moscow.
The brief Tass announcement on
the landing—the first official word
on the progress of the flight since
it was launched Monday—gave only
spotty details.
Nothing was said about the size,
shape, construction or weight of the
scientific instrument package. It is
thought likely to be more than 3,000
pounds. Nothing was said immediat
ely about the kind of data being
radioed back to earth.
Soviet commentators soon beamed
out thousands of words in praise of
the accomplishment.
• Communist Losses Soar
SAIGON, South Vietnam — The
count of enemy dead in allied coastal
drives soarde to 1,082 today. North
Vietnamese regulars fighting along
side the Viet Cong were reported to
have suffered their worst punish
ment since they infiltrated the South.
While American fliers struck
again at Ho Chi Minh's transporta
tion facilities, informed sources said
North Vietnam utilized the 37-day
bombing moratorium to construct

about 60 new missile sites and
strengthen its conventional air de
fenses.
Briefing officers said U. S. Air
Force Thunderchiefs sank a barge
and set fire to another on the Song
Ma River 60 miles southwest of Ha
noi and heavily damaged approaches
to a Highway 122 bridge about 65
miles south of the Red capital. U. S.
Navy jet pilots said they sank a
North Vietnamese patrol boat Wed
nesday 40 miles south of Haiphong,
North Vietnam's main port.
A South Vietnamese spokesman an
nounced Operation Masher, the hub
of the allied coastal offensive, has
heavily crippled one full regiment of
regulars from the North and a second
regiment made up of North Vietna
mese and guerrilla battalions. A Com
munist regiment normally totals
about 1,200 men.

• U.S. Plans Cuban Airlift
MIAMI, Fla. — The first of some
600 Americans and their families will
be flown here from Cuba this week
end in what U. S. officials call the
largest repatriation movement of its
kind since World War 11.
A State Department spokesman
said about 200 persons would arrive
the first day and "it's 95 per cent
sure that the repatriation flights will
begin Saturday and continue on a
two-flight each weekend basis."
Lists prepared by the Swiss Embas
sy in Havana, which handles U. S. in
terests in Cuba, show that most of
the Americans are lifetime or long
time residents of Cuba.
The majority were born in Cuba.
They claim American citizenship
through a parent.

NEW YORK — Gen. Maxwell D.
Taylor totally rejected Thursday the
"enclave strategy" for Vietnam rec

suing a peace effort in the United
Nations.
• Nuclear Rocket Tested.
JACKASS FLATS, Nev. — A
nuclear rocket engine system was
tested for the first time Thursday,
and scientists called the important

step in advanced space exploration
successful.
A Nerva engine system was brought
to 40 per cent power in two 15-min
ute runs which developed 22,(XX)
pounds of the system's 55,000 pounds
of thrust. In the morning and after
noon tests, an almost colorless flame
was shot 300 feet into the air.

• Lunar Landing Praised
MOSCOW — A Soviet space station
made history's first soft landing on
the moon Thursday, Moscow an
nounced.
British scientists in England said
the unmanned capsule, Luna 9, sent
pictures bacK to earth from the
moon's surface.
A Tass announcement said the land
ing was made at 9:30 p.m. Moscow
time—l:3o p.m. EST —after the ship,
launched Jan. 31, had hurtled through
space for more than three days.
Sir Bernard Lovell, director of the
radiotelescopic observatory at Jodrell
Bank, England, said the feat "puts
the Russians ahead in the space race."
From Washington President John
son sent a personal message to the
Soviet Union on the achievement, say
ing "all mankind applauds" the land
ing.
Four previous Soviet attempts at
a soft landing had failed.
Jodrell observatory scientists said
Luna 9 had sent fascimile pictures
back to earth from the moon's sur

face. This aspect was not immediately
announced in Moscow.
The brief Tass announcement on
the landing—the first official word
on the progress of the flight since
it was launched Monday—gave only
spotty details.
Nothing was said about the size,
shape, construction or weight of the
scientific instrument package. It is
thought likely to be more than 3,000
pounds. Nothing was said immediat

600 Americans and their families will
be flown here from Cuba this week
end in what U. S. officials call the
largest repatriation movement of its
kind since World War 11.
A State Department spokesman

sure that the repatriation flights will
begin Saturday and continue on a
two-flight each weekend basis."
Lists prepared by the Swiss Embas

• Enclave Strategy Vettted
NEW YORK — Gen. Maxwell D.
Taylor totally rejected Thursday the
"enclave strategy" for Vietnam rec
ommended by his old paratroop com
rade-in-arms, Lt. Gen. James M. Ga
vin.
Taylor, former ambassador to Viet
nam and now special adviser to the
President, said he believes the United
States and its allies can achieve their
objective in Vietnam: "To give the
people of South Vietnam their choice
of government."
Gavin, former Army planning
chief, has proposed that the U. S.
forces in Vietnam limit themselves
to holding coastal enclaves while pur
suing a peace effort in the United
Nations.
• Nuclear Rocket Tested.
JACKASS FLATS, Nev. — A
nuclear rocket engine system was
tested for the first time Thursday,
and scientists called the important

step in advanced space exploration
successful.
A Nerva engine system was brought
to 40 per cent power in two 15-min
ute runs which developed 22,(XX)
pounds of the system's 55,000 pounds
of thrust. In the morning and after
noon tests, an almost colorless flame
was shot 300 feet into the air.

• Lunar Landing Praised
MOSCOW — A Soviet space station
made history's first soft landing on
the moon Thursday, Moscow an
nounced.
British scientists in England said
the unmanned capsule, Luna 9, sent
pictures bacK to earth from the
moon's surface.
A Tass announcement said the land
ing was made at 9:30 p.m. Moscow
time—l:3o p.m. EST —after the ship,
launched Jan. 31, had hurtled through
space for more than three days.
Sir Bernard Lovell, director of the
radiotelescopic observatory at Jodrell
Bank, England, said the feat "puts
the Russians ahead in the space race."
From Washington President John
son sent a personal message to the
Soviet Union on the achievement, say
ing "all mankind applauds" the land
ing.
Four previous Soviet attempts at
a soft landing had failed.
Jodrell observatory scientists said
Luna 9 had sent fascimile pictures
back to earth from the moon's sur

face. This aspect was not immediately
announced in Moscow.
The brief Tass announcement on
the landing—the first official word
on the progress of the flight since
it was launched Monday—gave only
spotty details.
Nothing was said about the size,
shape, construction or weight of the
scientific instrument package. It is
thought likely to be more than 3,000
pounds. Nothing was said immediat
ely about the kind of data being
radioed back to earth.
Soviet commentators soon beamed
out thousands of words in praise of
the accomplishment.

Vietnamese regulars fighting along
side the Viet Cong were reported to
have suffered their worst punish

While American fliers struck

North Vietnam utilized the 37-day
bombing moratorium to construct

about 60 new missile sites and
strengthen its conventional air de
fenses.
Briefing officers said U. S. Air
Force Thunderchiefs sank a barge
and set fire to another on the Song
Ma River 60 miles southwest of Ha
noi and heavily damaged approaches
to a Highway 122 bridge about 65
miles south of the Red capital. U. S.

North Vietnam's main port.
A South Vietnamese spokesman an

heavily crippled one full regiment of
regulars from the North and a second
regiment made up of North Vietna
