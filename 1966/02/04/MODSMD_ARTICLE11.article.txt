# The 						'Heroes Of Telemark' Comes Over Like A Lark
## 
### ANDREW WILSON 
Kirk Douglas has the unlike
ly part of a playboy nuclear
physicist in an unlikely movie
called "The Heroes of Tellmar."
Ulla Jacobson also stars. So
does somebody else, but that
doesn't really matter because
neither does the movie. They
are all fellow members of a
resistance movement which
succeeds in the plot but other
wise fails.
Drip, drip, drip, the opening
scene zeroes in on a leaky fau
cet. An intriguing bit of banali
ty. Only it looks a trifle too
shiney to be an ordinary faucet
and when the focus broadens
one sees that the surrounding
paraphanelia is too elaborate to
be just anybody's kitchen sink.
Actually, this is a heavy water
distillery set up in Norway by
the Nazi's.
The fate of the world hinges
upon whether enough heavy wa
ter is dripped for the Germans
to drop an atomic bomb. Nat
urally the time element is cru
cial and just to drive this across
the solemn drip, drip scene is
recut into all the movie's grip
ping climaxes. Dramatic? Hard
ly. While the banality persists
throughout, the intrigue wears
thin.
Flimsy Characterization
A legitimate source of con
flict arises from a decision on
whether or not to sacrifice neu
tral civilians for the greater
good of the world, but the mo
vie's flimsy characterizations
quickly stultify this.
The vital distillery is located

in a large factory in a Norwe
gian village. Bombing seems
the obvious way to destroy the
distillery, but, as the factory is
not an easy target, this would
simultaneously wipe out most
of the village. The resistance
underground succeeds once in
demolishing the distillery with
dynamite. All the parts, how
ever, are soon replaced and
everything is put back in work
ing order, making bombing vir
tually imperative.
At this point phony scenes —
like one in which a fight en
sues Douglas' refusal to ex
plain the quantum theory to a
resistance co - worker who de
mands to know the factory's
significance, or like all the
heroine's drawn-out soliloquies
over what she can tell the moth
ers who lose their babies —
white -wash what might have
been a poignant matter.
Sour Cream
There is also an affair be
tween Douglas and his ex-wife.
The main problem seems to be
that she is bothered by his cal
lousness. It bothers the audi
ence too because iced over in
all the schmaltz it never be
comes more than sour cream
filling.
On the positive side the mo
vie does generate some excite
ment in the chase scenes and
tense resistance intrigues. The
scenery offers some visual re
lief and the skiing looks excel
lent. However, if it is wild ski
chases that you want, it is here
proffered that you wait for
James Bond's, "In Her Majes
ty's Service."

lousness. It bothers the audi
ence too because iced over in
all the schmaltz it never be
comes more than sour cream
filling.
On the positive side the mo
vie does generate some excite
ment in the chase scenes and
tense resistance intrigues. The
scenery offers some visual re
lief and the skiing looks excel
lent. However, if it is wild ski
chases that you want, it is here
proffered that you wait for
James Bond's, "In Her Majes
ty's Service."
Kirk Douglas has the unlike
ly part of a playboy nuclear
physicist in an unlikely movie
called "The Heroes of Tellmar."
Ulla Jacobson also stars. So
does somebody else, but that
doesn't really matter because
neither does the movie. They
are all fellow members of a
resistance movement which
succeeds in the plot but other
wise fails.
Drip, drip, drip, the opening
scene zeroes in on a leaky fau
cet. An intriguing bit of banali
ty. Only it looks a trifle too
shiney to be an ordinary faucet
and when the focus broadens
one sees that the surrounding
paraphanelia is too elaborate to
be just anybody's kitchen sink.
Actually, this is a heavy water
distillery set up in Norway by
the Nazi's.
The fate of the world hinges
upon whether enough heavy wa
ter is dripped for the Germans
to drop an atomic bomb. Nat
urally the time element is cru
cial and just to drive this across
the solemn drip, drip scene is
recut into all the movie's grip
ping climaxes. Dramatic? Hard
ly. While the banality persists
throughout, the intrigue wears
thin.
Flimsy Characterization
A legitimate source of con
flict arises from a decision on
whether or not to sacrifice neu
tral civilians for the greater
good of the world, but the mo
vie's flimsy characterizations
quickly stultify this.
The vital distillery is located

in a large factory in a Norwe
gian village. Bombing seems
the obvious way to destroy the
distillery, but, as the factory is
not an easy target, this would
simultaneously wipe out most
of the village. The resistance
underground succeeds once in
demolishing the distillery with
dynamite. All the parts, how
ever, are soon replaced and
everything is put back in work
ing order, making bombing vir
tually imperative.
At this point phony scenes —
like one in which a fight en
sues Douglas' refusal to ex
plain the quantum theory to a
resistance co - worker who de
mands to know the factory's
significance, or like all the
heroine's drawn-out soliloquies
over what she can tell the moth
ers who lose their babies —
white -wash what might have
been a poignant matter.
Sour Cream
There is also an affair be
tween Douglas and his ex-wife.
The main problem seems to be
that she is bothered by his cal
lousness. It bothers the audi
ence too because iced over in
all the schmaltz it never be
comes more than sour cream
filling.
