# Othello In Cinema Mostly Successful
## 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
Often acclaimed Shakespeare's
most intense and tragic play,
"Othello" survives remarkably
the motion picture cameras
that translate the British Na
tional Theater production onto
the screen.
Sir Laurence Olivier turns in
a brilliant, if not too brilliant,
performance as Othello. Olivier
carries the role of the Moor tri
umphantly until the final
scenes when lago's treachery is
revealed to him. Olivier is
somewhat overly lofty at this
point in his portrayal of Othel
lo.
Here we have a superman,
the highest Venetian general
and Governor of Cyprus, led
into an hysteria of jealousy
that drives him to kill Desde
mona and then stab himself to
death. In these last scenes Oli
vier overacts the tragedy and,
consequently, detracts much
Xrom the audience's empathy
for Othello.
Finley's lago
Frank Finlay, who portrays
lago, comes through as a scur
rilous, petty miscreant bent on
Othello's destruction. Finlay in
terprets lago as ari ordinary
man instead of the diabolical
craftsman of cabal, because, as
Finlay said in a press confer
ence, "His (Iago) villainy is in
his ordinariness."
If lago is just an ordinary
person seeking revenge on
Othello, he becomes a joke and
the balance that is intended be
tween himself and Othello is
lost. This interpretation of la
go costs the production much
tension between the two char
acters.
One problem that Warner
Brothers faced in reproducing
the theater presentation is how
to capsulize a three-hour, three
dimensional play onto a mo
tion picture screen and still
maintain the concentration of
the audience. The problem is un
avoidable and unsolvable if the
movie is to be an exact repro
duction of the play as acted in
the theater.
In the film epics to date,
focus is relieved with

various diversions such as a
musical background and inter
mittant clips of scenery. But
when the sustained concentra
tion required to pick up the
Shakespearean dialogue is add
ed to the exhaustion of having
to stare at a two-dimensional
screen for a length of time,
emotions are drained and audi
ence attention becomes frustra
ted and practically smothered
by the end.
Another problem encountered
in transferring the stage to
cinema which was not adequate
ly handled in "Othello," is the
soundtrack. The modulation of
voices and tones vary so
much from instant to instant
that the microphones were not
able to make all of the dialogue
intelligible. Needless to say,
this is somewhat of a chore
when one moment Othello whis
pers a couplet under his breath
and the next he bellows in an
guish to the heavens. A chore
or not, a problem this is and
one which is irritating.
Stage Realism
The most apparent realism
injected into "Othello" to give
the production the aura of the
theater is the simplicity of
stage setting and confinement
of the film industry's prover
bial "camera gone beserk."
Never did the setting of an ex
cess of camera closeups and
gyrations detract from the ac
tors or the intentions of
Shakespeare.
The several faults in "Othel
lo" do not overwhelmingly de
preciate the intrinsic value of
the play or the production. Oli
vier as an actor and Shakes
peare as a playwright are an
unbeatable combination. The
Warner Brothers' portrayal of
pure theater is an innovation
in the film world. "Othello" is
an experiment that has to be
criticized in part, but succeeds
well on the whole.
