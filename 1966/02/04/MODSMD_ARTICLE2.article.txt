# 'Discipline' Resolution Discarded
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY Editorial Assistant 
The Legislature last night barely
defeated a resolution which would
have expressed its disapproval of
teachers' "political strikes."
The vote was 27 for the proposal
and 32 opposed.
The original resolution submitted
by Carl Anderson called for "discip
linary action" against a number of
instructors who cancelled their
classes last Monday when bombing
raids were resumed in North Vietnam.
Two Amendments
The resolution was amended twice
before its defeat, each amendment in
effect putting the proposal in more
moderate terms. A motion to post
pone consideration of the legislation
indefinitely was also defeated, by a
margin of one vote.
Another resolution which affirmed
the right of students and faculty to
discuss, plan and mount political
actions on the campus was not con
sidered.
A resolution expressing disapproval
of the practice of drafting members
of the academic community was re
ferred to the Student Affairs and
Services Committee, along with a
resolution calling for the revitaliza
tion of the Senior Colloquia program.
LASSU also passed a resolution
which was introduced to clarify social
regulations now under discussion in
the Social Regulations Committee and
Student Affairs and Services Commit
tee. The resolution named February
27 as the date by which a proposed
change in overnight sign-out rules
would go into effect.
A plan to make it possible for fresh
man and sophomore women to sign
out for overnights after midnight and
before 2:30, and Juniors and Seniors
any time before 6 a.m. is now being
considered by concerned organizations
on campus.
"Surprise And Alarm"
Some controversy has arisen over
the proposal because several members
of the administration consider the
change "substantive," and therefore
state that it cannot be introduced into
social regulations until a three-year
waiting period has passed.
The resolution approved by LASSU
contains a clause which says that
body "views with surprise and alarm"
the position that no changes can be
made within the next three years.
The matter has been referred back
to the Student Affairs and Services
Committee for clarification and fur
ther discussion.
Legislation was also passed provid
ing for the establishment of an Edu
cation Commission concerned with
investigating matters pertaining to
the academic climate of the Univers
ity.

resolution calling for the revitaliza
tion of the Senior Colloquia program.
LASSU also passed a resolution
which was introduced to clarify social
regulations now under discussion in
the Social Regulations Committee and
Student Affairs and Services Commit
tee. The resolution named February
27 as the date by which a proposed
change in overnight sign-out rules
would go into effect.
A plan to make it possible for fresh
man and sophomore women to sign
out for overnights after midnight and
before 2:30, and Juniors and Seniors
any time before 6 a.m. is now being
considered by concerned organizations
on campus.
"Surprise And Alarm"
Some controversy has arisen over
the proposal because several members
of the administration consider the
change "substantive," and therefore
state that it cannot be introduced into
social regulations until a three-year
waiting period has passed.
The resolution approved by LASSU
contains a clause which says that
body "views with surprise and alarm"
the position that no changes can be
made within the next three years.
The matter has been referred back
to the Student Affairs and Services
Committee for clarification and fur
ther discussion.
Legislation was also passed provid
ing for the establishment of an Edu
cation Commission concerned with
investigating matters pertaining to
the academic climate of the Univers
ity.
