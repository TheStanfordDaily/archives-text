## 
### 
The Organ-Grinder, a "1 o u d,
laughing, who-the-hell-cares dis
cotheque" will open tonight at
the Madera-Junipero dining
room. Every Friday night from
nine to one the Organ-Grinder
will feature records, live bands,
and dancing.
Tonight's program will in
clude entertainment by the Idol
Rich, a band, and the Guild
Singers, a non-union freshman
folk-singing group. Admission is
fifty cents, and all students are
invited, with or without dates.
According to Madera Fresh
man Neil Rifenbark, "the one
unifying problem that all stu
dents face is what to do on Fri
day night." Rifenbark claims
that "the Wilbur men are tired
of sitting in their rooms staring
at a bottle or a faded picture

and old letters. Friday night is
a time for action!"
In order to remedy this situa
tion, Madera, "the progressive
house," is opening the Organ-
Grinder. Rifenbark stresses that
"the Organ - Grinder is a re
spectable establishment, dedi
cated to the happiness and well
being of the student." He adds
that it is "entirely freshman run
•—a service to the community."
Rifenbark contrasts the Or
gan-Grinder to the Jester, which
he labels "a study break."
Reaction to the Organ-Grind
er has been varied. A sponsor
at Houston House feels that
"the Organ-Grinder is a fine
idea." According to one Madera
freshman, however, "someone
would have to be nuts to go
the Organ-Grinder."
