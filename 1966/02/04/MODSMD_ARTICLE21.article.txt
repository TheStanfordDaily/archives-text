# Tankers Vie In Stanford Relays
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity (6-0) and
freshman (2-0) swimming
teams, fresh from victories over
the Santa Clara Swim Club
last weekend, will face Santa
Clara, defending champion
Foothill College, Foothill Athle
tic Club, and Cal in the Annual
Stanford Relays at 2:00 p.m. in
the Encina Pool tomorrow.
The Relays boast a large por
tion of International class this
year. Luis Nicolao, Greg Buck
ingham, and Olaf Von Schiller,
just returned from a successful
weekend at the Bremen Inter

national Invitational Swim Fest
in Germany, will try their
hands at American water.
Nicolao won the 100 meters
butterfly (57.4) and the 100
freestyle (53.2), earning the
meet's Outstanding Swimmer
award. Nicolao will swim on
Stanford's freshman relays.
Von Schiller's Express
Von Schiller won both the
200 and 400 freestyle events.
Von Schiller will fly his flag
with the Santa Clara Swim
Club tomorrow.
Greg Buckingham, a Stanford
student that will bo eligible next

year, will also swim for Santa
Clara tomorrow. Buckingham
took second in the 400 individual
medley in Bremen, behind Ger
many's Erhardt Getz. Bucking
ham also swam the breaststroke
leg of the US 400 medley relay
that finished second.
Dick Roth, Olympic gold
medalist, and Mike Wall, also
a member of the 1964 Olympic
team, will put in their laps to
morrow. Both Roth and Wall
traveled to Bremen last year.
Depth Critical
The Relays, which consist of
ten events, place prime empha

sis on depth. Each relay race
has three or four men on a
team, and a swimmer can swim
in only three events.
A number of 'different'
events will be swum in the Re
lays. There will be a 300 back
stroke relay, as well as 300 yard
relays for breaststroke, butter
fly, and individual medley.
Standard dual meet 400 free
style and medley relays will be
swum. Abbreviated versions of
the same — 200 free and med
ley relays — will face rare col
lege tests.
'800' A Hair-Raiser
The 800 freestyle relay prom
ises to be the hottest of the
afternoon. Last year, the Stan
ford freshmen cracked the
American record for this event,
narrowly touching out Foothill.
Three of the four members
of that relay, Gary Sheerer,
Mike Greene, and Mike Wall,
will be back this year to better
their effort. Mark Parmely, also

a sophomore, will fill out the
foursome.
The Stanford frosh will make
it rough on the varsity. Dick
Roth, Luis Nicolao, Morgan
Manning, and either Paul Mey
er or Tom Jamison promise to
put together a sizzling tandem.
Santa Clara Formidable
Santa Clara Swim Club will
make it uncomfortable for both
squads, with Greg Buckingham,
Mark Spitz, Tim Cummings,
and Olaf Von Schiller.
Foothill College can be count
ed upon to mix things up in any
event, especially one that in
volves distance freestylers.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
looks optimistically at the 400
medley relay, where he has
what he considers his strongest
freshman unit. Bill Kee, Dick
Roth, Luis Nicolao, and Morgan
Manning will be gunning for
the NCAA frosh record they
missed by half a second three
weeks ago.
