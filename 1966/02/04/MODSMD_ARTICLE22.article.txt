# Recuperating Cards To Meet Oregon's Finest
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford's varsity basketball
taam returns to the home court
tonight after disastrous week
end when they were destroyed
by the two Arizona teams down
thi?re. But this weekend they
face league competition, which
will try to wrench the Tribe out
of the top spot in the AAWU.
After the two upset victories
over the LA teams the Indians
find themselves surprisingly in
a first place tie with Oregon
State and UCLA. Stanford
meets the two Oregon teams
here at the Pavilion, while the
Bruins will face the Washing
ton teams in the Northwest.
Against USC and UCLA it
seemed that Stanford's outside
shooting had become both con
sistent and devastating. But in
the desert last weekend the In
dians shot below 40% both eve
nings.
Oregon 2-2
Friday night the Oregon Web
foots will waddle in boasting a
2-2 league slate and everybody's
hero in the Beaver State, Jim
Barnett, is fourth on the all
lime Oregon scoring list. Ore
gon has won six of its last sev
en games, after losing six of
its first nine. They dropped
games to UCLA and USC, but
whipped both the Washington
entries.
Barnett does not seem to be
the entire story for Oregon for
he played well against both
USC and UCLA. It is established
that Barnett will get approxi
mately his 18 points per game,
but the Tribe cannot concen
trate too heavily upon Barnett,
thus allowing the rest of the
team to have a field day.
Belligerent Beavers
On Saturday Stanford is
faced with the prospect of fac
ing Oregon State, co-AAWU
leader. They may not be by
Saturday night, but they are
now. In the Far West Classic
these two teams played in the
finals, and the Beavers sur
prised Stanford with a stun
ning upset. Oregon plays a slow
down type of game, concen
trating on ball control causing
the defense to get into early
foul trouble. They hope that
Stanford will get a little too
over anxious on defense, thus
having this affect their offen
sive play also.
But when USF tried a stall
for the last two minutes in a
game earlier this season, Art

Harris made two steals, Stan
ford tied the game and won it
in overtime. Howard Hassen is
now in the starting line up, pri
marily for defense, so the Ore
gon Stallers may find that they
will have a more difficult time
than they did in the Far West
Classic.
Stanford must continue win

ning their league games to keep
pace with the UCLA Bruins, for
it is expected that they are not
going to lose too many more
league games. It would seem
that this would have to be the
year for Stanford to win the
league, if they consider win
ning it anytime within the next
four years.

here at the Pavilion, while the
Bruins will face the Washing
ton teams in the Northwest.
Against USC and UCLA it
seemed that Stanford's outside
shooting had become both con
sistent and devastating. But in
the desert last weekend the In
dians shot below 40% both eve
nings.
Oregon 2-2
Friday night the Oregon Web
foots will waddle in boasting a
2-2 league slate and everybody's
hero in the Beaver State, Jim
Barnett, is fourth on the all
lime Oregon scoring list. Ore
gon has won six of its last sev
en games, after losing six of
its first nine. They dropped
games to UCLA and USC, but
whipped both the Washington
entries.
Barnett does not seem to be
the entire story for Oregon for
he played well against both
USC and UCLA. It is established
that Barnett will get approxi
mately his 18 points per game,
but the Tribe cannot concen
trate too heavily upon Barnett,
thus allowing the rest of the
team to have a field day.
Belligerent Beavers
On Saturday Stanford is
faced with the prospect of fac
ing Oregon State, co-AAWU
leader. They may not be by
Saturday night, but they are
now. In the Far West Classic
these two teams played in the
finals, and the Beavers sur
prised Stanford with a stun
ning upset. Oregon plays a slow
down type of game, concen
trating on ball control causing
the defense to get into early
foul trouble. They hope that
Stanford will get a little too
over anxious on defense, thus
having this affect their offen
sive play also.
But when USF tried a stall
for the last two minutes in a
game earlier this season, Art

Harris made two steals, Stan
ford tied the game and won it
in overtime. Howard Hassen is
now in the starting line up, pri
marily for defense, so the Ore
gon Stallers may find that they
will have a more difficult time
than they did in the Far West
Classic.
Stanford must continue win

ning their league games to keep
pace with the UCLA Bruins, for
it is expected that they are not
going to lose too many more
league games. It would seem
that this would have to be the
year for Stanford to win the
league, if they consider win
ning it anytime within the next
four years.
Stanford's varsity basketball
taam returns to the home court
tonight after disastrous week
end when they were destroyed
by the two Arizona teams down
thi?re. But this weekend they
face league competition, which
will try to wrench the Tribe out
of the top spot in the AAWU.
After the two upset victories
over the LA teams the Indians
find themselves surprisingly in
a first place tie with Oregon
State and UCLA. Stanford
meets the two Oregon teams
here at the Pavilion, while the
