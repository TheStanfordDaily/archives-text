Stanford's frustrated matmen
battled San Jose State to a 14-14
tie last Wednesday night. The
grapplers will have a chance to
vent their bile today, as UCSB
hits the Encina mats at 4 p.m.,
and UCLA trundles into the
Gym at 8 p.m.
Indian coach Bill Leland sees
UCSB as a strong, well-rounded
team. UCLA has beaten the
Gauchos twice this season, and
on the basis of past perform
ance, UCLA should give the
Cards a stiffer struggle.
UCLA's two strongest spots
of the lineup lie at 160 and 177
pounds. The UCLA meats will
have to get around Steve
Schaum and Mike Davison, Stan
ford co-captains at those weight
divisions.
