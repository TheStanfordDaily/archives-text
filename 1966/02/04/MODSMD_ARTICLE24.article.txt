# SAC STATE HERE
## Ruggers Charge 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford Rugby team,
back on the winning track, hosts
the Sacramento State College
ruggers tomorrow afternoon at
1:30 on the Stanford rugby
field.
Last Saturday the Indians
captured a rain-soaked decision,
11-5, from the San Francisco
Olympic Club. Coach Pete Kme
tovic expressed a hope for a
dry game this Saturday.
"You just can't tell what will
happen when it rains. Both
teams are hurt and the wet ball
changes the whole complexion
of the game."
Stanford Attack All Wet
The rain last week turned the
game into a defensive battle
which saw Stanford never real
ly get a sustained offense drive
going. But for 2 scoring plays
by Bob Newberry and one long
run. by Mike Grace the Cards
might not have scored.
Newberry got the Indians in
to a quick lead with two scores
in the first half and Grace, the
teams leading scorer, scored
his try late in the game.

Sacramento will bring a strong
but inexperienced team to test
the Card ruggers. Rugby is a
relatively new sport at Sacra
mento State and the program
has not gotten strong yet.
However the Staters dropped
a close 11-9 loss to the Penin
sula Ramblers earlier this sea
son and the Ramblers defeated
the Indians for the team's only
loss of the year.
The Card ruggers will be at
nearly full strength this week.
Andy Ovenstone, hurt two
weeks ago, may also be ready
by game time. The probable
Stanford starters are:
Starting Lineup
Tom Fortmann, hooker; Joe
Neal, prop; Dave Pugh, prop;
Blaine Nye, 2nd row; Randy
Vahan, 2nd row; Eric De goo
yer, back row; Bob Newbery,

breakaway, David Evans,
scrum half; Dave Mac Queen,
Ist %; Mike Grace, 2nd %; Mac
Wylie, Center % ; Tim A be n a,
