# The 						Fearful Spectator
## Profs Seduce Students While Nobody Watches 
### Art Fisher 
A great and wearying tradition has developed
in the public prints. Conservatives make a prac
tice of periodic accusations that the university
faculties tend to be liberal, resulting in "academic
imbalance" and the seduction of otherwise con
servative student minds. Answering liberals
imply that this is an act of nature and that any
attempt to alter the situation would involve vio
lation of "academic freedom."
Proceeding on the assumption that small quan
tities of understanding may obviate great quanti
ties of dull rhetoric about practical matters, let
us inquire of both sides how they think these
things happen.
No Pied Piper Complex
It is patently false that students become more
liberal solely from a sort of Pied Piper complex
causing them to follow their professors. It is
equally false that the apparent liberal bias of
the faculty as a whole derives from the system
atic exclusion of those whose political premises
might lead them to disagree with the ruling
coterie. Discussion of the problem on such sim
plistic levels is irresponsible or cynical.
Similarly, that liberals, who claim to number
the university among their highest concerns,
should have as yet failed to explain or defend
this process adequately is at best a bit humorous.
What should be examined are the affinities
between liberalism, professors, and students. If
the conservatives can achieve a fuller mastery
of that process, they may come to do more than
correct an "imbalance of the faculties."
When complaining of this problem, conserva
tives have a way of forever repeating the same
few excluded names. It is to be suspected that
these few are not the leaders of a legion but
are in fact most of their army. The liberalism of
Ph.D. candidates leads to only slightly less lib
eral assistant professors and so forth. Hence a
search for the liberalizing process might begin
in the manner of thought current among aca
demicians and consequent of the nature of their
problems and their methods of solution.
The Professor
The professor is a theorist, a speculator, a
tinkerer, a deviser. He is an inventor of hypoth
esis, and consequently, he is an explorer of pos
siblity. He no longer is an absorber and reflector
of knowledge, but rather today, if he is to suc
ceed, he must act upon knowledge and extract
from it theories. He must lake what he has and
project well beyond it.
The historian must perceive relations and
essences not perceived before. The sociologist
must have guesses to devise his experiments. The
critic confronts an art world where innovation is
the rule, and he must always relate old works
to new people. The scientist and mathematician
are likewise possibility-prone.
Possibility and the extension of reality toward
it are very basic concepts in the complex called
liberalism.
The professor is a deviser and a builder of
systems. Scholastic systems, reality systems,
testing systems, schemes of history, neat cate-

gories. Some if not all of these are constructs,
human inventions for the extension of reality
to encompass more of the possible. They are
impositions of order, imposed to facilitate the
achievement of a goal. At times the result is in
creased understanding, and at other times order
can become its own end. In any case, the in
tellectual devising of a system, the creation of
a reality to be imposed upon (and hence added
to) reality, is a primary tool of the mind. At
times such tools grow larger than their objects
and appear to become the basic reality and to
live eternally.
Such creation of systems is a very basic
method, and now perhaps an essence, of the com
plex today called liberalism.
Fallen and Embittered?
There is a theory that because professors fall
into the lower reaches of society economically
and socially, they are embittered and hence be
come enemies of the power structure. A variant
theory is that they in fact fall into the higher
reaches, but not so high as they believe befits
them. That these theories have a certain nine
teenth century quaintness is hardly grounds for
dismissing them.
Rather these notions may be altered after some
slight acquaintance with professors. Very, very
few professors are genuine non-conformists in
any public v/ay, nor are many wild-eyed, fanat
ical, or even particularly excited. Mostly they
are calm, and this is perhaps more significant
than the fact of their interest or concern. There
are a few obtrusive exceptions. Save for these
exceptions, most professors are hardly more lib
eral than a handful of U.S. Senators. (It must be
understood that these notes form background,
not explanation, for professors' personal re
sponses to the present crisis.)
Mutual Suspicion
A mutual suspicion bordering on fear tends to
develop between groups of differing ideologies,
and disparities of intelligence often aggravate
this problem. Too, the present has a tendency
to be comparatively harsher in its condemnations
of what are perceived as follies of the immediate,
rather than of the distant, past. The scholar
hopes to be an investigator, a discoverer of truth,
and unmasker of lies, a corrector of misconcep
tions, and hence an attacker of the public myth
ology or "conventional wisdom," and at times he
goes overboard.
Conservatives have a stake rooted in the "con
ventional wisdom" and in the ways of the past.
It is noteworthy that as President Johnson de
pends more heavily on public mythology for his
support, academicians become alienated.
Topics like these don't fit In a column. They
seem somehow more worthy than the continual
harangue. Perhaps the regular players will now
pick up the ball.
None of which says that an inclination to be
seduced will not make seduction more likely. The
inverse may be proven by experiment, but such
questions arc not so interesting as is how it all
happens.
