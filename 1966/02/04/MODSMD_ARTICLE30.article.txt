# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## On Ants, Mash, And War 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's
Once and Future King mobilize
for war, they both broadcast to
their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive
one.
• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.
• If we do not attack them to
day, they will attack us to
morrow.
• In any case we are not at
tacking them at all. We are
offering them incalculable
benefits.

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let
ters;
• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol
icy.

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.
TOM COOK
• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.
DAVID ANDERSON
• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.
RICHARD NEWLIN
• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

• On Coffin
Editor, The Daily:
Many have exhorted us to re
pudiate what Rev. Coffin called
the "simplistic" stand of our
government on Viet Nam. But
we cannot make a simplistic
repudiation. We are not ready
to be rallied; we want, to be in
formed. Consequently, we have
been repeatedly disappointed
and saddened by the many lost
opportunities for reasoned ap
praisal. Those who exhort us
seem to asume that we agree
with their analysis of the facts;
they have seemed convinced
rather than convincing. We find
the expression of deep commit
ment quite moving; but we seek
to be convinced rather than
moved.

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva
tive, and familiar. But one reads
them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works
of art and offered them to you.
Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work
shop--or for that matter Se
quoia, Yiigcn, Table, Choice,
but one reads them because they
are honest work. It would make
Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom
ising in the stories and poems.
Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

and promising and it is too bad
that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re
viewers, however. I would sim
ply like to suggest that you
find people who are sensitive to
apprentice stuff to do your re
views. There is a kind of pom
posity in dragging out the guns
of Literary Criticism and spend
ing them on Workshop.
ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se

refer Mr. Olson to the "Viet

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva
tive, and familiar. But one reads
them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works
of art and offered them to you.
Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work
shop--or for that matter Se
quoia, Yiigcn, Table, Choice,
but one reads them because they
are honest work. It would make
Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom
ising in the stories and poems.
Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

and promising and it is too bad
that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re
viewers, however. I would sim
ply like to suggest that you
find people who are sensitive to
apprentice stuff to do your re
views. There is a kind of pom
posity in dragging out the guns
of Literary Criticism and spend
ing them on Workshop.
ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

(Editor's Note: Buchwald

Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se

humor and overall quality. We
refer Mr. Olson to the "Viet
nam" issue of The Daily last
Tuesday and Buchwald's col
umn entitled "Cleavage and
Bust."
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's
Once and Future King mobilize
for war, they both broadcast to
their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive
one.
• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.
• If we do not attack them to
day, they will attack us to

• In any case we are not at
tacking them at all. We are
offering them incalculable

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let

• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.
WILLIAM CALIN

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.
TOM COOK
• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.
DAVID ANDERSON
• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.
RICHARD NEWLIN
• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

Editor, The Daily:
Many have exhorted us to re

the "simplistic" stand of our

we cannot make a simplistic
repudiation. We are not ready
to be rallied; we want, to be in
formed. Consequently, we have
been repeatedly disappointed
and saddened by the many lost
opportunities for reasoned ap
praisal. Those who exhort us
seem to asume that we agree
with their analysis of the facts;
they have seemed convinced
rather than convincing. We find
the expression of deep commit

he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.

• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.

• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.
RICHARD NEWLIN
• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva
tive, and familiar. But one reads
them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works
of art and offered them to you.
Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work
shop--or for that matter Se
quoia, Yiigcn, Table, Choice,
but one reads them because they
are honest work. It would make
Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom

Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re

ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

(Editor's Note: Buchwald

Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se

humor and overall quality. We
refer Mr. Olson to the "Viet

Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis

two ant colonies in T. H. White's
Once and Future King mobilize

their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive

• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.

offering them incalculable

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let
ters;
• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol
icy.

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let
ters;
• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.

• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.
DAVID ANDERSON
• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.

• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi

ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a

the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re

to seek a settlement is one of

which should not be calmly ac

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva

them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works

Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work

quoia, Yiigcn, Table, Choice,
but one reads them because they
are honest work. It would make
Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom

Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

and promising and it is too bad
that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re

ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.
ERIC OLSON

(Editor's Note: Buchwald

Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se
lected on the basis of interest,
humor and overall quality. We
refer Mr. Olson to the "Viet
nam" issue of The Daily last
Tuesday and Buchwald's col
umn entitled "Cleavage and
Bust."
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's

their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive
one.
• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.

• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se

Bust."
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's

for war, they both broadcast to
their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous

have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive

• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.
• If we do not attack them to
day, they will attack us to

• In any case we are not at
tacking them at all. We are
offering them incalculable

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let

• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.
WILLIAM CALIN

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.
TOM COOK
• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.
DAVID ANDERSON
• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.
RICHARD NEWLIN
• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

Editor, The Daily:
Many have exhorted us to re

the "simplistic" stand of our
government on Viet Nam. But
we cannot make a simplistic
repudiation. We are not ready
to be rallied; we want, to be in
formed. Consequently, we have
been repeatedly disappointed
and saddened by the many lost
opportunities for reasoned ap
praisal. Those who exhort us
seem to asume that we agree
with their analysis of the facts;
they have seemed convinced
rather than convincing. We find
the expression of deep commit

to be convinced rather than

of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.

• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.

• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.

• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva
tive, and familiar. But one reads
them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works
of art and offered them to you.
Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work

Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom

Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re

find people who are sensitive to

ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

• We are more numerous

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let
ters;
• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol
icy.

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment

loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re

than had it not been resumed.

The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let
ters;
• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.

• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.

• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re

toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no

turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis

• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi

disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re

They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal

ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.
ERIC OLSON
Teaching: Fellow

(Editor's Note: Buchwald
writes three columns each week.
Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se
lected on the basis of interest,
humor and overall quality. We
refer Mr. Olson to the "Viet
nam" issue of The Daily last
Tuesday and Buchwald's col
umn entitled "Cleavage and
Bust."
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's
Once and Future King mobilize
for war, they both broadcast to
their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive
one.
• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.
• If we do not attack them to
day, they will attack us to
morrow.
• In any case we are not at
tacking them at all. We are
offering them incalculable
benefits.

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re

States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.

• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two

Tuesday and Buchwald's col

Bust."
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's
Once and Future King mobilize
for war, they both broadcast to
their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive
one.
• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.
• If we do not attack them to
day, they will attack us to
morrow.
• In any case we are not at
tacking them at all. We are
offering them incalculable

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let

• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol

• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.
TOM COOK
• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.
DAVID ANDERSON
• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.
RICHARD NEWLIN
• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

• On Coffin
Editor, The Daily:
Many have exhorted us to re
pudiate what Rev. Coffin called
the "simplistic" stand of our
government on Viet Nam. But
we cannot make a simplistic
repudiation. We are not ready
to be rallied; we want, to be in
formed. Consequently, we have
been repeatedly disappointed
and saddened by the many lost
opportunities for reasoned ap
praisal. Those who exhort us
seem to asume that we agree
with their analysis of the facts;
they have seemed convinced
rather than convincing. We find
the expression of deep commit

to be convinced rather than

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva
tive, and familiar. But one reads
them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works
of art and offered them to you.
Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work
shop--or for that matter Se
quoia, Yiigcn, Table, Choice,
but one reads them because they
are honest work. It would make
Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom
ising in the stories and poems.
Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

and promising and it is too bad
that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re
viewers, however. I would sim
ply like to suggest that you
find people who are sensitive to
apprentice stuff to do your re
views. There is a kind of pom
posity in dragging out the guns
of Literary Criticism and spend

we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.

• Lost Innocence
Editor, Th»> Daily:
In reply to George Racette's
letter on Feb. 2: He claims that
"everyone caught in the war is
an innocent victim." He places a
"woman who is incinerated by
napalm," a GI, and"the woman
who sits home waiting for a
telegram" announcing the death
of her husband, all in the cate
gory of innocent victims. There
is at least one great fallacy in
his thinking. Only the napalmed
woman is innocent. The GI is
there because he wants to be;
there are alternatives to fight
ing that he could have taken.
And the woman at home is not
an innocent victim; she sits in

active by choice. The SCPV has
realized that we all are respon
sible for what is happening in
Vietnam, that no one except the
civilians of that country are
innocent. The SCPV is not
"sticking to speech making" but
is thinking and acting in the
way that it believes best. All
Americans must at this time
think and act in one way or an
other. We cannot view ourselves
as innocent victims of a situa
tion for which we are not re
sponsible.

• Conrad's Gall
Editor, The Daily:
In the despair of Monday's re
newed bombings, Conrad's car
toon of the "suicide" of the U. S.
peace offensive was particular
ly galling. The clever retort
that evades refutation, the tren
chant thrust that harbors no
reply these are the carica
turist's forte. Yet the superfi
cial visual irony of such master
pieces as his "I'd rather bitch
than fight" does express Con
rad's political opinion. The vis
ual impact of his cartoons con
ceal an unquestioning appeal to
red-blooded jingoism.
His recent cartoon of the
scraggy student blood-donor
demonstrat ing among flag
draped caskets, with the pi us
caption, "Others have already
given their blood," similarly con
fuses all attempts at under
standing by a cynical appeal to
Americanism. If it dares to ques
tion the "national interest," the
other side has its own unreason
ing appeal: the cartoon of a
Vietnamese peasant with his
tiny, bloody son limp in his
arms — apparently not Conrad's
sentiment, perhaps not yours,
but for the peasant and for some
of us profound horror and mis
erableness. Conrad would have
us snigger whose only recourse
is to weep.

• Stubborn Ho
Editor, The Daily:
A number of faculty members
have stated their strong opposi
tion to the resumption of bomb
ing North Vietnam. Although I
disagree with them, I feel that
the courageous expression of
their opinions, apparently re
spected by the leaders of North
Vietnam, entitles them to a priv
ilege which it is their duty to
exercise. It is only proper that
these faculty members strongly
urge Ho Chi Minh to send a
representative to discuss possi
ble grounds for negotiation with
the United States government.
They should urge Ho Chi Minh
to drop his intransigent refusal
to consider a peaceful settle
ment which is politically feasi
ble in the United States. The
dangers of nuclear war affect
everyone, and the stubborn re
fusal of the North Vietnamese
to seek a settlement is one of
the key elements in our present
dangerous situation, an element
which should not be calmly ac
cepted.

Editor, The Daily:
Many have exhorted us to re

we cannot make a simplistic

formed. Consequently, we have
been repeatedly disappointed
and saddened by the many lost
opportunities for reasoned ap
praisal. Those who exhort us

• Workshop Defended
Editor, The Daily:
I am finally annoyed by your
reviews of Workshop (Daily,
Feb. 2) to write a letter about
it.
Why don't you assign the re
views to someone who likes to
read? Mr. Bjoring, who con
siders 15 pages to be a long lit
erary magazine, is obviously not
your man. One reads experimen
tal and undergraduate literary
magazines, after all, with the
expectation that they will con
tain much that is crude, deriva
tive, and familiar. But one reads
them anyway because writing is
a good thing and because peo
ple have tried to make works
of art and offered them to you.
Any damned fool can tell
what is wrong with the Work
shop--or for that matter Se
quoia, Yiigcn, Table, Choice,
but one reads them because they
are honest work. It would make
Infinitely more sense and take
a lot more critical intelligence
to say what is good and prom
ising in the stories and poems.
Cheri Dyck's sketch, for ex
ample, seems to me both good

and promising and it is too bad
that Bjoring (who found a page
and a half too long) could not
have seen that and said so. I
don't moan to attack your re
viewers, however. I would sim
ply like to suggest that you
find people who are sensitive to
apprentice stuff to do your re
views. There is a kind of pom
posity in dragging out the guns
of Literary Criticism and spend

ROBERT HASS
• Ilogical War
Editor, The Daily:
Today, in Vietnam, the United
States is engaged in a conflict
the logic of which is totally in
compatible to the Western
mind. In addition to differences
of political thinking between
the opposing factions, there is
a completely dissimilarity in
thinking, a different order of
logic. Some differences of logic
stem from vastly divergent bas
ic premises. (Logic can only ren
der an argument valid—its truth
depends upon the initial prem
ises). To one side of the fight,
human life is a commodity, like
coal or iron, to lie exploited and
used; while to the other, human
beings are the raison de'et r«> in
the first place. On one side, war
is waged with armies; on the
other with terror and disruption
—what is immoral in one camp
becomes the standard of opera
tion in the other.

How, in this double standard,
can our university's epic little
minds outline so clearly an issue
of morality? If we are to assume
that war is immoral, as by West
ern standards it most certainly
is, we must also admit to its ef
fectiveness (Witness Hitler's re
moval from power). There may
be other less gory ways to re
solve differences, but there are
none known in which both
sides do not willingly resolve
themselves, whatever the rea
sons. If one ideology is to de
pend entirely on the effective
ness of war, what remains
there for the other side to do?
A unilateral cease-fire will not
work (Christmas truce . . .). To
surrender would seem to be the
only other possibility, but would
that not invite and ultimately
lead to the breakdown of all
concepts of peaceful order in
which one individual or power
cannot take brutally from an
other?
And so war is forced. By its
nature, war is violent because
it comes of frustration . . . peo
ple will die. There is no "nice"
war, there is no "nice" way to
kill. War is a torture, only
"nice" when they stop. There
can be no distinction between
machine-gunned buses or na
palm, there can be no separa
tion of satchel bomb and aerial
bomb. The difference lies in liv
ing or dying.
ROBERT H. SMITH
• And Finally
Editor, The Daily:
I lived in Cambridge for three
years before coming here this
year and before that I lived in
Los Angeles. In both of these
cities the Art Buchwald column
was syndicated in the papers
which I read. I have two recol
lections of the column which
bring a most disquieting
thought to my mind: one is that
the column appeared daily and
the other is that he wrote on
many subjects and needled
those of many positions and
persuasions. I notice that this
column appears only occasion
ally in The Stanford Daily and
that when it does it seems to
concern only one matter: criti
cism of the present administra
tion and in particular of the
administration's position on the
war in Vietnam. While it seems
possible that Buchwald is no
longer writing daily and that
he now has only one thing to
say, it occurs to me that it is
possible that the Stanford Daily
Editorial Board is running se
lected columns and that that
selection runs against a fair
selection representing Buch
wald writing. If this is the case
it is a most upsetting phenome
non that a newspaper which
has (this year at least) stood
boldly for the right of various
groups to be heard, has effect
ively edited out the qualifying
parts of the remarks of one col
umnist whose views that paper
purports to run. If in fact you
are running a fair selection of
Buchwald's columns I apolo
gize for suggesting otherwise,
but if that is the case the col
umn has changed substantial
ly between the time I left Har
vard in the Spring and reached
Stanford in the Fall.

(Editor's Note: Buchwald
writes three columns each week.
Because of space limitation*,
The Daily generally prints two
of them. The columns are se
lected on the basis of interest,
humor and overall quality. We
refer Mr. Olson to the "Viet
nam" issue of The Daily last
Tuesday and Buchwald's col
umn entitled "Cleavage and
Bust."
Editor, The Daily:
It is comforting for me to note
that the present world crisis
is not without precedent. When
two ant colonies in T. H. White's
Once and Future King mobilize
for war, they both broadcast to
their people the following pro
nouncement:
• We are more numerous
than they are, therefore we
have a right to their mash.
• They are more numerous
than we are, therefore they
are wickedly trying to steal
our mash.
• We are a mighty race and
have a natural right to sub
jugate their puny one.
• They are a mighty race and
are unnaturally trying to
subjugate our inoffensive
one.
• We must attack them in
self-defense.
• They are attacking us by
defending themselves.
• If we do not attack them to
day, they will attack us to
morrow.
• In any case we are not at
tacking them at all. We are
offering them incalculable
benefits.
RONALD ADIJ2R

• Missing The Point
Editor, The Daily:
The argument of Mr. George
Ilacette in Wednesday's Daily,
whereby he attempts to defend
the use of napalm and incessant
bombing in Vietnam, sadly, tra
gically misses the point. It be
trays the same oversimplified
"all or nothing" mentality ex
pressed by Barnett Adelmann,
president of the napalm-produc
ing plant, who said he would
make any weapon this govern
ment asked him to (Does any
body remember Krupp or I. G.
Farben?) since he saw no dif
ference between small arms and
chemical, bacteriological, or
atomic weapons — and anyway,
war is hell.
The point which both Mr. Ra
cette and Mr. Adelman miss is
that even in war there are lim
its. Even if one grants that our
soldiers have a right to be in
Vietnam in the first place (a
point which I, incidentally, re
ject emphatically >„ their pur
pose becomes not to win at any
cost but to terminate the con
flict with honor — something
which, I submit, can only be ac
complished by a negotiated with
drawal, and not on terms dicta
ted by us. By our callous disre
gard for human life, as ex
pressed in our incineration of
civilian populations, we are not
helping our cause, nor are we
(as Mr. Racette would imply)
saving Americai GI lives. We are
prolonging the war, causing the
entire civilized world to turn
against us, risking danger of a
world war and, ultimately,
costing more lives (GI and "en
emy") than if we followed a ra
tional, humane course of action.
Despite the contentions of
hardboiled cynics like Mr. Ra
cette, the fact remains that
moral values are an important
force in world politics and lhat
power without a moral base will
someday destroy itself.

• Radical—Lash
Editor, The Dally:
While agreeing with criticism
of President Johnson's decision
to lesume bombing of North
Vietnam, and supporting actions
which may lead to a change in
present U.S. policy, we feel that
marches as a means of protest
tend to discourage rather than
promote additional support out
side the university community.
If marches are intended to stim
ulate discussion and concern
among those who are as yet
uncommitted, we believe that
the negative psychological re
action to marchers may alienate
many potential allies who refuse
to align themselves with "stu
dent radicals." We have not yet
seen evidence to contradict the
hypothesis from the dissonance
theory: The greater the pres
sure used to elicit behavior con
trary to one's private attitude,
the less his attitude will change.
If, moreover, marches are in
tended to demonstrate support
of those Congressmen and Sena
tors who are demanding re
evaluation of our Far Eastern
policy, we question whether
marches enhance the effect of
letters, telegrams, and rallies.
Although we feel strongly im
pelled to act on such a critical
issue, we would favor —
• Publicizing, by means of
newspapers, private discussions,
and rallies, the support which
Congressmen, Senators, and oth
er highly respected men are
lending to the cause;
• Backing the existing organi
zations to which these men be
long, such as ARFEP and the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, by fund-raising and let
ters;
• Demanding the public re
lease of the secret government
reports on Vietnam which Sen.
Fulbright claims would convince

all Americans of the error in
the administration's present pol
icy.

CAROL WHITE
• The Jews And Duty
Editor, The Daily:
When the Jews were carted
off to detention camps, the Ger
man professors were no doubt
also told that their first fluty
is to their students, that they
are the employees of their uni
versity and students, that they
must not place selfish personal
opinion above professional duty,
i.e., imparting to their students
the pursuit of truth in their
chosen course of study, that par
ticipating in a general strike is
not proper, a violation of aca
demic duty, and sentimentality
of the worst kind (paraphrase
or direct quote from Letters to
the Editor and statements by
three professors, Daily, Feb. 1).
They listened and kept silent.
We have learned a lesson from
our German brothers: that al
though, as scholars, we devote
our lives to the pursuit of truth
in our chosen fields, there comes
a time when, as intellectuals and
as human beings, we must pro
test against inequity to the very
core of our beings. Those pro
fessors who dismissed their
classes on January 31 consider
the Johnson policy in Vietnam
and the ensuing threat of World
War 111 such a time.
The university is a commun
ity of scholars, masters and dis
ciples, engaged in learning and
research, we are not our stu
dents' employees. The General
Strike, by professor and stu
dent, is considered a perfectly
legitimate political arm through
out the civilized world, although
to be effective it must be car
ried out on a national scale
(SCPV, take note). I can ap
preciate that the life of the in
tellectual is not readily under
standable to midddle class Cali
fornia adolescents and their par
ents. They will simply have to
try harder.
WILLIAM CALIN

• Negative Effect
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just
made a political and moral deci
sion of great importance and
difficulty, involving complex is
sues and facts, some of which
may well be unknown to me.
I sympathized with him while
he was making the decision, and
sympathize with him now that
he is facing its public and pri
vate consequences.
However, I cannot agree with
his decision to resume bombing
North Vietnam. I feel that prior
to his decision there should have
been more public debate, es
pecially in Congress. I also feel
that, despite North Vietnamese
intransigence, not all possibili
ties for peace have been ex
plored. If there is truth in re
ports from Cairo that the U. S.
government is prepared to al
low representatives of the Na
tional Liberation Front at nego
tiations, I wonder why this is
not stated publicly. And if these
reports from Cairo are not true,
I feel that preventing the Na
tional Liberation Front from
participating in negotiations as
an autonomous entity leaves
one possibility for peace still un
explored.
In any case, I doubt the value
of bombing as a solution to the
problem. Studies of the effects
of bombing in World War II
lead one to expect an increase in
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong morale and war effort.
Further, analysis of internation
al and national politics may lead
one to expect bombing to result
in: an increase in outside sup
port for the North Vietnamese
war effort, thereby keeping the
Viet Cong supplies at least the
equal of present supplies; forc
ing China and the USSR into
closer political cooperation
perhaps to the embarrassment
of the USSR and to the detri
ment of Soviet-American rela
tions. Other effects may be: a
loss of American prestige among
non-aligned nations; an in
creased probability of war with
China; and the growth of infor
mal forces within the USA
whose aim is to curb public op
position to present policies.
If some of the above are valid,
we may expect bombing to re
sult in more American deaths
than had it not been resumed.
