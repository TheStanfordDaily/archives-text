# LBJ's Pastor Raps Extremism, Press
## 
### ERIC MILLER 
Modern man is "too much con
cerned with the weakness of Western
civilization and not with its
strengths," aserted Dr. George R.
Davis, President Johnson's pastor, in
a speech last night in Tresidder.
Dr. Davis, pastor of the National
City Christian Church in Washington,
D.C., was giving his "Answer to the
Death Wish of Modern Man" as part
of this quarter's contemporary mor
ality series. He will remain on campus
as Wilbur Hall's guest-in-residence
until Sunday.
Extreme extremism, the arrogance
of liberalism, and an irresponsible
press are among the forces which in
dicate a death wish in Western man,
factors which threaten to destroy our
civilization.
"We're telling ourselves how bad we
are," he said, but maintained that
many elements do not recognize that
all is so bleak. The darkness is that
before a dawn, not that of an immin
ent doom.
"Part of the answer to the death
wish is a longing for renewal."
He attacked current extremism for
a "we'll have it our way or let it go"
attitude, implying that many extrem
ists would throw out the whole of
western civilization if they could not
get the reforms they desired.

He also attacked "arrogant liberal
ism," a state of mind which ada
mantly holds to its "liberal" doctrine.
Speaking "as one who would like to
be called a liberal," Dr. Davis stated
that the radical right—the Birchers
and the KKK—are "supposed to be
arrogant," but emphasized that there
is no place for such a closed mind
in the liberal camp.
As another destructive influence in
our world, Dr. Davis claimed "total
irresponsibility on the part of the
press."
"How can you debate an issue if by
the time it gets to the press it is
twisted completely out of propor
tion?"
