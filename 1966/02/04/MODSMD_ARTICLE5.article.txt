# Sigma Chi Challenges New Pledge
## 
### 
The national membership commit
tee of Sigma Chi fraternity has re
fused to approve initiation of a Lafay
ette College pledge of Korean ances
try, the college disclosed last week.
Lafayette College is the second to
become involved in a direct test of
de facto discrimination within Sigma
Chi. The national has been under fire
across the country since its suspen
sion of the Stanford chapter in April,
1965, just before the chapter was to
pledge a Negro.
In the Stanford case, the national
office claimed the suspension was not
for taking a Negro but for "contin
ual disregard of, and actual opposition
to, the ritual requirements of the fra
ternity." The suspension was, the na
tional said, based on "deliberate vio
lation of pledge education procedures
and financial responsibility."
The Stanford Chapter said it paid
its dues regularly and had not
changed its pledge education practices
for years. The chapter had deelared
its independence of the national on
membership matters before rushing
the Negro student and had informed
the national of its intention to pledge
a Negro.
