# VDC Holds Protest Defying Chancellor
## 
### The Associated Press 
A showdown is developing on the
University of California campus be
tween Chancellor Roger W. H e y n s

and the radical student movement
over rules controlling protest rallies.
Heyns announced Thursday that
disciplinary action was being initia
ted against students who violated the
rules with a Vietnam Day Committee
rally Wednesday protesting the re
suming of American bombing in
North Vietnam.
It appeared to be a deliberate choice
of the committee leaders to defy the
rules as a challenge to Heyns, who
took over as chancellor Sept. 18.
Defy Rules
The rules proclaimed by Heyns last
fall limit a student group to one rally
a week on the steps of Sproul Hall,
the university administration center,
and require use of university-supplied
loudspeaker equipment.
The VDC group had staged a Sproul
steps rally on Monday.
Robert Cole, university legal coun
sel, advised the VDC leaders that their
Wednesday rally, being the second in
the week, violated the rules. He ad
vised that they move to the lower
Student Union plaza.
The VDC group produced its own
loudspeaker equipment and proceed
ed with its rally on the Sproul steps
before an assembly estimated at
about 300.
Disciplinary Action
One of the rally speakers was Bet
tina Aptheker, an avowed Communist
and daughter of Herbert Aptheker,
New York Communist theoretician
who visited Hanoi last month.
Miss Aptheker, a junior history ma
jor, was elected last semester to the
committee on rules, set up to advise
Chancellor Heyns on the effectiveness
of rule enforcement.
Miss Aptheker Confident
She said the Wednesday rally inci
dent demonstrated the VDC need to
fight a two-front war—against sup
pression of the right to protest and
against the Vietnam war itself.
"We won that fight before and
we'll win it again," she said.
Miss Aptheker participated in the
December 1964 sit-in occupation of
Sproul Hall in support of the Free
Speech Movement's demand for the
right to advocate political and social
causes on and off the campus.
Jerry Rubin, a non-student VDC
leader, said disciplinary action against
the rally speakers would prove very
unfortunate for the university.
"It will open the lid," he said.

North Vietnam.
It appeared to be a deliberate choice
of the committee leaders to defy the
rules as a challenge to Heyns, who
took over as chancellor Sept. 18.
Defy Rules
The rules proclaimed by Heyns last
fall limit a student group to one rally
a week on the steps of Sproul Hall,
the university administration center,
and require use of university-supplied
loudspeaker equipment.
The VDC group had staged a Sproul
steps rally on Monday.
Robert Cole, university legal coun
sel, advised the VDC leaders that their
Wednesday rally, being the second in
the week, violated the rules. He ad
vised that they move to the lower
Student Union plaza.
The VDC group produced its own
loudspeaker equipment and proceed
ed with its rally on the Sproul steps
before an assembly estimated at
about 300.
Disciplinary Action
One of the rally speakers was Bet
tina Aptheker, an avowed Communist
and daughter of Herbert Aptheker,
New York Communist theoretician
who visited Hanoi last month.
Miss Aptheker, a junior history ma
jor, was elected last semester to the
committee on rules, set up to advise
Chancellor Heyns on the effectiveness
of rule enforcement.
Miss Aptheker Confident
She said the Wednesday rally inci
dent demonstrated the VDC need to
fight a two-front war—against sup
pression of the right to protest and
against the Vietnam war itself.
"We won that fight before and
we'll win it again," she said.
Miss Aptheker participated in the
December 1964 sit-in occupation of
Sproul Hall in support of the Free
Speech Movement's demand for the
right to advocate political and social
causes on and off the campus.
Jerry Rubin, a non-student VDC
leader, said disciplinary action against
the rally speakers would prove very
unfortunate for the university.
"It will open the lid," he said.
