# Rally Planned To Climax Week-Long Controversy
## 
### JACK TRINKLEIN 
Seven mid-Peninsula pcace groups
announced plans today for a public
meeting Saturday noon at Cogswell
Plaza in Palo Alto to protest the re
sumption of the bombing of North
Vietnam. The meeting will be pre
ceded by a short march for Palo
Alto's Hamilton Ave. Post Office to
Cogswell Plaza.
Professor Paul Wallin of the Stan
ford faculty group of Californians
for peace in Vietnam announced that
over 200 faculty members had by
Thursday afternoon agreed to attend
the meeting and that they were buy
ing a full-page advertisement in to
day's Daily to publicize that fact.
Groups sponsoring the meeting in
due Californians for Peace in Viet
nam (a group of Stanford faculty
members), Concerned Citizens of
Palo Alto, Concerned Citizens of San
Mateo, Mid-Peninsula SANE, Palo
Alto Religious Society of Friends,
Stanford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, and Women's International
League for Peace and Freedomâ€”Palo
Alto branch.
U. S. Policy Supported
This "concern" among students has
also been voiced in the opposite di
rection. Robert Stone, co - chairman

of Victory in Vietnam is Essential
(VIVE), with Jeffrey Gray and Bob
Clark, the president and vice-presi
dent of the Walter Army Society,
presented the following policy state
ment in to the Daily yesterday eve
ning:
"The Walter Army Soviety and
VIVE both support the basic element
of the Administration's policy in
South Vietnam and are therefore sym
pathetic to each other's efforts to
demonstrate their support of our
Government's actions in this area,
and to inform the public of the facts
with regard to the Vietnam Situa
tion."
The groups sponsoring Saturday's
meeting also announced that they
were buying a full-page advertise
ment in today's Palo Alto Times urg
ing citizens to attend the protest
meeting and to wire their opposition
to the bombing to Senator J. William
Fulbright, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in
Washington, D. C.
"Response Increasing"
Today Stanford students plan to
leaflet shopping areas in Palo Alto,
East Palo Alto, Mountain View, and
Menlo Park. Poul Goldman (not a
member of the Stanford Committee),

who is organizing the leafletting, said
that "response since Monday from
students previously unconcerned
with the war has been great and is
increasing." He cited the torchlight
parade held from Stanford to the Palo
Alto Post Office on Monday night in
which more than 500 participated as
evidence of a growing concern among
non-activist students.
The leaflet which the students will
pass out says in part "Sunday many
of us felt the same profoundly serious
sense of shock and concern that we
felt on November 22, 1963, when we
learned of the murder of John F. Ken
nedy. Many of us felt that we were
conscience-bound to stand and be
counted in opposition to the resump
tion of the bombing. But many of us
had no way to take that stand. Now
there is a way." There follows an in
vitation to take part in the meeting
protesting the resumption of bomb
ing of North Vietnam.
Speakers Announced
Speakers at the meeting will in
clude Rear Admiral Arnold True, Ed
ward Keating, editor of Ramparts
magazine in Menlo Park and congres
sional candidate for the 9th district;
Dr. George Leppert, congressional
candidate for the 10th district; Rab
bi Sidney Askelrad; Dr. Mark Man
call, assistant-professor of history at
Stanford; and William Stanton, As
semblyman from San Jose.
Morse Telegram
A representative for Charles M.
Stein, professor of statistics, called
in late last evening to report that a
three-page telegram had just been
received from Sen. Wayne Morse of
Oregon. It came in response to a call
by Professor Stein asking for a state
ment of approval for this coming
Saturday's rally. The most pertinent
section reads as follows:
"It is my judgement that we need
across America is educational discus
sion of the issues involved at the
community level. Calm, intelligent,
carefully prepared discussions pre
sented to community groups are
needed if the American people are
to be informed of the facts concern
ing the issues that are involved."
