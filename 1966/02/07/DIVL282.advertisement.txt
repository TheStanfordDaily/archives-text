A Word to the Weak
Do you sometimes feel a bit inadequate? Are you weak and helpless in
the face of life? Do you lack what it takes to be a man? Cheer up, you're
made that way. A lamp can't light without the current, a flower dies without
rain. The power you need must come from God.
Twenty-five hundred years ago the God of Israel led his chosen nation, the
Hebrews, out of the howling, barren wilderness of Arabia into long-promised
Canaan land, the place of triumph in a world of evil. After forty years of
empty wanderings, death and suffering, over a million Jews found an able
captain for their deliverance, a courageous leader for their salvation. When
Moses died, God commissioned this man, Joshua ("Jehovah is Savior"), with
these words, No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your
life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake
you. Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this people to inherit
the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. Only be strong and
very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law which Moses my
servant commanded you,- turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that
you may have good success wherever you go. The book of the law shall not
depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you
may be careful to do all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way
prosperous, and then you shall have good success. Have I not commanded you?
Be strong and of good courage; be not frightened; for the Lord your God is
with you wherever you go."
God does not tell a strong man "be strong" or the courageous "do not
fear." Jesus Christ said, "Without me you can do nothing." God deals with
the broken, helpless and inadequatel It is He who is the Strong and Adequate
One. Jeremiah acknowledges, "O Lord, my strength and my refuge in the day
of trouble, to thee shall all nations come. . . ." The Apostle Paul writes, "I can
do all things through Christ who strengthens me. The secret of greatness,
strength and fortitude is Jesus Christ. Have ycu exchanged your weakness for
his strength, his adequacy for your insufficiency, his life for your emptiness, his
power for your resourcelessness? To call on the strong name of Jesus is to tap
the power of the universe. It takes God to make a man a man. Why not be
someone, why not make your life count forever? The key to everything is
Jesus Christ.

strength and fortitude is Jesus Christ. Have ycu exchanged your weakness for
his strength, his adequacy for your insufficiency, his life for your emptiness, his
power for your resourcelessness? To call on the strong name of Jesus is to tap
the power of the universe. It takes God to make a man a man. Why not be
someone, why not make your life count forever? The key to everything is
Jesus Christ.

A Word to the Weak
Do you sometimes feel a bit inadequate? Are you weak and helpless in
the face of life? Do you lack what it takes to be a man? Cheer up, you're
made that way. A lamp can't light without the current, a flower dies without
rain. The power you need must come from God.
Twenty-five hundred years ago the God of Israel led his chosen nation, the
Hebrews, out of the howling, barren wilderness of Arabia into long-promised
Canaan land, the place of triumph in a world of evil. After forty years of
empty wanderings, death and suffering, over a million Jews found an able
captain for their deliverance, a courageous leader for their salvation. When
Moses died, God commissioned this man, Joshua ("Jehovah is Savior"), with
these words, No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your
life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you or forsake
you. Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this people to inherit
the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. Only be strong and
very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law which Moses my
servant commanded you,- turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that
you may have good success wherever you go. The book of the law shall not
depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you
may be careful to do all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way
prosperous, and then you shall have good success. Have I not commanded you?
Be strong and of good courage; be not frightened; for the Lord your God is
with you wherever you go."
God does not tell a strong man "be strong" or the courageous "do not
fear." Jesus Christ said, "Without me you can do nothing." God deals with
the broken, helpless and inadequatel It is He who is the Strong and Adequate
One. Jeremiah acknowledges, "O Lord, my strength and my refuge in the day
of trouble, to thee shall all nations come. . . ." The Apostle Paul writes, "I can
do all things through Christ who strengthens me. The secret of greatness,
strength and fortitude is Jesus Christ. Have ycu exchanged your weakness for
his strength, his adequacy for your insufficiency, his life for your emptiness, his
power for your resourcelessness? To call on the strong name of Jesus is to tap
the power of the universe. It takes God to make a man a man. Why not be
