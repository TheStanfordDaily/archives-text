• Congress Asks Debate
Washington—Some Democratic and

called on President Johnson today to
take the initiative in clarifying Amer
ican aims in the Viet Nam war. And
they agreed the whole subject needs
to be debated in Congress.
Rep. Gerald R. Ford, R-Mich., House

Minority Leader, criticized President
Johnson fur not briefing congress on
decisions he is about to make, such
as calling on the United Nations to
seek a peace and making his trip to
Hawaii to discuss the war with South
Vietnamese leaders.
The criticism was aired as the Sen

• Lutw 9 Is bid filled
Moscow — Soviet scientists an
nounced early today that Luna 9's
moon mission had been fulfilled. But

hours later scientists in England re
ceived another picture and sought
the significance of the transmission.
Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Brit
ain's Jodrell Bank Observatory which

something sensational is happening
to Luna 9."

to show that the suffice was not
deep in dust, but a sponge-like mass
scattered with rock capable of sup
porting a manned landing.
Foreign experts made their observa
tions too. Dr. Raymond Lyttleton of
Cambridge University, England, said
informaton from the Russian space
station would cut a year off the time
needed for the United States to put
a man on the moon.
