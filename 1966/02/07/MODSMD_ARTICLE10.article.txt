# 'Know Your Trustees' Pamphlet Offered By GCC Researchers
## 
### 
The research staff of the Grad
uate Coordinating Committee
(GCC) has compiled and pub
lished what member Jim Sayre
calls "an objective study" enti
tled "Know Your Trustees."
This five-page newsletter is
a compendium of facts without
editorial comment about each
of Stanford's 23 trustees, includ
ing his date of birth, corpora
tions with which he is directly
connected, and the references
used to compile these facts.
Copies of the newsletter are
available at the ASSU office in

Tresidder.
The GCC hopes that the release
"will lead to more informed dis
cussions about the role played
by the Board of Trustees in set
ting policy for the University."
Another statement of the pur
pose was made when Sayre said
that he hopes "for a re-evalua
tion of the Trustee system by
everybody."
The Board of Trustees is cus
todian of the endowment and all
the properties of the Univer
sity. It administers the invested
funds, sets the annual budget,

and determines policies for the
operation and control of the Uni
versity.
