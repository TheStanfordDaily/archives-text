# Moore To Probe Aleutian Trench
## 
### 
Palo Alto â€¢ born geologist Dr.
George W. Moore will be the
fifth lecturer in the 1966 series
on the earth sciences at Stan
ford University.
Now a staff member at the
U. S. Geological Survey (USGS)
in Menlo Park, Dr. Moore will
discuss "Sediment of the Aleu
tian Trench" at 4 p.m. today in
Room 320, Geology Building.
While the lccture will be tech
nical in nature, all interested per
sons are invited to attend.
The 25,000-foot Aleutian trench
is the deepest in U. S. territory.
It stretches about 1,000 miles
along the south coast of the
Aleutian Islands.
Its bottom has been sampled
by cores bored from a USGS re
search vessel. The longest core,
15 feet deep, is believed to go
back about 50,000 years into the
trench's history. Each inch of
sediment, the geologists believe,
is equal to approximately 250
years.
Oddly, the top two feet of sed
iment are different from the
rest, and are thought to have
been laid down since the area's
last great glaciers melted a few
thousand years ago. These sedi
ments match the volcanic rock
of the Aleutians.
The lower sediments are quite
different and were probably car
ried in muddy currents from
hundreds of miles away. They
resemble the soil composition
around Anchorage and South
Central Alaska. None of the
sediments appears to have any
mineral value.
