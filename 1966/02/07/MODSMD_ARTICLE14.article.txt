# Job Shortages, Lack Of Opportunity Plague Russian High School Grads
## 
### The Associated Press 
MOSCOW â€” A double-sized
Soviet high school graduating
class of next June learned today
that many of its members will
be put into undesirable jobs and
few will get into universities.
The bad news came in a Krem
lin statement that seemed in
tended to assure youths of 17
and 18 that Soviet leaders are
taking steps to solve a difficult
problem. But millions of anxious
parents and students are expect
ed to read the statement as any
thing but assuring.
The problem was created by
a 1964 decision to abandon a
program of Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev's for 11 years of
basic education instead of 10.
This will produce two gradu
ating classes in June. In addi
tion, the number of students
turned out of school after the
eighth grade to take jobs will be
higher than in the past.
Despite official statements
that the Soviet Union has no un
employment, there have been
signs of job shortages in some
fields and some geographic
areas. Getting into a Soviet uni
versity has always been very
difficult because of inadequate
capacity to meet demand.
With this background, the
Central Committee of the Sovi
et Communist Party and the

cabinet announced a broad pro
gram to try to meet the prob
lem. The party makes such de
cisions and the government
carries them out.
The decision "obligates local
agencies to insure the admission
of an increased number of pu
pils to various educational es
tablishments and also to insure
employment for those boys and
girls who cannot continue edu
cation without continuing
work," Tass said.
It said universities and other
higher schools will admit 34,000
additional full-time students.
This would be only a 9 per cent
increase over the number admit
ted in 1964, the last year for
which figures have been pub
lished. With the number of po
tential applicants rising perhaps
100 per cent, this meant the
proportion to be denied admis
sion would rise sharply. The
number of high school gradu
ates last year was 1.3 million
and this year, taking into ac
count the post war birth rate,
it might be more than twice
that many.
The decision provides for tech
nical schools to train skilled in
dustrial workers. Factories will
be allowed to set production
targets for youths as much as
20 per cent below normal for
their first four months on the
job.
