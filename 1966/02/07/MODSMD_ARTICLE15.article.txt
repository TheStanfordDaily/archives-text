# President Asks Change In Means Test For College Students Seeking Federal Loans
## 
### 
President Johnson has pro
posed new legislation that
would abolish direct federal
loans to college students and
establish instead a system of
government guarantees to banks
and other private institutions
that make such education
loans.
He also proposed changing the
definition of eligibility from
proven hardship, which officials
said amounted in practice to a
"means test" to a stated level
of family income, $15,000 a year.
During the fiscal year end
ing last June 30, the number of
borrowers under the National
Defense Education Act was
about 319,000. In his message,
President Johnson predicted
that the number would rise to
775,000 in the fiscal year begin
ning July 1.
Peter M. Muirhead, associate
commissioner of education, ex
plained that loans would no
longer be restricted to students
from the poorest families, em
phasizing President Johnson's
$15,000 figure. "This takes in a
good proportion of the middle
income families in the country,"
he said. "Approximately 90 per

cent of the students in institu
tions of higher learning today
come from families with in
comes of $15,000 a year or less."
The government would pay a
subsidy to the lenders in order
to maintain a 3 per cent interest
rate for the student borrowers.
Normal bank interest rates on
such loans at the current time
range from 6 to 8 per cent. The
loans would run as much as ten
years, with repayment deferred
until the student had completed
his studies. Part of the principal
would not have to be repaid by
those who became teachers.
The government has invested
$609 million in such loans in the
seven years the Defense Educa
tion Act has bee"n law, and 833,-
000 students have borrowed.
The delinquency rate on the
loans has been high, according
to normal loan standards, Office
of Education officials say. They
add that on any given day last
year, 16 per cent of all loans
were overdue or in default.
Banking circles, however, in
dicated their willingness to "co
operate enthusiastically with the
new program," a spokesman
said.

Rep. Edith Green (D., Ore.),
who is chairman of the House
subcommittee on education,
said she was reserving judg
ment on the program. "I'm not
necessarily opposed to the in
sured loan idea, but I think we
should see how well it works
before we abandon the other
plan."
