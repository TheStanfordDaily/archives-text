# I-CENTER STUDY
## Isolation Big Problem For Foreign Students 
### 
Foreign students at Stanford
can look forward to greater op
portunities for participation in
campus life, hopes the Non-Res
ident Student Associates Com
mittee, part of the Residential
Education Commission formed
last November.
The committee has asked
foreign students to fill out ques
tionnaires indicating their
choices among four general ac
tivity areas: social, sports, cul
tural and meals. The committee
hopes to interest campus resi
dences to include foreign stu
dents in these activities. Ques
tionnaires have also been sent
to the residences, which are ex
pected to discuss the idea this
week.
Foreign students received
their questionnaires in this
month's issue of the Foreign
Student Newsletter, and have
been asked to return it to the
I-Center by February 15.
Campus living groups have
been asked to turn in their ques
tionnaires to the directors of
their respective residences.
House officers have the ques
tionnaires for the purpose of
discussion during this week's
house meetings.
Co-chairman of the committee,
Robert Velarde, told The Daily:

"Eventually, we hope that we
can have the I-Center as co
ordinator for the activities, and
have foreign students become
'student associates' in the living
groups."
Velarde said that his commit
tee seeks to solve the problem
of "isolation" which foreign
students often encounter on
campus. According to Velarde,
the committee plans to expand
its efforts to include off-campus
students in general. Presently,
the committee is addressing it
self to the 900 foreign students
both on and off-campus.
The results of the question
naires will be evaluated by the
committee, and if student inter
est and response is great enough,
a program will be initiated to
meet the needs of both foreign
students and living groups.
Serving as Co-Chairman with
Robert Velarde is Kathy Zenoff.
