As in all close meets, there
were a number of "if's" that
could have changed the out
come markedly. For instance,
the Stanford varsity 300 breast
stroke relay was disqualified.

One point would have been
enough to win.
Santa Clara's 200 medley re
lay tied for second. If it had
taken a clean second or a defi
nite third, the Swim Club would
have won or lost the meet. In
that same event, the Stanford
frosh placed fifth, .1 second
out of fourth. Two tenths fast
er, and the frosh would have
been the victors. If ... .
Start Out Fast
Stanford's varsity took sec
ond in the first event, the 200
freestyle relay behind the Foot

then won the 200 medley relay
to take over a commanding
lead.
Bill Schubach, Bob Momsen,
Doug Miller, and Jim Laney
navigated the course in 1:42.7.
Laney's 22.1 anchor split was

the difference between first
place and two teams finishing
at 1:43.0.
The 800 freestyle relay
brought a showdown between
the Stanford frosh and the San
ta Clara Swim Club. Morgan
Manning, Paul Meyer, Luis Ni
colao, and Dick Roth won the
race in 7:16.4, one and a half
seconds ahead of Santa Clara.
Nicolao, ailing from a heel
infection that may have to be
operated upon this week, put
in a 1:47.2 leg to counteract
Greg Buckingham's 1:46.5 split
for Santa Clara.
Cards Take Fly Relay
The Stanford varsity jumped
back into the lead in the 300
butterfly relay, as Jim Laney,
Bill Manoogian, and Doug Mil

threesome averaged 54.9 for
each 100 yard leg. Santa Clara
pushed back into the standings,
winning the 300 backstroke re

Santa Clara tandem.
Bob Hart, just returning from

gaining second place.
Foothill College won its only
event of the day, the 300 breast
stroke relay in 3:12.9.
Star-Studded In Relay
The following event, the 300
individual relay, had to be the
most outstanding race of the
day.
Dick Roth, Luis Nicolao, and
Morgan Manning two world
record-holders and the fastest
high school 100 freestyle last
year â€” challenged Mark Spitz,
Tim Cummings, and national
record holder Greg Buckingham
of Santa Clara.

56.2 for each 100 IM leg, posting
a final time of 2:48.6, bettering
the old record by nine seconds.
Santa Clara finished a second af

teams.
Cal dominated the diving
event, totalling 441.6 points for
two men. Del Pletcher of Cal ac
cumulated 280.1, Bill Freeman

(246.1) and Bill Kennedy took
second for the Indians.
The Papooses took over the
meet lead with a come-from-be
hind victory in the 400 medley
relay. Bill Kee led off back
stroke, finishing even with San
ta Clara's Ivey, but behind
Foothill's Leasure.
Dick Roth handled the breast
stroke leg, but his 1:02.4 only
kept him even with Foothill and
Santa Clara. Then Luis Nicolao
took over. The world-record but
terflier gained three body
lengths on Foothill's flier, giv
ing Morgan Mannfng a half
body-length lead to work with.
Manning held his ground,
touching the wall 3:42.1 after
the race started.

Going into the final event, the
frosh held a two point lead over
the varsity, who in turn led
Santa Clara by 2.
Santa Clara and the varsity
swam next to each other, Mark
Parmely, Gary Sherrer, and
Mike Wall stayed dead even
with their opponents for three
fourths of the race. Jim Laney
and Greg Buckingham took off
simultaneously on the anchor
leg.
Buckingham could not gain
on Laney until the final turn,
he picked up the foot that
turned out to be the winning
margin.
The Papooses splashed in
third, homogenizing the final
score.
