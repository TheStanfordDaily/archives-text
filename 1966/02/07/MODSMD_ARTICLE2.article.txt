# IIR To Conduct European Week On The Farm
## 
### 
"Europe Week," an attempt to
bring the culture and daily life of
Europeans closer to Stanford stu
dents, has been scheduled for Feb. 7-13
by the Area Projects Division of lIR.
Monday evening at 7:30 and again
at 9:15, a film version of Voltaire's
"Candide" will be shown in the Large
Lounge of TMU. On Tuesday evening
at 7:30 and 9:30, Fclini's "Open City"
with Anna Magnani will be shown in
the Large Lounge.
Wednesday evening at 7:30, Konrad
Gaissmayer, a graduate student at the
Free University of Berlin, will speak
on "Germany and the Myth of Runifi
cation" in the Small Lounge.
Curtis Keck, vice president in charge
of Area Projects for the lIR explained
that each of the six desks of the Area
Projects Division which focus on a
certain geographical area will host
a "Week."
"Asia Week" and "Latin America
Week" were both held earlier this
quarter; "Middle East Week" will be
toward the end of the quarter; and
"Soviet Week" and "Africa Week" will
take place Spring quarter.
The capstone of the series is a
week being planned by Keith Lowe of
the Crisis Committee on "Colonialism
and Imperialism."
Keck explained that efficiency was
the decisive factor in planning a series
of "Weeks" rather than a number of
lectures and films throughout the
year. It is easier for lIR members to
program a whole week of activity. In
addition, wider publicity is available
for a particular "Week" than for un
connected films and lectures spaced
throughout the year.
Keck added that he hoped the
"Weeks" "would include a lot of the
culture of the different areas. You
read your Western Civ.," he contin
ued, "and you wonder how the Greek
philosophers felt.
"To understand that, you have to
transport yourself to their time and
place. You have to relive something
to understand it. What we are trying
to do is to make it easier for students
to relive and imagine how an Asian
or an African feels."
