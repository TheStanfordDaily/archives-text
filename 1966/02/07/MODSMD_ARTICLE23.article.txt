# Indians Lose To OSU, 56-54
## "High" For The Game 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford failed to hold on to
the league lead in the AAWU
basketball race for very long.
The Tribe defeated Oregon Fri
day night 81-64, but choked in
the final seconds, Saturday, to
fall to Oregon State, 56-54. The
loss dropped the Indians into a
second place tie with UCLA, one
game back of the Beavers.
Friday night Stanford began
very poorly against fairly weak
opposition. Neither team could
generate any momentum,

though the Indians lead for the
better part of the half.
John Pinkstaff Oregon cen
ter found himself in serious foul
trouble right from the opening
tip-off. By halftime he had four.
With just over one minute gone
in the second half the 6-7 de
fensive star fouled out.
Height Triumph
Bob Bedell and Ray Kosanke
then took advantage of superior
height. Th e v poured in many
little jumpers and lay-ins from
very close. Oregon was helpless

on defense, and their offense con
tinued to be sputtery. Jim Bar
nett kept bombing until he
fouled out. He ended up with
IS, his point per game average.
Ait Harris, Stanford's flashy
guard, recorded 15, Bedell 24,
and Kosanke 23.
Saturday night was both a
very unusual game and a mis
erable tragedy for Stanford and
Bob Bedell. The game started
off ordinarily with the teams
trading baskets. Oregon State
did not immediately employ
their famed stall, though' both
teams were very deliberate on
offense.
Oregon managed to gain a
five point lead at one point, but
Stanford, lead by a masterful
performance by Art Harris,
raced back. Harris was swishing
shots from every believable an
gle and often he was fouled on
his drives. By halftime he had
taken all the Stanford foul
shots and had made all five.
Bedell's Slap-in
The highlight of the first half,
if therfc was a high point at all,
was Bob Bedell's masterful
slap-In bank shot at the wrong
end of the court. There was not
an Oregon player in the same
half of the court, and most of
the Stanford players had headed
down court. Bedell slapped at
a rebound, and scored—for Ore
gon.
The half ended with a tie
score and a rather bored but
noisy crowd. The fans were es

pecially awed by the Stanford
full-court press. The press was
riot as successful as the UCLA
concoction, but Stanford only
used it at various surprise
times. The Tribe shocked the en
tire crowd when they set up for

the press, and the crowd showed
approval by a loud ovation when
Oregon State lost the ball.
Dead on the Rim
The second half continued
with the slowed down, very close
game. The weird feature of the
second half which broke the
monolony was when Jack Gil
bert took a foul shot and the
ball came to pest on the back
rim. That means it stayed up
there. This caused all kinds of
complications, when a Stanford
player tipped-in the reposing
ball. One ref said jump ball, the
other offensive goal-tending.
For the last ten minutes the
teams were virtually trading
baskets with rarely a miss. Ore
gon would take a multitude of

time each time they'd bring the
ball downcourt, so that the end
approached with the score still
in the 40's.
Stanford fell behind 52-49 with
only two minutes remaining. Rut
the Tribe roared back to a 54-54
tie but fouling the Beavers, get
ting the ball, and making a two
pointer.
Bedell Bobbles
With 1:29 remaining in the
game Stanford got the bull on a
turnover After calling time-out
to discuss strategy, the Indians
set up their own stall. They
were playing to take one shot
with about 3 seconds to go and
either win or go into overtime
for the third time this year.
They never got a shot off at
all. With :27 to play Bob Bedell
ignored the stalling plan and
tried to score by driving into
the middle. Unfortunately he
dribbled the ball off his foot
and it was stolen.
Oregon State then called
time out to set up a play. As ex
pected, they stalled until the
last few seconds. Ed Freden
burg tried to shoot over Jack
Gilbert from the foul line. Gil
bert put his arms so high up that
Fredenburg had to alter the arc
on his shot to get it over Gil
bert.
The shot was an air ball, but
racing in from the right corner
Rick Whelan grabbed it under
the net, whirled, and scored a
tiny fraction of a second before
the final buzzer.


808 BEDELL is shown in sec
ond-half action against Oregon
State. Bedell who had nine
points pulled down 11 rebounds
—"high" for the contest even
though he sat out for over a
quarter because of foul trouble.
Stanford lost the contest t<x the
Beavers in a heart-breaking fin
ish, 56-54.
