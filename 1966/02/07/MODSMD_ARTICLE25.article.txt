## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford rugby team, add
ing a driving offense to its con
sistently tough defensive scrum
play, routed the Sacramento
State ruggers 38-0 Saturday on
the Stanford Rugby Field.
The Indians were never seri
ously threatened as Mike Grace
made 14 points kicking, while
Bob Newberry and Eric Sutcliffe
each scored two tries apiece.
Sutclil'fe Starts Rout
In the opening moments of
play, Sutcliffe started the on
slaught, scoring from close-in
on a pass from Mac Wylie. Mike
Grace then made his first of
seven conversion attempts for
the day.
The two teams both got
chances at penalty kicks, but
each attempt was unsuccessful.
This was to bo the Staters last
real scoring opportunity in the
entire half.
The Cards next score came
when Bob Newberry blocked a
Sacramento State kick. Tim
Abena was right there to pick
up the ball and raced down the
sideline before he was forced
to pass to Grace.
Early 10-0 Lead
Grace carried the hall over
and converted, giving the Cards
an early 10-0 lead.
Two scrums later the Indians
found themselves deep in their
own territory. But Mac Wylie
suddenly broke through the
State defense and was heading
down the field before the Hor
nets could recover.
Wylie straight-aimed the last
defender and finished the last
30 yards of his 80 yard romp
untouched. The try was the long
est individual running play this
season.
Hornets Stung
The Hornets never really re
covered after this point and the
Stanford ruggers scored twice
more before the half ended.
Bob Newberry got one of the

tries, falling on a ball in the end
zone from his breakaway posi
tion in the scrum.
Tim Abena, running out of
the clutches of three different
Sacramento defenders, closed
the first half scoring with a 55
yard run. Grace made his fifth
straight conversion kick and the
half time score stood at 25-0.
The second half saw more of
tfte same, though the Indians
lost just a little of their scoring
punch. It was well into the sec
ond half before Bob Newberry
scored on a pass from Bill Os
trander. Once again Grace con
verted.
Evans Surprises
A few plays later, Dave Evans,
playing scrum half for Stan
ford, surprised the Staters by
taking the ball out of the scrum
and not passing the bail to his
first man as usual.
Instead Evans made an unas
sisted 35 yard try, as the Sacra
mento fullback found Evans'
fakes too much for his balance
on the muddy field.
Though Mike Grace then
missed his only conversion kick
of tlw day, the score was 33-0 at
this point.
Hornets Come Close
The Hornets almost scored
shortly after but Dennis Hcglie
was hauled down by Stanford's
Sutcliffe just short of the goal.
Stanford won the ensuing scrum
and it was all over for Sacra
mento.
Eric Sutcliffe closed out the
day's scoring with a 15 yard try
after picking up a fumbled Sac
ramento State kick. Grace made
his finai two points of the day
and the game ended with Stan
ford scoring its third win of the
year in a 38-0 shutout.
The Indians' record now stands
at 3-1-1. Pete Kmetovic, coach
of t he Card ruggers, was pleased
with the performance of his
team on both offense and de
fense.

"Our backfield was considera
bly strengthened with the re
turn of Andy Ovenstone, who
played a fine game. Of course
the scrum was rugged as usual."
Also singled out by Kmetovic
for their fine play were Chip
Greening, fullback, and 11 a n d y
Vahari, scrum-man. Blaine Nye
consistently controlled tho line
outs for the Indians. Tim Abena
was also potent for Stanford.

The Stanford rugby team, add
ing a driving offense to its con

The two teams both got
chances at penalty kicks, but
each attempt was unsuccessful.
This was to bo the Staters last
real scoring opportunity in the
entire half.
The Cards next score came

up the ball and raced down the
sideline before he was forced
to pass to Grace.
Early 10-0 Lead
Grace carried the hall over
and converted, giving the Cards
an early 10-0 lead.
Two scrums later the Indians
found themselves deep in their

suddenly broke through the
State defense and was heading
down the field before the Hor

Bob Newberry got one of the

tries, falling on a ball in the end

playing scrum half for Stan
ford, surprised the Staters by
taking the ball out of the scrum
and not passing the bail to his
first man as usual.
Instead Evans made an unas
sisted 35 yard try, as the Sacra
mento fullback found Evans'
fakes too much for his balance
on the muddy field.
Though Mike Grace then
missed his only conversion kick
of tlw day, the score was 33-0 at
this point.
Hornets Come Close

shortly after but Dennis Hcglie
was hauled down by Stanford's
Sutcliffe just short of the goal.
Stanford won the ensuing scrum
and it was all over for Sacra
mento.
Eric Sutcliffe closed out the

played a fine game. Of course
