# Tale Of Two Cities
## 
### 
Last month President Sterling reasserted the
values of the Inner City "which is calmer and
more contemplative than the storms which swirl
about it, where value of discussion is measured
not by volume but by information and knowl
edge." The latest and most surprising attack on
this philosophy has come from a member of the
Administration. In proposing to increase gradu
ate fees from $40 to $200 per quarter while re
ducing residence requirements, the Dean of the
Graduate Division has succumbed to the philos
ophy of the Outer City, which measures accom
plishments in dollars and time spent. This out
look is antithetical to any concept of the Uni
versity —Inner City, or just plain liberal educa
tion.
Although the University, like any fiscally re
sponsible institution, has bills to pay and salaries
to meet, cost-accounting and utility curves are
considerably less relevant when the commodity
is education. If the University were to charge
a student on the basis of what he costs the Uni
versity, it would seem reasonable to charge the
student taking 18 units half again as much as the
student taking the minimal 12. Or then again,
applying this formula, why should the student
taking three large lecture courses be expected
to pay the same fee as the student whose largest
class numbers only 20? If the justice of cost
accounting reveals anything in this case, it is
simply that the "dawdlwer" deserves the tuition
reduction if anyone does. Clearly, the hard work
ing student who takes advantage of as many aca
demic opportunities as possible costs the Uni

versity more in terms of professors' time and
facilities used.
Not satisfied with Outer City economics, the
Dean feels compelled to accelerate the process
of excellence by reducing its requirements. Pre
cisely why is it assumed that a doctoral disser
tion no longer represents "a mature, finished
book"? We can see no reason. By effectively cre
ating a deadline for excellence, increased ter
minal graduate fees will reduce the possibility
of achieving that goal. If students lack the dedi
cation of preceding generations, this is no cause
for modifying the doctorate itself.
Rarely is a university judged by the number
of degrees it awards. The larger question is how
many scholars did a university send into society.
Although there is a great demand for Ph.D.'s in
this country, a multiplication of sheepskin and
pastel hoods is meaningless if the proud bearers
do not also possess the tools to aid society.
If the Inner City can pretend to offer anything
unique, one of its features must surely be that
it is a place where a man can "dwadle" —a place
where his ideas can develop to their fullest at
the student's own pace. That a scholar has a duty
to get out into the world cannot be denied. How
ever, the investment of a few extra years is not
unreasonable, for it is far better to produce doc
toral candidates whose knowledge can grow
over a lifetime rather than technical pedants
educated solely to meet the needs of the present.
We hope that the University will resist the
pressure to increase graduate fees. For there is
no deadline for excellence. J.V.S.
