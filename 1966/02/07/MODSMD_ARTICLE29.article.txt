# The 						Fearful Spectator
## The 						Student Confronted With Mystery Art Fisher 
### 
A confrontation with mystery
forms a critical part of the re
action of students to the war in
Vietnam.
The anguish of human suffer
ing, of burned and disembowled
bodies, of a loss of hope, of a
torment of force hurled on the
peasant by distant powers
whose exhortations may seem
odd and foreign—all this for us
is a mystery.
The anguish—sterilized, sim
plified—reaches us in the news
media, and grows more persist
ent, and clamors for attention
and at last provokes sorrow and
an echo of anguish, and we
struggle confused to know
where we should turn.
A Moral Urgency
The moral urgency provokes
hasty statement and a simplic
ity of thought. The factions split
further, and as both recede from
the uncertain students, their ex
hortations become both more ur
gent and more foreign.
We are Americans. For us
loyalty entails no obligation of
agreement. We won our rights
by revolution; as a people we

have followed jingoism and a
tendency toward rigidty. We led
the fight to stop Hitler, and we
have sustained dictators. Now in
the crisis, the perceptive student
is suddenly aware of his un
certainty of the particulars of
his national identity. Certain of
being American, he is not sure
what that asks of him.
Some seek to stretch toward
a new morality that may obviate
what are commonly called the
practical concerns. Some, con
versant with the old moralities,
seek to apply their paradoxical
complexities to this new, spe
cific complexity. Some root vig
orously through the channels of
reason in search of a base on
which to construct justification.
Many simply try to remember
what they learned years ago, in
securely hopeful that it might
still apply.
We are a generation which
cannot remember war, which
cannot remember economic col
lapse, which has lived wholly
in an optimism always justified
by reality. We have abstracted

war and can feel it but little. We
know all the words, the theories,
the history, and our closest ex
perience is a kids' game of sol
diers.
Such is not to say that for
our ignorance we are worse or
better. While We are not tough
ened, neither are we made rigid.
We will face challenges some
what different from those past,
and as yet it is unknown what
might best fit us to meet them.
Tragedy
Nonetheless certainly threats
of tragedy of some sort will
occur through our lives, and at
least some of these will be real,
and tragedy, unless averted, will
shortly follow them.
Will we respond sleepily and
unbelieving of our eyes? Will
our response be too slow or not
hasty? Are we freed of one rig
idity to slip comfortably into
another?
We are told we will be the
guards on the walls of freedom,
and our principal problem would
seem to be the distinguishing of
the enemv, a not unsubtle trick.

perience is a kids' game of sol
diers.
Such is not to say that for
our ignorance we are worse or
better. While We are not tough
ened, neither are we made rigid.
We will face challenges some
what different from those past,
and as yet it is unknown what
might best fit us to meet them.
Tragedy
Nonetheless certainly threats
of tragedy of some sort will
occur through our lives, and at
least some of these will be real,
and tragedy, unless averted, will
shortly follow them.
Will we respond sleepily and
unbelieving of our eyes? Will
our response be too slow or not
hasty? Are we freed of one rig
idity to slip comfortably into
another?
We are told we will be the
guards on the walls of freedom,
and our principal problem would
seem to be the distinguishing of
the enemv, a not unsubtle trick.
A confrontation with mystery
forms a critical part of the re
action of students to the war in
Vietnam.
The anguish of human suffer
ing, of burned and disembowled
bodies, of a loss of hope, of a
torment of force hurled on the
peasant by distant powers
whose exhortations may seem
odd and foreign—all this for us
is a mystery.
The anguish—sterilized, sim
plified—reaches us in the news
media, and grows more persist
ent, and clamors for attention
and at last provokes sorrow and
an echo of anguish, and we
struggle confused to know
where we should turn.
A Moral Urgency
The moral urgency provokes
hasty statement and a simplic
ity of thought. The factions split
further, and as both recede from
the uncertain students, their ex
hortations become both more ur
gent and more foreign.
We are Americans. For us
loyalty entails no obligation of
agreement. We won our rights
by revolution; as a people we

have followed jingoism and a
tendency toward rigidty. We led
the fight to stop Hitler, and we
have sustained dictators. Now in
the crisis, the perceptive student
is suddenly aware of his un
certainty of the particulars of
his national identity. Certain of
being American, he is not sure
what that asks of him.
Some seek to stretch toward
a new morality that may obviate
what are commonly called the
practical concerns. Some, con
versant with the old moralities,
seek to apply their paradoxical
complexities to this new, spe
cific complexity. Some root vig
orously through the channels of
reason in search of a base on
which to construct justification.
Many simply try to remember
what they learned years ago, in
securely hopeful that it might
still apply.
We are a generation which
cannot remember war, which
cannot remember economic col
lapse, which has lived wholly
in an optimism always justified
by reality. We have abstracted

war and can feel it but little. We
know all the words, the theories,
the history, and our closest ex
perience is a kids' game of sol
diers.

our ignorance we are worse or
