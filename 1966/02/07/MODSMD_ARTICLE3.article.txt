(Editor's note: the following
statement was released yester
day by Wilbur Head Sponsor A 1
Taylor.)
After weeks of deliberation,
the Wilbur sponsors have
drafted a final procedure for
this year's sponsor solution.
Among those consulted by the
sponsors before reaching their
decision were the faculty Resi
dent of Wilbur Hall, I)r. Eric
Hutchinson, the Dean of Under
graduate Education, Dr. Robert
Wert, the Committee on Under
graduate Education, the Wilbur
Faculty Residents, the Intra-Wil
bur Council, the Student Body
President, Sandy Mackenzie, and
the Speaker of the Legislature,
.lay Kadane.
This year's Sponsor Selection
Committee, considerably differ
ent in content than any in past
years, includes three sponsors, to
be chosen by the Head Sponsor;
one Faculty Resident, to be
chosen by tlie Faculty Residents;

one freshman, to be chosen by
the house presidents; one ASSU
representative, to be chosen by
tlie Student Body President in
consultation with the Legisla
ture; the Faculty Master as ad
visor; and the Head Sponsor as
chairman.
This year's procedure for spon
sor selection represents a defi
nite change from previous years.
It is an attempt to involve the
entire University community in
the selection process, to speak
to t he criticism sometimes made
that the sponsor selection proce
dure was inequitable. We expect
to gain much from the divrsity
of viewpoint represented in the
Selection Committee.
Sponsor selection takes an im
mense amount of time and we
hope to commence within a
week or so. Application forms
are now being drawn up. There
will be an informational meeting
held soon for all those interest
ed in sponsoring next year.
