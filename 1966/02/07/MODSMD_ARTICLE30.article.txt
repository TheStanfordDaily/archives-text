# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Stone, Heineman Answered 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori
tarian Personality, 1950), H. Mc-
Closkey ("Conservatism and
Personality," American Political
Science Review, 1958, 42, pp. 27-
45). H. P. Smith, and B. Chris
tiansen. You might also give up
satire and take up psychology.

• World Into Flames
. . . Anarchy, according to Mr.
Stone, is found in such seem
ingly innocent actions as writing
letters to Senators, urging Sen
ate investigations, and question
ing Presidential decisions and
the (I write this with head
bowed reverently) the Consti
tution. Alas! What sinners have
we been, dangerously treading
the narrow ridge to chaos! I con
fess that on that Day I myself
urged a large crowd of people
to write their Senators (o pity
on my soul!). But I shall do
penance and refuse to write an
other letter to my Senator ever
again, lest I plunge the world
into flame!

• Left Wingers?
... I imagine Mr. Stone would
like his congressmen to take
their responsibilities seriously
enough to debate isues pertain
ing to the common defense and
general welfare—and this seems
to be constitutional, if Stone has
the U.S. constitution in mind.
Moreover, if Congress can im
peach the President, surely it
may constantly consider how
well he is executing his powers.
I suspect that Mr. Stone, and
VIVE, may be clever left-wing
ers reducing right-wing views to
absurdity. But if he is in good
faith, perhaps he is himself an
anarchist by his own definition;

he is doing quite a bit of con
stitutional questioning himself.
But what can you expect in an
anarchic society founded on a
constitution created not by di
vine inspiration but by a group
of anarchists who heatedly
questioned the provisions of the
document they were then writ
ing?

• The Academic
Community
. . . Let me remind Mr. Stone
that racial unrest in Asia (or
dissent in the U.S.) is not identi
cal with Communism. Let me
further remind Mr. Stone that
Communist countries are con
sidered totalitarian because they
deny the right to dissent. Fin
ally, let me remind Mr. Stone
and the V.D.C. that there was
little or no resistance to the
Nazis when Hitler expelled the
Socialists and the Jews from the
universities. The German aca
demic community, the pride of
Germany said and did nothing
to stop Hitler. Fortunately, Am
erica's academic community is
contributing to keeping America
free, rather than totalitarian.
That is more than can be said
for Mr. Stone and the VDC.

• In The Future?
Editor, The Daily:
(Also addressed to Robert
Stone)
It was seventeen years after
President Lyndon Baines John
son's famous "Declaration of
Peace" had been televised across
the earth. The Ruchinese were
in firm control of Mt. Everest
and the U.S.A. had recaptured
the Sahara. Throughout the
rest of the world the U.S.A. was
waging guerrilla peace with the
Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

• Walter Army Society
Editor, The Daily:
The reporting in the Daily im
plies a greater dissent against
the war in Vietnam than we be
lieve actually exists. We would
like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000
signatures on this campus to its
petition in support of the Ad
ministration's policy, a better
than 10-1 margin over ARFEP's
position, and that the pro-Ad
ministration blood drive, led by
the Walter Army Society and
supported by six other recog

nized voluntary student organi
zations, received more than 6
times as many pledges as the
Medical Aid Committee. (The
Society also collected its blood,
while the M.A.C. was all words
and no action.)
If we have thought it unnec
essary to conduct a new vote of
confidence at this point, it is
because we do not view the re
sumed bombings as constituting
any new turn in the conduct of
the war. but rather the logical
step after unsuccessful attempts
at negotiations. At the price of
American and South Vietna
mese lives and at the price of
loss of military advantage, the
U. S. Government conducted an
8 day cease-fire and a one
month moratorium on the bomb
ings. The effort was admirable,
if expensive, but failing to pro
duce results, it could only be
ended and followed by resumed
fighting with sufficient weapons
for the mission. The alternative
was pointless procrastination
until defeat by default, while al
lowing our allies and ourselves
to be butchered for lack of suffi
cient tools to do their unfor
tunate but neeessarv job.

• Savings Bonds
Editor, The Daily:
Taking a hint from Thurs
day's letters of Messrs. Beye and
Mayshark, I would suggest that
anyone wishing to make a mean
ingful protest of the present
policy in South East Asia sell
immediately any U.S. Savings
Bonds he or she might own and
send a letter to President John
son reporting and explaining
this action. Also advisable would
be a carbon copy to one's con

RANDOLPH M. BONNER
• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.
HUGH BRECKENRIDGE

• Continued . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must
bear.
PHILIP WELLES O'DONNELL
• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.

• In The Future?
Editor, The Daily:
(Also addressed to Robert
Stone)
It was seventeen years after
President Lyndon Baines John
son's famous "Declaration of
Peace" had been televised across
the earth. The Ruchinese were
in firm control of Mt. Everest
and the U.S.A. had recaptured
the Sahara. Throughout the
rest of the world the U.S.A. was
waging guerrilla peace with the
Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

Editor, The Daily:
The reporting in the Daily im
plies a greater dissent against
the war in Vietnam than we be
lieve actually exists. We would
like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000
signatures on this campus to its
petition in support of the Ad
ministration's policy, a better
than 10-1 margin over ARFEP's
position, and that the pro-Ad

times as many pledges as the
Medical Aid Committee. (The
Society also collected its blood,
while the M.A.C. was all words

If we have thought it unnec

because we do not view the re

RANDOLPH M. BONNER
• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.
HUGH BRECKENRIDGE

• Continued . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must
bear.
PHILIP WELLES O'DONNELL
• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.
JON MOYNES
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori
tarian Personality, 1950), H. Mc-
Closkey ("Conservatism and
Personality," American Political
Science Review, 1958, 42, pp. 27-

Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000

If we have thought it unnec

because we do not view the re

RANDOLPH M. BONNER
• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.
HUGH BRECKENRIDGE

• Continued . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must
bear.
PHILIP WELLES O'DONNELL
• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.
JON MOYNES
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori
tarian Personality, 1950), H. Mc-
Closkey ("Conservatism and
Personality," American Political
Science Review, 1958, 42, pp. 27-
45). H. P. Smith, and B. Chris

satire and take up psychology.

Moreover, if Congress can im

I suspect that Mr. Stone, and

ers reducing right-wing views to

anarchist by his own definition;

he is doing quite a bit of con

But what can you expect in an

• Savings Bonds
Editor, The Daily:
Taking a hint from Thurs
day's letters of Messrs. Beye and
Mayshark, I would suggest that
anyone wishing to make a mean
ingful protest of the present
policy in South East Asia sell
immediately any U.S. Savings
Bonds he or she might own and
send a letter to President John
son reporting and explaining
this action. Also advisable would
be a carbon copy to one's con

RANDOLPH M. BONNER
• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.
HUGH BRECKENRIDGE

• Continued . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must
bear.
PHILIP WELLES O'DONNELL
• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.
JON MOYNES
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori
tarian Personality, 1950), H. Mc-
Closkey ("Conservatism and
Personality," American Political
Science Review, 1958, 42, pp. 27-
45). H. P. Smith, and B. Chris
tiansen. You might also give up
satire and take up psychology.

. . . Anarchy, according to Mr.

• Left Wingers?
... I imagine Mr. Stone would
like his congressmen to take
their responsibilities seriously
enough to debate isues pertain
ing to the common defense and
general welfare—and this seems
to be constitutional, if Stone has
the U.S. constitution in mind.
Moreover, if Congress can im
peach the President, surely it
may constantly consider how
well he is executing his powers.
I suspect that Mr. Stone, and
VIVE, may be clever left-wing
ers reducing right-wing views to
absurdity. But if he is in good
faith, perhaps he is himself an
anarchist by his own definition;

he is doing quite a bit of con
stitutional questioning himself.
But what can you expect in an
anarchic society founded on a
constitution created not by di
vine inspiration but by a group
of anarchists who heatedly
questioned the provisions of the
document they were then writ
ing?

• In The Future?
Editor, The Daily:
(Also addressed to Robert
Stone)
It was seventeen years after
President Lyndon Baines John
son's famous "Declaration of
Peace" had been televised across
the earth. The Ruchinese were
in firm control of Mt. Everest
and the U.S.A. had recaptured
the Sahara. Throughout the
rest of the world the U.S.A. was
waging guerrilla peace with the
Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

Editor, The Daily:
The reporting in the Daily im

the war in Vietnam than we be
lieve actually exists. We would
like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000
signatures on this campus to its
petition in support of the Ad
ministration's policy, a better
than 10-1 margin over ARFEP's

times as many pledges as the
Medical Aid Committee. (The

while the M.A.C. was all words

If we have thought it unnec

because we do not view the re

acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.

I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must

• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.
JON MOYNES
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori
tarian Personality, 1950), H. Mc-
Closkey ("Conservatism and
Personality," American Political
Science Review, 1958, 42, pp. 27-
45). H. P. Smith, and B. Chris
tiansen. You might also give up
satire and take up psychology.

• World Into Flames
. . . Anarchy, according to Mr.
Stone, is found in such seem
ingly innocent actions as writing
letters to Senators, urging Sen
ate investigations, and question
ing Presidential decisions and
the (I write this with head
bowed reverently) the Consti
tution. Alas! What sinners have
we been, dangerously treading
the narrow ridge to chaos! I con
fess that on that Day I myself
urged a large crowd of people

• Left Wingers?
... I imagine Mr. Stone would
like his congressmen to take
their responsibilities seriously
enough to debate isues pertain
ing to the common defense and
general welfare—and this seems
to be constitutional, if Stone has
the U.S. constitution in mind.
Moreover, if Congress can im
peach the President, surely it
may constantly consider how
well he is executing his powers.
I suspect that Mr. Stone, and
VIVE, may be clever left-wing
ers reducing right-wing views to
absurdity. But if he is in good
faith, perhaps he is himself an
anarchist by his own definition;

he is doing quite a bit of con
stitutional questioning himself.
But what can you expect in an
anarchic society founded on a
constitution created not by di
vine inspiration but by a group
of anarchists who heatedly
questioned the provisions of the
document they were then writ
ing?

• In The Future?
Editor, The Daily:
(Also addressed to Robert
Stone)
It was seventeen years after
President Lyndon Baines John
son's famous "Declaration of
Peace" had been televised across
the earth. The Ruchinese were
in firm control of Mt. Everest
and the U.S.A. had recaptured
the Sahara. Throughout the
rest of the world the U.S.A. was
waging guerrilla peace with the
Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

• Walter Army Society
Editor, The Daily:
The reporting in the Daily im
plies a greater dissent against
the war in Vietnam than we be
lieve actually exists. We would
like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000
signatures on this campus to its
petition in support of the Ad
ministration's policy, a better
than 10-1 margin over ARFEP's
position, and that the pro-Ad
ministration blood drive, led by
the Walter Army Society and
supported by six other recog

nized voluntary student organi
zations, received more than 6
times as many pledges as the
Medical Aid Committee. (The
Society also collected its blood,
while the M.A.C. was all words
and no action.)
If we have thought it unnec
essary to conduct a new vote of
confidence at this point, it is
because we do not view the re
sumed bombings as constituting
any new turn in the conduct of
the war. but rather the logical
step after unsuccessful attempts
at negotiations. At the price of
American and South Vietna
mese lives and at the price of
loss of military advantage, the
U. S. Government conducted an
8 day cease-fire and a one
month moratorium on the bomb
ings. The effort was admirable,
if expensive, but failing to pro
duce results, it could only be
ended and followed by resumed
fighting with sufficient weapons
for the mission. The alternative
was pointless procrastination
until defeat by default, while al
lowing our allies and ourselves
to be butchered for lack of suffi
cient tools to do their unfor
tunate but neeessarv job.

• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.

shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.
JON MOYNES
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori
tarian Personality, 1950), H. Mc-
Closkey ("Conservatism and
Personality," American Political
Science Review, 1958, 42, pp. 27-
45). H. P. Smith, and B. Chris
tiansen. You might also give up
satire and take up psychology.

• World Into Flames
. . . Anarchy, according to Mr.
Stone, is found in such seem
ingly innocent actions as writing
letters to Senators, urging Sen
ate investigations, and question
ing Presidential decisions and
the (I write this with head
bowed reverently) the Consti
tution. Alas! What sinners have
we been, dangerously treading
the narrow ridge to chaos! I con
fess that on that Day I myself
urged a large crowd of people
to write their Senators (o pity
on my soul!). But I shall do
penance and refuse to write an
other letter to my Senator ever

• Left Wingers?
... I imagine Mr. Stone would
like his congressmen to take
their responsibilities seriously
enough to debate isues pertain
ing to the common defense and
general welfare—and this seems
to be constitutional, if Stone has
the U.S. constitution in mind.
Moreover, if Congress can im
peach the President, surely it
may constantly consider how
well he is executing his powers.
I suspect that Mr. Stone, and
VIVE, may be clever left-wing
ers reducing right-wing views to
absurdity. But if he is in good
faith, perhaps he is himself an
anarchist by his own definition;

he is doing quite a bit of con
stitutional questioning himself.
But what can you expect in an
anarchic society founded on a
constitution created not by di
vine inspiration but by a group
of anarchists who heatedly
questioned the provisions of the
document they were then writ

• In The Future?
Editor, The Daily:
(Also addressed to Robert
Stone)
It was seventeen years after
President Lyndon Baines John
son's famous "Declaration of
Peace" had been televised across
the earth. The Ruchinese were
in firm control of Mt. Everest
and the U.S.A. had recaptured
the Sahara. Throughout the
rest of the world the U.S.A. was
waging guerrilla peace with the
Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

Editor, The Daily:
The reporting in the Daily im
plies a greater dissent against
the war in Vietnam than we be
lieve actually exists. We would
like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000
signatures on this campus to its
petition in support of the Ad
ministration's policy, a better
than 10-1 margin over ARFEP's
position, and that the pro-Ad
ministration blood drive, led by
the Walter Army Society and
supported by six other recog

nized voluntary student organi
zations, received more than 6
times as many pledges as the
Medical Aid Committee. (The
Society also collected its blood,
while the M.A.C. was all words
and no action.)
If we have thought it unnec
essary to conduct a new vote of
confidence at this point, it is
because we do not view the re
sumed bombings as constituting
any new turn in the conduct of
the war. but rather the logical
step after unsuccessful attempts
at negotiations. At the price of
American and South Vietna
mese lives and at the price of
loss of military advantage, the
U. S. Government conducted an
8 day cease-fire and a one
month moratorium on the bomb
ings. The effort was admirable,
if expensive, but failing to pro
duce results, it could only be
ended and followed by resumed
fighting with sufficient weapons
for the mission. The alternative
was pointless procrastination
until defeat by default, while al

RANDOLPH M. BONNER
• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.
HUGH BRECKENRIDGE

• Continued . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must
bear.
PHILIP WELLES O'DONNELL
• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result

• World Into Flames
. . . Anarchy, according to Mr.
Stone, is found in such seem
ingly innocent actions as writing
letters to Senators, urging Sen
ate investigations, and question
ing Presidential decisions and
the (I write this with head
bowed reverently) the Consti
tution. Alas! What sinners have
we been, dangerously treading
the narrow ridge to chaos! I con
fess that on that Day I myself
urged a large crowd of people
to write their Senators (o pity
on my soul!). But I shall do
penance and refuse to write an
other letter to my Senator ever
again, lest I plunge the world
into flame!

• Left Wingers?
... I imagine Mr. Stone would
like his congressmen to take
their responsibilities seriously
enough to debate isues pertain
ing to the common defense and
general welfare—and this seems
to be constitutional, if Stone has
the U.S. constitution in mind.
Moreover, if Congress can im
peach the President, surely it
may constantly consider how
well he is executing his powers.
I suspect that Mr. Stone, and
VIVE, may be clever left-wing
ers reducing right-wing views to
absurdity. But if he is in good
faith, perhaps he is himself an
anarchist by his own definition;

he is doing quite a bit of con
stitutional questioning himself.
But what can you expect in an
anarchic society founded on a
constitution created not by di
vine inspiration but by a group
of anarchists who heatedly
questioned the provisions of the
document they were then writ
ing?

further remind Mr. Stone that
Communist countries are con

little or no resistance to the

• In The Future?
Editor, The Daily:
(Also addressed to Robert
Stone)
It was seventeen years after
President Lyndon Baines John
son's famous "Declaration of
Peace" had been televised across
the earth. The Ruchinese were
in firm control of Mt. Everest
and the U.S.A. had recaptured
the Sahara. Throughout the
rest of the world the U.S.A. was
waging guerrilla peace with the
Ruchinese infiltrators. The
earth's people were known to
be unhappy about all the peace
being waged in their midst hut
they did not protest. If they op
posed peace they were obvious
ly warmongers and, as they well
knew, Johnson's "Declaration of
Peace" had abolished war seven
teen years before. Johnson him
self was justifiably proud of his
part in abolishing war. He often
said that "Americans should be
happy to accept inflation, hun
ger and lots of other hardships
for the sake of our peace offen
sive. Remember, my peace I
bring unto you, and that's no
idle threat."
True, Americans accepted
these hardships. But there was
grumbling from the weaker and
less informed. Enough support
from these dissidents appeared
to force the matter to debate on
the floor of the Senate. There
it was argued brilliantly, by you
among others, that, since the
Constitution specifically allots
to Congress only to the power
to declare war President John
son was within constitutional
bounds when he declared peace
on the world seventeen years
before. It was, as you know,
suggested that those who had
opened the debate were engaged
in an invidious attack on the
Constitution in an attempt to fo
ment anarchy. It was immedi
ately moved that they be re
classified 1-A in the peace draft.
I can only admire your forth
right stand for order instead of
anarchy, echoing as it does Pres
ident Johnson's now-famous
quote, "Cry Order & let slip
the dogs of peace."

• Walter Army Society
Editor, The Daily:
The reporting in the Daily im
plies a greater dissent against
the war in Vietnam than we be
lieve actually exists. We would
like to recall that last quarter
CONSCIENCE received 3000
signatures on this campus to its
petition in support of the Ad
ministration's policy, a better
than 10-1 margin over ARFEP's
position, and that the pro-Ad
ministration blood drive, led by
the Walter Army Society and
supported by six other recog

nized voluntary student organi
zations, received more than 6
times as many pledges as the
Medical Aid Committee. (The
Society also collected its blood,
while the M.A.C. was all words
and no action.)
If we have thought it unnec
essary to conduct a new vote of
confidence at this point, it is
because we do not view the re
sumed bombings as constituting
any new turn in the conduct of
the war. but rather the logical
step after unsuccessful attempts
at negotiations. At the price of
American and South Vietna
mese lives and at the price of
loss of military advantage, the
U. S. Government conducted an
8 day cease-fire and a one
month moratorium on the bomb
ings. The effort was admirable,
if expensive, but failing to pro
duce results, it could only be
ended and followed by resumed
fighting with sufficient weapons
for the mission. The alternative
was pointless procrastination
until defeat by default, while al
lowing our allies and ourselves
to be butchered for lack of suffi

Editor, The Daily:
Taking a hint from Thurs

anyone wishing to make a mean
ingful protest of the present

RANDOLPH M. BONNER
• Prometheus Bound
Editor, The Daily:
No, Mr. Heineman, the legend
of Prometheus is still as signifi
cant to us, as it was to the
Greeks! The basic question in
the play is whether man is to
have technology, and if you
think that man's technology is
not a problem in our world to
day, you had better read the
newspaper. You may question
the means of conveying the mes
sage, but it doesn't seem too dif
ficult to understand. I suppose
you think that the Theater of
the Absurd is not "intrinsincally
significant" to the theatergoer
of today because it is absurd.
Why then was the perform
ance of Prometheus Bound so
long and boring? First, Mr. Vos'
choreography was far from
masterful. In Greek tragedy the
chorus is supposed to be the
element that emphasizes the
drama, but the slow and delib
erate motions of the chorus and
the monotony of their lines de
stroyed the drama of the play.
If the chorus had been more vio
lent in their movements and had
there been more songs, chants,
dances with emotional cre
scendoes, the drama would have
been drama rather than a series
of soliloquies. Second, the char
acter of Io is one of comic re
lief as compared to that of Pro
metheus, but Miss Randall did
a fine job of making it melo
dramatic, not comic.
The Stanford Repertory the
ater has managed to ruin this
play by overdramaticizing every
line into monotony. I have seen
a lesser play of Aeschylus done
properly and I don't doubt that
with sufficient skill even our
Repertory Theatre could do it.
HUGH BRECKENRIDGE

• Continued . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I would cavil at Mr. Heine
man's assertion, in his other
wise enthusiastic review of "Pro
metheus Bound," that Aeschy
lus' work "is an interpretation
of a legend no longer intrinsical
ly significant ... or with more
that a tangential relation to the
human condition." I find that,
on the contrary, lines such as
the final warning of Hermes
that we mortals know what we
are doing and cannot blame God
or fortune for calamities evoke
a depth of human suffering
that is timeless. The meeting of
divine rebuke while seeking
knowledge is the plight of Satan
in Hook IV of Paradise Ix>st, of
the Faustian hero, and of Ca
mus' Sisyphus. Human beings,
if capable of nothing else in the
face of an abyss of absurdity,
will share in the feeling of an
guish borne in common, as the
chorus which will bear along
with Prometheus what is must
bear.
PHILIP WELLES O'DONNELL
• Finally
Editor, The Daily:
A 1 Heineman's review of Pro
metheus Bound in last Thurs
day's Daily evidenced the same
blindness which kept director
Eric Vos from a completely suc
cessful production. The Reper
tory Theater's presentation of
the play fails not because Aes
chylus is no longer relevant to
us (as Heineman's review im
plied) but because of the direc
tor's unsuccessful attempt to
force the ancient tragedy into
a modern mold. Where individ
ual details of production are con
cerned, I must agree with your
reviewer: music, acting, choreo
graphy, all were well done. But
the overall view of the play, for
which Mr. Vos, as director, is
responsible, is faulty.
Prometheus Bound is a play
about the Greek gods; the char
acters of Aeschylus' play are
somehow much more than hu
man, with a power and a gran
deur of their own. But the crea
tures Mr. Vos sees in the play
are sub-human or at any rate,
extra-human; Mr. Vos! interpre
tation does not serve to move
an audience, it seeks only to
shock and terrify those who
view the play. But by far the
worst consequence of Mr. Vos'
short-sightedness is the result
ing inadequacy to handle the
part of 10. Clearly Vos was not
sure what to do with the part
and his solution to the problem,
the Noh-like pantomine to Pro
metheus' narration, does not fail
only because of Miss Randall's
acting. As the play stands, lo's
appearance is merely an inter
lude after which Prometheus
and the Chorus more or less
spontaneously defy Zeus. The
play ends then and the emotion
al-moral turning point of the
play has been completely passed
over.
In the final analysis, however,
fault lies not so much with Vos
himself as with his approach.
His desire for Symbolic Moun
tains and impressive costumes
seems to have come first; a fair
distance ahead of the demands
of script and tradition. Mr. Vos'
approach to the theater is cer
tainly a valid one and he is un
questionably an excellent direc
tor, but in Prometheus Bound
the approach has failed.
JON MOYNES
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the in
effective techniques in Mr.
Stone's Thursday article.
As satire, Mr. Stone, your ap
proach is too subtle. This is a
question of degree, I admit.
Good satire should cross the
border of the ridiculous; yours
goes only 90 per cent of the
way. You suggest that question
ing the decisions of our great
President, or asking the Senate
to do so, questions the U.S. Con
stitution and is, quite naturally,
anarchy. While the absurdity of
this statement may be obvious
to you, you must realize that
some poor souls, by incomplete
knowledge or intellect, may re
gard it as a serious reflection
of your views. Your suggestion
that the public, under "repre
sentative government," should
not be permitted to debate the
government's participation in
annihilating the human race is
a better effort at satire. But you
miss a good chance. Instead of
labeling debate and public dis
cussion as "anarchy," you might
point out, for example that our
only goal in this war is peace.
Public debate stifles peace by
preventing the war from en
larging. More war produces
more peace. For the greatest
possible peace, we must have
the greatest possible war. Once
this is accomplished, we can
democratically debate our gov
ernment's policy in a relaxed
posture.
While your article is weak
satire, the ideas and world pic
ture it presents bear a striking
resemblance to the thinking of
modern psychology's "authori
tarian personality." From the
clinical perspective, the article
is a masterpiece. In a remark
able fashion, it illustrates ob
session with order and with
rules, blind submission to au
thority figures, the inability to
tolerate inconsistencies and con
tradictions, and the simple
minded dichotomizing of the
world into black and white con
cepts: ORDER and ANARCHY.
If you have not already done so,
I urge you to look at the work
of T. W. Adorno (The Authori

Closkey ("Conservatism and
