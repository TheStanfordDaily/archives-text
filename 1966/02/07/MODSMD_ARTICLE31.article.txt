a general rule, unsigned letters
will not be printed, but names
will be withheld under certain
' circumstances upon request.
It is helpful if letters are type
written on 65-space lines and dou
ble spa<*Hl. They should not ex
cÂ«hkl 800 words in length.
The Daily reserves the right
to edit all letters for grammar
and also to fit available space.
