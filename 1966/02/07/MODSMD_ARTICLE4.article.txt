## 
### 
Professor Charles A. Drekmeier
opens the new TMU weekly series,
"Communism: Its Concepts and Its
Challenges," at 8 tonight in Tresidder.
His topic is "Marxism: The Classical
Stage."
"Communism is not a simple term,"
notes program co-chairman Bruce
Maximov. "The series will explore the
vast area denoted by Communism,"
he says.
The Tresidder program division
hopes to present a "balanced per
spective of Communism."
"To often we are only half-inform
ed," continues Maximov. To gain a
worthwhile perspective of Commun
ism, we must arrive at our own con
clusions only after exposure to and
assimilation of information from
varying sources, representing differ
ent positions."
The lectures are intended to expose
Comunism as a belief system rather
than as a threat.

Acording to Maximov, the series
will attempt to answer such ques
tions as what is communism? How
did it develop? Where is it headed?
What are its strengths and its weak
nesses He adds that the series will
not come to definite conclusions but
will provide the facts necessary to
rcachr them.
Seven lectures by Stanford pro
fessors will comprise the program,
which continues through May. Dr.
Bertram Wolfe, research fellow at
the Hoover Institute, will speak on
"Leninism: The Marxism of Revolu
tion," Feb. 14.
The series will include a panel dis
cussion on communism in developing
areas and another talk by several
PhD candidates on "Modern Commun
ism—A Study In Detail."
Doctor Chester Berry, director of
the union, expressed hope the series
would put communism in an "objec
tive context" for interested students.
