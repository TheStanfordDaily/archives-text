### BARBARA EHRLICH 
Vietnam protest continued this week
end with a Saturday march and rally
in Palo Alto and picketing Sunday by
women and children at the home of

In addition, the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam issued a chal
lenge for a formal debate to the Wal
ter Army Society, VIVE, CON

Approximately S5O students, facul
ty members, and area residents (by

Palo Alto police estimate) marched
five blocks from the Palo Alto post
office to Cogswell Plaza.
Speakers included Edward Keating,
editor of Ramparts magazine; Stan
ford professors George Leppert a n d
Marc Mancall; and Rear Adm. Arnold
True (ret.>, who strongly attacked the
resumption of bombing in Vietnam.
Of the faculty and staff members
endorsing a full-page ad in Friday's
Daily, "a very large percentage" at
tended, said sociology Professor Paul
Wallin, one of the organizers of the
march. "The Stanford faculty was
very well represented."
"Encouraging Turnout"
Approximately half the marchers
came from neighboring towns. "I was
very encouraged by the turnout,"
said Cyril Sia of the SCPV. Wallin
felt it was "an unusually effective
program and very well received."
"I feci the meeting on Saturday in
dicated a growing concern on the part
of the Stanford community. The
risks associated with our policy in
Vietnam are so great that they call
for complete public support of the
hearings now being held by Senator
Fulbright's foreign relations commit
tee," Wallin concluded.
Opposition to manufacture of na
palm at the TJTC plant in Coyote con
tinued with the Sunday picketing of
Adelman's home. A new coordinating
committee made up of two members
from each of the participating groups
was formed officially last night. Pick
eting and "leafleting" will continue at
both the Coyote plant and the Sunny
vale executive offices.
Challenge to Debate
The challenge to debate issued by
the SCPV specified Standard Oregon
Debate of at least an hour followed
by a discussion of at least an ho u r.
"Less time is inadequate for extended
arguments," said Sia.

Mike Cummings from CONSCIENCE
replied, "We will be willing to debate.
We debated them once before and I
though we came off very well." The
Walter Army Society and VIVE also
accepted the challenge.
In part the challenge reads, "If you
refuse this challenge you will be con
firming the suspicion of many that
you are mimicking the 'big-lie' tech
nique and merely mouthing plati
tudes."
