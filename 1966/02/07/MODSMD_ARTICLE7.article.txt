### STEVE GRUBER 
Stanford groups which have previ
ously supported the Administration
policy in Vietnam are continuing to do
so after the resumption of bombing
of North Vietnam.
Robert Stone, spokesman for VIVE
(Victory in Vietnam is Essential)
said yesterday,"The President must
work under this policy and the people
of the United States must also work
under the policy."
Recording secretary of the Young
Republicans, Sally Schulz, also felt
the policy is best for this country.
"You can't fight half a war," she
said.
According to Mike Cummings of
CONSCIENCE, his group is planning
two programs concerned with the is
sue. though not specifically in re
sponse to it.
First, CONSCIENCE will attempt
a Washington briefing of approxi
mately 100 CONSCIENCE officers.
The briefing will be conducted by the
State Department.

The second program will be the
enlistment of 200,000 students to
write letters to soldiers in Vietnam to
show their support for the war. Cum
mings stated that they will attempt
to have one member of CONSCIENCE
for each soldier.
CONSCIENCE supports the admin
istration's policy and has asked the
State Department to send a speaker
to Stanford to explain the adminis
tration's views.
Cummings stated, in regard to re
cent. activities on the campus. "We
were opposed to the teachers' strike.
It was a dire neglect of teaching re
sponsibility. We understand how the
instructors could oppose the policies,
but we think the University adminis
tration should have cracked down on
them."
Double Standard
Concerning the rallies held last
week. Cuminings added, "We support
the right to demonstrate, but we feel
the demonstrators have a double
standard they are protesting a

number of things. First, they say
that we are not getting all the facts
about Vietnam. However, they also
say that they are sympathetic to the
North Vietnam government and they
definitely suppress the facts."
Cummings added that the demon
strators urge a dialogue on Vietnam
but they are not interested in really
getting a dialogue.
Overwhelming Support
Clark explained the lack of activity
on the part of his group as being the
correct response to the situation. "It
is not necessary to recount the stu
dent support now. We counted it last
quarter and it was overwhelmingly
in favor of our position."
The question of the teachers' strike
is one of degree, according to Clark.
He feels that, "The issue is not
clear cut. As long as the strike was
for only one day, then it is a matter
of academic freedom. Rut if it lasted
for a week, then action would have to
be taken to stop it."
