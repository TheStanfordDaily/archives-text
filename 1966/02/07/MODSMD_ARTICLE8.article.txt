# Wilbur Sponsors Initiate New Selection Procedure
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
The Wilbur sponsors announced
Friday that they will begin selection
of next year's sponsors under a sys
tem which has not yet been approved
by the Committee on Undergraduate
Education.
The new Selection Committee will
be composed of four sponsors, a fresh
man, a Wilbur Faculty Resident, a
representative of the ASSU, and Fac
ulty Master Eric Hutchinson as an
advisor.
"Although the composition of the
committee has been informally agreed
upon," said Head Sponsor Taylor,
"there is as yet no consensus on
whether the Faculty Master and the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion should have a veto power over
the membership of the Selection Com
mittee and over its choices of new
sponsors."
The sponsors unanimously agreed
that these claims to veto power run
contrary to a student-directed spon
sor system and to the ideal of a Wil
bur community. "We believe that the
Selection Committee must have the
final say in the choice of sponsors,"
Taylor said.

For at least tho last twelve years
sponsor selection has been completely
in the hands of the sponsors them
selves.
This year, with the introduction of
the Faculty Master program, "full
control" of Wilbur has been given to
Dr. Hutchinson.
In an interview with the Daily yes
terday, Taylor said that the first indi
cation that there might be a conflict
came early last quarter.
At that time Dr. Hutchinson op
posed holding interviews for men who
would go overseas in the winter on
the basis that these interviews might
be construed to mean that the Faculty
Master inended to have sponsors next
year, which he said would not be
definitely known until a comprehens
ive study of Wilbur and the sponsors
had been made.
Not until late November did the
Faculty Master consent to hold these
interviews, according to Taylor.
Wilbur Study
Early in December and again in
January the Legislature recommend
ed that the Committee of Fifteen find
a suitable group of students, faculty,

and administrators to study the Wil
bur system.
The Committee of Fifteen, at a
meeting last Friday, passed a motion
requesting the Committee on Under
graduate Education to give its opin
ions on whether it feels such a study
is necessary and if so how the study
might be carried out.
Taylor says that the Faculty Master
told him in early January that the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion had decided December 14 on the
system to be used in selecting next
year's sponsors.
A committee of two sponsors, two
freshmen, and one Faculty Resident,
all to be appointed by the Faculty
Master, would make its choices, sub
ject to the approval of Dr. Hutchin
son and the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education.
Taylor told Dr. Hutchinson that
this plan was unacceptable, and ex
pressed his dissatisfaction that there
had been "no consultation with stu
dents, let alone sponsors."
System Drafted
Soon thereafter the Faculty Master
said that the question of sponsor
selection procedure was open to fur
ther discussion. The sponsors met on
two successive nights and drafted a
system acceptable to themselves.
In the ensuing weeks the Faculty
Master, the Faculty Residents, the
sponsors, and the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education informally
agreed upon a procedure acceptable
to all, with selections to be made by
a seven-man committee to which the
Faculty Master was an advisor (see
sponsor's statement).
Under the sponsors' plan, the ap
pointments to the Selection Commit
tee would be final, as would the
choices of sponsors which the com
mittee made. Both of these proposals
were unacceptable to the Faculty
Master and the Committee on Under
graduate Education, who insisted that
they retain a veto power over both
appointments and selections.
Dean Wert was unavailable for com
ment on the sponsors' announcement,
and Dr. Hutchinson made no state
ment pehding any decision the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education
may make when it meets later this
week.
Not Legal Question
Taylor commented that the spon
sors "view this primarily as an edu
cational and not a legal question. We
feel that the selection of sponsors by
a committee intimately involved in
the life of Wilbur Hall is infinitely
more desirable than the decision of
one man or the ruling of a faculty
committee far removed from the Hall
itself."
"To make sponsoring a staff posi
tion within a hierarch," continued
Taylor, "threatens to destroy the crea
tivity and esprit de corps long associ
ated with sponsoring."
