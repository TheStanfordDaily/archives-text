• Ky Says I\o Compromise
HONOLULU — President Johnson
was told today by the Prime Minister
of South Viet Nam that Saigon will
not surrender or compromise with
the Comunists and wants to increase
military strength because, he said,
that's the only language the Com
munists understand.
At the first formal meeting of their
top level strategy council, Johnson
and Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky
outlined their positions— generally in
similar language but with differences
of emphasis.
Johnson said he wants to see a
two-pronged program in South Viet
Nam—to pursue the war militarily
while moving vigorously to achieve
social and political reforms in South
Viet Nam.

committee of the University of North
Carolina Board of Trustees voted to
night to deny two controversial
speakers permission to appear at the

four hours of deliljeration on stu
dent invitations to Herbert Aptheker,

• // on so Passes Gl Bill
WASHINGTON The House
passed today a bill to set up a perm
anent program of educational and
housing benefits for military veter
ans and offer the bonus to those who
served in the Cold War Era since
Korea.
The vote was a unanimous 381 to 0,
although the House had failed to
act on a similar bill passed by the
Senate several years ago. The fight
ing in Viet Nam put steam behind
the drive to enact this help for men
in uniform.
The Senate last year passed a

somewhat costlier bill than the House
but is expected to go along with the
House version. And President John
son also is expected to accept it al
though his administration originally
asked that the program be limited
to veterans who served in combat
areas.
• Unruh Won't Back Brown
SACRAMENTO — Assembly
Speaker Jesse M. Unruh, one of the
most powerful Democrats in Cali
fornia, refused today to pledge his
support to Democratic Gov. Edmund
G. Brown for reelection to a third
term.
Unruh said a pledge he made a
year ago to back Brown "was taken
out of context" and "is no longer
valid." The Speaker told a news con
ference "if the Governor had an
nounced his intentions to run then,
he would have been assured of my
support."
Unruh, who guides administration
legislation through the lower house,
is at odds with the Governor over
how to finance an expected $250 mil
lion deficit in the state budget.
