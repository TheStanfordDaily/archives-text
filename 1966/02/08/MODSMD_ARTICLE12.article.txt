# Stanford's Bookstore: Pay Now, Expand Later
## Profits Grow But Students Complain 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's Bookstore has a
handsome new building, rising
sales, and soaring profit. What
it doesn't have is popularity.
Few institutions at Stanford
are the target of more angry
criticism, justified or unjusti
fied, than the 70-year-old Book
store. High prices, monopoly
status, and allegedly "jacked
prices" are the universal griev
ances.
These are the kinds of dissatis
faction in evidence every day on
campus:
• A Stern Hall sophomore

grimaced as he told his friends
in a lunch line that he paid
$4.50 for a paperback. "They
really soak you there. This isn't
worth more than $2.00!"
• A Lagunita junior said she
just bought a text published in
Britain at the Bookstore for
"twice" what it would have cost
overseas.
• A senior admitted recently
to a Daily reporter that he
steals nearly all his books from
the Bookstore. "It's a private
enterprise and a monopoly on
this campus. It isn't fair," he
said.
• President Wallace Sterling,

while addressing the Stanford
Mother's Club last month, said
the Bookstore was making
money "hand over fist" and said
facetiously that he wished he
could get his hands on some of
their profits for University use.
With the rapidly increasing
cost of a college education, ill
feeling against the expense of
books and supplies is easy to
understand. Last year the aver
age Stanford student spent
over $130 on textbooks alone,
the fourth highest of all univer
sities in the country.
Discontent with bookstore
concessions is not peculiar to
Stanford, as shown by a recent
survey by the National Associa
tion of College Stores (NACS),
of which the Stanford Bookstore
is a member. During spring se
mester, 1965, 25 NACS member
stores were '"investigated" by
student governments, one by lo
cal merchants, eight by stu
dent newspapers, and 22 by fac
ulty committees. A year ago the
store at Boston University was
the victim of a carefully planned
and effective student boycott.
Bad Image
At Stanford the Bookstore is
aware of its bad image and
works hard to improve it
through informative booklets
and receptivity to student com
plaints. William A. Kimball, the
white-haired, 62-year-old Book
store manager, talks freely of
the store's problems and prog
ress. He accounts for student's
critical attitudes from long ex
perience:
"When freshmen come to
Stanford, many have to buy
books for the first time. The cost
is a terrible shock. They're in a
strange new world, a little in
secure after the shock of tuition
and room and board costs. They
have to buy a lot of required
books they don't want," he ex
plained.
Kimball said further that
"Students see the real and ter
rific business we do during rush
periods. They see the high book
prices. They just decide the
bookstore is out to scrounge
them."
Kimball also attributed the
high cost of books to Stanford's
quarter system and the habit
of some professors of assigning
more required books than they
can possibly get to in one term.
Justified Complaints?
What are the facts? Are the
complaints justified?
First of all, nobody makes
any money out of the Book
store's concession. Founded in
1897 by faculty and staff, the
Bookstore is a non-profit co
operative association with 30
members representing all
schools and departments in the
University. No dividends or priv
ileges go to the members, each
of whom pays $1 per year dues.
The Bookstore corporation de
fines its sole purpose as serving
the Stanford community.
Since moving into its new
building on White Memorial
Plaza in 1960, the Bookstore has
given an 8 per cent discount to
all faculty, staff and students.
Before 1960 the store was on a
rebate system, with all profits
being shared with its customers.
Sometimes this rebate amount
ed to more than 20 per cent.
Sales, Profits Soar
Despite discounts and the
costs of the 30-year lease with
the University for the new
building, Bookstore sales and

profits have soared. In fiscal
1965, sales increased 15 per cent
to $2,223,129 and net profit
jumped 49 per cent to $85,539.
This year sales will climb at
least another 10 per cent, and
profits should exceed $100,000.
The money stays right in the
business. Cash on hand jumped
$60,000 last year, and the Book
store's nest-egg of savings ac
counts and U. S. Savings Bonds
increased to $94,866.
If the net profit of Bookstore
operations were turned into an
extra discount for customers,
the discount could be increased
from the current 8 per cent on
each sale to 12 per cent or more.
The discount will probably not,
however, ever be increased, ac
cording to Manager Kimball and
Chairman of the Bookstore's di
rectors, Professor Arthur Kroe
ger of the Graduate School of
Business.
Instead, the Bookstore will
continue to make profits with
the long-range goal of improv
ing its service and facilities. This
decision was made back in 1960,
when the Bookstore abandoned
its chaotic, inadequate space in
what is now the Western Civ li
brary. Rebates may have been
high, but the book counters
were impossibly jammed and the
store offered little to students
besides required textbooks.
"We decided to make the re
turn in rebate secondary," Kroe
ger said. "We wanted to offer a
better educational facility."
Now the Bookstore has that
better facility, with self-service,
a fast-growing paperback sec
tion, and humming cash regis
ters.
More Wanted
But the Bookstore Associa
tion still isn't satisfied. It wants
more storage, improvements in
the present building, and even
tually an additional store per
haps adjacent to the new un
dergraduate library. And these
things cost money. Kroger says
the Bookstore plans to save
$250,000 to help the University
build new facilities.
Kroeger admitted that all plans
for expansion are "still very
nebulous," and M. Harry San
ders of the University Planning
Office emphasized that "I know
of no plan for expansion. There
has, of course been conversa
tion."
"We assume the university
will continue to grow," Kroeger
said. "But we need more space
right now."
Manager Kimball points out
that planners blundered by not
building a full basement for
storage in the present Eook
store. If expansion goes smooth
ly, he said it is conceivable that
the discount may eventually be
raised to 10 per cent.
ASSU President Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, a student "consultant"
to the Bookstore association,
agrees with the "service vs. sav
ings" policy. "In a December
jmeetfng," MacKenzie said, "I
suggested that the discount be
raised to 9 or 10 per cent. But
the general reaction of the mem
bers was that in order to pro
vide good service, it is better to
keep the 8 per cent discount. I
was pretty well convinced."
So Bookstore officials have
a ready answer when criticisms
of the low discount are heard.
Other alleged abuses by the
Bookstore are just as quickly
dismissed by Kimball.

"Many students and profes
sors accuse us of jackingup
prices over publishers' list
prices," Kimball said. "This
just isn't true." He points out
that some books cost more here
than overseas because exclusive
publishing rights have been
granted to an American pub
lisher. He also emphasizes that
the occasional gummed stickers
With higher prices found on
books were put there by the
publisher, not by the Bookstore.
Kimball said the only reason
the Bookstore has increased its
profits is because sales have
risen with little increase in op
erating costs. Nearly half of the
Bookstore's dollar volume is in
low-margin textbooks, procured
on the request of Stanford pro
fessors.
The Bookstore actually makes
a relatively small profit on each
book sale, Kimball stressed,
with the majority of the retail
price going to the publisher. He
used Halliday and Resnick's
Physies For Students of Science
and Engineering as an example.
"Last quarter we bought 345
new copies from John Wiley and
Sons," Kimball said. "They cost
us $9.80 each, and including
shipping this came to $9.95 each.
The price stamped in the book
is $12.25. We gave 8 per cent off,
or $.98, so we ended up with
$1.32 as our margin on each
copy of this book."
Out of this gross profit the
Bookstore pays salaries to over
50 employees, property taxes, de
preciation, insurance and nu
merous miscellaneous expenses.
Why Separate?
One of the major operating
expenses of the Bookstore is rent
paid to the University. This
amounted to $24,000 last year,
and will increase if new facili
ties are ever built for the Book
store. And this prompts a ques
tion about the Bookstore that
nobody can answer: Why is it
separate from the University in
the first place?
Kroeger admits that "Any uni
versity starting up today would
include a bookstore as an in
tegral part." He says that Stan
ford's Bookstore is separate
merely because "it started that
way," and the Board has al
ways felt it "might as well keep
on being separate."
Ironically, the Bookstore's con
stitution stipulates that the
store will become part of Stan
ford University if the associa
tion ever discontinues.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore will
continue to save its profits so it
can afford to lease new space
from the University. The Univer
sity, as President Sterling's
wistful comment shows, will con
tinue to wish it could use the
Bookstore's profits.
And the students will continue
to wish that those profits didn't
exist in the first place.

faction in evidence every day on
campus:
• A Stern Hall sophomore

grimaced as he told his friends
in a lunch line that he paid
$4.50 for a paperback. "They
really soak you there. This isn't
worth more than $2.00!"
• A Lagunita junior said she
just bought a text published in
Britain at the Bookstore for
"twice" what it would have cost
overseas.
• A senior admitted recently
to a Daily reporter that he
steals nearly all his books from
the Bookstore. "It's a private
enterprise and a monopoly on
this campus. It isn't fair," he
said.
• President Wallace Sterling,

while addressing the Stanford
Mother's Club last month, said
the Bookstore was making
money "hand over fist" and said
facetiously that he wished he
could get his hands on some of
their profits for University use.
With the rapidly increasing
cost of a college education, ill
feeling against the expense of
books and supplies is easy to
understand. Last year the aver
age Stanford student spent
over $130 on textbooks alone,
the fourth highest of all univer
sities in the country.
Discontent with bookstore
concessions is not peculiar to
Stanford, as shown by a recent
survey by the National Associa
tion of College Stores (NACS),
of which the Stanford Bookstore
is a member. During spring se
mester, 1965, 25 NACS member
stores were '"investigated" by
student governments, one by lo
cal merchants, eight by stu
dent newspapers, and 22 by fac
ulty committees. A year ago the
store at Boston University was
the victim of a carefully planned
and effective student boycott.
Bad Image
At Stanford the Bookstore is
aware of its bad image and
works hard to improve it
through informative booklets
and receptivity to student com
plaints. William A. Kimball, the
white-haired, 62-year-old Book
store manager, talks freely of
the store's problems and prog
ress. He accounts for student's
critical attitudes from long ex
perience:
"When freshmen come to
Stanford, many have to buy
books for the first time. The cost
is a terrible shock. They're in a
strange new world, a little in
secure after the shock of tuition
and room and board costs. They
have to buy a lot of required
books they don't want," he ex
plained.
Kimball said further that
"Students see the real and ter
rific business we do during rush
periods. They see the high book
prices. They just decide the
bookstore is out to scrounge
them."
Kimball also attributed the
high cost of books to Stanford's
quarter system and the habit
of some professors of assigning
more required books than they
can possibly get to in one term.
Justified Complaints?
What are the facts? Are the
complaints justified?
First of all, nobody makes
any money out of the Book
store's concession. Founded in
1897 by faculty and staff, the
Bookstore is a non-profit co
operative association with 30
members representing all
schools and departments in the
University. No dividends or priv
ileges go to the members, each
of whom pays $1 per year dues.
The Bookstore corporation de
fines its sole purpose as serving
the Stanford community.
Since moving into its new
building on White Memorial
Plaza in 1960, the Bookstore has
given an 8 per cent discount to
all faculty, staff and students.
Before 1960 the store was on a
rebate system, with all profits
being shared with its customers.
Sometimes this rebate amount
ed to more than 20 per cent.
Sales, Profits Soar
Despite discounts and the
costs of the 30-year lease with
the University for the new
building, Bookstore sales and

profits have soared. In fiscal
1965, sales increased 15 per cent
to $2,223,129 and net profit
jumped 49 per cent to $85,539.
This year sales will climb at
least another 10 per cent, and
profits should exceed $100,000.
The money stays right in the
business. Cash on hand jumped
$60,000 last year, and the Book
store's nest-egg of savings ac
counts and U. S. Savings Bonds
increased to $94,866.
If the net profit of Bookstore
operations were turned into an
extra discount for customers,
the discount could be increased
from the current 8 per cent on
each sale to 12 per cent or more.
The discount will probably not,
however, ever be increased, ac
cording to Manager Kimball and
Chairman of the Bookstore's di
rectors, Professor Arthur Kroe
ger of the Graduate School of
Business.
Instead, the Bookstore will
continue to make profits with
the long-range goal of improv
ing its service and facilities. This
decision was made back in 1960,
when the Bookstore abandoned
its chaotic, inadequate space in
what is now the Western Civ li
brary. Rebates may have been
high, but the book counters
were impossibly jammed and the
store offered little to students
besides required textbooks.
"We decided to make the re
turn in rebate secondary," Kroe
ger said. "We wanted to offer a
better educational facility."
Now the Bookstore has that
better facility, with self-service,
a fast-growing paperback sec
tion, and humming cash regis
ters.
More Wanted
But the Bookstore Associa
tion still isn't satisfied. It wants
more storage, improvements in
the present building, and even
tually an additional store per
haps adjacent to the new un
dergraduate library. And these
things cost money. Kroger says
the Bookstore plans to save
$250,000 to help the University
build new facilities.
Kroeger admitted that all plans
for expansion are "still very
nebulous," and M. Harry San
ders of the University Planning
Office emphasized that "I know
of no plan for expansion. There
has, of course been conversa
tion."
"We assume the university
will continue to grow," Kroeger
said. "But we need more space
right now."
Manager Kimball points out
that planners blundered by not
building a full basement for
storage in the present Eook
store. If expansion goes smooth
ly, he said it is conceivable that
the discount may eventually be
raised to 10 per cent.
ASSU President Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, a student "consultant"
to the Bookstore association,
agrees with the "service vs. sav
ings" policy. "In a December
jmeetfng," MacKenzie said, "I
suggested that the discount be
raised to 9 or 10 per cent. But
the general reaction of the mem
bers was that in order to pro
vide good service, it is better to
keep the 8 per cent discount. I
was pretty well convinced."
So Bookstore officials have
a ready answer when criticisms
of the low discount are heard.
Other alleged abuses by the
Bookstore are just as quickly
dismissed by Kimball.

"Many students and profes
sors accuse us of jackingup
prices over publishers' list
prices," Kimball said. "This
just isn't true." He points out
that some books cost more here
than overseas because exclusive
publishing rights have been
granted to an American pub
lisher. He also emphasizes that
the occasional gummed stickers
With higher prices found on
books were put there by the
publisher, not by the Bookstore.
Kimball said the only reason
the Bookstore has increased its
profits is because sales have
risen with little increase in op
erating costs. Nearly half of the
Bookstore's dollar volume is in
low-margin textbooks, procured
on the request of Stanford pro
fessors.
The Bookstore actually makes
a relatively small profit on each
book sale, Kimball stressed,
with the majority of the retail
price going to the publisher. He
used Halliday and Resnick's
Physies For Students of Science
and Engineering as an example.
"Last quarter we bought 345
new copies from John Wiley and
Sons," Kimball said. "They cost
us $9.80 each, and including
shipping this came to $9.95 each.
The price stamped in the book
is $12.25. We gave 8 per cent off,
or $.98, so we ended up with
$1.32 as our margin on each
copy of this book."
Out of this gross profit the
Bookstore pays salaries to over
50 employees, property taxes, de
preciation, insurance and nu
merous miscellaneous expenses.
Why Separate?
One of the major operating
expenses of the Bookstore is rent
paid to the University. This
amounted to $24,000 last year,
and will increase if new facili
ties are ever built for the Book
store. And this prompts a ques
tion about the Bookstore that
nobody can answer: Why is it
separate from the University in
the first place?
Kroeger admits that "Any uni
versity starting up today would
include a bookstore as an in
tegral part." He says that Stan
ford's Bookstore is separate
merely because "it started that
way," and the Board has al
ways felt it "might as well keep
on being separate."
Ironically, the Bookstore's con
stitution stipulates that the
store will become part of Stan
ford University if the associa
tion ever discontinues.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore will
continue to save its profits so it
can afford to lease new space
from the University. The Univer
sity, as President Sterling's
wistful comment shows, will con
tinue to wish it could use the
Bookstore's profits.
And the students will continue
to wish that those profits didn't
exist in the first place.
Stanford's Bookstore has a
handsome new building, rising
sales, and soaring profit. What
it doesn't have is popularity.
Few institutions at Stanford
are the target of more angry
criticism, justified or unjusti
fied, than the 70-year-old Book
store. High prices, monopoly
status, and allegedly "jacked
prices" are the universal griev
ances.
These are the kinds of dissatis
faction in evidence every day on
campus:

grimaced as he told his friends

the Bookstore. "It's a private
enterprise and a monopoly on
this campus. It isn't fair," he
said.
• President Wallace Sterling,

while addressing the Stanford
Mother's Club last month, said
the Bookstore was making
money "hand over fist" and said
facetiously that he wished he
could get his hands on some of
their profits for University use.
With the rapidly increasing
cost of a college education, ill
feeling against the expense of
books and supplies is easy to
understand. Last year the aver
age Stanford student spent
over $130 on textbooks alone,
the fourth highest of all univer
sities in the country.
Discontent with bookstore
concessions is not peculiar to
Stanford, as shown by a recent
survey by the National Associa
tion of College Stores (NACS),
of which the Stanford Bookstore
is a member. During spring se
mester, 1965, 25 NACS member
stores were '"investigated" by
student governments, one by lo
cal merchants, eight by stu
dent newspapers, and 22 by fac
ulty committees. A year ago the
store at Boston University was
the victim of a carefully planned
and effective student boycott.
Bad Image
At Stanford the Bookstore is
aware of its bad image and
works hard to improve it
through informative booklets
and receptivity to student com
plaints. William A. Kimball, the
white-haired, 62-year-old Book
store manager, talks freely of
the store's problems and prog
ress. He accounts for student's
critical attitudes from long ex
perience:
"When freshmen come to
Stanford, many have to buy
books for the first time. The cost
is a terrible shock. They're in a
strange new world, a little in
secure after the shock of tuition
and room and board costs. They
have to buy a lot of required
books they don't want," he ex
plained.
Kimball said further that
"Students see the real and ter
rific business we do during rush
periods. They see the high book
prices. They just decide the
bookstore is out to scrounge
them."
Kimball also attributed the
high cost of books to Stanford's
quarter system and the habit
of some professors of assigning
more required books than they
can possibly get to in one term.
Justified Complaints?
What are the facts? Are the
complaints justified?
First of all, nobody makes
any money out of the Book
store's concession. Founded in
1897 by faculty and staff, the
Bookstore is a non-profit co
operative association with 30
members representing all
schools and departments in the
University. No dividends or priv
ileges go to the members, each
of whom pays $1 per year dues.
The Bookstore corporation de
fines its sole purpose as serving
the Stanford community.
Since moving into its new
building on White Memorial
Plaza in 1960, the Bookstore has
given an 8 per cent discount to
all faculty, staff and students.
Before 1960 the store was on a
rebate system, with all profits
being shared with its customers.
Sometimes this rebate amount
ed to more than 20 per cent.
Sales, Profits Soar
Despite discounts and the
costs of the 30-year lease with
the University for the new
building, Bookstore sales and

profits have soared. In fiscal
1965, sales increased 15 per cent
to $2,223,129 and net profit
jumped 49 per cent to $85,539.
This year sales will climb at
least another 10 per cent, and
profits should exceed $100,000.
The money stays right in the
business. Cash on hand jumped
$60,000 last year, and the Book
store's nest-egg of savings ac
counts and U. S. Savings Bonds
increased to $94,866.
If the net profit of Bookstore
operations were turned into an
extra discount for customers,
the discount could be increased
from the current 8 per cent on
each sale to 12 per cent or more.
The discount will probably not,
however, ever be increased, ac
cording to Manager Kimball and
Chairman of the Bookstore's di
rectors, Professor Arthur Kroe
ger of the Graduate School of
Business.
Instead, the Bookstore will
continue to make profits with
the long-range goal of improv
ing its service and facilities. This
decision was made back in 1960,
when the Bookstore abandoned
its chaotic, inadequate space in
what is now the Western Civ li
brary. Rebates may have been
high, but the book counters
were impossibly jammed and the
store offered little to students
besides required textbooks.
"We decided to make the re
turn in rebate secondary," Kroe
ger said. "We wanted to offer a
better educational facility."
Now the Bookstore has that
better facility, with self-service,
a fast-growing paperback sec
tion, and humming cash regis
ters.
More Wanted
But the Bookstore Associa
tion still isn't satisfied. It wants
more storage, improvements in
the present building, and even
tually an additional store per
haps adjacent to the new un
dergraduate library. And these
things cost money. Kroger says
the Bookstore plans to save
$250,000 to help the University
build new facilities.
Kroeger admitted that all plans
for expansion are "still very
nebulous," and M. Harry San
ders of the University Planning
Office emphasized that "I know
of no plan for expansion. There
has, of course been conversa
tion."
"We assume the university
will continue to grow," Kroeger
said. "But we need more space
right now."
Manager Kimball points out
that planners blundered by not
building a full basement for
storage in the present Eook
store. If expansion goes smooth
ly, he said it is conceivable that
the discount may eventually be
raised to 10 per cent.
ASSU President Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, a student "consultant"
to the Bookstore association,
agrees with the "service vs. sav
ings" policy. "In a December
jmeetfng," MacKenzie said, "I
suggested that the discount be
raised to 9 or 10 per cent. But
the general reaction of the mem
bers was that in order to pro
vide good service, it is better to
keep the 8 per cent discount. I
was pretty well convinced."
So Bookstore officials have
a ready answer when criticisms
of the low discount are heard.
Other alleged abuses by the
Bookstore are just as quickly
dismissed by Kimball.

"Many students and profes
sors accuse us of jackingup
prices over publishers' list
prices," Kimball said. "This
just isn't true." He points out
that some books cost more here
than overseas because exclusive
publishing rights have been
granted to an American pub
lisher. He also emphasizes that
the occasional gummed stickers
With higher prices found on
books were put there by the
publisher, not by the Bookstore.
Kimball said the only reason
the Bookstore has increased its
profits is because sales have
risen with little increase in op
erating costs. Nearly half of the
Bookstore's dollar volume is in
low-margin textbooks, procured
on the request of Stanford pro
fessors.
The Bookstore actually makes
a relatively small profit on each
book sale, Kimball stressed,
with the majority of the retail
price going to the publisher. He
used Halliday and Resnick's
Physies For Students of Science
and Engineering as an example.
"Last quarter we bought 345
new copies from John Wiley and
Sons," Kimball said. "They cost
us $9.80 each, and including
shipping this came to $9.95 each.
The price stamped in the book
is $12.25. We gave 8 per cent off,
or $.98, so we ended up with
$1.32 as our margin on each
copy of this book."
Out of this gross profit the
Bookstore pays salaries to over
50 employees, property taxes, de
preciation, insurance and nu
merous miscellaneous expenses.
Why Separate?
One of the major operating
expenses of the Bookstore is rent
paid to the University. This
amounted to $24,000 last year,
and will increase if new facili
ties are ever built for the Book
store. And this prompts a ques
tion about the Bookstore that
nobody can answer: Why is it
separate from the University in
the first place?
Kroeger admits that "Any uni
versity starting up today would
include a bookstore as an in
tegral part." He says that Stan
ford's Bookstore is separate
merely because "it started that
way," and the Board has al
ways felt it "might as well keep
on being separate."
Ironically, the Bookstore's con
stitution stipulates that the
store will become part of Stan
ford University if the associa
tion ever discontinues.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore will
continue to save its profits so it
can afford to lease new space
from the University. The Univer
sity, as President Sterling's
wistful comment shows, will con
tinue to wish it could use the
Bookstore's profits.
And the students will continue
to wish that those profits didn't
exist in the first place.
Stanford's Bookstore has a
handsome new building, rising
sales, and soaring profit. What
it doesn't have is popularity.
Few institutions at Stanford
are the target of more angry
criticism, justified or unjusti
fied, than the 70-year-old Book
store. High prices, monopoly
status, and allegedly "jacked
prices" are the universal griev
ances.
These are the kinds of dissatis
faction in evidence every day on
campus:
• A Stern Hall sophomore

grimaced as he told his friends
in a lunch line that he paid
$4.50 for a paperback. "They
really soak you there. This isn't
worth more than $2.00!"
• A Lagunita junior said she
just bought a text published in
Britain at the Bookstore for
"twice" what it would have cost
overseas.
• A senior admitted recently
to a Daily reporter that he
steals nearly all his books from
the Bookstore. "It's a private
enterprise and a monopoly on
this campus. It isn't fair," he
said.

understand. Last year the aver
age Stanford student spent
over $130 on textbooks alone,
the fourth highest of all univer
sities in the country.
Discontent with bookstore
concessions is not peculiar to
Stanford, as shown by a recent
survey by the National Associa
tion of College Stores (NACS),
of which the Stanford Bookstore
is a member. During spring se
mester, 1965, 25 NACS member
stores were '"investigated" by
student governments, one by lo
cal merchants, eight by stu
dent newspapers, and 22 by fac
ulty committees. A year ago the
store at Boston University was
the victim of a carefully planned
and effective student boycott.
Bad Image
At Stanford the Bookstore is
aware of its bad image and
works hard to improve it
through informative booklets
and receptivity to student com
plaints. William A. Kimball, the
white-haired, 62-year-old Book
store manager, talks freely of
the store's problems and prog
ress. He accounts for student's
critical attitudes from long ex
perience:
"When freshmen come to
Stanford, many have to buy
books for the first time. The cost
is a terrible shock. They're in a
strange new world, a little in
secure after the shock of tuition
and room and board costs. They
have to buy a lot of required
books they don't want," he ex
plained.
Kimball said further that
"Students see the real and ter
rific business we do during rush
periods. They see the high book
prices. They just decide the
bookstore is out to scrounge
them."
Kimball also attributed the
high cost of books to Stanford's
quarter system and the habit
of some professors of assigning
more required books than they
can possibly get to in one term.
Justified Complaints?
What are the facts? Are the
complaints justified?
First of all, nobody makes
any money out of the Book
store's concession. Founded in
1897 by faculty and staff, the
Bookstore is a non-profit co
operative association with 30
members representing all
schools and departments in the
University. No dividends or priv
ileges go to the members, each
of whom pays $1 per year dues.
The Bookstore corporation de
fines its sole purpose as serving
the Stanford community.
Since moving into its new
building on White Memorial
Plaza in 1960, the Bookstore has
given an 8 per cent discount to
all faculty, staff and students.
Before 1960 the store was on a
rebate system, with all profits
being shared with its customers.
Sometimes this rebate amount
ed to more than 20 per cent.
Sales, Profits Soar
Despite discounts and the
costs of the 30-year lease with
the University for the new
building, Bookstore sales and

profits have soared. In fiscal
1965, sales increased 15 per cent
to $2,223,129 and net profit
jumped 49 per cent to $85,539.
This year sales will climb at
least another 10 per cent, and
profits should exceed $100,000.
The money stays right in the
business. Cash on hand jumped
$60,000 last year, and the Book
store's nest-egg of savings ac
counts and U. S. Savings Bonds
increased to $94,866.
If the net profit of Bookstore
operations were turned into an
extra discount for customers,
the discount could be increased
from the current 8 per cent on
each sale to 12 per cent or more.
The discount will probably not,
however, ever be increased, ac
cording to Manager Kimball and
Chairman of the Bookstore's di
rectors, Professor Arthur Kroe
ger of the Graduate School of
Business.
Instead, the Bookstore will
continue to make profits with
the long-range goal of improv
ing its service and facilities. This
decision was made back in 1960,
when the Bookstore abandoned
its chaotic, inadequate space in
what is now the Western Civ li
brary. Rebates may have been
high, but the book counters
were impossibly jammed and the
store offered little to students
besides required textbooks.
"We decided to make the re
turn in rebate secondary," Kroe
ger said. "We wanted to offer a
better educational facility."
Now the Bookstore has that
better facility, with self-service,
a fast-growing paperback sec
tion, and humming cash regis
ters.
More Wanted
But the Bookstore Associa
tion still isn't satisfied. It wants
more storage, improvements in
the present building, and even
tually an additional store per
haps adjacent to the new un
dergraduate library. And these
things cost money. Kroger says
the Bookstore plans to save
$250,000 to help the University
build new facilities.
Kroeger admitted that all plans
for expansion are "still very
nebulous," and M. Harry San
ders of the University Planning
Office emphasized that "I know
of no plan for expansion. There
has, of course been conversa
tion."
"We assume the university
will continue to grow," Kroeger
said. "But we need more space
right now."
Manager Kimball points out
that planners blundered by not
building a full basement for
storage in the present Eook
store. If expansion goes smooth
ly, he said it is conceivable that
the discount may eventually be
raised to 10 per cent.
ASSU President Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, a student "consultant"
to the Bookstore association,
agrees with the "service vs. sav
ings" policy. "In a December
jmeetfng," MacKenzie said, "I
suggested that the discount be
raised to 9 or 10 per cent. But
the general reaction of the mem
bers was that in order to pro
vide good service, it is better to
keep the 8 per cent discount. I
was pretty well convinced."
So Bookstore officials have
a ready answer when criticisms
of the low discount are heard.
Other alleged abuses by the
Bookstore are just as quickly
dismissed by Kimball.

"Many students and profes
sors accuse us of jackingup
prices over publishers' list
prices," Kimball said. "This
just isn't true." He points out
that some books cost more here
than overseas because exclusive
publishing rights have been
granted to an American pub
lisher. He also emphasizes that
the occasional gummed stickers
With higher prices found on
books were put there by the
publisher, not by the Bookstore.
Kimball said the only reason
the Bookstore has increased its
profits is because sales have
risen with little increase in op
erating costs. Nearly half of the
Bookstore's dollar volume is in
low-margin textbooks, procured
on the request of Stanford pro
fessors.
The Bookstore actually makes
a relatively small profit on each
book sale, Kimball stressed,
with the majority of the retail
price going to the publisher. He
used Halliday and Resnick's
Physies For Students of Science
and Engineering as an example.
"Last quarter we bought 345
new copies from John Wiley and
Sons," Kimball said. "They cost
us $9.80 each, and including
shipping this came to $9.95 each.
The price stamped in the book
is $12.25. We gave 8 per cent off,
or $.98, so we ended up with
$1.32 as our margin on each
copy of this book."
Out of this gross profit the
Bookstore pays salaries to over
50 employees, property taxes, de
preciation, insurance and nu
merous miscellaneous expenses.
Why Separate?
One of the major operating
expenses of the Bookstore is rent
paid to the University. This
amounted to $24,000 last year,
and will increase if new facili
ties are ever built for the Book
store. And this prompts a ques
tion about the Bookstore that
nobody can answer: Why is it
separate from the University in
the first place?
Kroeger admits that "Any uni
versity starting up today would
include a bookstore as an in
tegral part." He says that Stan
ford's Bookstore is separate
merely because "it started that
way," and the Board has al
ways felt it "might as well keep
on being separate."
Ironically, the Bookstore's con
stitution stipulates that the
store will become part of Stan
ford University if the associa
tion ever discontinues.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore will
continue to save its profits so it
can afford to lease new space
from the University. The Univer
sity, as President Sterling's
wistful comment shows, will con
tinue to wish it could use the
Bookstore's profits.
And the students will continue
to wish that those profits didn't
exist in the first place.
Stanford's Bookstore has a
handsome new building, rising
sales, and soaring profit. What
it doesn't have is popularity.
Few institutions at Stanford
are the target of more angry
criticism, justified or unjusti
fied, than the 70-year-old Book
store. High prices, monopoly
status, and allegedly "jacked
prices" are the universal griev
ances.
These are the kinds of dissatis
faction in evidence every day on
campus:
• A Stern Hall sophomore

grimaced as he told his friends
in a lunch line that he paid
$4.50 for a paperback. "They
really soak you there. This isn't
worth more than $2.00!"
• A Lagunita junior said she
just bought a text published in
Britain at the Bookstore for
"twice" what it would have cost
overseas.
• A senior admitted recently
to a Daily reporter that he
steals nearly all his books from
the Bookstore. "It's a private
enterprise and a monopoly on
this campus. It isn't fair," he
said.
• President Wallace Sterling,

while addressing the Stanford
Mother's Club last month, said
the Bookstore was making
money "hand over fist" and said
facetiously that he wished he
could get his hands on some of
their profits for University use.
With the rapidly increasing
cost of a college education, ill
feeling against the expense of
books and supplies is easy to
understand. Last year the aver
age Stanford student spent
over $130 on textbooks alone,
the fourth highest of all univer
sities in the country.

cal merchants, eight by stu
dent newspapers, and 22 by fac
ulty committees. A year ago the
store at Boston University was
the victim of a carefully planned
and effective student boycott.
Bad Image
At Stanford the Bookstore is
aware of its bad image and
works hard to improve it
through informative booklets
and receptivity to student com
plaints. William A. Kimball, the
white-haired, 62-year-old Book
store manager, talks freely of
the store's problems and prog
ress. He accounts for student's
critical attitudes from long ex
perience:
"When freshmen come to
Stanford, many have to buy
books for the first time. The cost
is a terrible shock. They're in a
strange new world, a little in
secure after the shock of tuition
and room and board costs. They
have to buy a lot of required
books they don't want," he ex
plained.
Kimball said further that
"Students see the real and ter
rific business we do during rush
periods. They see the high book
prices. They just decide the
bookstore is out to scrounge
them."
Kimball also attributed the
high cost of books to Stanford's
quarter system and the habit
of some professors of assigning
more required books than they
can possibly get to in one term.
Justified Complaints?
What are the facts? Are the
complaints justified?
First of all, nobody makes
any money out of the Book
store's concession. Founded in
1897 by faculty and staff, the
Bookstore is a non-profit co
operative association with 30
members representing all
schools and departments in the
University. No dividends or priv
ileges go to the members, each
of whom pays $1 per year dues.
The Bookstore corporation de
fines its sole purpose as serving
the Stanford community.
Since moving into its new
building on White Memorial
Plaza in 1960, the Bookstore has
given an 8 per cent discount to
all faculty, staff and students.
Before 1960 the store was on a
rebate system, with all profits
being shared with its customers.
Sometimes this rebate amount
ed to more than 20 per cent.
Sales, Profits Soar
Despite discounts and the
costs of the 30-year lease with
the University for the new
building, Bookstore sales and

profits have soared. In fiscal
1965, sales increased 15 per cent
to $2,223,129 and net profit
jumped 49 per cent to $85,539.
This year sales will climb at
least another 10 per cent, and
profits should exceed $100,000.
The money stays right in the
business. Cash on hand jumped
$60,000 last year, and the Book
store's nest-egg of savings ac
counts and U. S. Savings Bonds
increased to $94,866.
If the net profit of Bookstore
operations were turned into an
extra discount for customers,
the discount could be increased
from the current 8 per cent on
each sale to 12 per cent or more.
The discount will probably not,
however, ever be increased, ac
cording to Manager Kimball and
Chairman of the Bookstore's di
rectors, Professor Arthur Kroe
ger of the Graduate School of
Business.
Instead, the Bookstore will
continue to make profits with
the long-range goal of improv
ing its service and facilities. This
decision was made back in 1960,
when the Bookstore abandoned
its chaotic, inadequate space in
what is now the Western Civ li
brary. Rebates may have been
high, but the book counters
were impossibly jammed and the
store offered little to students
besides required textbooks.
"We decided to make the re
turn in rebate secondary," Kroe
ger said. "We wanted to offer a
better educational facility."
Now the Bookstore has that
better facility, with self-service,
a fast-growing paperback sec
tion, and humming cash regis
ters.
More Wanted
But the Bookstore Associa
tion still isn't satisfied. It wants
more storage, improvements in
the present building, and even
tually an additional store per
haps adjacent to the new un
dergraduate library. And these
things cost money. Kroger says
the Bookstore plans to save
$250,000 to help the University
build new facilities.
Kroeger admitted that all plans
for expansion are "still very
nebulous," and M. Harry San
ders of the University Planning
Office emphasized that "I know
of no plan for expansion. There
has, of course been conversa
tion."
"We assume the university
will continue to grow," Kroeger
said. "But we need more space
right now."
Manager Kimball points out
that planners blundered by not
building a full basement for
storage in the present Eook
store. If expansion goes smooth
ly, he said it is conceivable that
the discount may eventually be
raised to 10 per cent.
ASSU President Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, a student "consultant"
to the Bookstore association,
agrees with the "service vs. sav
ings" policy. "In a December
jmeetfng," MacKenzie said, "I
suggested that the discount be
raised to 9 or 10 per cent. But
the general reaction of the mem
bers was that in order to pro
vide good service, it is better to
keep the 8 per cent discount. I
was pretty well convinced."
So Bookstore officials have
a ready answer when criticisms
of the low discount are heard.
Other alleged abuses by the
Bookstore are just as quickly
dismissed by Kimball.

"Many students and profes
sors accuse us of jackingup
prices over publishers' list
prices," Kimball said. "This
just isn't true." He points out
that some books cost more here
than overseas because exclusive
publishing rights have been
granted to an American pub
lisher. He also emphasizes that
the occasional gummed stickers
With higher prices found on
books were put there by the
publisher, not by the Bookstore.
Kimball said the only reason
the Bookstore has increased its
profits is because sales have
risen with little increase in op
erating costs. Nearly half of the
Bookstore's dollar volume is in
low-margin textbooks, procured
on the request of Stanford pro
fessors.
The Bookstore actually makes
a relatively small profit on each
book sale, Kimball stressed,
with the majority of the retail
price going to the publisher. He
used Halliday and Resnick's
Physies For Students of Science
and Engineering as an example.
"Last quarter we bought 345
new copies from John Wiley and
Sons," Kimball said. "They cost
us $9.80 each, and including
shipping this came to $9.95 each.
The price stamped in the book
is $12.25. We gave 8 per cent off,
or $.98, so we ended up with
$1.32 as our margin on each
copy of this book."
Out of this gross profit the
Bookstore pays salaries to over
50 employees, property taxes, de
preciation, insurance and nu
merous miscellaneous expenses.
Why Separate?
One of the major operating
expenses of the Bookstore is rent
paid to the University. This
amounted to $24,000 last year,
and will increase if new facili
ties are ever built for the Book
store. And this prompts a ques
tion about the Bookstore that
nobody can answer: Why is it
separate from the University in
the first place?
Kroeger admits that "Any uni
versity starting up today would
include a bookstore as an in
tegral part." He says that Stan
ford's Bookstore is separate
merely because "it started that
way," and the Board has al
ways felt it "might as well keep
on being separate."
Ironically, the Bookstore's con
stitution stipulates that the
store will become part of Stan
ford University if the associa
tion ever discontinues.
Meanwhile, the Bookstore will
continue to save its profits so it
can afford to lease new space
from the University. The Univer
sity, as President Sterling's
wistful comment shows, will con
tinue to wish it could use the
Bookstore's profits.
And the students will continue
to wish that those profits didn't
exist in the first place.
Stanford's Bookstore has a
handsome new building, rising
sales, and soaring profit. What
it doesn't have is popularity.
Few institutions at Stanford
are the target of more angry
criticism, justified or unjusti
fied, than the 70-year-old Book
store. High prices, monopoly
status, and allegedly "jacked
prices" are the universal griev
ances.
These are the kinds of dissatis
faction in evidence every day on
campus:
• A Stern Hall sophomore

grimaced as he told his friends
in a lunch line that he paid
$4.50 for a paperback. "They
really soak you there. This isn't
worth more than $2.00!"
• A Lagunita junior said she
just bought a text published in
Britain at the Bookstore for
"twice" what it would have cost
overseas.
• A senior admitted recently
to a Daily reporter that he
steals nearly all his books from
the Bookstore. "It's a private
enterprise and a monopoly on
this campus. It isn't fair," he
said.
• President Wallace Sterling,

while addressing the Stanford
Mother's Club last month, said
the Bookstore was making
money "hand over fist" and said
facetiously that he wished he
could get his hands on some of
their profits for University use.
With the rapidly increasing
cost of a college education, ill
feeling against the expense of
books and supplies is easy to
understand. Last year the aver
age Stanford student spent
over $130 on textbooks alone,
the fourth highest of all univer
sities in the country.
Discontent with bookstore
concessions is not peculiar to
Stanford, as shown by a recent
survey by the National Associa
tion of College Stores (NACS),
of which the Stanford Bookstore
is a member. During spring se
mester, 1965, 25 NACS member
stores were '"investigated" by
student governments, one by lo
cal merchants, eight by stu
dent newspapers, and 22 by fac
ulty committees. A year ago the
store at Boston University was
the victim of a carefully planned
and effective student boycott.
