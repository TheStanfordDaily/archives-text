# The 						Mystery of Man
## 
### 
Man is much more than a higher form of animal life, an electro-mechani
cal robot, or a biological organism. He has a soul. A look within shows con
science, mind and will. Creative ihought, artistry and invention, memory and
imagination mark the inner man. Dreams of the night reveal the depths of
an unconscious mind, the archetypes and traces of the whole human race in
each one of us. Man is an engima to himself and the greatest of puzzles found
on earth.
St. Augustine said, Thou hast made us for thyself, O God, and our
hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee." Pascal, the great physicist
and philosopher more recently said, "There is a God-shaped vacuum in the
heart of each man which cannot be satisfied by any created thing but only
by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus Christ." And Jesus Christ
said, "I came that men might have life and that more abundantly." The key
to man and the mystery of life is the God who put us here, the God who knows
our hearts, and who alone can fill them.
Man, the Bible declares, is intended to be a partaker of the divine, a
god-like created being indwelt by the sovereign Lord of glory. Peter writes in
the New Testament, "God's divine power has granted to us all things that
pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Jesus Christ who
called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his
previous and very great promises, that through these you may escape from
the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and became partakers of
the divine nature."
Unable to escape from what he really is and the way he has been
created, man seeks to be his own god, self centerd and self-sufficient, but
out of touch with his Creator who alone is Life, and Love and Power. John's
Gospel says, "God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship him
in spirit and in truth." It is Jesus Christ who told us, "I am the truth ... no
one come to the Father but by me."
The key to finding yourself, the answer to the meaning of persons is
Jesus Christ. To live without God is to be something less than man, a mockery
of truth. To know yourself, meet Jesus Christ. To find fulfillment, walk with
him. Why stay a child in a self-made world of unreality?

of truth. To know yourself, meet Jesus Christ. To find fulfillment, walk with
him. Why stay a child in a self-made world of unreality?

Man is much more than a higher form of animal life, an electro-mechani
cal robot, or a biological organism. He has a soul. A look within shows con
science, mind and will. Creative ihought, artistry and invention, memory and
imagination mark the inner man. Dreams of the night reveal the depths of
an unconscious mind, the archetypes and traces of the whole human race in
each one of us. Man is an engima to himself and the greatest of puzzles found
on earth.
St. Augustine said, Thou hast made us for thyself, O God, and our
hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee." Pascal, the great physicist
and philosopher more recently said, "There is a God-shaped vacuum in the
heart of each man which cannot be satisfied by any created thing but only
by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus Christ." And Jesus Christ
said, "I came that men might have life and that more abundantly." The key
to man and the mystery of life is the God who put us here, the God who knows
our hearts, and who alone can fill them.
Man, the Bible declares, is intended to be a partaker of the divine, a
god-like created being indwelt by the sovereign Lord of glory. Peter writes in
the New Testament, "God's divine power has granted to us all things that
pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Jesus Christ who
called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his
previous and very great promises, that through these you may escape from
the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and became partakers of
the divine nature."
Unable to escape from what he really is and the way he has been
created, man seeks to be his own god, self centerd and self-sufficient, but
out of touch with his Creator who alone is Life, and Love and Power. John's
Gospel says, "God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship him
in spirit and in truth." It is Jesus Christ who told us, "I am the truth ... no
one come to the Father but by me."
The key to finding yourself, the answer to the meaning of persons is
Jesus Christ. To live without God is to be something less than man, a mockery
of truth. To know yourself, meet Jesus Christ. To find fulfillment, walk with
him. Why stay a child in a self-made world of unreality?
