# Prof To Speak On Ruby Trial
## 
### 
Professor John Kaplan of the
Stanford Law School will speak
this afternoon on his new book,
The Jack Ruby Trial, at 4:30 in
the small lounge at Tresidder.
One of Kaplan's main conclus
ions in his book is that the
Dallas trial of Jack Ruby for the
murder of Lee Harvey Oswald
shed little credit on the nation's
legal profession. The book cites
many examples of improper
legal methods and personal con
flicts during the trial.
Kaplan worked with Profes
sor John R. Waltz of the North
western University Law School
in writing the book. The authors
concluded that Belli's reliance
on the defense that Ruby was
suffering psychomotor epilepsy
at the time of the crime played
right into the hands of the prose
cution. However, despite the
death penalty given Ruby in the
trial, the authors feel that there
is very little likelihood that
Ruby will ever be executed for
his crime.
