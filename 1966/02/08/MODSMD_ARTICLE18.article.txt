# YR's Elect Three Birchers
## 
### 
A coalition of moderates and
conservatives lost their fight to
regain control of the Young Re
publicans of California Sunday
at the organization's state con
vention in Los Angeles.
As a result, known members
of the John Birch Society were
elected to fill at least three of
the top offices in the organiza
tion.
Stanford's six delegates and
alternates actively supported
the coalition candidates, includ
ing presidential candidate Rob
ert Sprinkel, a 30-year-old in
vestment executive and grad
uate of Stanford.
Mike Djordjevich, a 29-year
old Yugoslav refugee, defeated
Sprinkel 146 to 100 after a third
candidate, Jerry Ducote, with
drew from the race in Djordje
vich's favor. Ducote is a former
Birch member.
"These people now in control
lack all sense of political reali
ties," said Stanford YR Presi
dent Carl Anderson. "Mr. Djor
djevitch's public statements be
fore and since his election do
not represent the viewpoint of
the Stanford YR's. It is unfor
tunate that his irresponsible
opinions will be take as repre

scntative of a Republican volun
teer organization, especially in
a crucial election year."
Acording to the Los Angeles
Times, Djordjevitch said he fav
ors withdrawal of the U.S. from
the U.N. and advocates aboli
tion of the income tax.
The original platform offered
to the convention by the plat
form committee labeled public
welfare as "legalized plunder"
and suggested "reconsideration
of the concept of state main
tained educational systems." Al
though those latter two points
were not contained in a substi
tute platform, they were sup
ported by delegates who backed
the victorious slate of candi
dates.
"Sprinkel's campaign was
backed by many who felt one
final try should be made to re
store respectability to the or
ganization," explained John
Bonine, San Mateo County YR
treasurer. "Membership has
dropped from 15,000 in 1963 to
9,000 in 1966. This has been the
result of a policy of intolerance
toward differing viewpoints."
Robert Naylor, treasurer of
the state YR college federation,
told The Daily: "The conven

tion was a complete disaster.
This election may have been the
last throes of a dying state YR
organization."
In a contest held the evening
before the election, the Stanford
YR organization was named
"Best College Unit of the Year."
"Although we worked hard for
the award, we're not sure
whether to take it as an honor
or as a booby prize," Naylor
said.

welfare as "legalized plunder"
and suggested "reconsideration
of the concept of state main

though those latter two points
were not contained in a substi

ported by delegates who backed
the victorious slate of candi
dates.
"Sprinkel's campaign was
backed by many who felt one
final try should be made to re
store respectability to the or
ganization," explained John
Bonine, San Mateo County YR
treasurer. "Membership has
dropped from 15,000 in 1963 to
9,000 in 1966. This has been the
result of a policy of intolerance
toward differing viewpoints."
Robert Naylor, treasurer of
the state YR college federation,
told The Daily: "The conven

tion was a complete disaster.
This election may have been the
last throes of a dying state YR
organization."
In a contest held the evening
before the election, the Stanford
YR organization was named
"Best College Unit of the Year."
"Although we worked hard for
the award, we're not sure
whether to take it as an honor
or as a booby prize," Naylor
said.
A coalition of moderates and
conservatives lost their fight to
regain control of the Young Re
publicans of California Sunday
at the organization's state con
vention in Los Angeles.
As a result, known members
of the John Birch Society were
elected to fill at least three of
the top offices in the organiza
tion.
Stanford's six delegates and
alternates actively supported
the coalition candidates, includ
ing presidential candidate Rob
ert Sprinkel, a 30-year-old in
vestment executive and grad
uate of Stanford.
Mike Djordjevich, a 29-year
old Yugoslav refugee, defeated
Sprinkel 146 to 100 after a third
candidate, Jerry Ducote, with
drew from the race in Djordje
vich's favor. Ducote is a former
Birch member.
"These people now in control
lack all sense of political reali
ties," said Stanford YR Presi
dent Carl Anderson. "Mr. Djor
djevitch's public statements be
fore and since his election do
not represent the viewpoint of
the Stanford YR's. It is unfor
tunate that his irresponsible
opinions will be take as repre

scntative of a Republican volun
teer organization, especially in
a crucial election year."
Acording to the Los Angeles
Times, Djordjevitch said he fav
ors withdrawal of the U.S. from
the U.N. and advocates aboli
tion of the income tax.
