# Skill At Jacks No Test Of Femininity
## 
### 
New Haven, Conn., (AP) —
The latest round of the role of
the sexes was fought Friday
when the male Managing Ed
itor of the Yale Daily News
trounced his female counter
part on the Harvard Crimson
in a game of jacks.
John Rothchild, outfitted in a
tuxedo for the occasion, hardly
worked up a sweat as he went
all the way from onesies to ten
sies in only five tries.
He repeated this feat using
the more difficult "eggs in a
basket" method while Miss
Linda McVeigh was still work
ing on her first sixies.
The match was the result of
Miss McVeigh's being appointed
the first female Managing Edi
tor of the Harvard student
newspaper.
Weakest Point
In challenging Miss McVeigh
to the traditionally female
sport, Rothchild had said, "I
pect that you, like other fair
sex cohorts, have become so
good at being male that you
could beat me easily in any sort
of wrestling or drinking bout.
So I challenge you at your
weakest point—femininity."
The entrance of Miss Mc-
Veigh into the jacks ring was

heralded by a troup of young
boys distributing balloons to
the approximately 200 observ
ers.
Rothchild was seconded by
his paper's Executive Editor,
Winthrop Conrad, who present
ed Miss McVeigh with two sets
of jacks and balls on a silver
platter.
Miss McVeigh chose the set
closest to her for the competi
tion, but later claimed her ball
was defective and the second
jacks set was brought into play.
Get Wiped
Midway through the contest,
after Rothchild had reached
tensies for the first time and
was preparing for "Eggs in a
Basket," Miss McVeigh pre
dicted "I'm going to get wiped."
When the final whistle was
blown by the referee, eight
year-old Polly Prelinger of New
Haven, and Rothchild was de
clared the winner, the partisan
audience of Yale students broke
into a spirited rendition of the
Yale fight song.
When asked about the results
of the match, Miss McVeigh
said, "I don't think the loss
makes me any less feminine; it
just proves that John is more
feminine."
Cameramen?
The Radcliffe junior became
more kindly disposed toward
her former opponent a few min
utes later, however, when he
demonstrated his masculinity
by kissing her several times,
presumably for the benefit of
cameramen.
After this sportsmanlike dem
onstration, Rothchild issued a
statement through his second
which read: I won the jacks
match but my truthful admis
sion is I lost the war.
Miss McVeigh's obvious
feminine charms are not with
out evidence. I concede to her
feminity, as well as her ability
to boss around those poor hap
less males in the Harvard Crim
son newsroom.
"Men, we are lost."

her former opponent a few min
utes later, however, when he
demonstrated his masculinity
by kissing her several times,
presumably for the benefit of
cameramen.

onstration, Rothchild issued a
statement through his second
which read: I won the jacks
match but my truthful admis
sion is I lost the war.

feminity, as well as her ability
to boss around those poor hap

"Men, we are lost."
New Haven, Conn., (AP) —
The latest round of the role of
the sexes was fought Friday
when the male Managing Ed
itor of the Yale Daily News
trounced his female counter
part on the Harvard Crimson
in a game of jacks.
John Rothchild, outfitted in a
tuxedo for the occasion, hardly
worked up a sweat as he went
all the way from onesies to ten
sies in only five tries.
He repeated this feat using
the more difficult "eggs in a
basket" method while Miss
Linda McVeigh was still work
ing on her first sixies.
The match was the result of
Miss McVeigh's being appointed
the first female Managing Edi
tor of the Harvard student
newspaper.
Weakest Point
In challenging Miss McVeigh
to the traditionally female
sport, Rothchild had said, "I
pect that you, like other fair
sex cohorts, have become so
good at being male that you
could beat me easily in any sort
of wrestling or drinking bout.
So I challenge you at your
weakest point—femininity."
The entrance of Miss Mc-
Veigh into the jacks ring was

heralded by a troup of young
boys distributing balloons to
the approximately 200 observ
ers.
Rothchild was seconded by
his paper's Executive Editor,
Winthrop Conrad, who present
ed Miss McVeigh with two sets
of jacks and balls on a silver
platter.
Miss McVeigh chose the set
closest to her for the competi
tion, but later claimed her ball
was defective and the second
jacks set was brought into play.
Get Wiped
Midway through the contest,
after Rothchild had reached
tensies for the first time and
was preparing for "Eggs in a
Basket," Miss McVeigh pre
dicted "I'm going to get wiped."
When the final whistle was
blown by the referee, eight
year-old Polly Prelinger of New
Haven, and Rothchild was de
clared the winner, the partisan
audience of Yale students broke
into a spirited rendition of the
Yale fight song.
When asked about the results
of the match, Miss McVeigh
said, "I don't think the loss
makes me any less feminine; it
just proves that John is more
feminine."
Cameramen?
The Radcliffe junior became
more kindly disposed toward
her former opponent a few min
utes later, however, when he
demonstrated his masculinity
by kissing her several times,
presumably for the benefit of
cameramen.

onstration, Rothchild issued a
