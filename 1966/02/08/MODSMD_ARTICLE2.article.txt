# Background Of Marxism Emphasized
## 
### 
"The most basic drive in men is the
restless urge to produce," because
only in transforming his environment
does man come to know the world.
So labor is not a demeaning activity
but is actually the fulfillment of
man's potentiality.
<This basic view of work formed the
ioundation for Marx's philosophy,
Professor Charles Drekmeier told a
packed house in the first of a series
of lectures on the nature of Commu
nism sponsored by Tresidder Board.
Dr. Drekmeier placed Marx in his
historical context by first discussing
the philosophies of prior writers and
showing how they influenced Marx's
works. Since the writings of Hobbes,
that which is good has been defined
as that which man desires. Conse
quently Marxism reflects a material
istic attitude toward life.
Changing Environment
In stating that man can only ex
press himself by changing'his environ
ment, Marx closely followed the writ
ings of John Locke, Drekmeier said.
In the act of modifying the world,
man also creates himself" by making
his potential for work actual.
Because man cannot create certain
products without the help of his fel
lows, societies have to be formed.
The nature of the work done in a
particular region will determine
exactly the type of civilization which
is found there, Drekmeier explained
Marx as saying.
This economic interpretation of so
ciety, leads to a theory of history
based entirely on the economy of the
major nations of the world. "Econom
ics is the independent variable" which
effects all other changes in the histo
ry of the world, but it was not a new
concept, Professor Drekmeier stated.
New Economic Force
The major innovation which Marx
produced, Dr. Drekmeier commented
was the introduction of the Proletariat
as an important force in economic
movements.
The proletariat is composed of the
masses of working men who actually
produce all commodities. The capital
ist exploit these workers by taking an
unfair profit from their work and
keeping them poor.
According to Drekmeier, Marx was
a moralist when he proclaimed that
the workers should arise and throw
off the chains of their oppressors and
get back from the capitalists that
which was stolen from them. Marx
maintained that the workers were the
only one's who should benefit from
their labors and so would be justified
in destroying the upper class rulers.
Marx proposed the abolishion of
class distinctions, so that all men
might be able to express themselves
in honest labor and so might all be
come more human as a consequence.
