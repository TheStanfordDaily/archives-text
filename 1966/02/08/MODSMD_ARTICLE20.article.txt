# Stanford Gets $100,000 Grant
## 
### 
Stanford will be one of thir
teen private institutions to re
ceive $100,000 from the Procter
and Gamble Fund over the next
five years, it was announced
yesterday.
A similar pledge of $100,000
from Procter and Gamble to
Stanford in 1957 was termed by
emeritus Vice-President Frede
rick E. Terman as "what broke
through the dike that had been
holding us back" in the univer
sity's chemistry department.
"As a result of the Procter
and Gamble gift we were able
to go out and obtain a couple
of top men to provide the new
leadership we needed in chemis
try. With these top men coming
to Stanford, we were able to ob
tain the gift of a building. With
the building and the men, we
then had a base which made it
possible to develop support from
other sources.
"The gift was thus the essen
tial catalyst which triggered the
entire developmnt."
The department received near
ly $1 million for research in
1965 of which $100,000 came
from private sources and more
than $800,000 from government
agencies.
During fiscal 1965, Stanford
received more than 1600 gifts
from business and industry to
taling $5.5 million, ari all-time
high in support from this
source.
