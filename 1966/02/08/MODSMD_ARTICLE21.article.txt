# Grapplers Sweep Pair Of Weekend Matches
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity wrestling
squad picked up a pair of im
pressive victories last Friday,
wrapping up the UCSB Gauchos
24-9, then crushing UCLA, 26-9.
The Grapplers go to battle
again, hosting the Moffett Field
Naval Air Service Squadron at
7:30 in the Pavilion tonight.
The Stanford weekend victo
ries came on the heels of a dis
appointing 15-15 tie with San
Jose State last week. Varsity
Coach Bill Leland was pleased
with the team's performance
against the two southern teams,
whom he judges on a par with
San Jose and as tough as most
teams the Indians will meet
this year.
Hazel ton Scores
John Hazelton took a 5-1 de
cision in his match against
UCSB, but UCLA could not pro
vide a 123 pound opponent.
Steve Boyan lost a tough
match to UCLA's Tanase. Ta
nase scored a second period pre
dicament that turned out to be
the victory margin in a 6-4 deci
sion.
Tom Rajala came out on top
of a rough and tumble 137 divi
sion match against UCLA's
Ness. Tied 2-2 going into the
second period, Rajala executed
two reverses while Ness scored
one. Ness escaped in the third
period, but Rajala held on to
win, 6-5.
Ott Pins A Bruin
Marshall Ott made no bones
about his intentions in his 145
pound match with UCLA. Ott
took his opponent down in the
opening stanza. In the second,
Ott scored a reverse, then near
ly pinned his man as the whis
tle blew. In the final period, Ott
pinned the Bruin in short or
der.
Bill Vogelpohl wrestled at 152
against UCSB. The springy Vi
dian gave the Gaucho no quar
ter, scoring a second period pin.
Doug Gunesch handled the 152
chores against the Bruins. Gu
nesch stayed even with his oppo

nent through two quarters. In
the final period, he tallied a late
take down and subsequent pre
dicament to win on decision.
Schaum: Twist in' Bout
Steve Schaum earned a deci
sion victory against UCSB's
team captain, and ran into an
other team captain with UCLA.
Schaum held an early lead, but
UCLA's 160 pound Lee Ehler
gained slowly.
Ehler was penalized for knee
twisting, but still managed to
take a 12-8 decision.
Frank Pratt, whom Leland
cited as one of the outstanding
wrestlers of the weekend,
pinned his UCSB opponent in
quick time. The aggressive 167
pound Indian slammed his Bru
in opponent to the mat and
pinned him before the first
round was two minutes old.
Stanford co-captain Mike

Davison dropped a pair of tough
matches against what L e 1 a n d
termed "probably UCSB's and
UCLA's best wrestlers." Davi
son's eye was cut in his UCLA
match, where the Bruin's Orr
used a second period predica
ment to decide a 7-3 match.
Rick Lindsley, wrestlfng un
limited stuck his UCSB adver
sary in 6:11. Lindsley didn't
have a chance to wrestle against
UCLA, as the Bruins forfeited
the heavyweight match.
