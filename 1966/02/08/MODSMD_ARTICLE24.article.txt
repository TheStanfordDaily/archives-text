# John Gilmore Has Loads Of Problems

Exerpt from my personal
Stanford Athletic Coloring:
Book: "See the Coach. He is John
Gilmore. He coaches gymnas
tics. Color him unlucky."
In last year's edition of this
famous book, Coach Gilmore
would have been colored "on the
rise." He had just finished a
successful 6-2 season and it ap
peared that his appointment as
Director of Gymnastics had paid
off. Several top performers were
returning, some were to be eligi
ble for the first time the follow
ing season, and Stanford Gym
nastics enthusiasts — a rare and
devoted breed — were experi
encing what our social scientist
friends call "a rising curve of
expectations." (Some of my best
friends are social scientists).
Unlucky
I don't know what these friends
would call what has now hap
pened to the fortunes of the
gymnastics squad and to those
hopeful disciples. A "descend
ing curve" hardly describes it.
A sudden plummet comes
closer. But I prefer to sacrifice
scientific precision for clarity:
the Indians have just been un
lucky.
Number one: Gilmore started
the season with greetings from
three of the Fates: His team:
two hopefuls did not show up
for school and presumably have
turned in their red tee-shirts for

green ones and are working out
somewhere in Southeast Asia,
and John Retternich, the previ
ous season's Ail-Around man
went to study in Stanford-in-
Austria.
Rules Committee
Number two: the NCAA rules
committee, which changed over
to the Olympic style of scoring,
computing the total of the raw
score of the three top men for
each team, instead of giving
points for placement in an
event. This was no help to the
Tribe's growing depth problem.
Number three: the third
problem came, ironically from
Gilmore himself. He found that
his diligence had produced the
beefiest schedule in Stanford
history and one of the toughest
in the nation.
But this was only the begin
ning. The free Exercise was the
Tribe's best event. Then free
exercise man Tom Boyce appar
ently disappeared into the wood
work of the gymnastics room.
The only trampoline man, Ted
Anstedt, was forced by doctor's
orders to drop the sport.
More to Come
By the time the Cal-Brigham
Young tri-meet rolled around,
Pete Gibson was only able to
compete in the parallel bars be
cause of a torn ligament.
But the ultimate blow, it

his diligence had produced the
beefiest schedule in Stanford
history and one of the toughest
in the nation.
But this was only the begin
ning. The free Exercise was the
Tribe's best event. Then free
exercise man Tom Boyce appar
ently disappeared into the wood
work of the gymnastics room.
The only trampoline man, Ted
Anstedt, was forced by doctor's
orders to drop the sport.
More to Come
By the time the Cal-Brigham
Young tri-meet rolled around,
Pete Gibson was only able to
compete in the parallel bars be
cause of a torn ligament.
But the ultimate blow, it
Exerpt from my personal
Stanford Athletic Coloring:
Book: "See the Coach. He is John
Gilmore. He coaches gymnas
tics. Color him unlucky."
In last year's edition of this
famous book, Coach Gilmore
would have been colored "on the
rise." He had just finished a
successful 6-2 season and it ap
peared that his appointment as
Director of Gymnastics had paid
off. Several top performers were
returning, some were to be eligi
ble for the first time the follow
ing season, and Stanford Gym
nastics enthusiasts — a rare and
devoted breed — were experi
encing what our social scientist
friends call "a rising curve of
expectations." (Some of my best
friends are social scientists).
Unlucky
I don't know what these friends
would call what has now hap
pened to the fortunes of the
gymnastics squad and to those
hopeful disciples. A "descend
ing curve" hardly describes it.
A sudden plummet comes
closer. But I prefer to sacrifice
scientific precision for clarity:
the Indians have just been un
lucky.
Number one: Gilmore started
the season with greetings from
three of the Fates: His team:
two hopefuls did not show up
for school and presumably have
turned in their red tee-shirts for

green ones and are working out
somewhere in Southeast Asia,
and John Retternich, the previ
ous season's Ail-Around man
went to study in Stanford-in-
Austria.
Rules Committee
Number two: the NCAA rules
committee, which changed over
to the Olympic style of scoring,
computing the total of the raw
score of the three top men for
each team, instead of giving
points for placement in an
event. This was no help to the
Tribe's growing depth problem.
Number three: the third
problem came, ironically from
Gilmore himself. He found that
his diligence had produced the
beefiest schedule in Stanford
history and one of the toughest
in the nation.
