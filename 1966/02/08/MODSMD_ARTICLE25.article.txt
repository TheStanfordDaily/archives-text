# Card Boxing Team Beaten By Chico State Fighters
## 
### TOM EDISON Daily Sports Editor 
Facing the toughest competi
tion they have met all year
Stanford's boxing team was de
feated by Chico State, 8 1 /a-4^ 1
last Saturday. The Indians
fought to a draw in three bouts
while winning three.
Tom Jenks and Jim Marlar
were the big winners for Stan
ford. However, all the fights
wore close with Chico State re
vealing a highly trained and
experienced group of boxers
against the equally proficient
Indian fighters.
The actual competition ended
in a tie with Chico State also
winning three bouts. Stanford
had to forfiet four bouts, how
ever, thus depriving them of
salvaging their win-loss record.
First And Last Draws
The first and last bouts ended
in a draw with both of the
heavyweight fighters, Delos
Brown and Eric de Gooyer,
fighting to a stale-mate with
their foes. This was Brown's
third draw in as many fights
he's still undefeated.
Both heavyweight fighters
displayed fine boxing ability in
the final round of their match.
Brown, who in the first two
rounds again reverted to tying
his opponent up and did little
boxing, revealed an effective
left jab in the third that basic
ally saved the fight for him.
De Gooyer employed a free
swinger type of offense that
kept his foe baffled in the final
round. Both boxers used un
orthodox styles throughout the
fight.
Jenks: He's Not
Tom Jenks, who is the only
other undefeated boxer on the
team, had a difficult time
throughout his match in em
ploying his jabbing-while-mov
ing-back style of boxing. He
also salvaged his fight in the
final round. After losing the
first round Jenks became a
little more effective in the sec
ond round and, then, completely
dominated the third round.
Although not of superior size,
Jenks has been effective all
year having concocted a style
that successfully combines a
defense in which he back-pedals
from his opposition, bobbing
and weaving from side to side,
with an offense that employs
sharp, quick jabs.
A Technical Knockout
Jim Marlar's bout began
quick and also ended as such.
In the first round Marlar
showed that he was out to con
trol the fight with his quick,
aggressive offense. After a
good exchange in the second
round Marlar landed one of his
shots to the mid-section of his
opposition that put his oppon
ent down on one knee and sub-

would seem, came last weekend.
Gibson found his injury too pain
ful to work at all. Bob Smith
came down with a bad cold. By
no stretch of definition could a
Tribe exist: Gilmore met Chico
State with a duet consisting of
Bill Fisher and Bob Cook.
Captain Cook and his one
Fisher did a remarkable job,
going seven and six events re
spectively and came back with
85 points to Chico State's 125.
Cook won the side horse and
horizontal bar and Fisher re
corded a personal best in the
Long horse of 8.05.
What does a man look like
who is colored unlucky? In Gil
more's he looks philosophi
cal. Certainly good things have
come from the experience, not
the least of which is the close
teacher-student relationship be
tween Gilmore and his team and
the kind of work an inexperi
enced gymnast like Cook has
put out for Gilmore.
The freshman are promising,
and Gilmore awaits cautiously
and patiently that "rising curve
of expectations."

sequently ended the fight.
Fighting an opponent that
had almost a font height ad
vantage over him, George Bel
lows lost his first bout of the
season in the 156-pound class.
Both revealed* definite ring
knowledge but Bellows' at
tempts to work inside on his

opponent were not effective
enough. The Chico State fight
er was continually using his
reach to his advantage.
Dave Hibbits, although los
ing, and Bill Thomas, who
fought to a draw, also fought
well for Stanford in their initial
varsity bouts.

Fighting an opponent that

Both revealed* definite ring

opponent were not effective
enough. The Chico State fight

Dave Hibbits, although los

Facing the toughest competi
tion they have met all year
Stanford's boxing team was de
feated by Chico State, 8 1 /a-4^ 1
last Saturday. The Indians
fought to a draw in three bouts
while winning three.
Tom Jenks and Jim Marlar
were the big winners for Stan
ford. However, all the fights
wore close with Chico State re
vealing a highly trained and
experienced group of boxers
against the equally proficient
Indian fighters.
The actual competition ended
in a tie with Chico State also
winning three bouts. Stanford
had to forfiet four bouts, how
ever, thus depriving them of
salvaging their win-loss record.
First And Last Draws
The first and last bouts ended
in a draw with both of the
heavyweight fighters, Delos
Brown and Eric de Gooyer,
fighting to a stale-mate with
their foes. This was Brown's
third draw in as many fights
he's still undefeated.
Both heavyweight fighters
displayed fine boxing ability in
the final round of their match.
Brown, who in the first two
rounds again reverted to tying
his opponent up and did little
boxing, revealed an effective
left jab in the third that basic
ally saved the fight for him.
De Gooyer employed a free
swinger type of offense that
kept his foe baffled in the final
round. Both boxers used un
orthodox styles throughout the
fight.
Jenks: He's Not
Tom Jenks, who is the only
other undefeated boxer on the
team, had a difficult time
throughout his match in em
ploying his jabbing-while-mov
ing-back style of boxing. He
also salvaged his fight in the
final round. After losing the
first round Jenks became a
little more effective in the sec
ond round and, then, completely
dominated the third round.
Although not of superior size,
Jenks has been effective all
year having concocted a style
that successfully combines a
defense in which he back-pedals
from his opposition, bobbing
and weaving from side to side,
with an offense that employs
sharp, quick jabs.
A Technical Knockout
Jim Marlar's bout began
quick and also ended as such.
In the first round Marlar
showed that he was out to con
trol the fight with his quick,
aggressive offense. After a
good exchange in the second
round Marlar landed one of his
shots to the mid-section of his
opposition that put his oppon
ent down on one knee and sub-

would seem, came last weekend.
Gibson found his injury too pain
ful to work at all. Bob Smith
came down with a bad cold. By
no stretch of definition could a
Tribe exist: Gilmore met Chico
State with a duet consisting of
Bill Fisher and Bob Cook.
Captain Cook and his one
Fisher did a remarkable job,
going seven and six events re
spectively and came back with
85 points to Chico State's 125.
Cook won the side horse and
horizontal bar and Fisher re
corded a personal best in the
Long horse of 8.05.
