James Reston of The New York Times: Our
doctrine "is that force should never be used for
political ends. We are trying to rule out all
wars. ..."
Soviet Premier Kosygin: "This war in Viet
nam and the war in the Dominican Rep til) lie
and others —you believe that this reflects your
doctrine of peace. I cannot agree *hat you
have the right to kill defenseless people. That is
a doctrine of the right of the strong to kill the
weak. That is what you are doing. . ."
Reston: "This is a monstrous distortion of
American policy. . .
Kosygin: "You cannot say that the United
States is not killing innocent people in Viet
nam. ... I am surprised, that you do not see
objectively what is taking place. Even a blind
man could see what is happening. And if you
speak to the contrary . . . 1 can only conclude
that you are not being sincere. . .
It would probably be hard for any American
to listen to a ruler of Soviet Russia make an
accusation of insincerity. It was probably doub
ly hard for James Reston, an enormously tal
ented and thoroughly sincere reporter. "Kosy
gin . . he wrote in a separate commentary on
the interview, "insults you quietly. ... It is
difficult to comprehend his self-righteousness.
. . . He was clearly right, he seemed to be say
ing, and any sensible person who thought
about it would realize it was true."
Kosygin didn't just seem to be saying it; he
was indeed saying it. Rut is it really so "diffi
cult to comprehend his self-righteousness"? It
may well be argued that no Soviet leader has
ever told the truth, and the evidence for such
an argument extends from Stalin's consistent
treachery to Khrushchev's lies at the time of
the Hungarian revolt and the Cuban missile
crisis. Cynics might even argue that no politi
cian of any kind ever tells the truth, and that
it is the function of politicians to say whatever
is expedient to achieve their ends. Here, too,
there is ample evidence.
Rut despite our mistrust of anything said in
Moscow —and the Communists' mistrust of
anything said in Washington —it is rarely wise
to underestimate one's enemy by assuming that
he is the helpless victim of absurd illusions.
Just as Khrushchev was woefully mistaken in
declaring that the West would inevitably turn
to Communism, we may make the similar error
of assuming that the leaders of Soviet Russia
accept our own ideas of right and wrong, and
that they, being naturally evil, choose to lie
and play the hypocrite in justification of their
evil ways. In fact, it is much more likely that
Kosygin and his deputies do consider them
selves "clearly right," and do believe that "any
sensible person" would agree with them. This
does not mean that they arc right, but that
they believe it as confidently as we believe our
selves to be "right."
With die Russians our disputes are relatively
normal. When we come to deal with Coinmun

ist China's Mao Tse-tung and North Vietnam's
Communist leader Ho Chi Minh, normality
and reason fade away into the mist. According
to Stewart Alsop, Washington's professional
"China-watchers" report that Mao believes a
hostile alliance of Russia, India and the United
States is planning to attack China. lie must,
according to the China-watchers, be a par
anoiac. It is quite possible, however, that Mao
has his own "America-watchers," and if they
analyze an appropriate selection of official
statements, they might conclude that the
United States has stationed 200,000 troops in
Europe in the serious belief that the Red Army
may invade West Germany any day, that the
United States really credits tiny Cuba with the
ability to subvert all of Latin America and that
the 10,000 aging incurables of the American
Communist Party represent some kind of threat
to the republic. Mao, from his own standpoint,
might well decide that our leaders in Wash
ington are paranoiac. More seriously, just as
we like to interpret refugee accounts in Hong
Kong as evidence of the impending collapse
of Mao's empire, Mao's America-watchers
might analyze the reports on Watts, Harlem,
Selma and the various marches on Washing
ton to infer that the American people are on
the verge of revolt.
It becomes obvious that we do not really
understand the Communists any more than
they understand us, and that they may con
sider us as misguided as we consider them.
While it is easy to talk of more tourism and
academic exchanges as means of "international
understanding," the war in Vietnam offers a
critical test of our mutual myopia.
We say we are fighting for the liberty and
independence of the people of Vietnam. The
Communists say they are fighting for the lib
erty and independence of the people of Viet
nam.
We say we will stop the bloodshed if they
will stop their aggression. They say they will
stop the bloodshed if we stop our aggression.
We say we want to negotiate on the restora
tion of the 1954 Geneva treaty, interpreted our
way. They say they want to negotiate on the
basis of the treaty, interpreted their way.
We are convinced we must "teach them a
lesson." They think they are teaching us a
lesson.
As is often true, each side can argue its case
reasonably and believe in it passionately. What
is at stake here is not a matter of moral light
ness but rather a deadly conflict of national
interests. As long as each side demands that
the other side abjectly surrender, the war will
probably go on —for years. As long as each
side takes "negotiation" to mean that the
enemy must confess his sins, there will prob
ably be no peace —for years. Is this really what
we want? Is it really what the Communists
want? Is it what the people of Vietnam want?

reasonably and believe in it passionately. What

probably go on —for years. As long as each

doctrine of peace. I cannot agree *hat you

a doctrine of the right of the strong to kill the

Reston: "This is a monstrous distortion of
American policy. . .
Kosygin: "You cannot say that the United

objectively what is taking place. Even a blind
man could see what is happening. And if you
speak to the contrary . . . 1 can only conclude
that you are not being sincere. . .

accusation of insincerity. It was probably doub

Kosygin didn't just seem to be saying it; he

may well be argued that no Soviet leader has

an argument extends from Stalin's consistent
treachery to Khrushchev's lies at the time of
the Hungarian revolt and the Cuban missile

it is the function of politicians to say whatever
is expedient to achieve their ends. Here, too,
there is ample evidence.

Moscow —and the Communists' mistrust of
anything said in Washington —it is rarely wise
to underestimate one's enemy by assuming that
he is the helpless victim of absurd illusions.

declaring that the West would inevitably turn
to Communism, we may make the similar error
of assuming that the leaders of Soviet Russia
accept our own ideas of right and wrong, and
that they, being naturally evil, choose to lie
and play the hypocrite in justification of their
evil ways. In fact, it is much more likely that

Reston: "This is a monstrous distortion of

It would probably be hard for any American
to listen to a ruler of Soviet Russia make an
accusation of insincerity. It was probably doub

Kosygin didn't just seem to be saying it; he
was indeed saying it. Rut is it really so "diffi
cult to comprehend his self-righteousness"? It
may well be argued that no Soviet leader has
ever told the truth, and the evidence for such
an argument extends from Stalin's consistent
treachery to Khrushchev's lies at the time of
the Hungarian revolt and the Cuban missile
crisis. Cynics might even argue that no politi
cian of any kind ever tells the truth, and that
it is the function of politicians to say whatever
is expedient to achieve their ends. Here, too,
there is ample evidence.
Rut despite our mistrust of anything said in
Moscow —and the Communists' mistrust of
anything said in Washington —it is rarely wise
to underestimate one's enemy by assuming that
he is the helpless victim of absurd illusions.
Just as Khrushchev was woefully mistaken in
declaring that the West would inevitably turn
to Communism, we may make the similar error
of assuming that the leaders of Soviet Russia
accept our own ideas of right and wrong, and
that they, being naturally evil, choose to lie
and play the hypocrite in justification of their
evil ways. In fact, it is much more likely that
Kosygin and his deputies do consider them
selves "clearly right," and do believe that "any
sensible person" would agree with them. This
does not mean that they arc right, but that
they believe it as confidently as we believe our
selves to be "right."
With die Russians our disputes are relatively
normal. When we come to deal with Coinmun

ist China's Mao Tse-tung and North Vietnam's
Communist leader Ho Chi Minh, normality
and reason fade away into the mist. According
to Stewart Alsop, Washington's professional
"China-watchers" report that Mao believes a
hostile alliance of Russia, India and the United
States is planning to attack China. lie must,
according to the China-watchers, be a par
anoiac. It is quite possible, however, that Mao
has his own "America-watchers," and if they
analyze an appropriate selection of official
statements, they might conclude that the
United States has stationed 200,000 troops in
Europe in the serious belief that the Red Army
may invade West Germany any day, that the
United States really credits tiny Cuba with the
ability to subvert all of Latin America and that
the 10,000 aging incurables of the American
Communist Party represent some kind of threat
to the republic. Mao, from his own standpoint,
might well decide that our leaders in Wash
ington are paranoiac. More seriously, just as
we like to interpret refugee accounts in Hong
Kong as evidence of the impending collapse
of Mao's empire, Mao's America-watchers
might analyze the reports on Watts, Harlem,
Selma and the various marches on Washing
ton to infer that the American people are on
the verge of revolt.
It becomes obvious that we do not really
understand the Communists any more than
they understand us, and that they may con
sider us as misguided as we consider them.
While it is easy to talk of more tourism and
academic exchanges as means of "international
understanding," the war in Vietnam offers a
critical test of our mutual myopia.
We say we are fighting for the liberty and
independence of the people of Vietnam. The
Communists say they are fighting for the lib
erty and independence of the people of Viet
nam.
We say we will stop the bloodshed if they
will stop their aggression. They say they will
stop the bloodshed if we stop our aggression.
We say we want to negotiate on the restora
tion of the 1954 Geneva treaty, interpreted our
way. They say they want to negotiate on the
basis of the treaty, interpreted their way.
We are convinced we must "teach them a
lesson." They think they are teaching us a
lesson.
As is often true, each side can argue its case
reasonably and believe in it passionately. What
is at stake here is not a matter of moral light
ness but rather a deadly conflict of national
interests. As long as each side demands that
the other side abjectly surrender, the war will
probably go on —for years. As long as each
side takes "negotiation" to mean that the
enemy must confess his sins, there will prob
ably be no peace —for years. Is this really what
we want? Is it really what the Communists
want? Is it what the people of Vietnam want?
