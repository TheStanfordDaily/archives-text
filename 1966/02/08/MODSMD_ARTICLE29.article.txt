# Two Minutes Of Haight
## What's Going On Out There? 
### Tim Haight 
Jules Feiffer, one of America's
funniest cartoonists, once de
picted the following conversa
tion:
MR. X, "When President
Kennedy said we were going in
to the Bay of Pigs to help the
Cubans overthrow Castro, did
you or anyone you know believe
him?
MR. Y, "No."
MR. X, "When President John
son told us we were sending Ma
rines to Santo Domingo to pro
tect the American citizens
there, did you believe him? Did
anyone you know believe him?
MR Y, "No."
MR. X, "Well, when Secre
tary MacNamara came back
from Vietnam and said that the
war was going well and that we
would be out of there very
soon, did you or anyone you
know believe him then?
MR. Y. "No."
MR. X, "Then what I want to
know is how can the President
and his advisors make decisions
about foreign policy when
they're not exposed to the in

formation available to the gen
eral public?"
In an article in The Daily Feb
ruary 3, Robert E. Stone, a mem
ber of VIVE (another acrid
acronym), said:
"Those people who are op
posed to the war in Vietnam
urge a public debate of our po
sition there. Public debate is
out or order. Inherent in the
system of representative gov
ernment .... is the idea that
there are times when the repre
sentatives know more than the
people. Such is the situation
now."
Mr. Stone's conception of our
government is, to say the least,
wrong, for several reasons.
First, the term "representative"
government means that our
men in Washington are supposed
to be sensitive to how we feel.
How are we to tell them with
out public debate?
Furthermore, how are we to
inform each other of a crisis in
our foreign policy? Whether or
not one feels that Vietnam is
such a crisis, an informed elec-

toratc is essential for an ef
fective democracy.
Where do our representatives
get the esoteric knowledge to
make life-and-death decisions?
At what point is a freshman
congressman converted from
one-of-us to one-of-them — one
of those elected, omniscient gods
on Mount Capitol? Some infor
mation comes from the career
military and diplomatic officers,
certainly. What control do we
have over them? None but the
control we exercise over our
elected representatives.
Mr. Stone seems to be con
fusing the democratic conception
of the elected with the Puritan
idea of the elect.
While certain specific informa
tion has always been kept se
cret. — information such as
troop movements, weaponry,
and confidential diplomatic ma
neuvers — debate on policy must
continue. And when, unfortu
nately, the carrying on of unde
clared wars is part of that poli
cy, that too must be discussed.

have over them? None but the
control we exercise over our
elected representatives.
Mr. Stone seems to be con
fusing the democratic conception
of the elected with the Puritan
idea of the elect.
While certain specific informa
tion has always been kept se
cret. — information such as
troop movements, weaponry,
and confidential diplomatic ma
neuvers — debate on policy must
continue. And when, unfortu
nately, the carrying on of unde
clared wars is part of that poli
cy, that too must be discussed.
Jules Feiffer, one of America's
funniest cartoonists, once de
picted the following conversa
tion:
MR. X, "When President
Kennedy said we were going in
to the Bay of Pigs to help the
Cubans overthrow Castro, did
you or anyone you know believe
him?
MR. Y, "No."
MR. X, "When President John
son told us we were sending Ma
rines to Santo Domingo to pro
tect the American citizens
there, did you believe him? Did
anyone you know believe him?
MR Y, "No."
MR. X, "Well, when Secre
tary MacNamara came back
from Vietnam and said that the
war was going well and that we
would be out of there very
soon, did you or anyone you
know believe him then?
MR. Y. "No."
MR. X, "Then what I want to
know is how can the President
and his advisors make decisions
about foreign policy when
they're not exposed to the in

formation available to the gen
eral public?"
In an article in The Daily Feb
ruary 3, Robert E. Stone, a mem
ber of VIVE (another acrid
acronym), said:
"Those people who are op
posed to the war in Vietnam
urge a public debate of our po
sition there. Public debate is
out or order. Inherent in the
system of representative gov
ernment .... is the idea that
there are times when the repre
sentatives know more than the
people. Such is the situation
now."
Mr. Stone's conception of our
government is, to say the least,
wrong, for several reasons.
First, the term "representative"
government means that our
men in Washington are supposed
to be sensitive to how we feel.
How are we to tell them with
out public debate?
Furthermore, how are we to
inform each other of a crisis in
our foreign policy? Whether or
not one feels that Vietnam is
such a crisis, an informed elec-

toratc is essential for an ef
fective democracy.
Where do our representatives
get the esoteric knowledge to
make life-and-death decisions?
At what point is a freshman
congressman converted from
one-of-us to one-of-them — one
of those elected, omniscient gods
on Mount Capitol? Some infor
mation comes from the career
military and diplomatic officers,
certainly. What control do we
have over them? None but the
control we exercise over our
elected representatives.
