# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Patience Or Push? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This is to register respectful
disagreement with Dean Whit
aker's proposal, as outlined in
The Daily. The dissertation may
not be "the equivalent of a ma
ture finished book" but it should
strive to be, and a great univer
sity ought to be pushing in that
direction rather than "out into
the world." Our best chance of
becoming a first rate university
is by aiming patiently — with
out yielding any further to the
norms of efficiency from an ex
traneous technological and busi
ness culture which is already
crowding in on us excessively (I
am speaking particularly for
the humanities here) — at real
excellence in this essential and
crowning part of the graduate
program. This will come about
in time when potential students
from all over the country get
the word that Stanford trusts
the deep and slow-maturing edu
cational and creative processes.
I'm afraid the punitive fees
would cause many to shy away
from us as is now a patent dan
ger at Columbia.
I do not agree that the "stu
dent who costs the university
more should have to pay more";
will the young experimenter
working with the linear accele
rator have to pay Stanford or the
government pro portionately?
Should the eager ones who come
to us after class be sent a bill?
There are already for the seri
ous students harsh penalties for
taking time to complete a dis
sertation: lower initial rank and
salary, restricted job possibili
ties. Why should we be further
discouraging the effort of even
a few to get some youthfully
ambitious publication out of the
resourceful earlier years? On
some of those few our reputa
tion will largely depend — as
will our capacity to attract more
of the same. We ought to back
them in every way and, at the
same time, admit only those to
our graduate program who are
committed to this way of life.
At best there will be some who
fail to "make it." but that is in
the nature of things. It is mis
taken to tailor our Ph.D. to those
who choose not to meet our
standards and mistaken to make
any move toward a degree-mill
atmosphere.
Professor Whitaker informs
us that he found he worked bet
ter under the pressure of an ex
ternally imposed deadline; many
of us do not. Because of the
great variety of individual hu
man capacities and needs plus
the variety of projects, it is im
possible for one man to judge
how long another should take
for a specific creative act. Fi
nancial and other public pres
sures in a hustling society con
stitute ample molding forces for
most.
The dawdlers, serious and less
serious, even in narrow terms of
efficiency, constitute only a
slight extra burden on the fac
ulty, judging from my own ad
visees. At equal value, a spread
out dissertation hardly takes
more of our attention than a
quickly-written one — if it does,
there is something wrong with
the professor's self - organiza
tion. I respectfully decline to
evaluate my services to stu
dents in terms of dollars. And I
suspect that library costs go on
the same regardless of the hang
ers-on; indeed, in a speed-up sit
uation the library staff would
be burdened more.
I see no reason why the de
sirable goal of lowering fees
during the first three years
should be tied to the punitive
device. Yale, for example, re
quires only terminal registration
during the third year. Moreover
I do not see how the augmented
fees from the later years will
help pay for the reduction in
the "package", since if the sys
tem works as was intended these
later fees will tend to disappear.
Finally, I vigorously disagree
that "a student who accepts aid
. . . has an obligation to get his
degree and get out into the
world." A sensitive parent, for
example, would make no such
bargain with his child: all he
ought to expect in return for

his support is the child's respect
and a promise from him to make
the most of his resources in
whatever way he chooses, by
his own individual lights. A
liberal patron of art, or any
other creative activity, would
adopt a similar attitude. And
this to me is the essential mean
ing of the term: "liberal educa
tion."

• Vive Suffrage!
Editor, The Daily:
While engrossed in the most
recent issue of the university
Disaster Instructions (the one
exhorting the reader to "remain
calm at all times"), I noted an
interesting fact. According to
its map of university buildings,
more than half of Stern, the lar
gest wing of Toyan, and all of
Wilbur, Crothers, and Crothers
Memorial Halls are equipped
with bomb shelters stocked with
food and supplies. Among Roble,
Branner, Florence Moore, and
Lagunita Court, however, the
only "shelter" is the basement
of one wing of Roble, unstoekod,
with several outside windows to
let in fresh air and radiation.
Although I have long been re
signed to the traditional and
blatant double standard at Stan
ford, I feel that this time the
administration has gone a step
too far.

• Graduate Tuition
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's editorial Mr.
Selna voiced objections to the
proposed new tuition scale for

graduate students which don't
seem to be valid to me.
A simple calculation shows
that under the proposed new
plan a student could spend five
years of full time graduate study
with a saving of $55 in tuition
as compared to the old tuition
schedule. A student could "dwa
dle" for up to five years at a
saving.
Mr. Selna concedes that a
scholar "has a duty to get out
in the world." His fear is that
the new tuition schedule would
tend to produce Ph.D.'s with nar
row long-term views of their
fields of study. I can only say
that among students I've known
who have received their Ph.D.
degrees, those finishing in four,
three, and even two years have
generally been the sharpest and
most promising of the lot. I sim
ply don't foresee these people
ending up as "technical pedants"
who will be outdated ten or
twenty years from now.
Finally, regarding the quality
of Ph.D. theses, I quote from
Norbert Wiener's autobiography
Ex-Prodigy. His view of Ph.D.
theses is one with which I heart
ily agree. "It is often supposed
that a man's doctoral thesis
should be one of the best things
he ever does, and should give the
full measure of the man. I do
not believe in this. A doctor's
thesis is nothing but a specific
piece of work by which a jour
neyman qualifies himself to be
come a master of his craft; and
if he does not exceed this level
a dozen times in the course of
his career, he is a very poor
master indeed."
