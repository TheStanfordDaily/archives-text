## Rising Hem Lines Spark Great Knee Controversy 
### Art Buchwald 
A few works ago I wrote about the bosom and how the fashion
designers had moved it from the front to the side. It appears that,
while this had caused some raised eyebrows, the big battle going on
now in the fashion world is what to do about a woman's knees.
The Paris designers have moved the hemline above the knee,

some as high as two and three
inches, and th 6 American dress
manufacturers are not sure it
will sell. I went out to speak to
the man on the street the other
day and asked him what he
thought about this controversy.
Knee Man
The first person I talked to
said, "I'm a knee man myself.
I could sit for hours and look at
a woman's knees."
"What makes a woman's
knees so interesting to you?"
"Well, a bosom is a bosom,
but a woman's knees are con
stantly changing. Every time she
moves her legs, the knees take
on a new expression."
"Do you prefer a woman's
knees when she is sitting or
standing?"
"I think if you're a knee man
it doesn't make that much dif
ference. I like a knee that's firm
and strong and stands on its
own."
Falsies
A second man I interviewed
said, "I think it's dangerous to
allow women to show their
knees in public. There are some
women who have very attractive
knees, but many women might
resort to subterfuge."
"You mean they might wear
false knees?"
"They fooled us with other
parts of their bodies. Suppose
a man was very attracted to a
woman, particularly to her
knees, and she married him,
Then he discovered that instead
of the nice round firm knees he
thought she had it turned out
she had thin knobbly knees.
That wouldn't be fair, would it?"
"No, it wouldn't," I agreed.
"She'd probably have to get

down on her knees and ask your
forgiveness."
"Exactly," he said, "and that
wouldn't do much good for her
knees either."
The third man I talked to was
not even aware that a contro
versy was raging. "I thought
with all those new detergents the
dresses had shrunk. I didn't
think it was planned that way."
A fourth man said, "Look,
mister, I don't want to get in
volved. I mind my own busi
ness."
"But as a citizen you must
have some opinion on this."
"I pav my taxes and I do as
I'm told."
An elderly man I talked to
said, "When I was a boy the
ankle was the sexiest part of a
woman's body. I guess we're
moving up in the world."
Replacing the Ankle
"Do you think the knee will
ever replace the ankle?"
He looked at mo sadly and said,
"Why would I care?"
I asked the final man I talked
to if he thought American wom
en should wear skirts above the
knees.
"I think that's for the Presi
dent to decide. He knows what's
best for the country."
"How would he decide?"
"He would ask Dean Rusk and
McNamara and leaders of Con
gress. Then he would take a poll.
If the majority of the people
are in favor of short hemlines,
then I believe it's to the nation
al interest to support the Presi
dent's Knee Policy."
"Wouldn't this be a form of es
calation?" I asked.
"It would be. But what other
choice do we have?"
