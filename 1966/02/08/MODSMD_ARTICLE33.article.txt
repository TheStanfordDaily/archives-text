## Presidental War Policy Leading Up To Dead End 
### Walter Lippmann 
In saying that under the joint resolution of Aug. 7, 1964, he has
full authority from Congress "to take all necessary steps" in Viet
nam, the President left himself in the position of a man relying on
the letter of the bond, regardless of what it meant at the time it was
written.

There is no doubt that the lan
guage of the resolution gives
him a blank check. But there is
no doubt, also, that when the
blank check was voted on Aug
ust, 1964, it was voted to a man
engaged in a campaign for the
Presidency against Sen. Barry
Goldwater, who was advocating
substantially the same military
policy that President Johnson is
now following.
Therefore, if laws ai'e to be
interpreted in the light of their

legislative history, the Presi
dent is without legal and moral
authority to fill in the blank
check of August, 1964, with
whatever he thinks he ought to
do in 1966.
Objectives and Conduct
It is, of course, impossible to
rescind the resolution of August,
1964. But as a matter of fact the
actions of the administration go
far beyond the original meaning
of the resolution of 1964. This
is the positive reason why the
objectives and the conduct of the
greatly enlarged war should be
examined and debated before we
are led into a still greater war.
It ought not to be necessary
to press this point in a country
dedicated to government by due
process of law. A President who
finds that his powers are chal
lenged by responsible leaders of
his own party and of the opposi
tion would not refuse debate. He
would not pretend that brief
ings are a substitute for debate.
He would insist upon debate and
welcome it. For only by refusing
to rely upon the letter of the
law would he be acting accord
ing to its spirit.
Stretching The Law
It is wrong to keep using the
blank check while many of those
who voted for it in 1964 now
say—and historically they are
indubitably right — that the
resolution does not mean what
the President is making it mean
in 1966.
It is also unwise to stretch
the letter of the law this way.
For the country is deeply and
dangerously divided about the
war in Vietnam, and in the try
ing days to come this division
will grow deeper if the Presi
dent rejects the only method by
which a free nation can heal
such a division — responsible
and informed debate.
There are two principal diffi
culties in holding such a debate.
About one of these we hear a
great deal, namely that our ad
versary will take heart from the
speeches and newspaper articles
and be confirmed in his view
that the United States will not
stay the course, but will pack
up and go home. Undoubtedly
the dissent here at home does
give comfort to the enemy
abroad.
Silencing Not Remedy
But the remedy for this disad
vantage cannot be to silence
dissent. For the dissent cannot
be silenced. It would be a delu
sion to suppose that this dissent
has its source in the minds of a
few senators and of some pub
licists. It has its source among
a great mass of the American
people who simply are not per
suaded that the war in Vietnam
is, in fact, the defense of a vital
interest of the United States.
Nations do not fight indefi
nitely if they are not convinced
that their own vital interests are
at stake. Although the Korean
war began under much better
legal and moral auspices than
did our entanglement in Viet
nam, the American people came
to hate the Korean war. The rea
son for that was that they did
not believe that the interests of
America in Korea on the Asian
mainland were great enough to
justify the casualties that were
being suffered.
National Purpose
The other principal difficulty
in uniting the country behind a
national purpose in Indochina is
that the President's diplomatic
advisers have never defined our
national purpose except in the
vaguest, most ambiguous gen
eralities about aggression and
freedom.
The country could be united
—in the preponderant mass —
on a policy which rested on a
limited strategy and on limited
political objectives. It cannot
be united on a policy of trading
American lives for Asian lives
on the mainland of Asia in order
to make Gen. Ky or his succes
sor the ruler of all of South
Vietnam.
The division of the country
will simply grow worse as the
casualties and the costs increase
and the attainment of our aims
and the end of the fighting con
tinue to elude us.
Policy Revision
The revision of our policy in
Vietnam—the revision of our
strategy and our political pur
poses and plans — is the indis
pensable condition of a really
united country and of an even
tual truce abroad. Gestures,
propaganda, public relations and
bombing and more bombing will
not work.
Without a revision of the pol
icy- of our war aims as stated
by Secretary of State Dean
Rusk, of our military strategy
as approved by Secretary of De
fense Robert McNamara — the
President will find that he is in
a dead-end street.
