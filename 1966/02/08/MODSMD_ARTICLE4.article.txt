# Illegal Liquor Nearby?

### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
"Oh you got trouble my friend right
here in River City. It starts with a T
and that rhymes with P and that
stands for pool," or so warned "Mu
sic Man" Harold Hill.
Fortunately the pool tables at Stan
ford are hidden away in the Union
and the back rooms of fraternity
houses. But there is another menace
plaguing the "younguns" of Stanford
which might have gone undetected
had it not been for the diligence of
"an informal group of Stanford par
ents." Lurking at the doorstep of the
University 120 feet across the El Ca
mino from Escondido Village is the
liquor-serving Stanford View Bar-B-Q
Restaurant.
In prose that would have made the
good Professor Hill blush, the infor
mal and equally anonymous group of
local Stanford parents has begun a
letter campaign urging Stanford par
ents around the country "to do
everything humanly possible" to see
that the restaurant loses its license.
A Special Exception
State law prohibits liquor stores
and bars within a IV2 mile radius of
college campuses, but a special excep
tion was passed by the California
State Legislature allowing bona fide
restaurants to serve their patrons
within the IV2 mile radius.
In 1963 George Jalkson, owner of
the Stanford View, applied for a li
cense to serve beer and wine. And
soon he found himself involved in a
legal battle with the University as
well as the Palo Alto Women's Club.
It was nip and tuck all the way to
the State Supreme Court, which re
fused to review lower court decisions
granting Jalkson his license.
Having received a beer and wine li
cense, he then applied for permission
to serve hard liquor. Jalkson had no
opposition in obtaining the second li
cense.
The anonymous parent group has
opened up on Jalkson's establishment
with both barrels. The letter accuses
Jalkson of not giving the community
sufficient warning that he intended
to apply for a license. However, Jalk
son told The Daily he posted the re
quired notice of intent for several
weeks longer than required.
While Citizens Slept
"Yet—while good citizens slept the
neighboring city of Palo Alto has be
come a fertile ground for the schcmes
of unscrupulous liquor promoters,"
according to the letter, but Mrs. Hen
ry J. Broderson, Chairman of the
Civic Affairs Committee of the Palo
Alto Women's Club, commented to

The Daily she and her group had vig
orously protested the granting of the
license along with other civic organi
zations.
At Their Doorstep
Holding a copy of the letter, Jalk
son demanded to know whether his
restaurant looked like a "haven for
dope pushers, perverts, and sex ped
dlers," as the letter accused. Pointing
to the Sunday afternoon clientele of
young families which crowded his
dining room, he let his case rest. He
did have words of warning for the
unknown authors of the letter but said
he was talking to his attorney.
The informal letter writing group

is also warning parents that this
"tragic first break" in the liquor bar
rier may lead to more of the same.
Attributing "the excellent environ
ment around Stanford," to the Uni
versity's traditional support of the 1 %
mile limit, the letter urged parents to
write President Sterling at once.
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Stu
dents, told The Daily the "original
significance of the quarantine zone is
nowhere near as important toda$ r ."
However, it is still the official policy
of the University. The Dean noted
that the current campaign would
probably result in several dozen let
ters to the President.

ment around Stanford," to the Uni
versity's traditional support of the 1 %
mile limit, the letter urged parents to
write President Sterling at once.
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Stu
dents, told The Daily the "original
significance of the quarantine zone is
nowhere near as important toda$ r ."
However, it is still the official policy
of the University. The Dean noted
that the current campaign would
probably result in several dozen let
ters to the President.
"Oh you got trouble my friend right
here in River City. It starts with a T
and that rhymes with P and that
stands for pool," or so warned "Mu
sic Man" Harold Hill.
Fortunately the pool tables at Stan
ford are hidden away in the Union
and the back rooms of fraternity
houses. But there is another menace
plaguing the "younguns" of Stanford
which might have gone undetected
had it not been for the diligence of
"an informal group of Stanford par
ents." Lurking at the doorstep of the
University 120 feet across the El Ca
mino from Escondido Village is the
liquor-serving Stanford View Bar-B-Q
Restaurant.
In prose that would have made the
good Professor Hill blush, the infor
mal and equally anonymous group of
local Stanford parents has begun a
letter campaign urging Stanford par
ents around the country "to do
everything humanly possible" to see
that the restaurant loses its license.
A Special Exception
State law prohibits liquor stores
and bars within a IV2 mile radius of
college campuses, but a special excep
tion was passed by the California
State Legislature allowing bona fide
restaurants to serve their patrons
within the IV2 mile radius.
In 1963 George Jalkson, owner of
the Stanford View, applied for a li
cense to serve beer and wine. And
soon he found himself involved in a
legal battle with the University as
well as the Palo Alto Women's Club.
It was nip and tuck all the way to
the State Supreme Court, which re
fused to review lower court decisions
granting Jalkson his license.
Having received a beer and wine li
cense, he then applied for permission
to serve hard liquor. Jalkson had no
opposition in obtaining the second li
cense.
The anonymous parent group has
opened up on Jalkson's establishment
with both barrels. The letter accuses
Jalkson of not giving the community
sufficient warning that he intended
to apply for a license. However, Jalk
son told The Daily he posted the re
quired notice of intent for several
weeks longer than required.
While Citizens Slept
"Yet—while good citizens slept the
neighboring city of Palo Alto has be
come a fertile ground for the schcmes
of unscrupulous liquor promoters,"
according to the letter, but Mrs. Hen
ry J. Broderson, Chairman of the
Civic Affairs Committee of the Palo
Alto Women's Club, commented to

The Daily she and her group had vig
orously protested the granting of the
license along with other civic organi
zations.
At Their Doorstep
Holding a copy of the letter, Jalk
son demanded to know whether his
restaurant looked like a "haven for
dope pushers, perverts, and sex ped
dlers," as the letter accused. Pointing
to the Sunday afternoon clientele of
young families which crowded his
dining room, he let his case rest. He
did have words of warning for the
unknown authors of the letter but said
he was talking to his attorney.
The informal letter writing group

is also warning parents that this
"tragic first break" in the liquor bar
rier may lead to more of the same.
