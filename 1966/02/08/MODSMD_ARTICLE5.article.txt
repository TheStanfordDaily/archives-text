# Taylor Asserts Selection Policy
## 
### 
A 1 Taylor, head Wilbur sponsor,
asserted yesterday that the sponsor
selection procedure was a "student
concern" in announcing that inter
views for next year's sponsors will be
gin next week.
The new selection procedure, an
nounced Monday by the sponsors, pro
duced a neutral faculty reaction yes
terday.
"We see our announcement of the
new sponsor selection procedure not
contingent upon any decision of the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion," Taylor said. "The selection of
sponsors is basically a student con
cern."
The Committee on Undergraduate
Education meets Friday to discuss
whether the Faculty Master and the
Committee should retain a final veto
over sponsor selections.
Under the sponsors' new procedure,
neither the Faculty Master nor the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion have a final veto. The selection
committee will choose 40 of the appli
cants and submit their names to the
Faculty Master and the Committee
on Undergraduate Education for
recommendations.
The names will then be returned to
the selection committee who will
choose the final 25 sponsors.
The faculty residents will meet on
Wednesday afternoon to select a rep
resentative to serve on the new selec
tion committee. Joseph Higgins, a fac
ulty resident, arranged the meeting
at the request of Taylor.
"Dr. Hutchinson will probably at
tend the meeting," Higgins said, "al
though this has not been finally de
termined yet."
Dean Wert, Chairman of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education,
had no comment about the new se
lection procedure until his committee
had met.
However, in an interview with The
Daily last spring, Wert commented
that the Faculty Master will have
the "freedom to explore the whole
Wilbur system and to experiment

with the RA's, TA's, or anybody else
to make the system work."
Another member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education, Pro
fessor Donald Kennedy, commented
that "both the sponsors and Dr.
Hutchinson are extremely interested
and properly concerned about the se
lection of sponsors and the Wilbur
system. I suspect the somewhat mag
nified differences between them will
be ironed out."
In an interview with The Daily last
night, Professor Richard Lyman, a
member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education, described
the veto of the Faculty Master as "not
an unreasonable request." The veto
doesn't leave Dr. Hutchinson the
power to name sponsors, only to ob
ject. It is a negative check of a lim
ited kind.
"The result of giving the veto
power to the Faculty Master would
not necessarily destroy or damage the
sponsor system," he added. "The bet
ter part of the ultimate power rests
with the sponsors and their four to
three majority on the selection com
mittee."
Higgins who is also program di
dector at Wilbur, agrees that Dr.
Hutchinson does have the right "as
delegated by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education, to veto spon
sor selections." But the ultimate
authority is of no concern unless one
is challenged by it, he stated.
"If the selection process is handled
properly and the committee comes
up with the criteria which they feel
will meet the freshman program, Dr.
Hutchinson will merely be a tacit
approval," Higgins explained.
Lawrence Thomas, another faculty
resident, feels that "both sides are
not meeting on a common ground.
Sponsors are asking for ultimate
legal authority to pick their succes
sors. This power has always been
under the Dean of Students, although
he has never exercised it, and can't
be given away.
