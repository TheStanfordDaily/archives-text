# Heschel Explores Individual, National Morality
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
Most students think only once in
their life, at college. They adopt their
perspective then, so the most im
portant event for students in college
is acquiring a sensitivity to real prob
lems. Religions help them to strug
gle with these problems.
These thoughts were explored yes
terday by internationally-known Jew
ish scholar and author Rabbi Abra
ham Heschel in an interview with
The Daily.
Dr. Heschel is professor of Jewish
Ethics and Mysticism at the Jewish
Theological Seminary of America
and is visiting Stanford this week as
part of his visiting professorship at
Union Theological Seminary. He is
the first non-Christian to teach at
Union.
Religion can be approached in two
ways, Heschel explained, by studying
doctrines or by seeking to under
stand the human situation in which
we find ourselves. It is a mistake to
start with doctrines. First, it is neces
sary to probe the human situation:
human beings exposed to the reality
of the world, to their own percep
tions, interests, and needs.
Understand Hitman Situation
"By trying to understand the hu
man situation, one can appreciate the
message of religion. Religion gives
an answer to ultimate problems, so
to understand the answer, one must
first understand the problems," he
said.
"We are pre occupied with the peri
pheral and are not trained to face
central issues." Since many people
think only once in their lives, at col
lege, they must acquire there a sensi
tivity to real problems.
"Religion helps one to struggle
with these problems, with the ulti
mate problem of relating himself to
a higher source of meaning, to God.

This is a great art which requires
inner training and cultivation over
a lifetime."
Greatest Challenge
"The greatest challenge to man is
"to learn to be human, and even
more than human: to be sensitive to
that which transcends personal in
terests and the limits of personal
vision." There is a requiredness about
the human situation: "to be open and
to acknowledge the divine dimension
of life and divine transcendence."
This requiredness is satisfied not
by doctrines but rather by the pos
session of elementary attitudes of
"radical amqzement, reverence, a
sense of wohder," he stated. "The
tragedy of our times is that we are
taught only how to recognize labels.
The distinctioh of man is in his crea
tivity which lis stifled by this tend
ency to take 1 he world and ourselves
for granted.'7
Rather than repeat our percep
tions, we should "see the world as if
we were seeing it for the first time.
True living is living in surprise, in
the realization that no two moments
are alike. T'he Bible is the expression
of amazemlent at creation."
Equally important to a theory or
the world is an appreciation of it.
"We will not perish from lack of
knowledge, but we may from lack
of appreciation. Religion is a way of
thinking about man, the world, and
how mai/i relates to the world." he
concluded.
Morally Defeated
Heschel is also serving on the Na
tional Clergy Committee for Viet
nam, a lead by Yale chaplain
William Sloane Coffin, who spoke
at Stafford last week. Heschel be
lieves that "the divine is found in
human relations. Man's task is to do
the divine, to sense His concern in
daily affairs."
"Ai this moment, God calls in Viet

nam. To sit idly by is defiance of
God. The future American position
in the world is at stake there but I
am afraid we are already morally de
feated."
Vietnam is "the most profound re
ligious problem at this moment. The
United States is involved in opera
tions against the Vietnamese which
can seem only absurd, destructive,
and merciless."
He see the function of the clergy
committee to contact congressmen,
and more importantly, "to arouse the
attention of the people. Conscience is
a small voice," he states. "Careless
ness speaks as if by loudspeaker."
Audience With Pope
Heschel is also involved in the
ecumenical movement. He conferred
last fall with Pope Paul about the
Vatican Council's declaration on non-
Christian Religions and is now serv
ing as Hary Emerson Fosdisk Visit
ing Professor at Union Theological
Seminary. He taught courses in Jew
ish thought there last semester and
is spending second semester visiting
American universities.
His inaugural address at Union was
"No Religion is an Island," a recog
nition that "parochialism has ended."
The ecumenical movement, in its
new recognition of need to include
Jews in the dialogue, is based on
three premises, Heschel feels. First,
what happens morally, economically,
and socially affects everyone sooner
or later, directly or indirectly. Thus
what is in Ihe minds of Jews affects
Christians and vice versa.
Second, the Hebrew Bible "is the
most important source of spiritual in
sight and guidance. Thus the redis
covery of its relevance is one of the
most significant events of the ecu
menical movement to date."
Third, although divisions obscure
it, "we are all human beings." Thus

the first step in the ecumenical move
ment is "the discovery of the kin
ship of being human." Second is the
understanding of the religious heri
tage we share.
MutnaJ Respect
Then comes the recognition of the
importance of religious pluralism:
"agreeing to disagree in mutual re
spect for one another. Any attempt
at conversion is an offense to the
dignity of a religious man."
Heschel was last at Stanford three
years ago when he delivered a series
of West lectures "In Search of Mean
ing." The lectures were published
this fall by the Stanford University
press under the title "Who Is Man?"

Vietnam is "the most profound re

United States is involved in opera

can seem only absurd, destructive,
and merciless."
He see the function of the clergy
committee to contact congressmen,
and more importantly, "to arouse the
attention of the people. Conscience is
a small voice," he states. "Careless
ness speaks as if by loudspeaker."
Audience With Pope
Heschel is also involved in the
ecumenical movement. He conferred
last fall with Pope Paul about the
Vatican Council's declaration on non-
Christian Religions and is now serv
ing as Hary Emerson Fosdisk Visit
ing Professor at Union Theological
Seminary. He taught courses in Jew
ish thought there last semester and
is spending second semester visiting
American universities.
His inaugural address at Union was
"No Religion is an Island," a recog
nition that "parochialism has ended."
The ecumenical movement, in its
new recognition of need to include
Jews in the dialogue, is based on
three premises, Heschel feels. First,
what happens morally, economically,
and socially affects everyone sooner
or later, directly or indirectly. Thus
what is in Ihe minds of Jews affects
Christians and vice versa.
Second, the Hebrew Bible "is the
most important source of spiritual in
sight and guidance. Thus the redis
covery of its relevance is one of the
most significant events of the ecu
menical movement to date."
Third, although divisions obscure
it, "we are all human beings." Thus

the first step in the ecumenical move
ment is "the discovery of the kin
ship of being human." Second is the
understanding of the religious heri
tage we share.
MutnaJ Respect
Then comes the recognition of the
importance of religious pluralism:
"agreeing to disagree in mutual re
spect for one another. Any attempt
at conversion is an offense to the
dignity of a religious man."
Heschel was last at Stanford three
years ago when he delivered a series
of West lectures "In Search of Mean
ing." The lectures were published
this fall by the Stanford University
press under the title "Who Is Man?"
Most students think only once in
their life, at college. They adopt their
perspective then, so the most im
portant event for students in college
is acquiring a sensitivity to real prob
lems. Religions help them to strug
gle with these problems.
These thoughts were explored yes
terday by internationally-known Jew
ish scholar and author Rabbi Abra
ham Heschel in an interview with
The Daily.
Dr. Heschel is professor of Jewish
Ethics and Mysticism at the Jewish
Theological Seminary of America
and is visiting Stanford this week as
part of his visiting professorship at
Union Theological Seminary. He is
the first non-Christian to teach at
Union.
Religion can be approached in two
ways, Heschel explained, by studying
doctrines or by seeking to under
stand the human situation in which
we find ourselves. It is a mistake to
start with doctrines. First, it is neces
sary to probe the human situation:
human beings exposed to the reality
of the world, to their own percep
tions, interests, and needs.
Understand Hitman Situation
"By trying to understand the hu
man situation, one can appreciate the
message of religion. Religion gives
an answer to ultimate problems, so
to understand the answer, one must
first understand the problems," he
said.
"We are pre occupied with the peri
pheral and are not trained to face
central issues." Since many people
think only once in their lives, at col
lege, they must acquire there a sensi
tivity to real problems.
"Religion helps one to struggle
with these problems, with the ulti
mate problem of relating himself to
a higher source of meaning, to God.

This is a great art which requires
inner training and cultivation over
a lifetime."
Greatest Challenge
"The greatest challenge to man is
"to learn to be human, and even
more than human: to be sensitive to
that which transcends personal in
terests and the limits of personal
vision." There is a requiredness about
the human situation: "to be open and
to acknowledge the divine dimension
of life and divine transcendence."
This requiredness is satisfied not
by doctrines but rather by the pos
session of elementary attitudes of
"radical amqzement, reverence, a
sense of wohder," he stated. "The
tragedy of our times is that we are
taught only how to recognize labels.
The distinctioh of man is in his crea
tivity which lis stifled by this tend
ency to take 1 he world and ourselves
for granted.'7
Rather than repeat our percep
tions, we should "see the world as if
we were seeing it for the first time.
True living is living in surprise, in
the realization that no two moments
are alike. T'he Bible is the expression
of amazemlent at creation."
Equally important to a theory or
the world is an appreciation of it.
"We will not perish from lack of
knowledge, but we may from lack
of appreciation. Religion is a way of
thinking about man, the world, and
how mai/i relates to the world." he
concluded.
Morally Defeated
Heschel is also serving on the Na
tional Clergy Committee for Viet
nam, a lead by Yale chaplain
William Sloane Coffin, who spoke
at Stafford last week. Heschel be
lieves that "the divine is found in
human relations. Man's task is to do
the divine, to sense His concern in
daily affairs."
"Ai this moment, God calls in Viet

nam. To sit idly by is defiance of
God. The future American position
in the world is at stake there but I
am afraid we are already morally de
feated."
Vietnam is "the most profound re

lege, they must acquire there a sensi
tivity to real problems.
"Religion helps one to struggle
with these problems, with the ulti
mate problem of relating himself to
a higher source of meaning, to God.

This is a great art which requires
inner training and cultivation over
a lifetime."
Greatest Challenge
"The greatest challenge to man is
"to learn to be human, and even
more than human: to be sensitive to
that which transcends personal in
terests and the limits of personal
vision." There is a requiredness about
the human situation: "to be open and
to acknowledge the divine dimension
of life and divine transcendence."
This requiredness is satisfied not
by doctrines but rather by the pos
session of elementary attitudes of
"radical amqzement, reverence, a
sense of wohder," he stated. "The
tragedy of our times is that we are
taught only how to recognize labels.
The distinctioh of man is in his crea
tivity which lis stifled by this tend
ency to take 1 he world and ourselves
for granted.'7
Rather than repeat our percep
tions, we should "see the world as if
we were seeing it for the first time.
True living is living in surprise, in
the realization that no two moments
are alike. T'he Bible is the expression
of amazemlent at creation."
Equally important to a theory or
the world is an appreciation of it.
"We will not perish from lack of
knowledge, but we may from lack
of appreciation. Religion is a way of
thinking about man, the world, and
how mai/i relates to the world." he
concluded.
Morally Defeated
Heschel is also serving on the Na
tional Clergy Committee for Viet
nam, a lead by Yale chaplain
William Sloane Coffin, who spoke
at Stafford last week. Heschel be
lieves that "the divine is found in
human relations. Man's task is to do
the divine, to sense His concern in
daily affairs."
"Ai this moment, God calls in Viet

nam. To sit idly by is defiance of
God. The future American position
in the world is at stake there but I
am afraid we are already morally de
feated."
Vietnam is "the most profound re
ligious problem at this moment. The
United States is involved in opera
tions against the Vietnamese which
can seem only absurd, destructive,
and merciless."
He see the function of the clergy
committee to contact congressmen,
and more importantly, "to arouse the
attention of the people. Conscience is
a small voice," he states. "Careless
ness speaks as if by loudspeaker."
Audience With Pope
Heschel is also involved in the
ecumenical movement. He conferred
last fall with Pope Paul about the
Vatican Council's declaration on non-
Christian Religions and is now serv
ing as Hary Emerson Fosdisk Visit
ing Professor at Union Theological
Seminary. He taught courses in Jew
ish thought there last semester and
is spending second semester visiting
American universities.
His inaugural address at Union was
"No Religion is an Island," a recog
nition that "parochialism has ended."
The ecumenical movement, in its
new recognition of need to include
Jews in the dialogue, is based on
three premises, Heschel feels. First,
what happens morally, economically,
and socially affects everyone sooner
or later, directly or indirectly. Thus
what is in Ihe minds of Jews affects
Christians and vice versa.
Second, the Hebrew Bible "is the
most important source of spiritual in
sight and guidance. Thus the redis
covery of its relevance is one of the
most significant events of the ecu
menical movement to date."
Third, although divisions obscure
it, "we are all human beings." Thus

the first step in the ecumenical move
ment is "the discovery of the kin
ship of being human." Second is the
understanding of the religious heri
tage we share.
MutnaJ Respect
Then comes the recognition of the
importance of religious pluralism:
"agreeing to disagree in mutual re
spect for one another. Any attempt
at conversion is an offense to the
dignity of a religious man."
Heschel was last at Stanford three
years ago when he delivered a series
of West lectures "In Search of Mean
ing." The lectures were published
this fall by the Stanford University
press under the title "Who Is Man?"
Most students think only once in
their life, at college. They adopt their
perspective then, so the most im
portant event for students in college
is acquiring a sensitivity to real prob
lems. Religions help them to strug
gle with these problems.
These thoughts were explored yes
terday by internationally-known Jew
ish scholar and author Rabbi Abra
ham Heschel in an interview with
The Daily.
Dr. Heschel is professor of Jewish
Ethics and Mysticism at the Jewish
Theological Seminary of America
and is visiting Stanford this week as
part of his visiting professorship at
Union Theological Seminary. He is
the first non-Christian to teach at
Union.
Religion can be approached in two
ways, Heschel explained, by studying
doctrines or by seeking to under
stand the human situation in which
we find ourselves. It is a mistake to
start with doctrines. First, it is neces
sary to probe the human situation:
human beings exposed to the reality
of the world, to their own percep
tions, interests, and needs.
Understand Hitman Situation
"By trying to understand the hu
man situation, one can appreciate the
message of religion. Religion gives
an answer to ultimate problems, so
to understand the answer, one must
first understand the problems," he
said.
"We are pre occupied with the peri
pheral and are not trained to face
central issues." Since many people
think only once in their lives, at col
lege, they must acquire there a sensi
tivity to real problems.
