ROOMMATES: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE
You'd think that with all the progress we have made in
the education game, somebody would have found a cure
for roommates by now. But no. Roommates remain as big
a problem today as they were when Ethan Mather founded
the first American college.
(Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the first.
Mr. Mather started his institution some 100 years earlier.
And quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Mather
built schools of liberal arts, fine arts, dentistry and tan
ning. He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 200,000.
Everywhere on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin
motto CAVE MUSSl—"Watch out for moose." The stu
dent union contained a bowling alley, a weighing ma
chine, and a sixteen-chair barber shop,)
(It was this last feature —the barber shop —that, alas,
brought Mr. Mather's college to an early end. The student
body, being drawn chiefly from the nearby countryside,
was composed almost entirely of Pequot and Iroquois In
dians who, alas, had no need of a barber shop. They
braided the hair on top of their heads, and as for the hair on
their faces, they had none. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle
by name, grew so depressed staring day after day at 16 emp
ty chairs that one day his mind gave way. Seizing his vibra
tor, he ran outside and shook the entire campus till it crum
bled to dust. This later became known as Pickett's Charge.)
But I digress. We were exploring ways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly
difficult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit,
give a little.
I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz
'08). My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less
agreeable than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading
whose native customs, while indisputably colorful, were
not entirely endearing. Mark you, I didn't mind so much
the gong he struck on the hour or the string of firecrack
ers he set off on the half hour. I didn't even mind that he
singed chicken feathers every dusk and daybreak. What I
did mind was that he singed them in my hat.

To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my
habits either—especially my hobby of collecting water. I
had no jars at the time, so I just had to stack the water
any-old-where.
Well, sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringa
ding and me, and they might actually have gotten ugly
had we not each happened to receive a package from home
one day. Ringading opened his package, paused, smiled
shyly at me, and offered me a gift.
"Thank you," I said. "What is it?"
"Yak butter," he said. "You put it in your hair. In Ti
betan we call it gree see kidstuff."
"Well now, that's mighty friendly," I said and offered him
a gift from my package. "Now you must have one of mine."
"Thank you," he said. "What is this called?"
"Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades," I said.
"I will try one at once," he said. And did.
"Wowdow!" he cried. "Never have I had such a smooth,
close, comfortable shave!"
"Ah, but the best is yet!" I cried. "For you will get
many, many smooth, close, comfortable shaves from your
Personna Blade —each one nearly as smooth, close, and
comfortable as the first!"
"Wowdow!" he cried.
"Moreover," I cried, "Personna Blades come both in
Double Edge style and Injector style!"
"Sort of makes a man feel humble," he said.
"Yes," I said.
We were both silent then, not trusting ourselves to
speak. Silently we clasped hands, friends at last, and I am
proud to say that Ringading and I remain friends to this
day. We exchange cards each Christmas and firecrackers
each Fourth of July.
