The Children of God
Not everyone has the inside dope on life, not a!! are clued in on the
way things really are. Jesus Christ said, "I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven
and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding
and revealed them to babes, yea Father, for such was thy gracious will."
It is one thing to be created as God, to be his offspring, but quite an
other matter to call him "Father." Jesus Christ said, "Let the children come
to me, do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly I
say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall
not enter it." With scathing words of denunciation he fold the hypocritical
religious leaders in his midst, "If God were your Father, you would love me,
for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord, but
He sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you can
not bear to hear my word. You are of your father, the devil, and your will
is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has
nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tries
he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies
... He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear
them is that you are not of God" (John 8).
All men have been born once. But some have been born twice. It is the
twice born who are the children of God. The Bible says, "To all who receive
Jesus Christ, who believed in his name he gave the power (authority) to be
come the children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the
flesh nor of the will.of man but of God." While God loves all, only the re
newed and reborn walk in direct, personal fellowship with the living Christ.
My sheep hear my voice," Jesus said, "and I know them and they follow
me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall
snatch them out of my hand."
A personal relationship with Jesus Christ is what you have been looking
for in life although you may not know it yet. The family of God, the household
of faith —blood-bought children of Jesus Christ—invite you to join us today by
committing your life to our Lord and God. Why be an onlooker of life?
