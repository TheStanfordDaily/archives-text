Our business no longer hangs by a fiber — cellulosic or otherwise. Far from it. We're
researching, producing and marketing a rich range of products — chemicals, plastics,
paints and coatings, forest products, petroleum and natural gas products, as well as a
full family of man-made fibers —all over the world.
"Celanesc' sales growth, its hefty interests in chemicals and its hugely expanded foreign
operations have already moved it into a big new class," said a CHEMICAL WEEK*
special report.
During the 10 years prior to 1964. sales more than quadrupled, chalking up a growth
rate more than six times that of all U. S. manufacturing industries. And the trend is
stronger than ever, with coiporate sales for 1965 estimated at 23% higher than last
year's record of $701 million.
What does this mean to you?
Since our future expansion depends on our continued ability to develop top-notch
people, it is, after all. in our best interest to bring you along as fast as you can take it,
and give you all the support you need —in your technical specialty or in management.
LET'S MAKE A DATE. Give our college representative a chance to fill you in on
more of the specifics. He will be on your campus within the next week or two-arrange
through your Placement Office to see him. If you miss our visit, drop a card indicating
