# Possony Suggests Discussions, Not Demonstrations
## 
### BARB SHAW 
I would bo very unhappy to see the United
States degenerate into a Latin America or a
Middle East where the university is a political
forum rather than a place of learning, stated
Dr. Stefan Possony of the Hoover Institution
in an interview with the Daily.
I would much rather see, he continued, stu
dents reading about Vietnam and about Com
munism than marching down University Ave
nue.
Pressure Politics
The undemocratic nature of demonstrations
was continually stressed by the Director of
the International Political Studies Program at
Hoover Institution. The demonstrators are en
gaging in pressure politics, Possony said, they
certainly don't think they can change the
minds of men like Walt Rostow in the State
Department.
Intellectual discussions would be more bene
ficial than demonstrations, Possony suggested,
and letters outlining alternative solutions

would be better than telegrams merely stating
opposition to the war.
Are Rallies Best Method?
Rallies too often create hatred, Possony said.
This is deplored later by the organizers, but
"if one goes mountain climbing, he cannot ob
ject if someone falls. Have you ever heard any
one at a rally tell a speaker that his name
calling was out of order and entirely out of a
place in an intellectual discussion?" asked Pos
sony.
Speaking candidly, at great length and with
a slight accent, Possony turned every question
around and fired it back. "Are demonstrations
the best way for a serious-minded citizen to
make his views known?"
Proceeding to the arguments of the demon
strators, Possony asked, "Has anyone e v e r
wanted Communism?" He said that the South
Vietnamese have never been allowed to ex
press their preferences by ballot because Com
munist terrorism has made free, democratic
elections impossible. On this score, Possony

pointed out, Eisenhower is misquoted: he did
not say that Ho Chi Minh would have won the
elections in 1956' but that he would have beat
en Bao Dai.
Will Coalition Work?
Then attacking the logic of those who wish
to withdraw from Vietnam, Possony demand
ed, "What would a Communist in a coalition
government want? Has a coalition govern
ment ever worked?"
Expecting the Communists to be satisfied
with a neutral country reminds Possony of
the story of the woman who saw two monkeys
mating at the zoo. "Stop them," she ordered
the guard. "Give them a piece of candy or
something." To which the guard replied,
"Lady, would you stop for a piece of candy?"
Goal Is World Conquest
This naive attitude toward Communist goals
is, to Possony, incomprehensible. "Have you
ever heard anyone anywhre renounce the goal
of world conquest?" he asked. Possony re
peatedly drew parallels to the situation exist

ing before World War II when so many people
did not believe Hitler wanted to conquer the
world.
What these demonstrators never get into
their head, Possony claimed, is that Vietnam is
part of a worldwide strategic conflict. The
most we could get out of negotiations, he said,
would be a temporary truce. A Communist
cannot promise that he will not try to influ
ence Vietnam because his basic belief is that
the world shoud be Communist.
"How can having a soldier in Berlin or in
Warsaw possibly be in the national interest
of a Russian, he asked, and answered, only
because it furthers the goal of world commu
nism.
Sino-Soviet Split?
There is no disagreement between the Rus
sians and the Chinese, Possony maintained,
on the desirability of a Communist world. But
the Soviets "have been in this business a little
longer" and are more realistic.
The Chinese think that Peoples' Wars are the
way to conquer the world, and the Russians do

not necessarily object, Possony said. However,
he continued, the Soviets know that they can
not hope for a Peoples' War to establish a Com
munist regime in the United States. Possony
said a full fledged war would be necessary and
the Soviets are not ready for this yet.
Vietnam Blockade
No one really knows what is happening be
tween the Soviets and tho Red Chinese, Pos
sony stated, but he thinks that the Soviets
probably regard the Vietnam war as good for
their cause, if for no other reason than that it
diverts the American military.
All-out war on North Vietnam is not advo
cated by Possony. "We must have certain re
straints, but why have we not blockaded, I
mean really blockaded them?" he demanded.
We have been bombing where we will hurt a
minimal number of people and this is as it
should be, but—he continued- our bombs have
been so small in relation to the targets that
the North Vietnamese can rebuild the site
overnight with less expense to them than the
bomb was to us.

their cause, if for no other reason than that it
diverts the American military.
All-out war on North Vietnam is not advo
cated by Possony. "We must have certain re
straints, but why have we not blockaded, I
mean really blockaded them?" he demanded.
We have been bombing where we will hurt a
minimal number of people and this is as it
should be, but—he continued- our bombs have
been so small in relation to the targets that
the North Vietnamese can rebuild the site
overnight with less expense to them than the
bomb was to us.
I would bo very unhappy to see the United
States degenerate into a Latin America or a
Middle East where the university is a political
forum rather than a place of learning, stated
Dr. Stefan Possony of the Hoover Institution
in an interview with the Daily.
I would much rather see, he continued, stu
dents reading about Vietnam and about Com
munism than marching down University Ave
nue.
Pressure Politics
The undemocratic nature of demonstrations
was continually stressed by the Director of
the International Political Studies Program at
Hoover Institution. The demonstrators are en
gaging in pressure politics, Possony said, they
certainly don't think they can change the
minds of men like Walt Rostow in the State
Department.
Intellectual discussions would be more bene
ficial than demonstrations, Possony suggested,
and letters outlining alternative solutions

would be better than telegrams merely stating
opposition to the war.
Are Rallies Best Method?
Rallies too often create hatred, Possony said.
This is deplored later by the organizers, but
"if one goes mountain climbing, he cannot ob
ject if someone falls. Have you ever heard any
one at a rally tell a speaker that his name
calling was out of order and entirely out of a
place in an intellectual discussion?" asked Pos
sony.
Speaking candidly, at great length and with
a slight accent, Possony turned every question
around and fired it back. "Are demonstrations
the best way for a serious-minded citizen to
make his views known?"
Proceeding to the arguments of the demon
strators, Possony asked, "Has anyone e v e r
wanted Communism?" He said that the South
Vietnamese have never been allowed to ex
press their preferences by ballot because Com
munist terrorism has made free, democratic
elections impossible. On this score, Possony

pointed out, Eisenhower is misquoted: he did
not say that Ho Chi Minh would have won the
elections in 1956' but that he would have beat
en Bao Dai.
Will Coalition Work?
Then attacking the logic of those who wish
to withdraw from Vietnam, Possony demand
ed, "What would a Communist in a coalition
government want? Has a coalition govern
ment ever worked?"
Expecting the Communists to be satisfied
with a neutral country reminds Possony of
the story of the woman who saw two monkeys
mating at the zoo. "Stop them," she ordered
the guard. "Give them a piece of candy or
something." To which the guard replied,
"Lady, would you stop for a piece of candy?"
Goal Is World Conquest
This naive attitude toward Communist goals
is, to Possony, incomprehensible. "Have you
ever heard anyone anywhre renounce the goal
of world conquest?" he asked. Possony re
peatedly drew parallels to the situation exist

ing before World War II when so many people
did not believe Hitler wanted to conquer the
world.
What these demonstrators never get into
their head, Possony claimed, is that Vietnam is
part of a worldwide strategic conflict. The
most we could get out of negotiations, he said,
would be a temporary truce. A Communist
cannot promise that he will not try to influ
ence Vietnam because his basic belief is that
the world shoud be Communist.
"How can having a soldier in Berlin or in
Warsaw possibly be in the national interest
of a Russian, he asked, and answered, only
because it furthers the goal of world commu
nism.
Sino-Soviet Split?
There is no disagreement between the Rus
sians and the Chinese, Possony maintained,
on the desirability of a Communist world. But
the Soviets "have been in this business a little
longer" and are more realistic.
The Chinese think that Peoples' Wars are the
way to conquer the world, and the Russians do

not necessarily object, Possony said. However,
he continued, the Soviets know that they can
not hope for a Peoples' War to establish a Com
munist regime in the United States. Possony
said a full fledged war would be necessary and
the Soviets are not ready for this yet.
Vietnam Blockade

tween the Soviets and tho Red Chinese, Pos
sony stated, but he thinks that the Soviets
probably regard the Vietnam war as good for

The Chinese think that Peoples' Wars are the
way to conquer the world, and the Russians do

not necessarily object, Possony said. However,
he continued, the Soviets know that they can
not hope for a Peoples' War to establish a Com
munist regime in the United States. Possony
said a full fledged war would be necessary and
the Soviets are not ready for this yet.
Vietnam Blockade
No one really knows what is happening be
tween the Soviets and tho Red Chinese, Pos
sony stated, but he thinks that the Soviets
probably regard the Vietnam war as good for
their cause, if for no other reason than that it
diverts the American military.
All-out war on North Vietnam is not advo
cated by Possony. "We must have certain re
straints, but why have we not blockaded, I
mean really blockaded them?" he demanded.
We have been bombing where we will hurt a
minimal number of people and this is as it
should be, but—he continued- our bombs have
been so small in relation to the targets that
the North Vietnamese can rebuild the site
overnight with less expense to them than the
bomb was to us.
I would bo very unhappy to see the United
States degenerate into a Latin America or a
Middle East where the university is a political
forum rather than a place of learning, stated
Dr. Stefan Possony of the Hoover Institution
in an interview with the Daily.
I would much rather see, he continued, stu
dents reading about Vietnam and about Com
munism than marching down University Ave
nue.
Pressure Politics
The undemocratic nature of demonstrations
was continually stressed by the Director of
the International Political Studies Program at
Hoover Institution. The demonstrators are en
gaging in pressure politics, Possony said, they
certainly don't think they can change the
minds of men like Walt Rostow in the State
Department.
Intellectual discussions would be more bene
ficial than demonstrations, Possony suggested,
and letters outlining alternative solutions

would be better than telegrams merely stating
opposition to the war.
Are Rallies Best Method?
Rallies too often create hatred, Possony said.
This is deplored later by the organizers, but
"if one goes mountain climbing, he cannot ob
ject if someone falls. Have you ever heard any
one at a rally tell a speaker that his name
calling was out of order and entirely out of a
place in an intellectual discussion?" asked Pos
sony.
Speaking candidly, at great length and with
a slight accent, Possony turned every question
around and fired it back. "Are demonstrations
the best way for a serious-minded citizen to
make his views known?"
Proceeding to the arguments of the demon
strators, Possony asked, "Has anyone e v e r
wanted Communism?" He said that the South
Vietnamese have never been allowed to ex
press their preferences by ballot because Com
munist terrorism has made free, democratic
elections impossible. On this score, Possony

pointed out, Eisenhower is misquoted: he did
not say that Ho Chi Minh would have won the
elections in 1956' but that he would have beat
en Bao Dai.
Will Coalition Work?
Then attacking the logic of those who wish
to withdraw from Vietnam, Possony demand
ed, "What would a Communist in a coalition
government want? Has a coalition govern
ment ever worked?"
Expecting the Communists to be satisfied
with a neutral country reminds Possony of
the story of the woman who saw two monkeys
mating at the zoo. "Stop them," she ordered
the guard. "Give them a piece of candy or
something." To which the guard replied,
"Lady, would you stop for a piece of candy?"
Goal Is World Conquest
This naive attitude toward Communist goals
is, to Possony, incomprehensible. "Have you
ever heard anyone anywhre renounce the goal
of world conquest?" he asked. Possony re
peatedly drew parallels to the situation exist

ing before World War II when so many people
did not believe Hitler wanted to conquer the
world.
What these demonstrators never get into
their head, Possony claimed, is that Vietnam is
part of a worldwide strategic conflict. The
most we could get out of negotiations, he said,
would be a temporary truce. A Communist
cannot promise that he will not try to influ
ence Vietnam because his basic belief is that
the world shoud be Communist.
"How can having a soldier in Berlin or in
Warsaw possibly be in the national interest
of a Russian, he asked, and answered, only
because it furthers the goal of world commu
nism.
Sino-Soviet Split?
There is no disagreement between the Rus
sians and the Chinese, Possony maintained,
on the desirability of a Communist world. But
the Soviets "have been in this business a little
longer" and are more realistic.
The Chinese think that Peoples' Wars are the
way to conquer the world, and the Russians do

not necessarily object, Possony said. However,
he continued, the Soviets know that they can
not hope for a Peoples' War to establish a Com
munist regime in the United States. Possony
said a full fledged war would be necessary and
the Soviets are not ready for this yet.
