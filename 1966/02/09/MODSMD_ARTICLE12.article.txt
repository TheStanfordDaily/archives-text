University of California Pres
ident Clark Kerr believes that
his administrators can now pre
vent major disturbances at the
Berkeley campus.
In an interview with Associ

administration added to the trou
ble during the 1964-1965 student
unrest at Berkeley and that
Chancellor Strong should never
have revived a longdormant
rule prohibiting certain political
activities on campus.
lender new rules adopted last
year, each campus group regard
less of political affiliation may
conduct outdoor rallies once a
week.
The Vietnam Day Committee
challenged this ruling by con
ducting two rallies last week
and according to Kerr is "trying
to produce a confrontation with
the university."
Head of California's nine-cam
pus university, Kerr said that
"looking back now, I can see
that I should have overruled the
chancellor.
"When you take away the his
toric right from people without
consulting them, you can never
negotiate with clean hands. I
knew the ruling was terribly
wrong," he said.
Kerr indicated that six of the
nine students responsible for the
recent VDC violation were non
students. The student partici
pants face a hearing by the new
campus rules committee.
"Discipline — which was on
a fragile moral basis last year
because we didn't have clean
hands — now is on a very strong
basis," Kerr added.
