Miss Henrietta Edeli, Room
Scheduling Secretary reports
I hat rooms which are open are
seldom filled to capacity. She
added that there have been
many requests by living groups
for private study rooms, but
that there were simply not
enough rooms to allow this.
Stickney's and Denny's, two
popular all-night coffee shops,
have announced that they will
no longer allow studying on the
premises.
Dean Winbigler warned that
the increasing trend toward all
night study sessions raises a seri
ous question about whether this
system of studying is detrimen
tal to health.
Dr. Houek, Director of the
Health Service, said that he had
no doubts that ail-night ses
sions, especially when stimu

lated by "goof balls" or "pop
pills," are unhealthy. But, he
added, each ease has to be
judged individually.

At the sound of the bell, students come pouring - out
of the library each night at 11. Some will wander
aimlessly, not possessing" that small jewel of
knowledge that there are study rooms open on
quad lute at night.
