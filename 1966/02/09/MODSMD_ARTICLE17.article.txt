# Gubenatorial Hopeful Talks In TMU Today
## 
### 
William Penn Patrick, the
"underdog" in the three-way
GOP gubernatorial race, will
speak in the Tresidder Small
Lounge at 4:15 this afternoon.
The program featuring the 35
year old Marin business man is
being sponsored by the Stanford
Area Young Republicans.
Patrick, who considers him
self a "progressive" Republican,
denounced the Birch Society at
last week-end's California Young
Republican's Convention in Los
Angeles.
He also made several cutting
references to Ronald Reagon
and George Christopher, the
other two GOP candidates, who
were sitting on either side of
him. Patrick claimed that he
has invested $250,000 in his cam
paign to date and is willing to
invest a lot more to get the "ex
posure that I feel is necessary."
