turner and make-up artist Irene Corey whose other
works are now on display in the upper foyer of
Tresidder Union. The exhibit is titled "The Integral
Make-Up Design" and is the product of the coop
eration of director and designer, In this ease Mr.
and Mrs. Corey. Mr. Orlin Corey Is the director
of the Department of Drama at Centenary Col
lege in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Ls as well-known

as a college theater director as his wife is in her
field. Mrs. Corey's stage designs are almost exclu
sively created for her husband's productions and
she does not strive to "date" the play with her
works as much as to "visualize directoral con
cepts". On the left is a make-up chart of Mrs. Cor
ey's which has been realized, in an amazing fash
ion, on the actor in the following photo. The last
picture is one of an actor playing in one of the
