# TWO YEAR ROTC
## Air Force Shortens Program 
### 
Stanford University Air Force
ROTC is discontinuing the four
year officer training program.
A joint announcement made by
University officials and Major
Harry Matthews, Professor of
Aerospace Studies, identified
the change as a great step for
ward in matching the needs of
the Air Force with the increas
ing demands modern education
places on a student's time.
A two year academic course
and a six-week summer field
training program are being sub
stituted for the present four
year academic course. Junior
and Senior year courses have
been reconstructed and academ
ically upgraded.
According to Major Matthews,
applications for the new two
year program have increased
rapidly over the past two
months.
"The considerable time re
quired to process applications
for the coming fall classes
means that students should seek
admittance within the next 30
days. Acceptance in the officer
training program will be on a
competitive basis," he said.
The changes are the result of
an Air Force study of college
preparation as it effects the fu
ture officer.
"The college student is bene
fitted in this new approach in
that he may concentrate his
study efforts in the first two
years on his basic degree work
and on his adjustment to a ca
reer decision. It also allows
time for the wealth of academic
and extracurricular activities
available at Stanford, such as
the Overseas Program," Mat
thews explained.
Male students with two years
remaining at Stanford as of the
Fall '66 quarter are eligible to
join the Air Force ROTC pro
gram. Those selected will
attend one of the two six-week

field training courses offered
during the summer break. Stu
dents completing the summer
training will participate in six
quarters of academic courses
during which they will receive
$40 per month.

Students interested in obtain
ing additional information about
the Air Force ROTC program
should attend the general orien
tation meeting at 4:15 p.m.,
February 16, in eMmorial Audi
