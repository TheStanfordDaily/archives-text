# Maryland Disciplines Pair For Not Stopping Drinkers
## 
### 
The University of Maryland
has ordered two students from
their dormitory and placed
them on disciplinary probration
during the current semester for
failing to stop other students
from drinking beer in a campus
dormitory
The University holds each
and every student "responsible
for all violations of or conspir
acy to violate rules against
consuming alcoholic beverages
on campus.'
The administration feels that
this is and should be one of a
student's responsibilities. Stu
dents feel that the administra
tion is asking students to spy
on each other.
Although the University re
fuses to comment on the inci
dent, the following story has
been pieced together:
On Dec. 5, these students saw
two other students drinking
beer. Half an hour later, they
decided to tell the offenders to
leave and notified University of
ficials.
Although the students did re
port the drinking, they were
apparently put on probation for
not stopping or reporting the
offenders immediately.
A university public relations
officer said that the two stu
dents "could have brought the
violation immediately to the at
tention of a member of the ad
ministration or they could have
handled it themselves".
A university official, who
wished to remain anonymous,
said that the university rule
was unrealistic and put an un

necessary burden on the stu
dent. Under this system he felt
the student would be forced to
pounce every time he saw beer.
It would be impossible to main
tain discipline and develop lead
ership in this kind of atmos
phere.
A faculty senate committee
ordered that the pair, one a
president of the dormitory and
the other a member of the
house rules committee, be pun
ished.
