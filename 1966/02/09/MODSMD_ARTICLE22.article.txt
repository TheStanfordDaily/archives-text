# Winter Slates Nearing End; Squads Measure Successes
## Whoopie!! 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
With a bare four weeks left
on their regular slates, Stan
ford's winter sports squads
have reached the stage when

their records are being compiled
and their stats tallied in order
to give a premature appraisal
of the season.
In basketball, swimming, wres

tling, rugby, boxing and gymnas
tics the teams and coaches can
see what measure of success
they have achieved thus far, and
calculate what they will need
in the remaining contests.
Stanford's cagers, with a 7-7
overall record, have had a fair
ly eratic season so fur. They got
off to a great start in putting
down a nationally lauded USF
squad in their second game of
the year. However, they subse
quently dropped three in a row,
which anticlimax set the sea
son's trend.
Turnabout —Card Play
A month later the Indians re
corded a fantastic weekend of
basketball against the two pow
erhouses from southern Califor
nia, USC and UCLA. But the
next week they again did a
turnabout and dropped a pair
to two lower-rated Arizona
teams.
Coming into the recent week
end tied with Oregon State for
first place in the conference,
the varsity Indians lost their
share in the last second of their
battle with that squad. The two
teams will meet again this
weekend, with Stanford hoping
to avenge the loss and unseat
the Oregon foes.
The swimming team has
romped through its slate and

now sports a 6-0 record, with
their frosh counterparts at 2-0.
The highlight of their season
was this past Saturday, when
the Stanford varsity squad, the
Stanford freshman squad, and
the Santa Clara swimmers tied
for first place in the fifth an
nual Stanford Relays.
Wrestlers Impressive
The wrestling team has com
piled an impressive 3-2-1 mark
thus far this year. They met
Moffett Field NAS on the mats
last night.
The highlight of their season
also came this past weekend.
The Grapplers wrapped up that
crucial series pinning the UCSB
Gauchos 24-9 and UCLA, 26-9.
Stanford's ruggers, boasting a
3-1-1 record, also lay claim to a
successful season. Their big win,
again taking place this past
weekend, was trampling Sacra
mento State 38-0.
In their short season, the box
ing squad carries a 1-2 mark so
far. They beat the 12th Naval
District and lost to Cal and Chi
co State.
A lack of personnel has put
Stanford's Gymnastic team in
a tight spot. They lost the four
meets they have entered so far
this season.


THIS TYPE of action, (which
depicts the type of space that
is available in the Pavilion), has
occurred several times this sea
son for Stanford's basketball
team. The Indians partook in
this type of rivalry after defeat
ing USF, USC, and UCLA. How
ever, there have been instances
when schools the likes of San
Jose, Arizona, and Arizona State
that have done likewise after up
setting the eratic Indians.

With a bare four weeks left
on their regular slates, Stan
ford's winter sports squads
have reached the stage when

their records are being compiled
and their stats tallied in order
to give a premature appraisal
of the season.
In basketball, swimming, wres

tling, rugby, boxing and gymnas
tics the teams and coaches can
see what measure of success
they have achieved thus far, and
calculate what they will need
in the remaining contests.
Stanford's cagers, with a 7-7
overall record, have had a fair
ly eratic season so fur. They got
off to a great start in putting
down a nationally lauded USF
squad in their second game of
the year. However, they subse
quently dropped three in a row,
which anticlimax set the sea
son's trend.
Turnabout —Card Play
A month later the Indians re
corded a fantastic weekend of
basketball against the two pow
erhouses from southern Califor
nia, USC and UCLA. But the
next week they again did a
turnabout and dropped a pair
to two lower-rated Arizona
teams.
Coming into the recent week
end tied with Oregon State for
first place in the conference,
the varsity Indians lost their
share in the last second of their
battle with that squad. The two
teams will meet again this
weekend, with Stanford hoping
to avenge the loss and unseat
the Oregon foes.
The swimming team has
romped through its slate and

now sports a 6-0 record, with
their frosh counterparts at 2-0.
The highlight of their season
was this past Saturday, when
the Stanford varsity squad, the
Stanford freshman squad, and
the Santa Clara swimmers tied
for first place in the fifth an
nual Stanford Relays.
Wrestlers Impressive
The wrestling team has com
piled an impressive 3-2-1 mark
thus far this year. They met
Moffett Field NAS on the mats
last night.
The highlight of their season
also came this past weekend.
The Grapplers wrapped up that
crucial series pinning the UCSB
Gauchos 24-9 and UCLA, 26-9.
Stanford's ruggers, boasting a
3-1-1 record, also lay claim to a
successful season. Their big win,
again taking place this past
weekend, was trampling Sacra
mento State 38-0.
In their short season, the box
ing squad carries a 1-2 mark so
far. They beat the 12th Naval
District and lost to Cal and Chi
co State.
A lack of personnel has put
Stanford's Gymnastic team in
a tight spot. They lost the four
meets they have entered so far
this season.


THIS TYPE of action, (which
depicts the type of space that
is available in the Pavilion), has
occurred several times this sea
son for Stanford's basketball
team. The Indians partook in
this type of rivalry after defeat
ing USF, USC, and UCLA. How
ever, there have been instances
when schools the likes of San
Jose, Arizona, and Arizona State
that have done likewise after up
setting the eratic Indians.
