# Diamondmen Elect Chiefs
## Rough Necks 
### 
Recently elected captains, Jim
Hibbs and Pete Middlekauff will
lead the Stanford varsity base
ball team into action this week
end against the Stanford Frosh.
It will kick off a 42-game
schedule for the varsity.
Hibbs made all-conference last
year and was drafted by the Cal
ifornia Angels. Middlekauff hit
.349 to lead the team and was
selected both ail-American and
all-CIBA. Middlekauff was
drafted by the Kansas City Ath
letics.
Virtually the whole varsity
team which won the CIBA cham
pionship returns. Seven of the
nine starters are back.
Pitcher Daro Quiring Is an
other all-conference pick who is
returning. Quaring is a junior.
As a bonus there are a num
ber of fine sophomores from
last year's Frosh to help Coach
Dutch Fehring fill in the thin
spots.
Ray Young's 1966 Frosh won't
be anybody's push-over, though
The Frosh have performers at
every position who were at least
one all-Something, and a couple
of pitchers who were all-Every
thing.


STANFORD'S SCRUM comprised
of players such as Blaine Nye,
Randy Vahn, and Tom Fort
mann have been extremely
tough this season.
