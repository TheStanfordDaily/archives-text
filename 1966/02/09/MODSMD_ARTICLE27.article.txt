# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Peacemonger Plan 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
"We want the U. S. govern
ment to get out of Vietnam, but
how do we make the govern
ment leave?"
"By making lots of noise and
excitement."
"How will that do it? We are
only a small minority."
"If we cause enough trouble
and are a big enough thorn in
the side of the U. S. government,
we can make it get out of Viet
nam."
"How can we cause all these
problems?"
"It's easy. By selling all our
U. S. government bonds, by burn
ing our draft cards and avoid
ing the draft by claiming to be
conscientious objectors, by not
paying our taxes, by calling the
U. S. government immoral, by
marching through streets and
blocking traffic, by demoralizing
U. S. troops in Vietnam, by de
manding the creation of a Utopi
an world without war, by flood
ing Congress and the White
House with junk letters and tel
egrams demanding the U. S. get
out of Vietnam, by picketing in
dustries with government con
tracts for weapon productions,
and by calling anyone who dis
agrees with us a warmonger."
"Gee, that sounds great, but
why hasn't it worked?"
"We don't know. We haven't
figured that out yet."

• The Lesser Evil
Editor, The Daily:
At the beginning of the rally
last Saturday at Cogswell Plaza,
there was a picket which read,
"I protest American and Viet
Cong atrocities." After the ral
ly had progressed for a few min
utes, the picket only read, "I
protest American atrocities."
The Viet Cong had been covered
by an "End Vietnam War Now"
sticker.
I think this is indicative of
the misunderstanding on both
sides. Most of the people at the
rally, I'm sure, protest both
American and Viet Cong atroci
ties. We are not blind to the
fact that the Viet Cong is per
haps as evil in its actions as the
U. S. Army. We are not deluded
into thinking that all the guilt
in Vietnam is attributable to
Americans. And we do not hate
American ideals: those are the
very ideals we are trying to see
in practice as well as in theory
It is not simply that we don't
like war, napalm, further bomb
ing, and enforced conscription.
We are ready to live with all
that if it is necessary. It is that
we don't know what "Win In
Vietnam" means. We don't want
to win Vietnam, or China, or the
U.S.S.R. We don't know what it
means to offer to negotiate

peace, when our offer excludes
part of the enemy, the Viet
Cong. We think it absurd not
to negotiate with the people we
are trying so desperately to kill.
What we do want to win is just
a little self-esteem, to know that
the thought of other people
wanting a better life won't make
us run for our guns, afraid of
losing our way of life. We would
rather negotiate than extermi
nate, and we honestly realize
that its the lesser evil, not the
absolute good against the abso
lute bad.

• Hopefully Joking
Editor, The Daily:
It was a joke. It had to be a
joke. Oh please, please, please
tell us it was a joke. Because
what Robert Stone, in "Tragedy,
Hope—Or Farce?" in the Febru
ary 3 issue of The Daily, stated
is that ". . . To question his [the
President's] decisions or to ask
the Senate to do so is to ques
tion the Constitution. This is an
archy." It is difficult to believe
that an article based upon so
fundamental a misconception
could have been written in seri
ousness and good faith. The
Constitution is a document
which has been subject to con
stant questioning, interpreta
tion, re - interpretation, and
amendment ever since its in
ception. Public debate has never
subverted the Constitution, un
dermined the security of the na
tion or unhinged the minds of

our citizens, nor is there any
reason to suppose public debate
on this or any other issue will
do so in the future. Public de
bate is essential if the public is
to be expected to form intelli
gent opinions. Public debate is
one of the basic freedoms guar
anteed by the Constitution. Yet
concerning the issue of what
ever • it - is - that - our - troops
are engaged -in - over • in-
Vietnam, to again quote Mr.
Stone, ". . . Public debate is out
of order." It was a joke, wasn't
it? Wasn't it? WASN'T IT???

• Reincarnation?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to know what
kind of a goddam constitution
this is that can't be criticized
and says that a senator can't
question the goddam President
and his goddam foreign policy
any goddam time he likes with
out having goddam anarchy. We
need another goddam amend
ment.

(Editor's Note: We congratu
late you, Mr. Howells, on your
reincarnation. Notify us. We
need feature writers.)
• Finally . . .
Editor, The Daily:
I'm not a figment of the Wal
ter Army Society's imagination.
