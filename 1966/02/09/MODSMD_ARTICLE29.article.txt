# Today And Tomorrow
## Johnson And General Ky 
### Walter Lippmann 
The Honolulu meeting has a critical bearing on the attempts to
bring about some kind of negotiation. There are several par allel at
tempts now under way—by Secretary General U Thant of the
United Nations, by Pope Paul VI, by a group of unaligned govern
ments as well as various private diplomatic explorations.

The status and the role of the
Viet Cong, or, as it calls itself,
the National Liberation Front,
in the negotiations is the key
problem which must be solved
in order that any kind of talks
can begin. For inasmuch as the
Viet Cong is in military control
of a large part of South Viet
nam, a peace cannot be negoti
ated if the Viet Cong does not
participate in the negotiations.
Two Formulae
There are, I understand, un
der consideration two formulae
for dealing with the Viet Cong.
One is that a reconvened Gene
va conference should consist of
the five great powers — China,
the Soviet Union, the United
States, France and Great Brit
ain—plus representatives of the
North Vietnamese government,
plus two delegations from
South Vietnam, one represent
ing the Saigon government and
the other the Viet Cong.
This formula reflects the ac
tual military situation, for there
are in being two powers in
South Vietnam. Neither can be
ignored in the making of peace.
This formula has been vetoed
by the United States because it
refuses to give the Viet Cong
any recognition as a govern
ment. There is now under con
sideration, therefore, a second
formula.
Conference
The reconvened Geneva con
ference would consist of the Big
Five, the two governments in
Hanoi and Saigon, plus a dele
gation from the Viet Cong. It
may be, as Ambassador Averell
Harriman seemed to suggest in
a radio interview on Sunday,
that this formula would be ac
ceptable to the administration.
It would be very good news in
deed if it were also acceptable
to the other governments con
cerned.
In any event, since we are in
formed that no new important
military decisions are being
taken in Honolulu, the most im
portant thing we need to know
is what understanding the Pres
ident reaches with Gen. Ky
about the format of the nego
tiations which we have asked
the United Nations to promote.
Fanfare
The fanfare of the reception
could mean that the President
has decided to commit this coun
try to liquidate the Viet Cong
and to establish undisputed rule
by Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky or his
successors over all of South
Vietnam. But it might also con
ceivably mean that the Presi
dent is talking turkey with
Gen. Ky and is telling him to
get ready for the readjustment
of U. S. policy in accordance
with the real military prospects
in Vietnam.
What, in short, has Gen. Ky
been promised? That is the ques
tion which will have to be an
swered if the American people
do indeed have the right to know
what they are fighting for and

what kind of war they are in
volved in.
The President's speech of wel
come to the two Vietnamese
leaders was full of righteous in
dignation and scorn for those of
us who still adhere to the long
established American military
doctrine, followed by every
President until Lyndon Johnson,
that we must refrain from be
coming involved in a land war
fought predominantly by Amer
icans against Asians on the
Asian continent. They believe,
as Winston Churchill is report
ed to have said, that we must
not jump into the water to fight
the sharks.
Sound Doctrino
Even Gen. Douglas Mac Ar
thur, who fought the Korean
land war, insisted repeatedly
that the old American doctrine
was sound. This was also the
view of Gen. Matthew Ridgway
and Gen. James Gavin and of
their Commander-in-Chief, Pres
ident Eisenhower. No one needs
to be abashed because he ad
heres to this doctrine. Nor need
he refrain from pointing out
that what is going on in Vietnam
has been demonstrating that
the doctrine is sound.
I do not think that the Presi
dent is a good historian when
he says that those who are look
ing for ways to liquidate as hu
manely and honorably as pos
sible what has proven to be a
gigantic mistake "belong to a
group that has always been
blind to experience and deaf to
hope."
The historical truth of the
matter is that those who think
the President is mistaken base
their conviction on a reading
of the history of our era, partic
ularly of the relations between
the Western white governments
and the peoples of Asia. In this
historical perspective it is Lyn
don Johnson who has broken
not only with the old American
wisdom, but also with the new
knowledge of the world as it is.
10,000 Miles
"We cannot accept their logic,"
said the President, "that tyran
ny 10,000 miles away is not
tyranny to concern us." The
President's critics are not say
ing that tyranny 10,000 miles
away does not concern us.
They are saying that we can
not and should not set up alone
as judges, juries and policemen
wherever there is tyranny on the
face of the globe. They are say
ing that we have enough to do
within the undoubted areas of
our vital interests in Europe
and in this hemisphere and in
the Pacific and that we should
not pretend to omnipotence and
omniscience.
The President's hot and un
examined generalities are a
moral commitment to endless
crusading in all the continents.
As one who has never been an
isolationist or a pacifist, I am
dismayed by the exaggerations
and generalizations which have
been allowed to grow out of the
great debate about isolation.

tion which will have to be an
swered if the American people
do indeed have the right to know
what they are fighting for and

what kind of war they are in
volved in.
The President's speech of wel
come to the two Vietnamese
leaders was full of righteous in
dignation and scorn for those of
us who still adhere to the long
established American military
doctrine, followed by every
President until Lyndon Johnson,
that we must refrain from be
coming involved in a land war
fought predominantly by Amer
icans against Asians on the
Asian continent. They believe,
as Winston Churchill is report
ed to have said, that we must
not jump into the water to fight
the sharks.
Sound Doctrino
Even Gen. Douglas Mac Ar
thur, who fought the Korean
land war, insisted repeatedly
that the old American doctrine
was sound. This was also the
view of Gen. Matthew Ridgway
and Gen. James Gavin and of
their Commander-in-Chief, Pres
ident Eisenhower. No one needs
to be abashed because he ad
heres to this doctrine. Nor need
he refrain from pointing out
that what is going on in Vietnam
has been demonstrating that
the doctrine is sound.
I do not think that the Presi
dent is a good historian when
he says that those who are look
ing for ways to liquidate as hu
manely and honorably as pos
sible what has proven to be a
gigantic mistake "belong to a
group that has always been
blind to experience and deaf to
hope."
The historical truth of the
matter is that those who think
the President is mistaken base
their conviction on a reading
of the history of our era, partic
ularly of the relations between
the Western white governments
and the peoples of Asia. In this
historical perspective it is Lyn
don Johnson who has broken
not only with the old American
wisdom, but also with the new
knowledge of the world as it is.

"We cannot accept their logic,"
said the President, "that tyran
ny 10,000 miles away is not
tyranny to concern us." The
President's critics are not say
ing that tyranny 10,000 miles
away does not concern us.
They are saying that we can
not and should not set up alone
as judges, juries and policemen
wherever there is tyranny on the
face of the globe. They are say
ing that we have enough to do
within the undoubted areas of
our vital interests in Europe
and in this hemisphere and in
the Pacific and that we should
not pretend to omnipotence and
omniscience.
The President's hot and un
examined generalities are a
moral commitment to endless
crusading in all the continents.
As one who has never been an
isolationist or a pacifist, I am
dismayed by the exaggerations
and generalizations which have
been allowed to grow out of the
great debate about isolation.

The Honolulu meeting has a critical bearing on the attempts to
bring about some kind of negotiation. There are several par allel at
tempts now under way—by Secretary General U Thant of the
United Nations, by Pope Paul VI, by a group of unaligned govern
ments as well as various private diplomatic explorations.

The status and the role of the
Viet Cong, or, as it calls itself,
the National Liberation Front,
in the negotiations is the key
problem which must be solved
in order that any kind of talks
can begin. For inasmuch as the
Viet Cong is in military control
of a large part of South Viet
nam, a peace cannot be negoti
ated if the Viet Cong does not
participate in the negotiations.
Two Formulae
There are, I understand, un
der consideration two formulae
for dealing with the Viet Cong.
One is that a reconvened Gene
va conference should consist of
the five great powers — China,
the Soviet Union, the United
States, France and Great Brit
ain—plus representatives of the
North Vietnamese government,
plus two delegations from
South Vietnam, one represent
ing the Saigon government and
the other the Viet Cong.
This formula reflects the ac
tual military situation, for there
are in being two powers in
South Vietnam. Neither can be
ignored in the making of peace.
This formula has been vetoed
by the United States because it
refuses to give the Viet Cong
any recognition as a govern
ment. There is now under con
sideration, therefore, a second
formula.
Conference
The reconvened Geneva con
ference would consist of the Big
Five, the two governments in
Hanoi and Saigon, plus a dele
gation from the Viet Cong. It
may be, as Ambassador Averell
Harriman seemed to suggest in
a radio interview on Sunday,
that this formula would be ac
ceptable to the administration.
It would be very good news in
deed if it were also acceptable
to the other governments con
cerned.
In any event, since we are in
formed that no new important
military decisions are being
taken in Honolulu, the most im
portant thing we need to know
is what understanding the Pres
ident reaches with Gen. Ky
about the format of the nego
tiations which we have asked
the United Nations to promote.
Fanfare
The fanfare of the reception
could mean that the President
has decided to commit this coun
try to liquidate the Viet Cong
and to establish undisputed rule
by Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky or his
successors over all of South
Vietnam. But it might also con
ceivably mean that the Presi
dent is talking turkey with
Gen. Ky and is telling him to
get ready for the readjustment
of U. S. policy in accordance
with the real military prospects
in Vietnam.
What, in short, has Gen. Ky
been promised? That is the ques
tion which will have to be an
swered if the American people
do indeed have the right to know
what they are fighting for and

what kind of war they are in
volved in.

and generalizations which have
been allowed to grow out of the

The Honolulu meeting has a critical bearing on the attempts to
bring about some kind of negotiation. There are several par allel at
tempts now under way—by Secretary General U Thant of the
United Nations, by Pope Paul VI, by a group of unaligned govern
ments as well as various private diplomatic explorations.

The status and the role of the
Viet Cong, or, as it calls itself,
the National Liberation Front,
in the negotiations is the key
problem which must be solved
in order that any kind of talks
can begin. For inasmuch as the
Viet Cong is in military control
of a large part of South Viet
nam, a peace cannot be negoti
ated if the Viet Cong does not
participate in the negotiations.
Two Formulae
There are, I understand, un
der consideration two formulae
for dealing with the Viet Cong.
One is that a reconvened Gene
va conference should consist of
the five great powers — China,
the Soviet Union, the United
States, France and Great Brit
ain—plus representatives of the
North Vietnamese government,
plus two delegations from
South Vietnam, one represent
ing the Saigon government and
the other the Viet Cong.
This formula reflects the ac
tual military situation, for there
are in being two powers in
South Vietnam. Neither can be
ignored in the making of peace.
This formula has been vetoed
by the United States because it
refuses to give the Viet Cong
any recognition as a govern
ment. There is now under con
sideration, therefore, a second
formula.
Conference
The reconvened Geneva con
ference would consist of the Big
Five, the two governments in
Hanoi and Saigon, plus a dele
gation from the Viet Cong. It
may be, as Ambassador Averell
Harriman seemed to suggest in
a radio interview on Sunday,
that this formula would be ac
ceptable to the administration.
It would be very good news in
deed if it were also acceptable
to the other governments con
cerned.
In any event, since we are in
formed that no new important
military decisions are being
taken in Honolulu, the most im
portant thing we need to know
is what understanding the Pres
ident reaches with Gen. Ky
about the format of the nego
tiations which we have asked
the United Nations to promote.
Fanfare
The fanfare of the reception
could mean that the President
has decided to commit this coun
try to liquidate the Viet Cong
and to establish undisputed rule
by Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky or his
successors over all of South
Vietnam. But it might also con
ceivably mean that the Presi
dent is talking turkey with
Gen. Ky and is telling him to
get ready for the readjustment
of U. S. policy in accordance
with the real military prospects
in Vietnam.
What, in short, has Gen. Ky
been promised? That is the ques
tion which will have to be an
swered if the American people
do indeed have the right to know
what they are fighting for and

what kind of war they are in
volved in.
The President's speech of wel
come to the two Vietnamese
leaders was full of righteous in
dignation and scorn for those of
us who still adhere to the long
established American military
doctrine, followed by every
President until Lyndon Johnson,
that we must refrain from be
coming involved in a land war
fought predominantly by Amer
icans against Asians on the
Asian continent. They believe,
as Winston Churchill is report
ed to have said, that we must
not jump into the water to fight
the sharks.
Sound Doctrino
Even Gen. Douglas Mac Ar
thur, who fought the Korean
land war, insisted repeatedly
that the old American doctrine
was sound. This was also the
view of Gen. Matthew Ridgway
and Gen. James Gavin and of
their Commander-in-Chief, Pres
ident Eisenhower. No one needs
to be abashed because he ad
heres to this doctrine. Nor need
he refrain from pointing out
that what is going on in Vietnam
has been demonstrating that
the doctrine is sound.
I do not think that the Presi
dent is a good historian when
he says that those who are look
ing for ways to liquidate as hu
manely and honorably as pos
sible what has proven to be a
gigantic mistake "belong to a
group that has always been
blind to experience and deaf to
hope."
The historical truth of the
matter is that those who think
the President is mistaken base
their conviction on a reading
of the history of our era, partic
ularly of the relations between
the Western white governments
and the peoples of Asia. In this
historical perspective it is Lyn
don Johnson who has broken
not only with the old American
wisdom, but also with the new
knowledge of the world as it is.
10,000 Miles
"We cannot accept their logic,"
said the President, "that tyran
ny 10,000 miles away is not
tyranny to concern us." The
President's critics are not say
ing that tyranny 10,000 miles
away does not concern us.
They are saying that we can
not and should not set up alone
as judges, juries and policemen
wherever there is tyranny on the
face of the globe. They are say
ing that we have enough to do
within the undoubted areas of
our vital interests in Europe
and in this hemisphere and in
the Pacific and that we should
not pretend to omnipotence and
omniscience.
The President's hot and un
examined generalities are a
moral commitment to endless
crusading in all the continents.
As one who has never been an
isolationist or a pacifist, I am
dismayed by the exaggerations
and generalizations which have
been allowed to grow out of the
great debate about isolation.
