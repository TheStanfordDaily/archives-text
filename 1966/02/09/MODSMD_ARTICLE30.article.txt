## A 						Senator Goes To War 
### Pell Fender 
One fact that has become cru
cially evident in the past week's
debate over Vietnam is that,a
military solution, in purely stra
tegic and tactical terms, re
volves around the development
of a weapon suitable for use in
that jungled and turbid part of
the world.
The World War II bombs be
ing used at present are capable
only of devastating decent farm
lands. Napalm is a hearty de
vice, but seems to have more of
an affinity for Vietnamese peas
ants that Viet Cong. Certainly
the use of a nuclear weapon
would not improve matters,
since it might contaminate the
water supply of the American
troops, as well as destroy the

water buffalo (who shall in
herit Vietnam).
The upshot of the Pentagon's
effort to formulate an "ultimate
weapon" culminated this last
weekend in the mysterious land
ing of an Air Force jet bearing
to Honolulu a silver-haired and
golden - toned senior senator
from Illinois. The conversation
that took place in a secluded
grass hut between this senator
and the Commander-in-C hi e 112
went like this.
(C-in-C): "Ev, we've brought
you here to this, the most beau
tiful and tropical of the glorious
fifty states, which is renowned
for its splendiferous natives and
its benevolent sugar crop, as a
gesture for peace."

(SS) "It is certainly my pleas
ure to be here, Sir, and I would
like to let the public know that
I am a politician . .
(C-in-C) "I'll be the politician,
Ev."
(SS) "Yes, Sir. Anyway, as
you know, since you are a poli
tician, politicians are always
more than glad to be of service
to their country."
(C-in-C) "I know, Ev, I am a
politician. I have brought you to
this, the last of the fifty states
to enter the already prosperous
Union to give you a little re
ward for being a politician."
Reward* Few
(SS) "You are a politician,
Sir, and I am a politician, and
you know as I do, that there

wards of a politician are few. So
I am happy to accept this re
ward."
(C-in-C) "Ev, my pappy
wasn't a politician, but he used
to have a little saying: 'There
ain't room enough for two poli
ticians in this country.' "
(SS) "I am not familiar with
that saying, Sir, and I don't un
derstand what this has to do
with peace in Vietnam."
Fassin' and Frantin'
(C-in-C) "Well, Ev, maybe
you've heard about how them
boys in the Pentagon is a fussin
and a frantin 'cause they just
can't think of a suitable weap
on."
(SS) "I am a politician and I
am acquainted with some of the
issues and problems of the Pen
tagon, Yes Sir."
(C-in-C) "Well, Ev, in light of
your recent performance in the
Senate — you know, Taft-Hart
ley and all that, me and the
Bird, and Dean and Mac got to
gether to do a little thunder
bolting, as my pappy would
have said."
(SS) "I am a politician and a
busy man, Sir, if you would
just get to the . .
(C-in-C) "Sure, Ev. So we all
decided that you could help us
to destroy North Vietnam."
(SS) "How is that, Sir."
(C-in-C) Ev, brace yourself.
We're goin to drop you on North
Vietnam."
And so, if you should hear Ho
Chi Minh mumbling that war
makes strange bedfellows, I ask
you to consider another dictum
my pappy (who is not a politi
cian) taught me: "If you've got
a bigger bomb, drop it."

(C-in-C) Ev, brace yourself.
We're goin to drop you on North
Vietnam."
And so, if you should hear Ho
Chi Minh mumbling that war
makes strange bedfellows, I ask
you to consider another dictum
my pappy (who is not a politi
cian) taught me: "If you've got
a bigger bomb, drop it."
One fact that has become cru
cially evident in the past week's
debate over Vietnam is that,a
military solution, in purely stra
tegic and tactical terms, re
volves around the development
of a weapon suitable for use in
that jungled and turbid part of
the world.
The World War II bombs be
ing used at present are capable
only of devastating decent farm
lands. Napalm is a hearty de
vice, but seems to have more of
an affinity for Vietnamese peas
ants that Viet Cong. Certainly
the use of a nuclear weapon
would not improve matters,
since it might contaminate the
water supply of the American
troops, as well as destroy the

water buffalo (who shall in
herit Vietnam).
The upshot of the Pentagon's
effort to formulate an "ultimate
weapon" culminated this last
weekend in the mysterious land
ing of an Air Force jet bearing
to Honolulu a silver-haired and
golden - toned senior senator
from Illinois. The conversation
that took place in a secluded
grass hut between this senator
and the Commander-in-C hi e 112
went like this.
(C-in-C): "Ev, we've brought
you here to this, the most beau
tiful and tropical of the glorious
fifty states, which is renowned
for its splendiferous natives and
its benevolent sugar crop, as a
gesture for peace."

(SS) "It is certainly my pleas
ure to be here, Sir, and I would
like to let the public know that
I am a politician . .
(C-in-C) "I'll be the politician,
Ev."
(SS) "Yes, Sir. Anyway, as
you know, since you are a poli
tician, politicians are always
more than glad to be of service
to their country."
(C-in-C) "I know, Ev, I am a
politician. I have brought you to
this, the last of the fifty states
to enter the already prosperous
Union to give you a little re
ward for being a politician."

(SS) "You are a politician,
Sir, and I am a politician, and
you know as I do, that there

wards of a politician are few. So
I am happy to accept this re

(C-in-C) "Ev, my pappy
wasn't a politician, but he used
to have a little saying: 'There
ain't room enough for two poli
ticians in this country.' "
(SS) "I am not familiar with
that saying, Sir, and I don't un

with peace in Vietnam."

(C-in-C) "Well, Ev, maybe
you've heard about how them
boys in the Pentagon is a fussin

am acquainted with some of the
issues and problems of the Pen
tagon, Yes Sir."
(C-in-C) "Well, Ev, in light of
your recent performance in the
Senate — you know, Taft-Hart
ley and all that, me and the
Bird, and Dean and Mac got to
gether to do a little thunder
bolting, as my pappy would
have said."
(SS) "I am a politician and a
busy man, Sir, if you would
just get to the . .
(C-in-C) "Sure, Ev. So we all
