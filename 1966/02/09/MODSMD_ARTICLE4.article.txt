# RABBI HESCHEL
## Man Must Capture His Humanity 
### JACK TRINKLEIN 
Man must not let the triteness and
banality of contemporary society fos
ter itself on man as a valid interpreta
tion of his position among men. Needs,
especially, have turned on man to en
slave him in their opiate power. Man
must arouse himself from his twen
tieth century stupor and realize the
depths of his inner self, lest he become
inhuman, said Rabbi Abraham Hesch
el last evening in Dinkelspicl.
Rabbi Heschel emphasized repeat
edly the debilitating effect of needs
on modern man. "Modern man is ob
sessed with needs and interests to the

extent that his sense of commitment is
almost gone. Needs are idols."
Against the artificially conceived
and artificially created needs of today
the soft-spoken Rabbi rallied. There is
evident today an "emptiness of the

heart ... a collapse of communication
between our outside world and our
inner self. We don't know how to cry,
how to pray.
We have no friends, only business
associates. Sensitivity is a luxury, but
entertainment is a compulsion.
Man as the sublime creation of God
emerged dominant in Rabbi Heschel's
talk. The Rabbi kept the audience
spell bound as he enunciated his
views on what form man should take
to reach his highest being. "There is
something about human eixstence so
glorious we cannot comprehend it.
"He seems to be limited in who he is
but he seems unlimited in what ho is
able to do. The potential of every

man is much greater than he is cap
able of realizing. With every child
born a new expectation is formed."
Rabbi Ileschel believes man must
respond to the challenges around him.
These are moralistic, life giving chal
lenges. "Self awareness of self is be
ing committed. Human being is being
challenged in the world â€” to be hu
man is to be a problem. The question
is 'How to be or how not to be'. I never
question my animal existence, I only
question my human being."
