### TINA PRESS 
Undergraduates who use psyche
delics such as LSD "on the whole get
very little out of it," Dr. James Fadi
man told an enthusiastic audience at
Roble Hall last night. The first speak
er of a three-day series to lead to an
informed exposure to these chem
icals. Dr. Fadiman teaches psychol
ogy at San Francisco State and
works for the Institute of Psychedelic
Research there.
"There is something about under
graduates, a sense of protection that
doesn't require major decisions,
which makes psychedelics not ter
ribly useful," he said.
"Whatever its therapeutic uses,
LSD is not for the person who does
n't know how to use it. If he wants
to get enough out of the experience
to make the risks worthwhile, it must
be done on a supervised basis."
Psychedelics provides a "conscious
ness expanding," Dr. Fadiman con
tinued, and leads to an extended
awareness, requiring a readjustment
by the user. "He needs a comfortable
safe place, under psychologically safe
conditions, where his reactions can
be studied and understood. If he gets
into the area of the mind that is
frightening, he will need someone to
guide his reactions."
"LSD often can have bizarre psyco
logical effects on the user, giving
rise to a feeling of love for everyone
in the room. The expression of this
is then sex, but the user feels this
sensation must be suppressed. The
repression leads to intense confusion
which the user can't understand,"
said Dr. Fadiman, emphasizing the
need for supervised clinical interpre
tation.
