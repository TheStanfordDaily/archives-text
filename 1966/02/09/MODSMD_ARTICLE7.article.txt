# 'Jack Ruby Trial' Tries To End Popular Distortions
## 
### JANE WELLS 
"Almost as soon as the trial was
over," Associate Professor John Kap
lan of the School of Law "conceived
of" The Trial of Jack Ruby, which he
discussed at the final meeting of the
Stanford Authors' Coffee Hour series
yesterday at Tresidder.
He saw two reasons for a book about
the Ruby trial. "First, any trial law
yer could .see, based on what people
said and the newspapers reported that
this was not a death penalty case; ob
viously something strange had gone
on here. Secondly, we saw a need for
a book which explains what goes on
in a courtroom."
Real Issues
According to Kaplan, "the real is
sues in the trial were: Was Ruby in
sane? If he was not insane, what pen
alty should he receive?" Usually the
defense would have tried to secure a
light penalty. Defense Attorney Mel
vin Belli chose instead the "all or
nothing" defense that Ruby had shot
Oswald while in a pschomotor epilep
tic seizure.
His wish to place the jury in the
best position for an acquittal accounts
perhaps for Belli's failure even to ask

for leniency, Kaplan believes. More
over, even if he had proved that Ruby
suffered from psychomotor epilepsy,
the defense did not show that he was
in a seizure at the time of the murder.
Although he did not predict precise
ly when or on what grounds the case
will be appealed, Kaplan stated—"one
thing is crystal clear, Ruby will never
be executed."
Research
Kaplan and his collaborator, Pro
fessor Jon Waltz of the Northwestern
University Law School, studied tran
scripts of the trial. Then Kaplan trav
elled through the South and West in
terviewing lawyers, jurors, and non
technical witnesses, while Waltz con
centrated on the medical witnesses.
Asked if they had attempted to as
sess Belli's motivations, Kaplan re
plied that the book contains only
documented facts. "As trial lawyers,
as law professors, we were familiar
with the law of libel and the best way
to get sued is to speculate about peo
ple's motivations when you can't
prove it." Although Belli threatened
three months ago to file suit "direct
ly", Kaplan added, "We are still wait
ing."

sues in the trial were: Was Ruby in
sane? If he was not insane, what pen
alty should he receive?" Usually the
defense would have tried to secure a
light penalty. Defense Attorney Mel
vin Belli chose instead the "all or
nothing" defense that Ruby had shot
Oswald while in a pschomotor epilep
tic seizure.
His wish to place the jury in the
best position for an acquittal accounts
perhaps for Belli's failure even to ask

for leniency, Kaplan believes. More
over, even if he had proved that Ruby
suffered from psychomotor epilepsy,
the defense did not show that he was
in a seizure at the time of the murder.
Although he did not predict precise
ly when or on what grounds the case
will be appealed, Kaplan stated—"one
thing is crystal clear, Ruby will never
be executed."
Research
Kaplan and his collaborator, Pro
fessor Jon Waltz of the Northwestern
University Law School, studied tran
scripts of the trial. Then Kaplan trav
elled through the South and West in
terviewing lawyers, jurors, and non
technical witnesses, while Waltz con
centrated on the medical witnesses.
Asked if they had attempted to as
sess Belli's motivations, Kaplan re
plied that the book contains only
documented facts. "As trial lawyers,
as law professors, we were familiar
with the law of libel and the best way
to get sued is to speculate about peo
ple's motivations when you can't
prove it." Although Belli threatened
three months ago to file suit "direct
ly", Kaplan added, "We are still wait
ing."
