# Rush Orientation Begins Tonight
## 
### 
Rush begins tonight for freshmen
and non-affiliated upperclassmen
with a general orientation in Dinkle
spiel Auditorium at 7:30. Featured in
the orientation will be Rob Freeman,
Inter-Fraternity Council President;
David Bell, Inter-Club President; and
Ray Colby, Stern Inter-House Presi
dent.
The assembly, according to Doug
Davis, Assistant Dean of Students,
is an attempt to introduce upperclass
living groups before open houses
start.
The first open house, Davis said,
is tomorrow night for the eating
clubs between 7:15 and 9:30 at the
Club "L".
Next week the 24 campus fraterni
ties will have open houses on Tues
day and Thursday. Eating Clubs will
also be open Wednesday and Thurs
day of next week.
Rush Publication
A second rush publication will be
distributed tonight to all freshmen
in their houses. The booklet features
detailed descriptions of the 39 upper
class living units on campus for men.
Acording to rush rules, formulated
last quarter by an ad hoe student-fac
ulty committee, living groups may
invite as many as five freshmen to
a meal. Contact in Wilbur and Stern
is also premitted between 2 and G
p.m. daily after the first open house.
Off-campus contact, such as par
ties, is not permitted during winter
quarter and constitutes a "dirty
rush" violation. Rush violations are
tried by individual council judiciary
systems and are subject to review
by the University judicial council.
Penalties up to $500 are possible.

Bidding may not take place until
the first Thursday night of spring
quarter, Davis said. Freshmen may
accept a bid informally after that
time but are not bound by it until
the signing of pledge cards starting
April 4.
Davis said this year marks the first
attempt at a rush policy combining
all living groups. He noted that the
two rush publications were jointly
written by representatives of all liv
ing groups.
An ad hoe committee is again being
formed, Davis said, to hear com
plaints about the rush system and
to recommend further changes.
The first rush book, entitled
Opportunity and Challenge, was writ
ten by representatives of the clubs,
fraternities and Stern houses. In the
introduction to the book, President
Wallace Sterling said that "much of
the mystery and confusion about
rushing should be reduced." The pub
lication was supposed to have been
mailed to freshmen during Christmas
vacation. But production problems
caused a month's delay.
Dean's Opinion
The unified rush philosophy de
veloped from the Assistant Dean's
office, which organized the ad hoc
committee. Dean Robert Gordon
noted that the program emphasized
"unity and cooperation."
The book attempts to assess the
positive and negative aspects of each
living group, according to Davis. The
second book, which will be distrib
uted tonight, will present specific in
formation about individual living
units.

living group, according to Davis. The
second book, which will be distrib
uted tonight, will present specific in
formation about individual living
units.
Rush begins tonight for freshmen
and non-affiliated upperclassmen
with a general orientation in Dinkle
spiel Auditorium at 7:30. Featured in
the orientation will be Rob Freeman,
Inter-Fraternity Council President;
David Bell, Inter-Club President; and
Ray Colby, Stern Inter-House Presi
dent.
The assembly, according to Doug
Davis, Assistant Dean of Students,
is an attempt to introduce upperclass
living groups before open houses
start.
The first open house, Davis said,
is tomorrow night for the eating
clubs between 7:15 and 9:30 at the
Club "L".
Next week the 24 campus fraterni
ties will have open houses on Tues
day and Thursday. Eating Clubs will
also be open Wednesday and Thurs
day of next week.
Rush Publication
A second rush publication will be
distributed tonight to all freshmen
in their houses. The booklet features
detailed descriptions of the 39 upper
class living units on campus for men.
Acording to rush rules, formulated
last quarter by an ad hoe student-fac
ulty committee, living groups may
invite as many as five freshmen to
a meal. Contact in Wilbur and Stern
is also premitted between 2 and G
p.m. daily after the first open house.
Off-campus contact, such as par
ties, is not permitted during winter
quarter and constitutes a "dirty
rush" violation. Rush violations are
tried by individual council judiciary
systems and are subject to review
by the University judicial council.
Penalties up to $500 are possible.

Bidding may not take place until
the first Thursday night of spring
quarter, Davis said. Freshmen may
accept a bid informally after that
time but are not bound by it until
the signing of pledge cards starting
April 4.
Davis said this year marks the first
attempt at a rush policy combining
all living groups. He noted that the
two rush publications were jointly
written by representatives of all liv
ing groups.
An ad hoe committee is again being
formed, Davis said, to hear com
plaints about the rush system and
to recommend further changes.
The first rush book, entitled
Opportunity and Challenge, was writ
ten by representatives of the clubs,
fraternities and Stern houses. In the
introduction to the book, President
Wallace Sterling said that "much of
the mystery and confusion about
rushing should be reduced." The pub
lication was supposed to have been
mailed to freshmen during Christmas
vacation. But production problems
caused a month's delay.
Dean's Opinion
The unified rush philosophy de
veloped from the Assistant Dean's
office, which organized the ad hoc
committee. Dean Robert Gordon
noted that the program emphasized
"unity and cooperation."
The book attempts to assess the
positive and negative aspects of each
living group, according to Davis. The
second book, which will be distrib
uted tonight, will present specific in
formation about individual living
units.
