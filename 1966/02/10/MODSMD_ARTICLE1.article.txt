NEW DELHI, India — A govern
ment spokesman dashed any hopes to
day that a letter from President Ho
Chi Minh of North Vietnam two
weeks ago contained any peace feel

The spokesman said the letter to
President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
was a routine one similar to those
sent to other chiefs of state and was
"mostly concerned with restating the
known position of his country."
Except for saying India held a spe
cial position as chairman of The In
ternational Control Commission in
Vietnam, Ho did not go beyond previ
ous statements, the spokesman said.
Ho's letter attacked peace moves as
a "cover for American imperialist war

plan for Vietnam was "the only way
... to achieve a lasting solution,"
sources in knowledge of the corres
pondence said.

• Ho Makes No Peace
NEW DELHI, India — A govern
ment spokesman dashed any hopes to
day that a letter from President Ho
Chi Minh of North Vietnam two
weeks ago contained any peace feel
ers.
The spokesman said the letter to
President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
was a routine one similar to those
sent to other chiefs of state and was
"mostly concerned with restating the
known position of his country."
Except for saying India held a spe
cial position as chairman of The In
ternational Control Commission in
Vietnam, Ho did not go beyond previ
ous statements, the spokesman said.
Ho's letter attacked peace moves as
a "cover for American imperialist war
mongering" and said his four-point
plan for Vietnam was "the only way
... to achieve a lasting solution,"
sources in knowledge of the corres
pondence said.
