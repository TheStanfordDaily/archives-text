# Balbaky Decries LSD For Kicks
## 
### JAN WELLS 
"Some people have claimed that
LSD will be, or is, the answer in psy
chotherapy; frankly, I disagree," Dr.
Yasin Balbaky of the Stanford Medi
cal School Department of Psychiatry
told his audience in the second ses
sion of the Roble psychodelic educa
tional series.
Although people have taken LSD
for many reasons, ranging from a de
sire for kicks to a wish to expnd
their consaciousness or undergo a re
ligious experience, Balbaky empha
sized that its use may be safe only
with close professional supervision.
"If LSD is legalized, if social and
other factors allow it to be experi
mented on long enough by competent
scientists, my hunch is that we may
find in it a drug which influences
perceptions of self and reality in a
special way which may prove a use
ful tool in the context of the rela
tionship between a patient and psyco
therapist," Balbaky stated.
In psychotherapy, Balbaky con
siders that LSD can be "a leverage
or a beginning, but only a beginning
and not an end in itself."
He explained that there is great
variation in the quality of the psy
chodelic experience. "Taking LSD is
like freeing energy. What shape this
energy takes depends upon the per
sonality of the subject and the cir
cumstances in which it is taken. This
has led to many hazardous results,
especially when the drug was used
under poorly controlled conditions."
The series will conclude this eve
ning with a panel discussion at 7:15
p.m. in the Roble lobby.
