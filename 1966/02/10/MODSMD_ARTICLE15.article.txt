# Text Of Wilbur Sponsors' Report
## 
### 
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area

compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in

and idealism of the sponsors.

Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree

whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele

gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit

ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in

additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with

tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi

sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with

has resulted in substantial agree

be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good

Master's ideas and programs.

whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master

there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.

the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu
ment for the veto is a much
more frank arid plausible one.
It does not question the compe
tence of the committee to choose
a heterogeneous group of good
students to sei ve as sponsors.
But it does want to insure that
the Faculty Master retains the
ability to vet :> anyone with
whom he could not work. We
wonder whether this is a valid
consideration a' all. We are not
at all sure th it anyone could
discern during the course of an
interview who would be most
compatible wi'h the Faculty
Master's ideas and programs.
Assuming that this could be as
certained, we still must ask
whether it would be good for
Wilbur if the Faculty Master
were to maintain the right of
veto on ground' of personal dis
approval.
We recognize that the Faculty
Master is personally responsi
ble for the prog] "am. But we also
realize that the Wilbur Sponsor
System has be »n and remains
the most significant single ele
ment in a successful Wilbur pro
gram, because the sponsor, as
friend, confident, teacher, and
challenger of ide as, has a unique
relationship witrt freshmen. To
argue that each individual mem
ber of the sponsor "staff" must
be wholly acceptable to the Fac
ulty Master and /or the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in order to achieve a suc
cessful Wilbur Program, how
ever, is not only fallacious but
also poses a st rious threat to
the very strength of the system.
This strength st ?ms from the in
dividual enthusiasm, initiative,
and idealism of the sponsors.
Motii ation
A sense of id ?alism and com
mitment has boen perhaps the
most important single source of
motivation among undergrad
uates applying for sponsor posi
tions in past y« ars; sponsoring
offers little con pensation other
than personal fulfillment
through workinjj with freshmen
and helping them. The job has
nonetheless attr acted a great
number of appli :'ants, for it has
offered an oppc rtunity for the
creative outlet of this idealism,
as well as an academic freedom
to express ideas, and the possi
bility of very personal involve
ment with the Wilbur house and
its members. Th ? "house teams"
of sponsors have in the past
been deliberately selected with
the idea of divei sity in mind, in
order to enable the sponsors of
any one house to reach as many
diverse elements within the
house as possibl c.
The continuing: success of the
sponsor system results from a
strong esprit <1«> corps and clan
developed withi i each succes
sive group of sp ;>nsors. We feel
that this spirit as well as the
quality of concern for freshmen
has been a dir< ct consequence

of the method of selection. The
most able undergraduates have
applied each year, knowing that
sponsor selection has been the
responsibility of those who best
understand the demands and op
portunities of sponsoring. It is
not likely that this spirit would
continue if selection depended
upon approval by two agencies
of the University authority
structure. It is our fear, a fear
that is increasingly justified,
that unless the principle of auto
nomous selection is maintained,
the entire value and quality of
the system will be undermined.
To argue for an arbitrary veto
on the part of the Faculty Mas
ter and/or the Committee on
Undergraduate Education is to
intimate that some types of di
versity, though acceptable to a
new and broadly-based commit
tee of selection, are unaccepta
ble for wholly bureaucratic rea
sons: i.e. that some applicants
are more likely to carry out the
wishes of the Faculty Master
than others.
And hence the real question
underlying the sponsor - choos
ing controversy: whether or not
an autonomous sponsor - choos
ing process, however constitu
ted, is incompatible with the
Faculty Master Plan. We have
argued above that de facto auto
nomy of the choosing committee
can be granted, and has been
granted in the past, despite irre
vocable de-jure authority over
the sponsor system. We have
also argued that this very de fac
to autonomy of the choosing
group, and indeed the autonomy
of the sponsor's entire role as
he conceives it, has been the
greatest single reason for the
success of the sponsor system,
i.e. the factor that marks no
sponsors rather than prefects or
R.A.'s.
Negative Effects
To insist on abolishing de fac
to autonomy of sponsor choos
ing in spite of a new and more
diversified choosing committee
can have only two effects, both
negative, on the selection proc
ess and the sponsor system. It
will first discourage desireable
candidates, for such a veto im
plies intolerance and an unwill

ingness to accept the tenet that
diversity of approach is a nec
essary element in the education
al process. Further, the Faculty
Master System already comes
under criticism for having a
suspected desire to eliminate
certain dissident elements in the
Wilbur Program. The desire of
Mr. Hutchinson and the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion to maintain an arbitrary
veto power only reinforces this
opinion. We argue that intelli
gent and idealistic students
have little enthusiasm for being
"staff members", expected to
take only approved approaches
in establishing house programs.
The prospect of administrating
a predetermined Wilbur Pro
gram is not an attractive one,
and it will prevent a large num
ber of candidates from applying
at all.
Secondly, an arbitrary veto
power over the selections made
by the choosing committee is
not only inimical to the very
concept of that committee as a
"selection" committee, but also
makes a sham of the value of
having a "representative" com
mittee at all. If Dr. Hutchinson,
or any member of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, would like to serve as a vot
ing member of the committee,
this would be welcomed by all
as an indication that points of
view other than his own were
considered in more than a token
sense, i.e. were seriously enter
tained as educational possibili
ties.
But perhaps they genuinely
are not. Perhaps as the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation conceives the role of the
Faculty Master, he would be
seriously crippled by not having
the veto.
Complimentary
Sponsors have felt throughout
the year that the Faculty Mas
ter System and the individual
efforts of sponsor teams in Wil
bur have not been inimical to
one another, but rather compli
mentary. And since sponsor ap
plicants will henceforth know
that they will be working under
the Faculty Master, as this
year's group did know at the

time of selection, it is not un
reasonable to expect equal or
greater success with next year's
group. But admittedly there is
at present some friction between
sponsors and Faculty Master.
The sponsors cherish an educa
tional philosophy which sees the
Wilbur community as a place
where education broadly con
strued takes place: where an in
dividual freshman can be pro
vided with every opportunity to
increase his self-awareness and
his desire to learn, and where he
can be almost literally "led out
of himself."
The Faculty Master Program
seems more oriented toward for
mal learning. Nevitt Sanford has
suggested that "education that
aims at the inculcation of skills
and knowledge respecting the
material, social, and cultural
worlds may be distinguished
from education that has as its
aim the fullest possible develop
ment of the individual"; perhaps
there are some grounds for say
ing that the Faculty Master Sys
tem is really concerned with im
plementing education in the first
sense, while sponsoring is more
concerned with the second. This
might account for what appears
to be lack of rapport between
Dr. Hutchinson and the spon
sors this year as well as explain
ing a variety of misunderstand
ings resulting from differing ed
ucational assumptions.
Both Forms
Whatever the case, we envi
sion Wilbur as a place where
both forms of education can
take place. And we cannot see
how any kind of arbitrary home
geneity that the Faculty Mas
ter's veto might impose upon
the sponsor body could be as
sistance. One of the most excit
ing aspects of the Wilbur Pro
gram as it exists is that many
educational philosophies are ap
plied at the same time with rea
sonable success. There is a joint
effort, yearly renewed by all
those participating in Wilbur, to
discover what Wilbur is.
Hence the second argument
rests on the erroneous assump
tion that Wilbur can only give
the Faculty Master a chance by
allowing him to impose his will
and his educational views on all
aspects of the program. Such a
plan would be the quickest way
not to give him a chance at all.
We feel reasonably sure that he
would not want this sort of ar
bitrary power anyway, however,
and we think he would agree
that if he did want such power
it would be far easier to estab
lish a Resident Assistant Pro

gram than to work out some
sophisticated criteria of his own
for vetoing applicants.
The third argument mentioned
has quite a different thrust. It
suggests that if some outside
authority, as in the departmen
tal analogy, has a veto power
over the final decision of the
committee, it serves two benefi
cial purposes. First, whether
or not the veto is used, the com
mittee is proportionately more
careful in its initial delibera
tions. Second, if the veto is used,
it is often used wisely, as the
only "check" that the authority
structure has upon the decision
of the committee.
Holding A Stick
But the psychology of holding
a stick over someone can as
easily result in resentful or un
imaginative behavior as result
in anything else. And the de
partmental analogy breaks
down because the representa
tive nature of the new commit
tee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members
provide adequate checks and
balances within the committee
itself. It is also hardly fair to
say that the choosing group, al
ready comprised of students and
faculty, should have a check
put upon it while the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, without student represen
tation, has none. We desire that
final authority rest with the
broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
The sponsors' discussion with
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert
on the weekend of January 21
has resulted in substantial agree
ment on all but one aspect of
next year's sponsor selection
process. The one remaining area
of controversy is a problem in
the abstract; it centers on
whether or not the Committee
on Undergraduate Education,
and the Faculty Master as its ap
pointee, should reserve the right
to veto or overrule the final de
cision of the sponsor selection
committee.
There were three clear argu
ments put forth in favor of main
taining such a right of veto.
The first, and in many ways
the strongest, was pointed out
by Dr. Wert. He said that the
question of legal autonomy of
the sponsor selection group was
simply not something which
could be negotiated, i.e. that the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education would not agree to
complete autonomy for the
choosing committee because it
legally could not. Dr. Wert indi
cated* that because authority in
the University resided primarily
in the faculty, and because par
ticular authority over the Wil
bur Sponsor system resided in
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, it would be ab
solutely impossible for the Com
mittee, even if it so desired, to
relinquish all responsibility for
the Sponsor Program. Further
more, since the Committee
would always be held accounta
ble for what occurred in Wilbur,
it was natural that it should
want to have a say in sponsor
selection.
This first argument states
that the Committee on Under
graduate Education will always
have a veto over events at Wil
bur by dint of the very struc
ture of the University. Hence
any argument about its right to
a veto must he a more general
argument about the structure
of the University if it is to have
any meaning at all. This argu
ment also suggests that because
of the authority and responsibil
ity implicitly held by the Com
mittee, it should have some di
rect control over the selection of
sponsors.
Choosing Staff
The second argument in favor
of the veto was one put forth
during the December 14 meeting
of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. At that
time, it was apparently felt that
if the new Faculty Master Plan
was to work at all, it was imper
ative that the Faculty Master
himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his
own staff. A loose confederacy
of Wilbur houses had proven un
manageable in the past, and the
only forseeable way in which
one man could alter this state of
affairs, and genuinely imple
ment a drive for greater academ
ic input into Wilbur, would be
through the close cooperation of
a trusted staff of sponsors and
faculty residents.
This staff surely should be the
Faculty Master's to choose;
therefore, the Master would
have to be invested by the Com
mittee with the power to choose
sponsors, or at least have the
ability to veto individual selec
tions. With such a procedure he
might be sure of procuring un
dergraduates with whom he
could work closely next year.
This argument, as it was heard
in the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, says that the
veto is the obvious right of the
Faculty Master if it is delegated
to him by the Committee; in
deed, the veto must be so dele
gated and he must maintain it if
he is to implement his program
at Wilbur.
Department Analogy
The third argument in favor
of the veto was proposed last
weekend by Dr. Hutchinson and
we shall call it the argument
from departmental analogy. He
maintained that regardless of
the source of right, or power,
or authority, there remained a
great deal of wisdom in having
a system whereby ultimate au
thority resided elsewhere than
in the committee itself. The ap
pointments of every department
in the University's academic fac
ulty are referred finally to the
President's office, after previous
ly passing through an elaborate
set of screening committees.
Instances are known in which
departmental promotions or
choices for appointment have
been turned down from above.
While initially causing consider
able anger or dismay, these re
fusals have proven wise in his
torical perspective because a bet
ter man was subsequently found
for the job. His argument con
cluded that any choosing com
mittee would be more conscien
tious in its initial deliberations
if it knew that it would have to
do a good job or else suffer the
invalidation of its selections.
It would hopefully therefore
never have to be overruled.
Opposing The Veto
The above three arguments
were the strongest cases given
for maintaining a faculty veto
over the sponsor selection com
mittee. They are set forth in or
der to provide context for our
own case and make clear our
reasons for strongly opposing
the veto.

In considering Dr. Wert's ar
gument, we have never meant to
suggest that the Committee on
Undergraduate Education relin
quish all authority over the
sponsor program. We recognize
that the sponsor program exists
at the pleasure of the faculty.
But sponsor selection is only
one aspect of the sponsor sys
tem, and the question we are
concerned with here is how we
can improve a particular func
tion of that system. Clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the
choosing committee itself. It has
been in the past. The real ques
tion here is not legal, but educa
tional.
Seven People
Which selection procedure
might work best? What is the
wisdom of the veto? It has been
encouraging to see the measure
of real agreement and under
standing that has gone into for
mulating the composition of
next year's selection committee.
All parties seem to have agreed
that seven people — four spon
sors, one student at large, one
freshman, and one faculty resi
dent — shall serve on the com
mittee, with Dr. Hutchinson act
ing in an advisory capacity. This
committee has a genuine diver
sity of representatives, each
bringing his point of view to
bear. It effectively avoids both
of the following unwise ex
tremes:
a) the assumption of aboslute
autonomy of selection (i.e. with
out consultation) by the Facul
ty Master and/or the Committee
on Undergraduate Education, or
b) the assumption of abso
lute autonomy of selection by a
committee composed solely of
sponsors.
The first has evidently failed
in the past, if we are to com
pare the Resident Assistant Pro
gram to the sponsor system.
But by the same token the latter
has given rise to claims of in
breeding and sponsorial in
groupism, because it neglects
the viewpoints of freshmen, Wil
bur alumni other than sponsors,
Faculty residents, and now the
Faculty Master as well.
Consistency
The second argument for the
veto states that because the fac
ulty as a whole, and the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion in particular, is concerned
with increasing the "academic
input" into Wilbur Hall, they
should maintain a veto over
sponsor-choosing so that they
can be sure of getting the sort
of person as a sponsor who will
assist them in this aim. But is
this argument consistent with
past actions?
If the faculty is genuinely
concerned about events at Wil
bur, they should want to par
ticipate directly in the Wilbur
Program in one way or another.
They might become faculty resi
dents, or faculty associates, or
teach freshman seminars in Wil
bur, or involve themselves in
myriad other ways with the Wil
bur System, thereby bringing
themselves into direct contact
with freshmen. Faculty involve
ment or interest in Wilbur has
never been sufficiently volun
tary; it appears there is an aver
sion to frequent, regular contact
in Wilbur. We suggest greater
individual participation by aca
demicians as the most signifi
cant single way to increase
"academic input." And if a mem
ber of the Committee on Under
graduate Education wanted to
participate as a voting member
of the sponsor selection commit
tee, we would rather have him
do that, and have him put in
100 thoughtful hours along with
the other representatives to that
committee in direct confronta
tion with candidates for spon
sor positions, than have him
feel that he was making a real
contribution to Wilbur by com
ing up with some criteria in ab
stracto for vetoing a sponsor, or
an entire group of sponsors.
Criteria
And more important still, what
might be the criteria for such a
veto? In what way could a veto
be used to insure greater "aca
demic input" in Wilbur? There
are only two possible ways.
Perhaps one might insist upon

This report, written and unanimously approved by the 25 sponsors of Wilbur Hall, de
lineates the arguments given in support of granting Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right to reject any individual chosen by the sponsor choosing committee, and presents
the sponsorV replies to those reasons. A statement explaining the University administra
tion's position in the dispute will be released to The Daily and printed early next week.

a minimum G.P.A. for all spon
sors. But it is tenuous indeed to
argue that if a sponsor has a
certain gradepoint he will auto
matically have the ability to in
still freshmen with academic fer
vor!, or the emp£i thy to relate per
sonally with th' >m. Quite the op
posite might well be the case:
witness the number of promi
nent researchers who are not
good teachers. Or perhaps one
would want to insure that, for
instance, there was not a block
of Humanities and Social Sci
ence majors z.mong the new
sponsors to the exclusion of ma
jors in the Natural Sciences.
This would be an undesireable
situation indeed but the widely
representative composition of
the choosing conmittee, and the
Faculty Master's own advisory
capacity, hardly make it a likely
situation. We aire sure that any
committee composed as the com
mittee is to be next year would
be careful to avoid such prob
lems of imbala ice.
'Absolu :e Power'
The "absolute power" argu

It does not question the compe

broadly-based committee, which
in our estimation will have max
imum competence to make de
cisions about next year's spon
sors. The authority structure of
the University is a pyramid, but
there are no reasons why final
authority over sponsor selection
cannot be wisely delegated to the
selection committee.
We would suggest that the
Sponsor Selection Committee
choose a group of 40 undergrad
uate men as a tentative list of
sponsors for next year, and then
submit that list to the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Educa
tion and/or the Dean's Office
via the Faculty Master as an
initial step. There might be some
additional information about
those selected which would be
useful to the committee in their
final deliberations, and the se
lection committee would no
doubt also be interested in the
opinions of the members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education about individual can
didates. Then the list, with all
additional information and rec
ommendations, would return to
the selection committee for fi
nal choice of 25 sponsors.
