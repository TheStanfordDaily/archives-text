The Stanford Quarter-in-
Washington Committee is seek
ing volunteers to help plan a
possible Stanford extension pro
gram in Washington, D.C.
The program, for undergrad
uate social scientists, might be
integrated with a similar pro
gram at American University.
Students could spend a semes
ter in Washington, carrying on
work-research projects as well
as academic study for credit.
A student committee to in
vestigate these possibilities was
formed last quarter and received
favorable support from the
Political Science Department
and the Administration. The
present suggestions now must
be evaluated.
Students interested in joining
the committee to work on the
proposals with members of the
faculty and Administration,
should sign up today on the bul
letin board of the lIR loft, in
Tresidder.
An informal meeting for all in
terested students will be held
tomorrow in Room 271 of Tre
sidder at 4 p.m.
