New suicide-foiling screens
make re-opening of Stanford's
local monument, Hoover Tower,
probable for late spring, accord
ing to Robert Miller, associate
director of University relations.
An article in the Palo Alto
Times reports that the new
screens designed by Kump
Associates of Palo Alto are ver
tical metal bars running the
full height of the observation
openings and conforming to
their arched shape at the top.
The design is planned to
cause minimal interference
with the panoramic view of the
mid-Peninsula area, long con
sidered one of the Tower's
greatest attractions for Stan
ford visitors and students.
Use of the observation deck
was first restricted in January,
1965, after the suicide of Stan
ley Theodore Horwitz, a gradu
ate student in philosophy. After
this suicide, the first in the
Tower' 25-year history, no one
was allowed alone on the obser
vation deck, and" a telephone

was installed for emergency
use.
When an 83-year-old Palo
Alto man jurrped to his death
last August, the observation
deck was closed to the public.
Last quarter the University
began receiving requests to
keep the deck open and propos
als for improving its safety,
according to L.yle Nelson, head
of University relations. Several
plans, including supervised
tours or plate glass windows,
like those at San Francisco's
Coit Tower, were then consid
ered.
The final design for the
$30,000 project has been ap
proved by the University's
Board of Trust ees.
The screens will be construct
ed of bronze cr other specially
treated metal. One as yet un
solved problem is how to raise
the screens to the platform,
Miller explained,
A contract 1.0 complete the
project has not yet been sel
ected.
