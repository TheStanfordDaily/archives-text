# Laurel, Hardy Set For Stern
## 
### 
Wincing, whining Stan Laurel
and baby-faced, tie-twiddling
Oliver Hardy will blunder their
way into Stern Hall this week
end for an art film festival.
Four of their best produc
tions, not yet the victims of
Saturday afternoon television
exposure, will be featured. "The
Music Box," winner of the
Academy Award in 1932 for
short subjects is the high-light
feature.
In this film the boys cart a
piano up a long rickety stairway,
fend off dogs and police, and
generally bring the viewer to
the brink of twitters, not to say
guffaws.
"Two Tars," the second silent
feature, has Laurel and Hardy
as sailors in a traffic jam. Their
famous reciprocal destruction
device spreads down a long line
of cars. Replete with smashed
in tonneaus and crumpled fend
ers, it is, in one critic's words,
"hilarious stuff."
"Big Business," another silent
effort, features an appearance
by the erascile Jimmy Findla
son. He does his greatest double
take and fadeaway ever, one
eye open and his bald head
cocked back in amazement.
"Swiss Miss," the only sound
offering, returns to the piano
theme. The boys cart it across
the Alps on a tortuous foot
bridge, all the while fending off
a gorilla.
Laurel and Hardy art buffs
will be glad to know that the
films are offered without com
mentary.
Screenings are at 8:00 p.m.
Friday and Saturday in Serra
Lounge. Admission is fifteen
cents or two for a quarter.
