# 'Friends Outside' Seek Help To Tutor Mexican-Americans
## 
### 
Santa Clara County Friends Out
side (SCCFO) are seeking help from
Stanford students interested in tutor
ing Mexican-American grade-school
children. A dozen tutors willing to
work one night a week are needed.
According to Anne Loftis, an officer
of SCCFO, the children live fifteen
minutes away from the campus, yet
come from a world of "tragically lim
ited horizons. They are children with
out a future—unless they receive help
from the outside."
Standord students can offer these
underprivileged children something
more than homework assistance, Miss
Loftis explained. They can give the
youngsters contact with the success
ful world which relieves their psy
chological poverty. She added that
visiting the Palo Alto homes can be
a revealing experience for Stanford
students also.
This tutoring project is only one of
the functions of Friends Outside, an
organization with over 200 volunteer
members. SCCFO has programs to aid

inmates of the County Jail, distraught
mothers, and older school children.
Four days a week volunteers visit
the County Jail and Jail Farm to per
form liason activities for the prison
ers and the families.
A Friendly Mothers' Club has been
formed — with 7 branches at present
—to give the housewives a rest and
a chance to discuss mutual problems.
For the older children, there is a
Day Camp. The Friends Outside News
letter states: "Our goal for the sum
mer of 196G is to see that every Mexi
can-American grade school child is
given the opportunity of a camp ex
perience." At present the organization
is welcoming any clothing and sleep
ing bags.
Although the camps are mostly
staffed by high school students,
Friends Outside is asking Stanford
students to help. Those who can give
one evening a week to tutoring can
call Richard Roe of the UCCM at 326-
8013 for more information.
