# Bold Reporter Tells Truth About Poloists
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Water Polo is not all work
and no play. Take note, for ex
ample:
Four years ago, Fullerton
Junior College met Foothill for
the National JC water polo

championship. Late in the
fourth quarter, with the score
tied, Foothill fired a shot that
was partially blocked and float
ing in front of the Fullerton
goal.
The goal judge, a diminutive,
blond-haired high school sopho
more, judged that the yellow
ball had passed the front goal
post. He immediately raised his
red flag to signal a score.
The Fullerton coach was irate,
and demanded that the goal
judge be removed. The puny
high school kid was too young
and inexperienced to hold a
position of such grave import
ance in a championship game.
Foothill went on to win the
game by two goals.
Coach Promoted
The Fullerton coach went on
to become assistant coach at

Stanford University. He is
James R. Smith, recognized as
one of the nation's foremost
authorities on the sport of
water polo.
The disputed goal judge also
went on. . . .
Gary Sheerer was a first
team All-American water polo
ist in 1965. The Stanford sopho
more was the second-high scorer
on the Stanford varsity after
missing a third of the season
with a broken hand.
Gary Sheerer no longer
judges goals, he scores them
in great profusionâ€”and no
body's arguing.
Or try this one:
The score was tied in the last
period, and USC called a time
out.
A burly Trojan water poloist

lumbered out of the Southern
Cal pool, then noticed some
thing shocking.
"Look, look what happened!"
A crowd of Sea Horses gath
ered 'round to see a spot of
blood on the poloist's lip.
"See, look, I'm bleeding!'
"Did Stanford do that to you?
Why those ..."
"Yeah, it must have been 27
who did it."
Mentioned Stanford coach
Jim Gaughran in passing,
"Thats* what you get for trying
to bite him."
Silence.
