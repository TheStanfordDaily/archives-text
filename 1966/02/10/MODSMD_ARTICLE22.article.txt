Indian skiers were snowed un
der by four Sierra colleges as
well as by the fluffy white stuff
last weekend at the Northern
California Collegiate Invitation
al, held at the Sugar Bowl.
Near blizzard conditions ham
pered both the Alpine and Nor
dic events but left host team
Sierra College unperturbed, as
that school won the meet, edg
ing out Nevada by less than ten
points.
Stanford Fifth
Stanford finished fifth with

169 points, to Cal's 122 and San
Jose State's 14.2. Steady per
formances were turned in by
Dana More, Steve Anderson and
Dick Drace in the downhill and
slalom events, but it took a her
culean effort on the part of the
Indians' lone entry in the cross
country, freshman Carl Aune, to
garner the tribe points in this
event.
Aune finished the six mile
course in the top ten, despite
the fact that it was his first race
of. the season.
The Ski team travels to Slide
Mt. Nevada this weekend to face
the toughest competition of the
season. The Indian schussers are
sponsored by the Stanford Ski
