Stanford's varsity tennis team
opens activities for its early
spring schedules this Friday
with a match with Arden Hills
Tennis Club from Sacramento.
The singles matches will begin
at 2:30.
Practice has been in session
since last fall, and finally the
players led by Jim Beste will
get a chance to test their excel
lence. The league season will
begin in arly April.
' The* league is associated with
the AAWU, but a close tie
up exists among California,
UCLA, USC, and Stanford. The
northern schools, OSU, Oregon,
WSU, and Washington are not
really considered in the league,
mainly because none of them
could win it. Stanford still has
periodic matches with both the
Oregon and Washington schools.
Beste and Leek
The Stanford tennis story
for the 1966 season resides with
the names Jim Beste and Brian
Leek. Beste, as his name might
indicate, is the star. At one
time he was ranked 2nd among
the national juniors. Last year
he got to the Quarter Finals of
the National Intercollegiate
Tournament. He was beaten by
Mike Belkin who was beaten in
the Finals by Arthur Ashe.
Beste and Leek, who is only
a junior this year, reached the
Semi-Finals of the doubles. Be
cause of the performances of
these two men, Stanford was
rated as the 3rd ranking tennis
power in the country last year.
With both of them returning
this campaign, Stanford should
have a successful team, and tre
mendously exciting players.

The biggest matches will be
the home-and-home series with
Cal, UCLA, and USC. The Bru
ins always present ample com
petition. Victory in this small
but talented league is a real con
quest of consequence.
Stanford will also face such
local foes as San Jose, USF,
and San Francisco State. Later
this month Stanford will host
the Northern California Inter
collegiate Tournament with six
players representing each of
the participating teams.
