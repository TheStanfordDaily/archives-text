# Education And Wilbur

The worthy man, by being enlightened, en
lightens others. Today men, being bewildered,
bewilder others.

It appears that the administration has taken
a not-so-long and not-so-hard look at Stanford's
dormitory for freshmen men and onee again
has proven the modern-day relevancy of Men
cius' ancient observation.
Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson, in
conjunction with Dean Robert J. Wert's Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education, has de
cided that the present method of selecting
sponsors for the dormitory is incompatible
with Hutchinson's ostensibly autonomous role
as lord of the Wilbur complex, fie has said
that the composition of the sponsor selection
committee must be changed; to that Wilbur's
sponsors have agreed. He has further said
that he shall have the right to reject any of
the committee's selections; to this the sponsors,
with considerable justification, have voiced
objection.
As with almost all major decisions made at
Stanford, students were not consulted before
the decisions were made. But now an ironic
respect for the sponsors' power has forced the
Committee on Undergraduate Education into
a series of discussions in an attempt to reach
a compromise on the matter of the professor's
right of veto.
The problem is not an easy one. The admin
istration maintains that it has the legal right
to impose a control such as the one proposed.
While we do not contest that right, we feel that
the question is an educational, rather than a
legal one. And so we ask the Committee on
Undergraduate Education to consider in their
deliberations a larger question, one which re
volves around the central concern of how
Stanford's residence programs can best affect
the education of her students. The question
is: Should a single individual, regardless of
his background or status, be given autonomous
control over an entire residence?
We have long felt that a dormitory such as
Wilbur cannot, and should not be "run", from

the top or elsewhere, but should rather be re
garded as the on-going collection of interact
ing individuals which it basically is. House
programs and the like are only peripheral frills.
As such, a wide variety of influences and be
liefs should be permitted—and encouraged—
so that the residents might be. better stim
ulated, and thereby better educated. The Fac
ulty Master system, as exemplified by Profes
sor Hutchinson's interpretation of it, seems to
be having the opposite effect. Time after time,
he has done his best to rid Wilbur of "unpopu
lar" ideas and "controversial" individuals.
The administration points out that the fac
ulty master system is an experiment, a five
year experiment, and that time must be given
before its success can be judged. We would
agree, and have tried thus far to avoid any
judgment on the system per se. But it already
seems obvious that in the course of the present
experiment the real purpose of attendance at
Stanford—the attainment of an education that
will prepare one for life—has been made sub
servient to an attempt to perpetuate one man's
conception—a mechanical conception that con
siders Wilbur's problem to be one of "academic
in-put"—of what education is really all about.
The sponsors realize that the true issue in
Wilbur is this conflict between two radically
different concepts of education. But, with a
commendable desire to avoid an attack, direct
or indirect, upon personalities, they have
chosen to voice their feelings through the issue
of sponsor selection.
We suggest that the Committee on Under
graduate Education drop the frills and begin
to discuss the very subject from which the
committee derives its name. The present issue
is an attempt to get just such a discussion go
ing; if the attempt fails, then Wilbur will un
doubtedly be twisted again and again in the
next five years as the related secondary issues
continue to arise. Surely this is a future in
which all the concerned parties will suffer.
In brief, we are tired of being bewildered
by those from above, and ask for a period of
enlightenment.
