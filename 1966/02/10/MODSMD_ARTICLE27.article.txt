# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Self-Preservation In Vietnam 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
No one will deny that war is
a horrible thing. Yet it exists,
and the Viet Cong are using it
as a highly effective means of
gaining domination over the peo
ple of South Vietnam. Even
more important, they are at
tempting to demonstrate to the
leaders of world communism
that war is a workable policy
for bringing about world revolu
tion — that Chinese policies of
militarism are ultimately the
most effective.
Certainly, the United States
could allow Vietnam to be swal
lowed up by the Viet Cong; we
could close our eyes to the 11,-
500 ruthless assassinations of
Vietnamese officials and civili
ans — to the tactics of guerrilla
warfare; and we could pull out
of Vietnam, allowing China to
expand her sphere of dominance
without ever seeming to bccome
involved. For let's not kid our

selves, who can seriously believe
that the outcome of this strug
gle is of little importance to the
attitude and power of China?
Yet, one day the United
States must take its stand
against communism. For a man
can't just let another man
punch at him especially when
that other has sworn to kill him.
Thus, we have chosen to take
our stand now in Vietnam rather
than next year in Thailand or
the year after in Cambodia.
War is a gruesome thing, and
it is immoral. But let's not for
get that the highest morality is
that of self-preservation.

Editor, The Daily:
Since the heavily-attended
public protest of a week ago
Monday, both in Daily editorials
and in letters to The Daily,

there have been numerous ap
peals for the offering of "mod
erate" ways in which "mode
rate" opponents of United
States Vietnam policy can ex
press their opposition to that
policy. One such offering is now
being made.
At the SCPV desk in the ASSU
office are ten thousand leaflets
which, in a quite moderate way,
express opposition to the Ad
ministration's policy in Vietnam.
Anyone interested in distribu
ting these leaflets either in liv
ing units or in the wider Palo
Alto area should go to this desk
any afternoon in the week.

which, in a quite moderate way,
express opposition to the Ad
ministration's policy in Vietnam.
Anyone interested in distribu
ting these leaflets either in liv

Alto area should go to this desk

Editor, The Daily:
No one will deny that war is
a horrible thing. Yet it exists,
and the Viet Cong are using it
as a highly effective means of
gaining domination over the peo
ple of South Vietnam. Even
more important, they are at
tempting to demonstrate to the
leaders of world communism
that war is a workable policy
for bringing about world revolu
tion — that Chinese policies of
militarism are ultimately the
most effective.
Certainly, the United States
could allow Vietnam to be swal
lowed up by the Viet Cong; we
could close our eyes to the 11,-
500 ruthless assassinations of
Vietnamese officials and civili
ans — to the tactics of guerrilla
warfare; and we could pull out
of Vietnam, allowing China to
expand her sphere of dominance
without ever seeming to bccome
involved. For let's not kid our

selves, who can seriously believe
that the outcome of this strug
gle is of little importance to the
attitude and power of China?
Yet, one day the United
States must take its stand
against communism. For a man
can't just let another man
punch at him especially when
that other has sworn to kill him.
Thus, we have chosen to take
our stand now in Vietnam rather
than next year in Thailand or
the year after in Cambodia.
War is a gruesome thing, and
it is immoral. But let's not for
get that the highest morality is
that of self-preservation.

• Moderate Leaflets
Editor, The Daily:
Since the heavily-attended
public protest of a week ago
Monday, both in Daily editorials
and in letters to The Daily,

there have been numerous ap
peals for the offering of "mod
erate" ways in which "mode
rate" opponents of United
States Vietnam policy can ex
press their opposition to that
policy. One such offering is now
being made.
At the SCPV desk in the ASSU
office are ten thousand leaflets
which, in a quite moderate way,
express opposition to the Ad
ministration's policy in Vietnam.
Anyone interested in distribu
ting these leaflets either in liv
ing units or in the wider Palo
Alto area should go to this desk
any afternoon in the week.
