## Out, Out, Damned Sponsor 
### Steve Leopold 
Behind the escalating sponsor-
Faculty Master conflict over who
is to have the final say in choos
ing next year's sponsors at Wil
bur Hall is a more fundamental
and disturbing problem; name
ly, what role are students to
have in determining residential
policies.
The Faculty Master system
is, we are told, the wave of the
future for all campus dormi
tories. Dean Wert's committee
on Undergraduate Education,
has apparently decided that this
system can kill two birds with
one stone—that is, it will pro
vide a more academic atmos
phere in residences while elimi
nating what one professor
termed "creeping Winbigler
ism" i.e. Deans' control of resi
dence policy. This is commenda
ble, but it seems students are
not to have any meaningful role
in the new decision-making
process.
Fait Accompli
The Union controversy was
one example of the Committee's
propensity toward fait accom
pli; the Faculty Master system
and the attendent sponsor selec
tion squabble is another. In both
cases, Dean Wert's committee
announced their decisions with
out prior student consultation
and then awaited any negative
student reaction.
Of course, Dean Wert claims
this is all inaccurate, because
there was a limited amount of
informal student consultation
prior to the announcement of a
Faculty Master System last
Spring. 'Limited' and 'informal'
are euphemisms of the first
magnitude; the sponsors were
told that a Faculty Master sys
tem had been decided upon and
then a few of them were infor
mally quizzed by former Wilbur
Director Doug Davis and former
Dean of Men Robert Gordon
about some of the various can
didates being mentioned for the
post.
Even Dean Wert admitted to
The Daily last Spring that "there
has been less consultation than
we would have liked." Recently,
a member of the Committee put
it much more succinctly—"We
were pretty harried last year and
just didn't have the time. I guess
we might have been a bit hasty."
Mistakes Ignored
Well, this was last year, and
the more optimistic students
thought that perhaps the Union
uproar would serve as a warning
to the Dean and his Committee.
After all, the whole controversy
could have been avoided with a

little pre-announcement consul
tation. Yet on December 14, the
Committee demonstrated that
nothing had changed; without
any prior consultation with the
sponsors — or any other stu
dents — the Committee decided
that the method of sponsor selec
tion would be changed such that
the Faculty Master would be
empowered to name two spon
sors, two freshmen, a faculty
resident and himself to a selec
tion committee.
It is only in the past few weeks
that the sponsors have been able
to present their rebuttals to the
Committee in a formal manner.
One hopes that their efforts
have dissuaded the Committee
men from acceoting Dean Wert's
over-simplified analysis of the
sponsor's reaction as typical of
a "conservative vested interest"
under duress. The problem is
much deeper.
Sponsor groups have rarely
been afflicted with delusions of
absolute control of Wilbur.
However, they have tended to
believe — by the very nature of
their job — that they should be
consulted about what policies
are to be pursued in Wilbur. To
this date, the "experimental"
Faculty Master system has not
proved viable in this regard —
perhaps for personal and not
institutional reasons.
Guaranteed Student Input
It should come as no sur
prise, then, that the sponsors
wish to retain the major say in
who their successors are to be.
It is the only manner—although
an indirect one to be sure — in
which they can guarantee crea
tive and non-institutional stu
dent input into the Wilbur sys
tem. Of course, the entire prob
lem could be obviated by guar
anteeing student-sponsor ac
cess to the Faculty Master in
his decision-making for Wilbur
and to the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education in its de
liberations for campus-wide res
idential policies.
But this would be a reversal
of the "conventional wisdom" on
the issue of student consulta
tion as practiced by Dean
Wert's Committee. Presently,
student participation is limited
to a subcommittee deliberating
with the architects of Moore
and Jacks Halls. All well and
good.
However, one might suggest to
the good Dean that student par
ticipation in the decision-making
process regarding residential
policy should extend beyond ad
vice as to where the hygenic
fixtures should be located.
