# To Miss the Point
## 
### 
There is nothing like a brilliant theory which doesn't explain the facts,
or a marvelous performance which is in the end in vain. What good does it
do to be a success, to reach fame and fortune, if death stops everything?
Does today's frantic love affair really have meaning if tomorrow there is
oblivion? What value is an education if you grow old and senile? Whot good
is money if it can't buy happiness and peace?
The Biblical word "sin" means "to miss the mark," "to fall short of the tar
get." And sin in not what we do but what we are, by birth and choice, thought
and action, until changed by God and made new within. The Bible says, "All
have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God." Jesus Christ said, No good
tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; for each tree
is known by its fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes
picked from a bramble bush. The good man out of the good treasure of his
heart produces good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil;
for out of the abundance of the heart his heart speaks. Why do you call me
'Lord, Lord' and do not do what I tell you? Everyone who comes to me and
hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like. He is like a
man building a house, who dug deep, and laid the foundation upon rock;
and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not
shake it, because it had been well built. But he who hears and does not do
my words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a founda
tion; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
that house was great" (Luke 6).
The Bible says that life is all about Jesus Christ, that we are in God's
world and accountable to Him at the end of time. To acknowledge Jesus Christ
as Anchor and Lord is to hit the target and to find the cure for sin. The New
Testament says, No other foundation can any one lay than that which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ."
To live by faith (trust and dependence in Jesus Christ) is to discover
exciting adventure daily with God, but whatever is not based on faith is
sin"! Jesus Christ has already died your death for you, why turn down life?
To build a life on Jesus Christ is to live forever, to turn Him down is to miss
the point. Most people miss the point forever—why should you?

do to be a success, to reach fame and fortune, if death stops everything?
Does today's frantic love affair really have meaning if tomorrow there is
oblivion? What value is an education if you grow old and senile? Whot good
is money if it can't buy happiness and peace?
The Biblical word "sin" means "to miss the mark," "to fall short of the tar
get." And sin in not what we do but what we are, by birth and choice, thought
and action, until changed by God and made new within. The Bible says, "All
have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God." Jesus Christ said, No good
tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; for each tree
is known by its fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes
picked from a bramble bush. The good man out of the good treasure of his
heart produces good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil;
for out of the abundance of the heart his heart speaks. Why do you call me
'Lord, Lord' and do not do what I tell you? Everyone who comes to me and
hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like. He is like a
man building a house, who dug deep, and laid the foundation upon rock;
and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not
shake it, because it had been well built. But he who hears and does not do
my words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a founda
tion; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
that house was great" (Luke 6).
The Bible says that life is all about Jesus Christ, that we are in God's
world and accountable to Him at the end of time. To acknowledge Jesus Christ
as Anchor and Lord is to hit the target and to find the cure for sin. The New
Testament says, No other foundation can any one lay than that which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ."
To live by faith (trust and dependence in Jesus Christ) is to discover
exciting adventure daily with God, but whatever is not based on faith is
sin"! Jesus Christ has already died your death for you, why turn down life?
To build a life on Jesus Christ is to live forever, to turn Him down is to miss
the point. Most people miss the point forever—why should you?

There is nothing like a brilliant theory which doesn't explain the facts,
or a marvelous performance which is in the end in vain. What good does it
do to be a success, to reach fame and fortune, if death stops everything?
