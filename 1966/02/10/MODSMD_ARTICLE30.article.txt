A few days ago I offered to teach classes in new and original dis
coveries in Physics and Astronomy. A reaction to my advertisement was
in the form of a security check. Apparently someone in security wanted
to be sure that anything I would teach chould not have been lifted from
the vaults of Cape Kennedy or any other sensitive place.
It was reassuring to find that while men fight and die in Vietnam,
there was one agency vitally alert to security. Except for the security
check 1 had no response to my offer to teach.
The offer was unique and offered in the most scholarly terms and
language possible. It offered you a chance to improve your knowledge
in Physics and Astronomy. The lack of interest from even one scholar
kvas most discouraging. It showed a complete lack of interest by the
entire faculty on a subject of vital interest to science and education.
I am not aware of what motivated you in your silent smugness.
Are you so well taught that no avenue of new information is open to
you? Certainly such minds are of no value to science, society or to me.
It seems a fact that none of this faculty is my peer as scientists. Why
should 1 waste my time and efforts to educate you??
The following is a lesson in Astronomy. It is not offered to the
ungrateful present faculty, but placed here for the benefit of future
faculties who may read and find in it a sprinkling of information about
man and his environment. They might find it helpful.
MAGNESTRONOMY
"The sciencc of magnetic effects upon celestrial mechanics."
The objective of magnestronomy is to trace the magnetic fields
and effects on celestrial bodies. The tracing of magnetic fields and ef
fects on nuclear bodies, while very like celestial meehancis should be
known by another name.
This lesson is to explain a part of celestial mechanics not embodied
in the conceptions of Sir Isaac Newton or Keppler. This is the part
played by the magnetic fields of the earth, other planets and satellites.
It shows how those magnetic fields work to dictate to the planets and
satellites what plane they should find and travel in their transits through
space. There is nothing to conflict with Sir Isaac Newton or Keppler
here.
Things which are brought to mind by this theory are many and
varied. A magnetic compass which points north on earth would appear
to point in the opposite direction if it were-on the moon. The two
celestial bodies in space with magnetic fields "like the earth and moon"
in one way work in much the same manner as a magnetic compass in
the earth's magnetic field. The moon being the lightest of the two
bodies and having a magnetic field is made to position its self in much
the same manner as the needle in the compass. Because of the unique
motions of some of the planets such as Uranius which alternately points
its north and south poles to within 10Â° of the sun. It appears that the
rings of Saturn could contain a magnetic field. It further appears that
because, of the mineral composition of the planets, some planets may
hold more than one magnetic field.
Some professors of limited learning will profess that evidence exists
which indicates that there is no magnetism on the moon. Others will
profess that gravity is a force of no relation to magnetic phenomenas but
these people are more related to those of the past who believed that
the earth had a roof over it, than they are relaed to those of us who are
dedicated to scientific progress.
If you were on the same plane as the planets and out in outer
space beyond the planet Pluto and if you could see the sun, planets and
satellites in our universe, the sun would appear in the middle and the
planets would project out in a straight line on either side of the sun.
This is because all the planets follow the same plane in their travels
about our universe.
Thus is to explain why that is a fact.
NATURAL LAW
Every north magnetic pole in every magnetic field in the universe

repels every other north magnetic
pole and attracts every south magnetic
pole in every other magnetic field in
the Universe with a force equal to
the power in the magnetic fields and
inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between them . . .

In our solar system, the planets, the Sun, and satellites are charged
with magnetic fields. The forces in those magnetic fields act upon the
masses of the Sun, the planets and satellites to dictate the orbital plane
that the planet and satellites shall travel in their transits around our
solar system.
In our solar system, the planets and satellites travel in orbits parallel
to each other; that is why the Sun, planets and satellites would appear in
a straight line if you viewed them from the planet Pluto.
If there were no physical force to cause the planets and satellites
to travel a parallel course, the orbits of the planets and satellites would
he helter skelter and in all directions, but the physical force is there and
working to guide each planet and satellite in their relations to each other
in their travels about the solar system.
The mechanics are explained as follows: If two magnetized spheres
like the Earth and Moon were held in space without orbital motion,
they would turn to a position where two unlike poles were closest.
There they would stay, so situated. Figure "B."
However, if those same two spheres were placed into orbits, like
the Earth and Moon are, the magnetic action would be different because
the movement of the spheres would prevent the magnetic fields from
locking in such a fixed position. In such a case, the magnetic action
would be shown in Figure "C." The spheres would be forced by mag-

netic action to where the like poles "North to North" and "South to
South" were furthest apart, and the unlike poles "North to South" and
"South to North" were nearest together. Note in the drawing that the
distances between unlike poles are shorter than the distances between
like poles. Therefore, the force pulling between unlike poles is slightly
greater than the repulsion between like poles. The slight difference in
the amount of power exerted upon the mass of the Earth and Moon is
enough to cause the Moon's orbital plane to be halfway between the
Earth's north and south magnetic poles, along the equatorial plane.
If you tract? the magnetic forces further, you will see that the same
mechanics arc used throughout our solar system to cause all the planets
and all the satellites to travel a plane with all their masses parallel to
each other, Figure "D." Then, if you trace the magnetic forces still

further, you will find that its force is felt in the movements of every
thing from atoms to galaxies. And thus another of nature's major mys
teries is reduced to the layman's simplicity.
