# Brave New Coed Wants Brave New Code

How does it feci to bo the only girl
in a five-member group expounding
radical ideas on contemporary sexual
mores?
Nationally known for its experts,
Stanford has one in this department,
too. She is 20-year old Jan Handke,
an attractive junior majoring in his
tory.
She is the sole female member of
Stanford Sexual Rights Forum
(SSRF) a campus voluntary organiza
tion which emerged January 3, with
a statement of principle advocating
drastic reform of sex laws.
"Our principle tenet is that the pri
vate sexual activities of consenting
adults are sacrosanct and are not the
concern of governments, churches,
schools, or other corporate bodies."
Statement of Goals
More specifically, SSRF asks that:
• All laws punishing cohabitation,

sodomy, homosexuality, non-marital
intercourse and adultery should be
abolished;
• Prostitution should be legalized
and socially useful medical controls
should be instituted;
• Job discrimination by reason of
homosexuality should be outlawed;
• Abortion should be legalized.
Miss Handke complains that many
people think she is involved in SSRF
only to justify her own actions.
"They keep looking at me like they
want to know who I'm sleeping with."
In explaining her philosophy, she
says!, "what two consenting adults do
in private is their own business."
Change in Attitudes
Miss Handke, who came to Stanford
as a "naive, unexperienced" freshman,
altered her views on cohabitation and
abortion soon after arrival.
A very close friend tried to commit
suicide when faced with the certainty

of having an illegitimate child. This
experience sold her on the idea of le
galized abortion.
"I knew right then," she recalls,
"I'd have an abortion if it were ever
necessary. I don't see any point in
having unwanted kids around."
As a freshman she experienced a
change of attitude toward premarital
sexual intercourse. She credits Wil
liam Sloane Coffin, chaplain at Yale,
with clarifying some of her stereo
typed views during a series of lectures
at Wilbur on sex in contemporary so
ciety.
Double Standard
He really awakened me. I realized I
hadn't really been thinking. Many of
our ideas of what is feminine or mas
culine have been ingrained in us by
our society. We never seriously think
about them.
"The idea that a girl should be
chaste before marriage while a guy

is almost encouraged to sleep around
is logically absurd. Obviously it takes
a boy and a girl to go to bed. If a girl
has to be a virgin, she should expect
the same from her husband."
SSRF Emerges
Early this quarter, Miss Handke and
Jim Sayre, a 23-year old first-year
graduate student with similar beliefs,
decided to establish an organization.
Miss Handke's involvement has pro
ceeded through several stages. First,
she swore she would not associate her
name with SSRF and next, that she
would not distribute its literature.
Then, she realized that "I would be
nothing but a hypocrite it I believed
but wouldn't actively support."
Miss Handke emphasizes that SSRF
is not basically a membership group,
thus accounting for its small size.
"We simply want to keep our ideas
before the students. I'd really like to
sec people clarify their views- to have

better reasons for their stands. People
are interested, though. Our button
sales have been very well received."
The weekly button sales have
grossed some $500 for Forum proj
ects. Among the titles are "Love and
Let Love," "I'm a Single Standard
Sox Snob," "Unbutton," and SSRF's
best known epithet, "If It Moves, Fon
dle It."
Supports Pill
What of tlu> future? Miss Handke
plans to continue the campaign for
legalized abortion on a long-range
basis. "With over a million illegal
abortions performed annually, the
states have got to take a more liberal
view."
Currently though, SSRF is seeking
wider availability of birth control
pills for unmarried women.
"No matter what society says," she
adds, "prevention is much easier than
cure."
