# Heschel Calls For Cosmic Awe
## 
### 
Rabbi Abraham Heschel yesterday
exhorted an overflow audience in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder to "culti
vate a sense of wonder."
"The beginning of reverence," he
said, "is wonder; the beginning of
wisdom is reverence."
Speaking on the topic "Mystery
and Meaning," Rabbi Heschel, Pro
fessor of Ethics and Mysticism at
Jewish Theological Seminary, re
marked that to lose the sense of won
der and reverence is "to commit

spiritual suicide, a common fate for
modern man . . . Beauty we enjoy,
power we grab, and the sublime we
ignore."
To experience the sublime we must
"go beyond the philosophers who
would limit reality to what can be
defined." He remarked that "a philos
ophy which begins with radical
doubts must end in radical despair.
A philosophy should begin with radi
cal wonder. For there is a mystery
even in reason itself: the most in
comprehensible fact in the world is
the fact that we comprehend at all."
Wordless Thought
Rabbi Heschel stated that only
through "thinking without words"

can we encounter the sublime, "that
which we see and are unable to con
vey. It is what words and categories
can never reach."
He asserted that those who deny
all meaning in the universe are the
ones who have lost this sense of won
der. "Debunking," he said, "has be
come a habit. But the world is too in
credible and too meaningful. In won
der we meet the world as if for the
first time. I cannot stand face to face
with the universe and say, 'This is all
nonsense.' "
For a man with this sense of won
der, "every moment is a new arrival."
He said that religion is here "to teach
us how to sanctify the moment. For
the present moment is the presence
of God." Religion is a "way of think
ing, a sensitivity to that which pre
cedes theology." The Bible "teaches
us how to look at things. It is the
language of the sublime."
Inner Universe
Rabbi Heschel asserted that "a
sense of radical amazement" is also
necessary for truly moral behavior.
"Everyone carries within himself a
universe." It is this wonder that "de
fies the egocentricities of man" and
enables him to acknowledge "the im
mediacy and uniqueness of other
people."
He cautioned that an overdepend
ence on science and theory, as well
as a "fear of the unfamiliar" was
suppressing our "innate sense of
wonder." He stated, "I am not against
theories, but I am in favor of life."
