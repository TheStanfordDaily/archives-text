# WILBUR REPORT
## Sponsors Present Rationale 
### SUE WICKIZER 
The sponsors have written a philo
sophical rationale of their position on
sponsor selection which, according to
Head Sponsor A 1 Taylor, "speaks to
the three arguments most commonly
used for a faculty veto and offers a
rebuttal."
The report, entitled "Sponsor Selec
tion and the Veto," was written spe
cifically for the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUGE) and Dr.
Eric Hutchinson, Faculty Master at
Wilbur.
It criticizes the proposed faculty
veto over the new sponsor selection
process as destructive to the enthusi
asm of future sponsors and the di
verse educational philosophies at Wil
bur.
Taylor stated the report was writ
ten "to ennunciate our position." It
was distributed to CUGE and the Fac
ulty Master last week.
Pro Arguments
The report cites the three argu
ments that are most commonly used
to support the veto. The first states
that CUGE cannot legally agree to
complete selection autonomy due to

the "very structure of the Univer
sity."
Secondly, CUGE believes that if the
Faculty Master Plan is to work at all,
it is imperative that the Faculty Mas
ter himself be able to participate de
cisively in the choosing of his own
staff.
The third argument which Hutchin
son proposed states that a check on
the selection committee would en
courage a more conscientious choice
of sponsors.
Con Arguments
The sponsors believe that CUGE is
avoiding the issue when the commit
tee argues for a veto in legal rather
than educational terms.
The report states that "clearly the
final responsibility for sponsor
choosing can be delegated to the spon
sor committee itself. It has been in the
past."
The most important point, accord
ing to the report, is the negative ef
fects a veto would have on the selec
tion process and the sponsor system.
The sponsors state that a veto "will
discourage desireable candidates, for
such a veto implies intolerance and

an unwillingness to accept the tenet
that diversity of approach is a neces
sary element in the educational proc
ess."
The sponsors feel that the "strong
<>spirit de corps and clan" which has
developed within each successive
group of sponsors "would not contin
ue if selection depended upon approval
by two agencies of the University au
thority structure."
The report argues that Wilbur is
benefitted by the many educational
philosophies which exist there. Be
cause of the "differing educational as
sumptions" between the Faculty Mas
ter and the sponsors, the report
states that a Faculty Master veto
might impose an undesireable "arbi
trary homogeneity."
Practically, the report argues that
"the representative nature of the new
committee and the variety of interests
to be found among its members pro
vide adequate checks and balances
wilhin the committee itself."
Hutchinson declined 1o comment on
the sponsor report. Dean Wert, Chair
man of CIJGE, was unavailable for
comment.
