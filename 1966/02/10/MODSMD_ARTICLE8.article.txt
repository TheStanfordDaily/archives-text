# LASSU To Hold Sponsor Debate
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
A bill concerning Wilbur sponsors
and a resolution affirming the right
of students and faculty to "discuss,
plan and mount political action" on
the campus will top the Legislature
agenda tonight.
A controversial piece of legislation
to be introduced by Wilbur sponsor
Dave Harris will, if accepted, change
ASSU by-laws and give a five-member
committee the final say in sponsor se
lection.
The legislation ignores the decision
of Wilbur Faculty Master Eric Hutch
inson that he should have veto power
over the committee's final choice.
The bill stipulates that the Wilbur
Faculty Master "may attend the com
mittee proceedings in an advisory ca
pacity."
No Veto
No veto power has been exercised
over sponsor selections for the last
twelve years. Reconsideration of the
composition of the selection commit
tee was undertaken last quarter to

University community in the selec
tion process."

chose the following year's sponsors.
Under the new provision, two spon
sors, one Faculty Resident, one fresh
man and one ASSU representative
would screen candidates and approve
24 for the job.

against resumed bombing in Vietnam.

tory and detrimental to students.

action to be introduced by Tom Forst

litical activities "a crucial concommit
ent of the principles of academic free
dom."

of the ASSU Finance Committee — to
pay for an lIR conference and the
