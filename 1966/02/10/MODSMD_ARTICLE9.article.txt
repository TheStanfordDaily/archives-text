# Roble Hot
## 
### 
Last night, a short circuit blacked
out Roble Hall. At exactly 10:58, lights
were turned off to prevent the possi
bility of a fire due to heat from the
shorted wire. As the Daily went to
press rooms were still black and chaos
reigned in the halls of Stanford's
home for unwed fresh women.
