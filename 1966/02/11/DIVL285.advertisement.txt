The Ground of Our Being
Is God to he found in the depths of the soul? Docs introspection
lead to a Power Beyond? Is God a universal spirit within all men? Is
He found in the subsconscious mind? Is He the ground of our being?
Where is God and wlio is God? Is He dead, or did He ever live at all?
Is there a God at all?
The philosophers and intellectuals of first century Athens were not
unlike the modern searching skeptic who seks a new theology and rele
vant new faith. Visiting Athens the Christian aspotle Paul aroused the
Greeks who said, "What would this babbler say? ... He seems to be a
preacher of foreign divinities . . . May we know what this ne\V teaching
is which you present? For you bring some strange things to our ears . . .
From Mars hill in ancient Athens, Paul brought to Greeks these
words about the God of life he had met personally: "Men of Athens, I
perceive that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed
along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar
with this inscription, 'To an unknown God.' What therefore you worship
as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and
everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines
made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed
anything, since lie himself Rives to all men life and breath and every
thing. And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the
face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries
of their habitation, that they should seek God, in the hope that they
might feel after him and find him.
'Yet God is not far from each one of us, for 'In Him we live and
move and have our being'; as even some of your poets have said, For
we are indeed his offspring. Being then God s offspring, we ought not
to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, a representation
by the art and imagination of man. The times of ignorance God over
looked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent, because
he has fixed a clay on which he will judge the world in righteousness by
a man whom he has appointed (Jesus Christ), and of this he has given
assurance to all men by raising him from the dead (Acts 17).
Truth is truth because it never changes. Paul's words to ancient
Athens are God's words to you today. The unchanging God who is the
ground of being, Jesus Christ, the Author of life, inites you to turn from
the error of you way to the reality of a personal walk with Him. To be
cut off from life is to die inside; to turn to God is to live forever. Have
you found Jesus Christ?
