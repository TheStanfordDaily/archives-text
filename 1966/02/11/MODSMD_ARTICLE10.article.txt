# 'Epidemic' Hits Peninsula Area
## 
### 
Although the mid-peninsula area
is experiencing a 'flu' epidemic, doc
tors at the Stanford Health Service
"have not seen in any number of
cases what we would call influenza,"
according to Dr. Maurice Osborne,
executive director of the Health
Service.
One-third of the student body and
six of the 23 teachers at Ortega
School in Sunnyvale were absent yes
terday with an illness tentatively
identified as influenza, and elsewhere
school absenteeism was double or
triple the normal five per cent, ac
cording to a story in the Palo Alto
Times yesterday. However, the State
Department of Health must conduct
required tests before the illness can
be verified as influenza.
Dr. Osborne said that often such
epidemics affect only a certain age
group. Though an attack of influ
enza is "uncomfortable," it is a
"short-term thing and not dangerous
for the college-age group," he added.
The Health Service has been treat
ing about the "usual volume" of mild
viruses, including respiratory and in
testinal viruses, this winter. "Lots
of things get called 'flu' loosely, even
by us," the doctor said. In true in
influenza cases, however, the patient
develops a high fever and is sick for
three or four days.
"If there's an epidemic around, ap
parently it isn't hitting u.yyet," Dr.
Osborne concluded.
