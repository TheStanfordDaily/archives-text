THEATER
If you have not already seen Aeschylus' tragedy, Prometheus
Bound, you can see the Repertory Theater's performance tonight
and tomorrow night in Memorial Auditorium. "Tiger at the Gates,
the comedy on the Trojan War by Jean Giraudoux, will continue
through February with performances every Friday and Saturday
nights at Theatre-St. Mark's in Palo Alto. Strindberg's The Father
at the Actor's Workshop and Jean Genet's ritual of evil, "The
Blacks," at the Playhouse will continue this weekend in San Fran
cisco.
FILM
Friday's Tresidder movie is "Singing in the Rain" directed by
Gene Kelley. If you don't want to get soaked better bring makin
tosh, rubbers, and umbrella.
The Girl With The Golden Eyes starts with a little known cast
and finishes with a no name one. But, as some erudite reviewer
once said, the film includes "a highlife of senses and a lowlife of
soul." If you can resolve that one, you can catch the flick Saturday
night at Tresidder.
The Sunday Flicks feature the Magnificent Marcello Mastroiunni
and Sophia Loren in Divorce Italian Style. This is the film that first
catapulted Mastroianni to the heights of American box office at
tractions.
Wednesday at 7:45 The International Film Discussion Series will
present "Rocco e i suoi fratelli." Visconti captures contemporary
Italy in its problem of rural-urban contention.
"The Cincinnati Kid" and The Americanization of Emily are
featured in a double header at Altos. The latter of the two is sup
posedly well worthwhile.
The Varsity and the Bel Art sport The Loved One (see review on
this page).
The Heroes of Telemark and Agvnt 8% have finally been slated
to sabotage some other theater, and we will have The Spy Who
Came in From The Cold starting' Wednesday.
Felix Greene's China document will return to the Park for the
weekend.
Ten Little Indians and Twenty-four Hours to Kill are featured
at the Bijou and the Tivoli. Get this ten minutes before "Indians"
wraps up, there is an intermission and the audience is dared—
DARED? did you say—yes, dared to guess the culprit that, been
liquidating his nine fellow Indians.
The Stanford and the Carlos have The Great Race starrfng Tony
Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Natalie Wood ill one of the greatest
comedies of all time! (At least, i that is how its ad reads.)
OTHER
Five Finger JSjflercise will play through the weekend at the Palo
Alto Community Theater, at 8:30 p.m. Liberace who has had a
dazzling success short run at the Circle Star Theater will be
on hand, eompleteHySth glittering ensemble and flickering candela
brum. His last performance is Sunday so better catch him fast. The
Sound of Music opens this Tuesday at the Circle Star for a two
week run.

the comedy on the Trojan War by Jean Giraudoux, will continue
through February with performances every Friday and Saturday
nights at Theatre-St. Mark's in Palo Alto. Strindberg's The Father
at the Actor's Workshop and Jean Genet's ritual of evil, "The
Blacks," at the Playhouse will continue this weekend in San Fran
cisco.
FILM
Friday's Tresidder movie is "Singing in the Rain" directed by
Gene Kelley. If you don't want to get soaked better bring makin
tosh, rubbers, and umbrella.
The Girl With The Golden Eyes starts with a little known cast
and finishes with a no name one. But, as some erudite reviewer
once said, the film includes "a highlife of senses and a lowlife of
soul." If you can resolve that one, you can catch the flick Saturday
night at Tresidder.
The Sunday Flicks feature the Magnificent Marcello Mastroiunni
and Sophia Loren in Divorce Italian Style. This is the film that first
catapulted Mastroianni to the heights of American box office at
tractions.
Wednesday at 7:45 The International Film Discussion Series will
present "Rocco e i suoi fratelli." Visconti captures contemporary
Italy in its problem of rural-urban contention.
"The Cincinnati Kid" and The Americanization of Emily are
featured in a double header at Altos. The latter of the two is sup
