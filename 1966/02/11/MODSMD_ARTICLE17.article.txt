# 'Zhivago' Is Ile warding
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
" Doctor Zhivago," which
opened at the Orphcum in San
Francisco Wednesday night, is
both immense and rewarding—
in a somewhat different man
ner than Boris Pasternak's No
bel Prize winning epic.
According to Director David
Lean ("Bridge Over the River
Kwai" and "Lawrence of Ara
bia": 1 , "The Revolution simply
provides the canvas against
which is told a moving and
highly personal love story." Yet
on the screen, it is the Revolu
tion that comes alive and the
love story which supplies the
canvas.
Irony Explicated
There are two reasons for this
ironic consequence: Lean's ex
cellent camera work, sound ef
fects and editing cannot capture
the subtlety and depth of Zhiva
go and Lara's affair; and unfor
tunately neither Omar Sharif as
Zhivago or Julie Christie
Lara are able to project such
feeling.
pointing. Cast as a medical stu

dent, who is also Russia's lead
ing young poet, he relies so
completely on his looks and
charm that the viewer finally
concludes that the Bolshevik's
are essentially correct when
they brand him and his works
"self-indulgent" and "petit bour
geoise."
Miss Christie is more intri
guing. After a disillusioning
start — in which the uninitiated
discover that those cleavage-or
iented spreads in Life and News
week ignored a jutting profile
(jaw, that is) and that not even
the most biased camerawork
can convince the viewer that
Miss Christie is a 17 year old
being seduced by her mother's
ostensible lover — she slowly
rebuilds the shattered image into
Sharif is particularly disap
a tour de force of essential sen
suality (a decided feat when
one considers that she spends
most of her on-camera time in
fur coats, full length gowns or
—blessed be the incessant win
ter —sweaters).
The six main supporting ac

tors, however, are un i 1' or m I y
excellent; indeed, they are with
one exception—superb. Alec
Guiness, as Zhivago's half-broth
er, a somewhat cynical Bolshe
vik who goes from an agitator
in the Czar's Army to political
commisar to general in the Red
Army, deserves still another Os
car- for his efforts. He is both
subtle and blunt in his dual role
as on-screen participant and off
screen narrator.
If Guineps is the face of a
somewhat cynical - yet essen
tially humane — revolutionary,
Tom Courtenay as Pasha is a
study in what one character apt
ly terms "murderous neurosis."
Beginning as an immature fana
tic and demonstrator for the
Bolshevik cause, he later leaves
Lara (his wife) and his child to
fight in the war. Still later, lie
returns to the screen as the cold,
diminuitive partisan general
Strelnikov, a man quite willing
to shell the city where his wife
is staying — "Liston, Zhivago,
the personal life is dead in Rus
sia; history has killed it."
Steiger Overacts Again
Rod Steiger as the opportun
ist Komarovsky who seduces
Lara and survives war, revolu
tion and purges, is also quite
convincing; that is, until his pro
pensity to overacting undoes a
fine effort in the last scenes.
Finally, Geraldine Chaplain
(Charlie's 21 year old daugh
ter), Siobham McKenna and
Ralph Richardson turn in im
pressive performances as Zhi
vago's wife and foster parents.
Miss Chaplain is especially ef
fective, playing a difficult part
which Richard Burton once
called the "Miss Goodie Two
Shoes" role; she is only rarely
too sweet to take.
Yet the essense of "Zhivago"
is in the canvas, to use Lean's
term. Although the street
scenes tend, at times, to look
too much like something out of
Currier and Ives and the direc
tor is overly fixated with falling
leaves and fading flowers (we
got the message that time was
passing on tlie first try). "Zhi
vago" is a masterpiece of sound
and sight.
Partisan Stint
Indeed, the 10 or so minutes
given to Zhivago's forced two
year stint with a band of Par
tisans incessantly tracking the
remnants of the White Army
loyalists is, by itself, worth the
price of two admissions. Across
an ice-bound river the Parti
sans launch a dawn attack on a
White position seen only as
flashes of white light from ma
chine gun fire; later, after a
small band of Whites is mowed
down in an insane advance
across a wheat field, the Parti
sans discover in a rage that
they have killed 20 boys led out
to die by their fanatical Czarist
instructor; the Partisan com
mander and his political "advi
sor" argue over Zhivago's fate
before the entire band in a bliz
zard-plagued tent-barrack with
the Bolshevik winning.
There are other scenes, equal
ly effective. In all, they trans
form Director Lean's canvas
into an immense — yet immedi
ate portrait of a nation con
vulsed.

provides the canvas against
which is told a moving and
highly personal love story." Yet
on the screen, it is the Revolu
tion that comes alive and the
love story which supplies the
canvas.
Irony Explicated
There are two reasons for this
ironic consequence: Lean's ex
cellent camera work, sound ef
fects and editing cannot capture
the subtlety and depth of Zhiva
go and Lara's affair; and unfor
tunately neither Omar Sharif as
Zhivago or Julie Christie
Lara are able to project such
feeling.

completely on his looks and

are essentially correct when
they brand him and his works
"self-indulgent" and "petit bour

Miss Christie is more intri

The six main supporting ac

tors, however, are un i 1' or m I y
excellent; indeed, they are with
one exception—superb. Alec
Guiness, as Zhivago's half-broth
er, a somewhat cynical Bolshe
vik who goes from an agitator
in the Czar's Army to political
commisar to general in the Red
Army, deserves still another Os
car- for his efforts. He is both
subtle and blunt in his dual role
as on-screen participant and off
screen narrator.
If Guineps is the face of a
somewhat cynical - yet essen
tially humane — revolutionary,
Tom Courtenay as Pasha is a
study in what one character apt
ly terms "murderous neurosis."
Beginning as an immature fana
tic and demonstrator for the
Bolshevik cause, he later leaves
Lara (his wife) and his child to
fight in the war. Still later, lie
returns to the screen as the cold,
diminuitive partisan general
Strelnikov, a man quite willing
to shell the city where his wife
is staying — "Liston, Zhivago,
the personal life is dead in Rus
sia; history has killed it."
Steiger Overacts Again
Rod Steiger as the opportun
ist Komarovsky who seduces
Lara and survives war, revolu
tion and purges, is also quite
convincing; that is, until his pro
pensity to overacting undoes a
fine effort in the last scenes.
Finally, Geraldine Chaplain
(Charlie's 21 year old daugh
ter), Siobham McKenna and
Ralph Richardson turn in im
pressive performances as Zhi
vago's wife and foster parents.
Miss Chaplain is especially ef
fective, playing a difficult part
which Richard Burton once
called the "Miss Goodie Two
Shoes" role; she is only rarely
too sweet to take.
Yet the essense of "Zhivago"
is in the canvas, to use Lean's
term. Although the street
scenes tend, at times, to look
too much like something out of
Currier and Ives and the direc
tor is overly fixated with falling
leaves and fading flowers (we
got the message that time was
passing on tlie first try). "Zhi
vago" is a masterpiece of sound
and sight.
Partisan Stint
Indeed, the 10 or so minutes
given to Zhivago's forced two
year stint with a band of Par
tisans incessantly tracking the
remnants of the White Army
loyalists is, by itself, worth the
price of two admissions. Across
an ice-bound river the Parti
sans launch a dawn attack on a
White position seen only as
flashes of white light from ma
chine gun fire; later, after a
small band of Whites is mowed
down in an insane advance
across a wheat field, the Parti
sans discover in a rage that
they have killed 20 boys led out
to die by their fanatical Czarist
instructor; the Partisan com
mander and his political "advi
sor" argue over Zhivago's fate
before the entire band in a bliz
zard-plagued tent-barrack with
the Bolshevik winning.
There are other scenes, equal
ly effective. In all, they trans
form Director Lean's canvas
into an immense — yet immedi
ate portrait of a nation con
vulsed.
" Doctor Zhivago," which
opened at the Orphcum in San
Francisco Wednesday night, is
both immense and rewarding—
in a somewhat different man

ironic consequence: Lean's ex

fects and editing cannot capture
the subtlety and depth of Zhiva
go and Lara's affair; and unfor

Zhivago or Julie Christie
Lara are able to project such
feeling.

The six main supporting ac

tors, however, are un i 1' or m I y
excellent; indeed, they are with
one exception—superb. Alec
Guiness, as Zhivago's half-broth
er, a somewhat cynical Bolshe
vik who goes from an agitator
in the Czar's Army to political
commisar to general in the Red
Army, deserves still another Os
car- for his efforts. He is both
subtle and blunt in his dual role
as on-screen participant and off
screen narrator.
If Guineps is the face of a
somewhat cynical - yet essen
tially humane — revolutionary,
Tom Courtenay as Pasha is a
study in what one character apt
ly terms "murderous neurosis."
Beginning as an immature fana
tic and demonstrator for the
Bolshevik cause, he later leaves
Lara (his wife) and his child to
fight in the war. Still later, lie
returns to the screen as the cold,
diminuitive partisan general
Strelnikov, a man quite willing
to shell the city where his wife
is staying — "Liston, Zhivago,
the personal life is dead in Rus
sia; history has killed it."
Steiger Overacts Again
Rod Steiger as the opportun
ist Komarovsky who seduces
Lara and survives war, revolu
tion and purges, is also quite
convincing; that is, until his pro
pensity to overacting undoes a
fine effort in the last scenes.
Finally, Geraldine Chaplain
(Charlie's 21 year old daugh
ter), Siobham McKenna and
Ralph Richardson turn in im
pressive performances as Zhi
vago's wife and foster parents.
Miss Chaplain is especially ef
fective, playing a difficult part
which Richard Burton once
called the "Miss Goodie Two
Shoes" role; she is only rarely
too sweet to take.
Yet the essense of "Zhivago"
is in the canvas, to use Lean's
term. Although the street
scenes tend, at times, to look
too much like something out of
Currier and Ives and the direc
tor is overly fixated with falling
leaves and fading flowers (we
got the message that time was
passing on tlie first try). "Zhi
vago" is a masterpiece of sound
and sight.
Partisan Stint
Indeed, the 10 or so minutes
given to Zhivago's forced two
year stint with a band of Par
tisans incessantly tracking the
remnants of the White Army
loyalists is, by itself, worth the
price of two admissions. Across
an ice-bound river the Parti
sans launch a dawn attack on a
White position seen only as
flashes of white light from ma
chine gun fire; later, after a
small band of Whites is mowed
down in an insane advance
across a wheat field, the Parti
sans discover in a rage that
they have killed 20 boys led out
to die by their fanatical Czarist
instructor; the Partisan com
mander and his political "advi
sor" argue over Zhivago's fate
before the entire band in a bliz
zard-plagued tent-barrack with
the Bolshevik winning.
There are other scenes, equal
ly effective. In all, they trans
form Director Lean's canvas
into an immense — yet immedi
ate portrait of a nation con
vulsed.
" Doctor Zhivago," which
opened at the Orphcum in San
Francisco Wednesday night, is
both immense and rewarding—
in a somewhat different man
ner than Boris Pasternak's No
bel Prize winning epic.
According to Director David
Lean ("Bridge Over the River
Kwai" and "Lawrence of Ara
bia": 1 , "The Revolution simply
provides the canvas against
which is told a moving and
highly personal love story." Yet
on the screen, it is the Revolu
tion that comes alive and the
love story which supplies the
canvas.
