# 4Loved One? Dies Leaving No Estate
## 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
"The Loved Ones" merits its
blurb, "the motion picture with
something to offend everyone,"
but lacks that something to
offer everyone. A sometime sat
ire and less often comedy, the
movie does jab fun at several
of the traditions ingrained in
our American way.
Robert Morse wins a free trip
to Los Angeles where ho then
lives with his uncle, a once re
known set designer in Holly
wood. The uncle is fired and, in
despair that his 31 year tenure
in motion pictures has come to
"the end," hangs himself. Morse
makes the funeral arrange
ments for his "loved one" with
a Hollywood memorial park
called Whispering Glades. He
meets and falls in love with
Miss Thanatogenos who is chief
cosmetician at the mortuary.
Dual Role For Winters
In a dual role, Jonathan Win
ters is seen first as the pres
tigious and preverted Wilbur
Glenworthy, who operates
Whispering Glades and con
ceives an idea for transforming
it into a more profitable Senior
Citizens Retirement City. With
the help of top-ranking space
program chiefs, he rockets the
"loved ones" into outer space

with the slogan, "Resurrection
Now!" In a lesser but funnier
role, he appears as Wilbur's
bumbling brother who runs a
pet cemetery with Robert Morse
as his assistant.
Everything goes haywire and
in the end all eyes are uplifted
to celestial serenity as the first
"loved one" is rocketed into an
orbit of cosmic grace.
Potpurri Of Glitter
The supporting cast is an im
pressive list of actors including
Dana Andrews, Rod Steiger,
Milton Berle, James Coburn,
Robert Morley, and a potpurri
of others. Impressive though the
list may seem, the big names
only make brief guest appear
ances and add little to the pic
ture.
The main cast, Miss Comer,
Morse, and especially Jonathan
Winters turn in good perform
ances. Winters almost saves the
movie from mediocrity and it is
unfortunate that he could not
have been on the screen more
often. He puts his own hilarious
stamp on what is otherwise dry,
dragging wittery.
The plot unravels as easily
as a wad of tangled string. It
is hard to establish the relev
ance of the first part concern
ing the uncle's death and fun
eral to the last and less humor
ous segment of transfiguring
the mortuary into a Senior Citi
zens Retirement City. The con
nection, alas, remains a knot.
As intended, "The Loved One"
is a commentary on the cere
monial and emotional fanfare
that shrouds the funeral scene.
It is true that our traditions
and ceremonies should occas
ionally be the subject of satire
lest we lose sight of the mean
ing behind them. But in "The
Loved One," much of what is
offended is neither clever satire
or uproarious comedy.
