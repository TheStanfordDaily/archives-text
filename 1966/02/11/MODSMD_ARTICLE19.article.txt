# Baseball Squads Open Season
## Best Ever 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's powerful varsity
baseball team will launch a 42-
gamo schedule Saturday against,
perhaps, an even more power
ful Frosh team. The game is
set for 2:00 p.m. in Sunken Dia
mond.
Last season the varsity won
the CIBA championship and
was ranked 11th in the nation
after having a brief fling in
the number one spot. This year
the fling may not be so brief.
Four out of the top four pitch
ers are back, six of eight start
ers in the field are back includ
ing Bill Boles a reserve catcher
who hit .357, and a host of fine
sophomores are up from last
year's championship Frosh team.
Veteran Pitchers
Daro Quiring and John Mason
head the veteran staff. Quiring
was all-CIBA last season post
ing a 9-5 record. Mason was
right behind him with an 8-4
record. Reliefer Terry Docken
had a perfect 5-0 record and
good 1.78 earned run average.
Senior Mike Connelly, who is
suffering from a sore arm right
now, is the other vet on the
staff.
Of the other eight positions,
Bob Cox in centerfield and
George Thacher at second base
are the only losses. Steve Hov
ley will move from leftfield
where he started last year and
take over for Cox. Dick Swan,
a slugging shortstop also
switches spots, going to second
base.
Slugger
Swan hit .315 last season and
led the team in homeruns with
four. He also chipped in 33
rbi's. A fine fielder, sophomore
Frank Duffy, will play short
stop.
Co-captain Jim Hibbs will
catch. The victim of quite a few
400-foot outs in the plains of
Sunken Diamond last year Hibbs
still managed a .303 average and
four home runs. This year he
and a few of the other big guns
will at least be able to see the
fences. A four foot barrier has
been erected inside the park so
that it is 335 feet down each
line, 375 to left and right center,
and 410 to straightaway center.
Catcher in the Field?
Backing up Hibbs, Coach
Dutch Fehring will have as fine
a catching crew as anyone in the
conference. The aforementioned
Bill Boles is one and sophomore
Larry Heath is the other. Boles
is the big stick and Heath is out
standing on defense.
Tough guy Pete Middlekauff
will handle everything that
comes his way again this year.
Even though he slumped towards
the end of last season he still
hit .349, and 31 rbi's, and made

All-Amei ican. Middlekauff is the
other co-captain.
Senior Tom Melzer will be at
third base this year with Melzer
started at third last season.
Senior Ron Yett will be start
ing in right for the second year
in a row. He lead the squad in
triples with 8 last season. He also
had four home runs along with
Swan and Hibbs.
Swift Fielder
Coach Fehring is starting soph
omore speedster Mike Schomak
er in left. After hitting .350 for
the Frosh and stealing 23 bases,
he was selected to the all-league
team and named the team's
Most Valuable Player.
A few of the other stars
from last year's Frosh team are
pitchers Frank Klinger, Bill

Holt, Hi Lewis, and Chris Mar
tin.
Klinger was 6-2 and had 67
strikeouts in 63 innings. Bill
Holt was 4-1 while dividing his
time between the mound and
the outfield. He hit .341.
Hi Lewis hit .333 as an in
fielder-pitcher. His 17 rbi's led
the team. His pitching record
was 1-0. Chris Martin had a 5-0
slate and like the other three
throwers he had an earned run
average under 2.00.

If last year's Frosh were out
standing, then this year's Frosh
are potentially heroes. If Coach
Ray Young wanted to, he could
start an all-star at every posi
tion and still have 10 more all
stars sitting on the bench.

When you say that a team
has strong points, you imply that
there are weak points. There
fore, Coach Young's 1966 Frosh
must have only strong and
stronger points. One of these
stronger points is the pitching.
The two with the most press
clippings are Sandy Vance and
Rod Poteete.
Vance pitched Pasadena High
into the finals of the CIF last
season, made all-CIF, and was
a high draft choice of the Cali
fornia Angels. Poteete didn't do
badly for himself either. He was
CIF Player of the Year in both
1964 and 1965. Another all-ClFer
is third baseman Bob Boone. He
was also San Diego Player of
the Year.

suffering from a sore arm right
now, is the other vet on the
staff.
Of the other eight positions,
Bob Cox in centerfield and
George Thacher at second base
are the only losses. Steve Hov
ley will move from leftfield
where he started last year and
take over for Cox. Dick Swan,
a slugging shortstop also
switches spots, going to second
base.
Slugger
Swan hit .315 last season and
led the team in homeruns with
four. He also chipped in 33
rbi's. A fine fielder, sophomore
Frank Duffy, will play short
stop.
Co-captain Jim Hibbs will
catch. The victim of quite a few
400-foot outs in the plains of
Sunken Diamond last year Hibbs
still managed a .303 average and
four home runs. This year he
and a few of the other big guns
will at least be able to see the
fences. A four foot barrier has
been erected inside the park so
that it is 335 feet down each
line, 375 to left and right center,
and 410 to straightaway center.
Catcher in the Field?
Backing up Hibbs, Coach
Dutch Fehring will have as fine
a catching crew as anyone in the
conference. The aforementioned
Bill Boles is one and sophomore
Larry Heath is the other. Boles
is the big stick and Heath is out
standing on defense.
Tough guy Pete Middlekauff
will handle everything that
comes his way again this year.
Even though he slumped towards
the end of last season he still
hit .349, and 31 rbi's, and made

All-Amei ican. Middlekauff is the
other co-captain.
Senior Tom Melzer will be at
third base this year with Melzer
started at third last season.
Senior Ron Yett will be start
ing in right for the second year
in a row. He lead the squad in
triples with 8 last season. He also
had four home runs along with
Swan and Hibbs.
Swift Fielder
Coach Fehring is starting soph
omore speedster Mike Schomak
er in left. After hitting .350 for
the Frosh and stealing 23 bases,
he was selected to the all-league
team and named the team's
Most Valuable Player.
A few of the other stars
from last year's Frosh team are
pitchers Frank Klinger, Bill

Holt, Hi Lewis, and Chris Mar
tin.
Klinger was 6-2 and had 67
strikeouts in 63 innings. Bill
Holt was 4-1 while dividing his
time between the mound and
the outfield. He hit .341.
Hi Lewis hit .333 as an in
fielder-pitcher. His 17 rbi's led
the team. His pitching record
was 1-0. Chris Martin had a 5-0
slate and like the other three
throwers he had an earned run
average under 2.00.

If last year's Frosh were out
standing, then this year's Frosh
are potentially heroes. If Coach
Ray Young wanted to, he could
start an all-star at every posi
tion and still have 10 more all
stars sitting on the bench.

When you say that a team
has strong points, you imply that
there are weak points. There
fore, Coach Young's 1966 Frosh
must have only strong and
stronger points. One of these
stronger points is the pitching.
The two with the most press
clippings are Sandy Vance and
Rod Poteete.
Vance pitched Pasadena High
into the finals of the CIF last
season, made all-CIF, and was
a high draft choice of the Cali
fornia Angels. Poteete didn't do
badly for himself either. He was
CIF Player of the Year in both
1964 and 1965. Another all-ClFer
is third baseman Bob Boone. He
was also San Diego Player of
the Year.
Stanford's powerful varsity
baseball team will launch a 42-
gamo schedule Saturday against,
perhaps, an even more power
ful Frosh team. The game is
set for 2:00 p.m. in Sunken Dia
mond.
Last season the varsity won
the CIBA championship and
was ranked 11th in the nation
after having a brief fling in
the number one spot. This year
the fling may not be so brief.
Four out of the top four pitch
ers are back, six of eight start
ers in the field are back includ
ing Bill Boles a reserve catcher
who hit .357, and a host of fine
sophomores are up from last
year's championship Frosh team.
Veteran Pitchers
Daro Quiring and John Mason
head the veteran staff. Quiring
was all-CIBA last season post
ing a 9-5 record. Mason was
right behind him with an 8-4
record. Reliefer Terry Docken

and 410 to straightaway center.
Catcher in the Field?
Backing up Hibbs, Coach
Dutch Fehring will have as fine
a catching crew as anyone in the
conference. The aforementioned
Bill Boles is one and sophomore
Larry Heath is the other. Boles
is the big stick and Heath is out
standing on defense.
Tough guy Pete Middlekauff
will handle everything that
comes his way again this year.
Even though he slumped towards
the end of last season he still
hit .349, and 31 rbi's, and made

All-Amei ican. Middlekauff is the
other co-captain.
Senior Tom Melzer will be at
third base this year with Melzer
started at third last season.
Senior Ron Yett will be start
ing in right for the second year
in a row. He lead the squad in
triples with 8 last season. He also
had four home runs along with
Swan and Hibbs.
Swift Fielder
Coach Fehring is starting soph
omore speedster Mike Schomak
er in left. After hitting .350 for
the Frosh and stealing 23 bases,
he was selected to the all-league
team and named the team's
Most Valuable Player.
A few of the other stars
from last year's Frosh team are
pitchers Frank Klinger, Bill

Holt, Hi Lewis, and Chris Mar
tin.
Klinger was 6-2 and had 67
strikeouts in 63 innings. Bill
Holt was 4-1 while dividing his
time between the mound and
the outfield. He hit .341.
Hi Lewis hit .333 as an in
fielder-pitcher. His 17 rbi's led
the team. His pitching record
was 1-0. Chris Martin had a 5-0
slate and like the other three
throwers he had an earned run
average under 2.00.

If last year's Frosh were out
standing, then this year's Frosh
are potentially heroes. If Coach
Ray Young wanted to, he could
start an all-star at every posi
tion and still have 10 more all
stars sitting on the bench.

When you say that a team
has strong points, you imply that
there are weak points. There
fore, Coach Young's 1966 Frosh
must have only strong and
stronger points. One of these
stronger points is the pitching.
The two with the most press
clippings are Sandy Vance and
Rod Poteete.
Vance pitched Pasadena High
into the finals of the CIF last
season, made all-CIF, and was
a high draft choice of the Cali
fornia Angels. Poteete didn't do
badly for himself either. He was
CIF Player of the Year in both
1964 and 1965. Another all-ClFer
is third baseman Bob Boone. He
was also San Diego Player of
the Year.
Stanford's powerful varsity
baseball team will launch a 42-
gamo schedule Saturday against,
perhaps, an even more power
ful Frosh team. The game is
set for 2:00 p.m. in Sunken Dia
mond.
Last season the varsity won
the CIBA championship and
was ranked 11th in the nation
after having a brief fling in
the number one spot. This year
the fling may not be so brief.
Four out of the top four pitch
ers are back, six of eight start
ers in the field are back includ
ing Bill Boles a reserve catcher
who hit .357, and a host of fine
sophomores are up from last
year's championship Frosh team.
Veteran Pitchers
Daro Quiring and John Mason
head the veteran staff. Quiring
was all-CIBA last season post
ing a 9-5 record. Mason was
right behind him with an 8-4
record. Reliefer Terry Docken
had a perfect 5-0 record and
good 1.78 earned run average.
Senior Mike Connelly, who is
suffering from a sore arm right
now, is the other vet on the
staff.
Of the other eight positions,
Bob Cox in centerfield and
George Thacher at second base
are the only losses. Steve Hov
ley will move from leftfield
where he started last year and
take over for Cox. Dick Swan,
a slugging shortstop also
switches spots, going to second
base.
Slugger
Swan hit .315 last season and
led the team in homeruns with
four. He also chipped in 33
rbi's. A fine fielder, sophomore
Frank Duffy, will play short
stop.
Co-captain Jim Hibbs will
catch. The victim of quite a few
400-foot outs in the plains of
Sunken Diamond last year Hibbs
still managed a .303 average and
four home runs. This year he
and a few of the other big guns
will at least be able to see the
fences. A four foot barrier has
been erected inside the park so
that it is 335 feet down each
line, 375 to left and right center,
and 410 to straightaway center.
