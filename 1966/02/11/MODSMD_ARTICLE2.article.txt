# Pledged Funds Mount According To PACE
## 
### DOUG BEARDSLEE (First in a Series 
Two years ago this February, Stan
ford concluded the most spectacular
university fund raising campaign ever
conducted. Entitled "Plan of Action
for a Challenging Era" (PACE), the
three-year drive brought pledges of
$113 million to the campus coffers
from more than 36,000 donors.
Today, only $3.16 million of those
pledges remain outstanding, accord
ing to Jack L. Shepard, director of de
velopment and Northern California
PACE chairman during the campaign.
"And we have every reason to believe
that only one-tenth of one per cent of
th total pledges will not be forthcom
ing," he added.
Whatever the reasons for these out
standing pledges, Shepard declared
student activism not to be a signifi
cant cause. He said, "Most people who
do support Stanford believe in the ed
ucational process, and therefore, if
they have made a commitment, they
will probably be less inclined not to
pay than those who never pledged
anything in the first place."
As Trustee W. Parmer Fuller 111
C 33) put it,"I believe it is difficult
enough for a student to try to please
his parents without trying to please
the whole alumni, so when I find 'in
dependent thinkers' I don't get horri
fied and think Stanford is going down
the drain."

Anyone who has heard energetic
bulldozers and air hammers punctu
ate the mid-Peninsula calm can feel
the effects of PACE in 1966. Indeed,
the program will be in visible progress
till the end of the decade.
With all the apparent signs of suc
cess, PACE officials still express re
gret over ending the program $8 mil
lion "in the hole" although they col
lected an additional $13 million in
pledges over the $100 million goal. (Of
this total, $88 million were corpora
tion and individual bequests, $25 mil
lion was from the Ford Foundation.)
Inflation
Shepard cited three reasons for the
discrepancy between the budget and
the expenditure figures:
• The primary reason was inflation,
which upped the original estimates
considerably, even after the contracts
had been let in some cases. In fact,
29 of the building programs went
over their estimates. The situation
was intensified when donors chose to
pledge their securities to Stanford up
on their deaths. Their pledges neces
sarily fall in value with inflation.
• Several sizeable gifts were speci
fied for non-PACE projects which di
verted funds from the projects
which Kenneth Cuthbertson, Stanford
vice president of finance and PACE
Program Manager, has listed.
Because Stanford ended its PACE
campaign with projects totaling $121
million but only $8 million in reve
nues, fund raising has continued as
usual. Among the projects for which
funds are still being solicited are:
• New schools for the Art and Mu
sic Departments and a theater for the
Stanford Repertory.
• The Earth Sciences Building to
be constructed straddling Lomita Dr.
north of Panama St.
• The Men's Athletic Pavilion located
near the present pavilion, which will
very likely become the possession of
student organizations.
• Law Library to be established in
the old School of Law when it is re
modeled.
• Student Residences.
• The Food Research Institute.
• Evisceration (a word coined by
Bob Funk meaning "complete inter
nal renovation") of the Geology Cor
ner, the Quad's museum piece.
• Similar "evisceration" of Jordan
Hall before the Psychology Depart
ment takes over from Biological Sci
ences.
• The Space Engineering Building
for which NASA has pledged $2 mil
lion of the total.
• General plant: improvements on
roads and services.
• Education Building renovation.

• The primary reason was inflation,
which upped the original estimates
considerably, even after the contracts
had been let in some cases. In fact,
29 of the building programs went
over their estimates. The situation
was intensified when donors chose to
pledge their securities to Stanford up
on their deaths. Their pledges neces
sarily fall in value with inflation.
• Several sizeable gifts were speci
fied for non-PACE projects which di
verted funds from the projects
which Kenneth Cuthbertson, Stanford
vice president of finance and PACE
Program Manager, has listed.
Because Stanford ended its PACE
campaign with projects totaling $121
million but only $8 million in reve
nues, fund raising has continued as
usual. Among the projects for which
funds are still being solicited are:
• New schools for the Art and Mu
sic Departments and a theater for the
Stanford Repertory.
• The Earth Sciences Building to
be constructed straddling Lomita Dr.
north of Panama St.
• The Men's Athletic Pavilion located
near the present pavilion, which will
very likely become the possession of
student organizations.
• Law Library to be established in
the old School of Law when it is re
modeled.
• Student Residences.
• The Food Research Institute.
• Evisceration (a word coined by
Bob Funk meaning "complete inter
nal renovation") of the Geology Cor
ner, the Quad's museum piece.
• Similar "evisceration" of Jordan
Hall before the Psychology Depart
ment takes over from Biological Sci
ences.
• The Space Engineering Building
for which NASA has pledged $2 mil
lion of the total.
• General plant: improvements on
roads and services.
• Education Building renovation.
Two years ago this February, Stan
ford concluded the most spectacular
university fund raising campaign ever
conducted. Entitled "Plan of Action
for a Challenging Era" (PACE), the
three-year drive brought pledges of
$113 million to the campus coffers
from more than 36,000 donors.
Today, only $3.16 million of those
pledges remain outstanding, accord
ing to Jack L. Shepard, director of de
velopment and Northern California
PACE chairman during the campaign.
"And we have every reason to believe
that only one-tenth of one per cent of
th total pledges will not be forthcom
ing," he added.
Whatever the reasons for these out
standing pledges, Shepard declared
student activism not to be a signifi
cant cause. He said, "Most people who
do support Stanford believe in the ed
ucational process, and therefore, if
they have made a commitment, they
will probably be less inclined not to
pay than those who never pledged
anything in the first place."
As Trustee W. Parmer Fuller 111
C 33) put it,"I believe it is difficult
enough for a student to try to please
his parents without trying to please
the whole alumni, so when I find 'in
dependent thinkers' I don't get horri
fied and think Stanford is going down
the drain."

Anyone who has heard energetic
bulldozers and air hammers punctu
ate the mid-Peninsula calm can feel
the effects of PACE in 1966. Indeed,
the program will be in visible progress
till the end of the decade.
With all the apparent signs of suc
cess, PACE officials still express re
gret over ending the program $8 mil
lion "in the hole" although they col
lected an additional $13 million in
pledges over the $100 million goal. (Of
this total, $88 million were corpora
tion and individual bequests, $25 mil
lion was from the Ford Foundation.)
Inflation
Shepard cited three reasons for the
discrepancy between the budget and
the expenditure figures:

which upped the original estimates
considerably, even after the contracts
had been let in some cases. In fact,
29 of the building programs went
