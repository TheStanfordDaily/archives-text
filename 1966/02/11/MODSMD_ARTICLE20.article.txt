# Basketball Team Heads North For Return Bout
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
It's up to Oregon for Stan
ford's basketball team this
weekend —to play Oregon State
and Oregon. But it is also up to
Stanford—to beat the Oregon
State Beavers who have not
only beaten the Indians twice
this year, 62-46 and 56-54 just
last weekend, but have won 9
of the last 11 games with Stan
ford.
Oregon State is anything but
a flashy ball team. Right now,
though, they lead the AAWU
with a 5-1 record and lead the
nation in defense holding their
opposition to a low 54.6 points
per contest.
Stanford won't be out to do
much crowd pleasing this week
end either if they plan on keep
ing their hopes alive in the
AAWU basketball race.
Tied For Second
The Indians are currently
tied with UCLA for second
place with a 4-2 record.
Friday night's game with the
Oregon Ducks certainly should
not be overlooked by Stanford.
If previous contests this season
are any indication, a possible
let-down could result in a sub
sequent defeat when the In
dians go into the game as big
favorites.
In last week's game with Ore
gon the Indians were able to
pull away from the Ducks only
after Oregon lost John Pikstaff
and, then later, the conference's
third leading scorer, Jim Bar
nett, who also fouled out. The
game was tied at 33-33 at the
half.
Beavers Don't Miss
Although the Beavers no not
have a single player averaging
more than 15 points and are
next to the bottom in rebounds
in the conference, they are po
tent Loy Petersen, OSU's fine
6-5 forward, leads the confer
ence in free throw percentage
and Ed Weide leads it in field
goal percentage. In other words,

when Oregon State shoots they
don't miss. If they do they don't
get the rebound.
The big guns for Oregon
State last week were Ed Fred
enburg with 17, Scott Eaton
with 14, and Peterson with 13
points. However, the biggest
bang was made by Rick Whelan
who dropped in the game-win
ning shot with less than five
seconds remaining.

Coach Howie Dallmar will be
counting on another big effort
from sophomore sensation, Art
Harris, and Ray Kosanke who
both performed elegantly for
Stanford last week.
Next week it will be Wash
ington State. The Cougars are
still beaming after tripping
both UCLA and USC last week.
They meet the same two clubs
this weekend.

It's up to Oregon for Stan
ford's basketball team this
weekend —to play Oregon State
and Oregon. But it is also up to
Stanford—to beat the Oregon
State Beavers who have not
only beaten the Indians twice
this year, 62-46 and 56-54 just
last weekend, but have won 9
of the last 11 games with Stan
ford.
Oregon State is anything but
a flashy ball team. Right now,
though, they lead the AAWU
with a 5-1 record and lead the
nation in defense holding their
opposition to a low 54.6 points
per contest.
Stanford won't be out to do
much crowd pleasing this week
end either if they plan on keep
ing their hopes alive in the
AAWU basketball race.
Tied For Second
The Indians are currently
tied with UCLA for second
place with a 4-2 record.
Friday night's game with the
Oregon Ducks certainly should
not be overlooked by Stanford.
If previous contests this season
are any indication, a possible
let-down could result in a sub
sequent defeat when the In
dians go into the game as big
favorites.
In last week's game with Ore
gon the Indians were able to
pull away from the Ducks only
after Oregon lost John Pikstaff
and, then later, the conference's
third leading scorer, Jim Bar
nett, who also fouled out. The
game was tied at 33-33 at the
half.
Beavers Don't Miss
Although the Beavers no not
have a single player averaging
more than 15 points and are
next to the bottom in rebounds
in the conference, they are po
tent Loy Petersen, OSU's fine
6-5 forward, leads the confer
ence in free throw percentage
and Ed Weide leads it in field
goal percentage. In other words,

when Oregon State shoots they
don't miss. If they do they don't
get the rebound.
The big guns for Oregon
State last week were Ed Fred
enburg with 17, Scott Eaton
with 14, and Peterson with 13
points. However, the biggest
bang was made by Rick Whelan
who dropped in the game-win
ning shot with less than five
seconds remaining.

Coach Howie Dallmar will be
counting on another big effort
from sophomore sensation, Art
Harris, and Ray Kosanke who
both performed elegantly for
Stanford last week.
Next week it will be Wash
ington State. The Cougars are
still beaming after tripping
both UCLA and USC last week.
They meet the same two clubs
this weekend.
