# Boxers Travel To Nevada; Seek First Conference Win
## 
### TOM EDISON Daily Sports Editor 
Looking for their first con
ference victory, Stanford's box
ing team hopes to hit the jack
pot this Saturday when they
travel to Reno to oppose the
University of Nevada. This will
be the Indians third match of
the season and the first time
they have fought away from
home.
Coach Ray Lunny will be tak
ing 10 fighters on the trip. Three
of these boxers, Delos Brown,
Eric de Gooyer, and Dave Os
wald, will be fighting in the
heavyweight division.
Surviving last week's defeat
at the gloves of Chico State,
and sporting unblemished rec
ords, are Tom Jenks and Brown.
Brown, a varsity football player
as are all three Stanford heavy
weight fighters, has fought to
three draws while Jenks has
pounded out convincing victories
in all three of his varsity bouts.
Against Chico State the In
dians displayed definite capa
bilities, however, several close
bouts cost them the match.
Three bouts ended in a draw.
However, as Coach Ray Lunny
put it, "A good varsity fight will
do more for a fighter than a
week of practice."
Strong Point: Heavies
Stanford's strong point lies in
their heavier fighter. Although,
de Gooyer and Oswald have
fought only three bouts between
them they are undefeated. In
these three bouts two have end
ed as technical knockouts. r
Besides Jenks in 172, Dennis
Hansen is also a formidable
fighter, sustaining his first de
feat last week. George Bellows
and Jim Marlar, both fighting
in the 156-pound class, are ex
tremely effective if given the
opportunity to really box.

Last week Bellows was
matched with an opponent con
siderably taller than himself
against Cal, Marlar's foe revert
ed to free-swinging tactics and
subsequently not allowing Mar
lar to employ his ring abilities.
Marlar lost the fight.
Next week Stanford will again
meet Cal at Berkeley. In their
initial match the Bears won 8-5.
The Indians now stand 1-2 on
the season with both defeats
coming in conference action.
