# Matmen Meet Four Teams In Weekend
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity wrestlers
embarked on their toughest
weekend of the season with a
dual meet against the Oregon
Ducks last night. The grapplers
meet defending AAWU champs
Oregon State tonight, and face
both Washington and WSU to
morrow.
The Cards blasted UCLA,
26-9, and UCSB, 24-9, last week
end.
Both Oregon teams should
give the Cards a real battle. The
Ducks and the Beavers both
beat Cal Poly, the team that
did in the Indians at the start
of the year. Nearly all matches
in those two meets were ex

tremely close, as were those be
tween Stanford and Cal Poly.
Indian coach Bill Leland
looked optimistically at the
weekend's prospects. "The team
has improved greatly since the
start of the season, and I think
we have the potential to upset
the Oregon teams."
Odds Are Good
Leland saw the Stanford mat
men's chances "at the best, an
upset, and at the worst, a series
of very tight matches."
Oregon's Bob Mitchell is a re
turning conference at 157
pounds. Bruce Glenn, wrestling
167 or 177, has been impressive
in every bout so far this season.
Leland sees Oregon as very
strong in the lower weights,
with Stanford having the edge
in the middle divisions. In the
upper divisions, it's a tossup.
Steve Schaum and Frank
Pratt, conference runners-up at
160 and 167, will be hard to
beat. Mike Davison, 177 pound
co-captain, is always a tough
man to handle.
Two Cluimps For Beavers
Oregon State boasts confer
ence champions in the 167 and
unlimited brackets this week
end.
OSU won the AAWU crown
last season, then placed seventh
in the NCAA's. The Beavers
went on to win the National
AAU Tournament last spring.
Washington and Washington
State should provide a change
of pace from the grueling com
petition of last night and to
day.
The Stanford frosh rolled
over the Moffett Field Naval
Air Force squadron last Wed
nesday night, 33-9. The Pa
pooses scored four pins against
the airmen.
Dick Kilpatrick, Roy Milwid,
Len Borchers, and Burt Ambler
all pinned their opponents be
fore the third round got under
way.

strong in the lower weights,
with Stanford having the edge
in the middle divisions. In the
upper divisions, it's a tossup.
Steve Schaum and Frank
Pratt, conference runners-up at
160 and 167, will be hard to
beat. Mike Davison, 177 pound
co-captain, is always a tough
man to handle.
Two Cluimps For Beavers
Oregon State boasts confer
ence champions in the 167 and
unlimited brackets this week
end.
OSU won the AAWU crown
last season, then placed seventh
in the NCAA's. The Beavers
went on to win the National
AAU Tournament last spring.
Washington and Washington
State should provide a change
of pace from the grueling com
petition of last night and to
day.
The Stanford frosh rolled
over the Moffett Field Naval
Air Force squadron last Wed
nesday night, 33-9. The Pa
pooses scored four pins against
the airmen.
Dick Kilpatrick, Roy Milwid,
Len Borchers, and Burt Ambler
all pinned their opponents be
fore the third round got under
way.
This weekend, the freshmen
and junior varsity wrestlers
will participate in the Vallejo
Invitational AAU Tournament.
Stanford's varsity wrestlers
embarked on their toughest
weekend of the season with a
dual meet against the Oregon
Ducks last night. The grapplers
meet defending AAWU champs
Oregon State tonight, and face
both Washington and WSU to
morrow.
The Cards blasted UCLA,
26-9, and UCSB, 24-9, last week
end.
Both Oregon teams should
give the Cards a real battle. The
Ducks and the Beavers both
beat Cal Poly, the team that
did in the Indians at the start
of the year. Nearly all matches
in those two meets were ex

tremely close, as were those be
tween Stanford and Cal Poly.
Indian coach Bill Leland
looked optimistically at the
weekend's prospects. "The team
has improved greatly since the
start of the season, and I think
we have the potential to upset
the Oregon teams."
Odds Are Good
Leland saw the Stanford mat
men's chances "at the best, an
upset, and at the worst, a series
of very tight matches."
Oregon's Bob Mitchell is a re
turning conference at 157
pounds. Bruce Glenn, wrestling
167 or 177, has been impressive
in every bout so far this season.
Leland sees Oregon as very
strong in the lower weights,
with Stanford having the edge
in the middle divisions. In the
upper divisions, it's a tossup.
