# Gymnasts Face San Jose State This Afternoon
## 
### 
Coach John Gilmore's depleted
gymnastics squad faces two op
ponents this weekend. The In
dians face San Jose State Friday
night at 7:30 in the Pavilion,
then travel to meet the San Fran
cisco State Dons Saturday
ternoon.
The gymnasts, hampered by
the no-shows of many of last
year's varsity, a new rules
change which puts emphasis on
depth, and an almost unbelieva
ble crescendo of illnesses and in
juries, competed with only two
team members last week.
Captain Bob Cook and Bill
Fisher took on six events each
against Chico State. The two ac
cumulated 85 points against
Chico's 125 team total.
Bob Smith, downed by a bad
cold last week, hopefully will
be able to compete this week
end.
Pete Gibson, hurting from a
torn ligament, could not exer
cise last week.
