# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Tuition, Booze, AndThe American Way 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
On January 25, I laid before
department officers a proposal
for changing tuition charges for
Ph.D. candidates. This proposal
had been drafted by the Execu
tive Committee of the Commit
tee on the Graduate Division.
It was viewed as a minor part
of a general long-range effort
to increase the currently low
ratio between those who enter
Stanford as hopeful graduate
students and those who emerge
as successful Ph.D.'s. Consider
able discussion has resulted.
This was what we had hoped
for, but I regret that most of it,
and in particular the Daily's edi
torial on Monday morning,
ignores some of the facts. Re
stating these may avoid waste
motion.
The essential fact is that the
present residence requirement
of three years means that every
Ph.D. must pay the equivalent
of three years' tuition, at pres
ent $4,725. Reducing the resi
dence requirement to two years
should not affect the work re
quired for the degree, but it
would reduce the tuition in
volved to $3,150. A student who
is ready for his dissertation
may now take terminal regis
tration at $40 a quarter. But if
the total tuition paid—regular
and terminal does not total
$4,725 before he gets his Ph.D.,
he is held to a final lump-sum
payment of any deficiency. This
seems to many of us an illogical
and confusing way of collecting
tuition, even though the three
year requirement takes into ac
count heavy costs to the Uni
versity involved in writing and
supervising a dissertation.
In theory, therefore, the new
schedule would represent a con
siderable savings for a high pro
portion of Ph.D. candidates —at
least half, so far as one can
gather on the basis of latest
statistics. A few comparative
figures will make this clear. Un
der the new system, a student
who takes three years will pay
$3,750 in tuition ($3,150 plus
$600; the $200 dissertation fee
does not apply in the summer).
For four, he will pay $4,350;
even five years will cost only a
few dollars more than the pres
ent charge. To cite another
common situation, the student
who studies full time during the
first year and works as a T.A.
or R.A. during the following
years, will have over five years
before he pays more than the
present tuition requirement.
In fact, however, almost all
Ph.D. candidates beyond the
first year who are deemed by
their departments to be making
satisfactory progress have their
tuition paid for them, either
through fellowships or through
the tuition grants that accomp
any teaching or research assist
antships. There is no intetion
to change this policy; we are
constantly trying, in fact, to
find more money to support
graduate students. What consti
tutes satisfactory progress var
ies markedly among academic
areas, as does the nature of the
Ph.D. itself, and decisions as to
satisfactory progress must be
made by departments. In fact,
all attempts to improve our
Ph.D. program must center in
the departments involved.
In terms of money paid out
of their pockets, the proposed
changes would therefore affect
only three categories of stu
dents; (1) the very small num
ber of advanced Ph.D. candi
dates who are paying their own
tuition might save a good deal
of money and earn a well-de
served reward—sloss if they
finished in the minimum three
years, $455 if they finished in
four; (2) students at Stanford
who had been around for five
or more years and who lost the
confidence and financial sup
port of their departments would
begin to incur costs beyond the
present charges; and (3) stu
dents who left Stanford with
out the degree to take a posi
tion and went beyond five years
before completing their disser
tation would also incur addition
al charges.
A few complicated but minor
details have been omitted, but
I hope that this outline will
clarify the situation.

• Unscrupulous WCTU
Editor, The Daily:
We fear that while good citi
zens slept, the neighboring city
of Palo Alto has become fertile
ground for the schemes of the
unscrupulous WCTU, a possi
ble haven for perverts, dope
pushers, and sex peddlers.
In order to preserve the vital
ity, the widely recognized great
ness, and the excellent environ
ment around Stanford, we pro
pose that slick operators w ho
write anonymous letters to par
ents be banned from within 1 \'i
miles of the campus.

ooncerned and thirsty degene

• (inward, Mothers
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to commend the
Mothers of Stanford University
for their Christian spirits as
shown in their stand against
the encrouchment of the Stan
ford View. These women are
certainly upholders of every
thing which has lead God, in Ilis
wisdom, to shower His blessings
on the University and S.L.A.C.
The way is now clear to contin
ue these good women's cam
paign: first, we must put an
end to hypocrisy, tobacco must
be banquished from the campus
and especially Tresidder Union;
secondly, innocent undergradu
ates must no longer be lead
astray by dirty old men; third
ly, present regulations prohibit
ing alcohol in residences and fra
ternities must be strictly en
forced (thankfully this is not
the East); fourthly, liquor must
be banquished from Escondido
Village. This is Married Student
Housing. Many married students
have children of their own; can
you honestly imagine a more
corrupting influence for these
babes (in arm no less!) than to
see their parents, whom they
should respect, totally drunk?
In summary, we live in a sin
ful world. The University must
act as a buffer and protect
those, innocent as the driven
snow, from the horrors of con
temporary Godless America. Let
us hope the Trustees reaffirm
the fundamental Christian pol
icy.

• Shameful Slogan
Editor, The Daily:
The Batman signs that have
been spattered about the cam
pus in the past few days enclos
ing the slogan "Kill VC", are
shameful and obscene. However
one feels about the dilemma of
Vietnam (I confess that I am
still too perplexed about the is
sues myself either to censure
or approve the conduct of the
Johnson administration in that
country), these signs are no
mere prank but an outrage to
anyone with a conscience. They
are symptoms, as I read them,
of a growing insensitivity in
our people, too many of whom
appear to be ready to delight in
the act of killing (which is one
regrettable means) as though it
were the end itself of our being
in Vietnam. If the national mood
is tending in that direction, bet
ter to lose the world than be
come so brutalized. That sol
diers have to destroy their fel
low men is tragic precisely be
cause the soldier in close com
bat knows that he is killing real

human beings like himself. But
to lust for wholesale slaughter
from the safe seats outside the
arena is to deny not only the
victims', but also one's own,
share in a common humanity.

• Demagogue Hole
Editor, The Daily:
Concerning the debate over
our country's resumption of
bombing in North Vietnam, it
seems tragic to me that, at least
in The Daily, supporters of this
policy have been cast in the
role of ranting irrational dema
gogues. The issue of February
3 is a good example. Support
ers of the bombing are seen as
running frantically around the
campus painting "Kill VC" on
everything available. The article
by Mr. Stone suggests that
questioning of national policy is
an anarchical attack on the
Constitution. 11 seems only fair
to point out that many who be
lieve it is our right and duty to
question national policy when
we feel it is wrong also support
the decision to resume bombing.
It is only fair to say that some,
confronted with contradictory
statements of "fact" about. Viet
nam, have, quite rationally and
deliberatively, chosen to believe
our President rather than our
professors. Some who recognize
the tragedy of war nevertheless
feel that freedom is important
enough to die for, even if it is
not our own freedom, but the
freedom of someone living
10,000 miles away.

• On-Going Effort
Editor, The Daily:
Protests are in vogue these
days. But the honest white heat
against Mr. Johnson's now-in
famous decision has already be
gun to fade, and in a few days
there will be relatively little vo
cal complaint. Although I can
not agree entirely with the
SCPV, I must thank them for
impressing on the Stanford
community the gravity of John
son's decision and confronting
us with the responsibility for
doing something about it.
The most important issue fac
ing each one of us as individuals
is, of course, whether we are for
this Vietnam war or against it.
Let me make it clear right now
that I myself am for our with
drawal from Vietnam; neverthe
less I think that SCPV errs in
thinking that it can persuade
the Stanford community as a
whole to support its views. We
are unfortunately too divided
on this issue to act as one upon

it, and SCPV must realize that
they will not represent a great
majority of the Stanford popula
tion but only those who agree
with them.
Still there remains the ques
tion of exactly what we can do
as an entire community about
the Vietnam situation. I there
fore submit the following propo
sition as one upon/which most
of us can agree, whether we are
for or against the war: that Mr.
Johnson, not matter what his in
tentions, was wrong not to con
sult Congress and let them de
bate the bombing issue at length
before ho decided to drop bombs
again on North Vietnam; that
his action is an example of exec
utive power too far extended.
What then, can we do? Mr.
Keating told us Monday after
noon; write our Senators and
Congressmen. I agree with him
that this is the best course of
action. One wonders why Con
gress let Johnson hoodwink
them so long and why the Sen
ate waited ten days after they
began their new session before
they started debate on Vietnam.
A good reason may be, as Rev.
Coffin suggested, that most of
their constituents did not ex
press urgent and persistent con
cern until just before that time.
That means that we gave Mr.
Johnson the opportunity to ig
nore us.
Precisely because protests of
any sort are so much in vogue
among college people, the ma
jority of those outside our inner
cities ignore them or regard
them at most as disturbing pub
lic nuisances. And no matter how
much mail we send Congress,
if we stop it in a week or ten
days, the majority of them will
say, "See those crackbrained col
lege kids? Give them a few days
to cool off and they'll end their
nonsense." We will move Con
gress only if we send them a
great amount of mail over a
long, continuous span of time.
If we consider ourselves adults
we must accept full responsibili
ty as such; we cannot escape
the war now. At the risk of bor
ing our legislators and incon
veniencing ourselves, we must
write them about Ihis issue
again and again, after it be
comes less of a novelty and less
fashionable and noticeable to do
so.

• Up From Immobility
Editor, The Daily:
For all of Dr. Possony's de
bunking the demonstration, he
must know of many a time
when a mighty clamor has pro
duced a mighty thing. Discus
sions have a deadpoint. Gov

ernments do feel the ground
swell.
The past Saturday I might
have sat at my desk making
money. I might have tuned in
a speaker, or a panel. Or read
the papers.
But it seemed that one of the
greatest weeks in Stanford's
iife was upon me. Knowing
none of the faculty or students
who invoked it. I yet felt that
whether or nut I did the demon
stration any good, getting into
it would do me some—shake
me out of immobility. It did.

• 'Daily' Errs Again
Editor, The Daily:
It is perfectly permissible,
that The Daily have its strong
editorial opinions on contempor
ary issues, especially on one so
important as the war in Viet
nam, and it is fruitful for The
Daily to challenge our reasons
for supporting the Administra
tions' policy in this area. How
ever, it is a little excessive to
impute us with a frivolous atti
tude towards what is a very
serious matter for the United
States and for the world. John
Hancock, who signed our letter
which appeared in Monday's
Daily but whom you did not see
fit to include among the list of
signers, is not a joking inven
tion of ours. John Hancock is a
bona fide student here at Stan
ford and is a member of the
Walter Army Society. If you
had any doubts, you might have
checked in the student directory
or at least left his existence to
be challenged by your reader
ship. If we were playing games,
we would have made fools of
ourselves. The Daily's policy is,
I thought, to leave letters un
tampered with—it is most cer
tainly not to decide who signed
a letter and who did not, or who
exists in The Daily's eyes and
who does not!

(Editor's note: The deletion of
Mr. Hancock's name was purely
an unintentional typographical
omission for which The Daily
apoligizes.)
• . . . And Again
Editor, The Daily:
"Hey, where's that story on
SSRF for page three?"
"Oh, Kirk wrote it. All they're
doing is passing out literature
on legalizing abortion and sell
ing 'Love Is' pins."
"What happened to the
'Fondle' pins? After we made
up 'Fondle It' as their slogan
in that article Reg Day you'd
think they'd have made a mint."
"Yeah—they did come in a
few weeks ago and say they'd
gotten some more pins and
wanted to know if they could
write a column about legaliz
ing abortion."
"Nobody would read an ar
ticle like that. Hey, how does
this sound? 'A short time after
arriving as a "naive, unexperi
enced freshman" she changed
her mind about free love.' "
"Great! All we need is a
catchy headline and we can run
it on page one. What was it the
Chronicle used for their ar
ticle?"
"Something about the double
standard."
"Oh, that's on its way out.
Say, if we play up the angle of
this girl we may have to leave
out part of their statement,
but. .
"Wait a minute, don't you
think we ought to at least tell
her what we're doing? After
all, The Daily is a responsible
paper."
"Oh, we called her up last
night to ask what SSRF is do
ing so we'd have something for
an article. Besides, she's a good
kid, oughta be able to take a
joke. They should be glad for
some publicity."

Editor, The Daily:
My name should not have ap
peared in the Vietnam ad on

• Sophomoric?
Editor, The Daily:
In a way it is too bad that so
many big guns came out against
Mr. Stone. He is only a sopho
more and probably only 18 or 19
years old. Give him time; he'll
grow up.
