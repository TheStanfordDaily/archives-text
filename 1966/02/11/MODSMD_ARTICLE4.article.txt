"It is an old American custom to
build counter-institutions that claim
to be more free than their predeces
sors. In this way the Free University
of Palo Alto is in part a criticism of
existing institutions —" Roy Kepler
said in an interview with the Daily.
Kepler is one of the founders of a
"Free University" being established
in the Palo Alto area, which has no
prerequisites for admission, no sys
tem of grades or credits, no grants or
degrees, and a tuition of only $15 per
semester.
"Discuss and Learn"
"It is partially a response to the
growing demand for education as
seen in the universal development of
study groups and adult education,"
Kepler said. The university is planned
to provide a center in which people
of the community can come together
to discuss and to learn, unencum
bered by the restrictions found in con
ventional educational structures.
"The Free University's immediate

roots go back to the FSM movement
at Berkeley when people thought
there should be a free university,"
Kepler said, adding that the experi
ment is a response to the nation-wide
situation of student unrest and skep
ticism about present society manifest
in the development of the "new left."
Registration
Registration will take place on Sun
day, February 13, at East Palo Alto
Women's Club. Felix Green, authority
on China, will speak and lead an open
discussion at 3 p.m. Registration will
occur between 2 and 6 p.m.
The university will allow any per
son of any age to instruct. The only
qualification required of teachers is
that they draw a class of students will
ing to investigate the topic presented.
Teachers and students will meet and
work as equals at all times. The foun
ders of this new university believe
such a fluid structure will encourage
radical questioning and the pursuit of
truth in subject areas felt essOiitial
and relevant to life by both students
and teachers.
Radicals
Most of the founders are graduate
students at Stanford who have been
active in civil rights and peace move
ments. "They are radicals of various
kinds who feel social injustice, a
whole range of people taking a radical
look at society," Kepler said.
An important part of the Free Uni
versity is the establishment of a study
center in or near East Palo Alto. The
center will provide a learning situa
tion for the citizens of this communi
ty who are primarily Negroes. Nego
tiations are now underway for the
purchase of a house to be used as this
study center. Until facilities are ac
quired, classes and seminars will meet
in private homes.
Fluid Organization
The fluid course organization of the
university, determined solely by stu
dent demand, will, according to the
founders, allow the presentation of
practical and higher education topics
that are thought essential by the mem
bers of the community themselves.
Kepler emphasized that the univer
sity is open and free to studies of al
most any problem from any approach
—right or left.
Such opposite doctrincs as "Marxi
an dialectical materialism" and "non
violence and its social organization"
are among courses presently planned.
More conventional subjects, "Crea
tive Writing," "The U. S. Economy,"
and "History of Mathematical
Thought," are also included.
A special feature of the Free Uni
versity is a weekly forum entitled

"Behind The News." This seminar is
an open discussion of contemporary
events such as the Vietnam question
and appraisal of Far Eastern policy.
It is presently meeting on Sunday af
ternoons and is open to the public at
no charge.
