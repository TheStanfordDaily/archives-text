# Potential Sponsors To Meet
## 
### 
An informal meeting for stu
dents interested in applying to
be men's sponsors will be held
I Monday evening at 7:30 in the
small lounge of Tresidder.
The following is the sponsor's
judgment of the qualities nec
essary to be a Wilbur sponsor:
Requirements
"To attempt a definition of
what a sponsor is runs the risk
of limiting the diversity and
creativity which are the basis
of the Wilbur sponsor system,
what is appropriate and helpful
at one time may not be at an
other. Sensitivity and mature
judgment should be prerequis
ites of a sponsor.
We are looking for men who
bring an intellectual vitality
that is contagious, whose inter
ests are far-reaching, who are
committed to the creation of an
academic community at Wilbur
Hall.
Mutual Respect
Certainly there is no com
munity without mutual respect
and concern. A sponsor must
accept each freshman in his
full individuality. There can be
no substitute for tolerance and
a willingness to hear and to
share the concerns of others.
"A sponsor should be an emo
tionally mature person, self
Â« aware, capable of independent
thought and responsible leader
ship. As an informal counselor,
the sponsor should be person
able, fair, and approachable,
respecting the complete free
dom of each freshman to make
his own choices. It is hoped that
the sponsor will have a world
view and ethic capable of articu
lation but not offered as norma
tive.
Old Tradition
"Sponsoring is one of the fin
est traditions at Stanford at
least several decades old. Those
who have been sponsors find
the experience immensely de
manding and rewarding. Each
sponsor joins with the other
two sponsors in his Wilbur
house, the Faculty Resident,
and the freshmen house officers
in the creation of a community
life largely of the students own
making."

Meier said the gap between the
have and have-not nations is widen
ing and the growth rate of underde
veloped countries has slowed notic
ably.
"We're slipping away from the
target of 2V6 per cent annual growth
in poor countries, he said.
During 1950-55, the rate averaged
3 per cent. From 1955-60 it fell to 2
per cent, and in the past five years it
dropped to lVs per cent.
Many underdeveloped countries
"overestimated the results and under
estimated the problems" in central
planning. While they had the intellec
tual skills to formulate plans, they
lacked the ability to execute them.
As a result, he said, "There has
been a retrenchment from heavy
planning" and "much greater scope
has been given to the private sector"
in less developed countries.
Meier noted that almost half the
foreign aid other countries receive
from the U.S. is returning to this
country with debt service.
"We've reached a plateau in foreign
aid just when countries could use
more capital from us" on the order
of $3-$4 billion additional aid over the
next five years.
Enlarged Need?
This greatly enlarged need should
be met in part from Europe and also
through expansion of the world bank,
he suggested.
Human resources are even more
important than capital in developing
poor nations, he indicated. "The gov
ernment's technical assistance record
is not the best," he commented. "This
is where the private sector excels."
Many less developed countries have
found their attempts to substitute
their own products for imported
goods has been "very costly," he
added. Their economies are too small,
monopolies spring up and resources
are diverted from export expansion.
"A reaction has set in," he said,
"with a shift of emphasis toward ex
port promotion.
He criticized current efforts of
poor countries to ask the rich for
discriminatory trade protection in
favor of their agricultural products
and manufactured goods.
