## 
### 
A classroom strike attempted
Wednesday at Berkeley has been
called a failure by the school's top
officials.
The walkout, callcd by the Vietnam
Day Committee, was similar to the
"strike" at Stanford last week.
Normal Attendance
University officials at the Univer
sity of California said that attendance
on Wednesday appeared to be normal.
The small VDC noon rally dissolved
when the campus bells rang for one
o'clock classes.
Three VDC members who had pre
viously been charged with violating
a new campus rally rule appeared al
all-day public hearing before the Cam
pus Rules Committee. The rule pro
hibits more than one rally a week by
any one group.
