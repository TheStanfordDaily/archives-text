# LASSU Delays Sponsor Action
## 
### 
In a move of diplomacy the Legisla
ture last night postponed final action
on the Wilbur sponsor selection pro
cedure.
It did pass a resolution "strongly
urging" the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUGE) to adopt
a procedure which would, in effect,
relegate the Wilbur Faculty-Master
to an advisory capacity in the selection
process. A bill supporting such a pro
cedure came before the Legislature
last night, and was referred back to
the Student Affairs Committee.
Intention
The intention behind these actions
was to leave the way open for further
negotiations. In the words of the reso
lution, the Legislature hoped that
further meetings be held "with the
object of arriving at mutually accepta
ble resolution of the points of dis
agreement."
It was hoped that the Legislature
would open the way to negotiations
if it suspended unilateral action. It
was thought desirable to avoid "be
coming the initiator of the conflict."
This thinking rested on a new-born
principle of "prior consultation" as
stated in the resolution. It means a
"willingness to negotiate differences
and is not merely a mechanism for
announcing hostile intentions."
In taking this position the Legisla
ture hoped to avoid presenting CUGE,
which will meet to consider the issue
today, with a fait accompli. There

would then be, argued ASSU Presi
dent Sandy MacKenzie who intro
duced the resolution, "a real possi
bility to iron out differences." This
appeared to be the sentiment of the
body which overwhelmingly approved
the resolution.
Nothing to Lose
One representative remarked, "We
lose nothing and we have everything
to gain."
Before approving the resolution, the
Legislature soundly rejected an
amendment which would have made
the choices of the selection committee
final.
This amendment was directed at a
proposal by Wilbur Faculty Master
Eric Hutchinson that we have final
veto power over sponsors chosen by
the committee. The intent of the
amendment was to nullify such a
veto.
It is this veto that the sponsors
have opposed, and it is this veto which
has emerged as the focal point in the
controversy.
In other action, the Legislature re
scinded the Feb. 25 implementation
date for the extension of overnight
signout. They also re-affirmed their
faith in the joint resolution setting
up the Committee of Fifteen.
The resolution states that all three
constituiencies of the Committee of
Fifteen —the faculty, the administra
tion, and the student —be consulted
in issues of general interest, such as
social regulations.
General Study
The extension of overnight signout
is now going to be included in a gen
eral study of social regulations by
the Social Regulations Committee.
According to Speaker of the Legisla
ture Jay Kadane, this study will be
completed in the second week of
Spring uarter.
In the resolution, LASSU also re
affirmed its conviction that the
changes in overnight signout were
"neither major nor substantive."
During the Speaker's report,
LASSU moved to a closed committee
of the whole to discuss the work of
the Committee of Fifteen. The dis
cussion, which was off the record,
lasted over an hour.
