Called to Freedom
In our great land of liberty where freedom is so treasured men can march
and speak and protest strongly whether right or wrong. Our religious heritage
and democratic government potects the privilege of exploring life and being
oneself without oppression and authoratarian control from church or state.
A nation is only the projection of many individuals, the collective body
which represents our hearts. When some are not free, all are bound, when
some are hurt all must suffer; the family of man is interconnected. But only
a few Americans have discovered the basis of our heritage and the spiritual
principles of life which set men free. Jesus Christ said, "If you continue in
my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth and the truth
will make you free. Ever one who commits sin is a servant of sin. The
servant does not continue in his house forever, the Son continues forever. So
if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
To find the cause of sin and bonage, God looks at me and tells me I
must change. To serve myself is to invite disaster and contribute, in the end,
to war. Helpless men we lack the power and must always serve a hidden
Master of our lives. What Jesus Christ died for, few men have asked for: the
power and strength of Almighty God. The New Testament says, "For freedom
Christ has set you free; stand fast therefore and do not submit again to a
yoke of salvery . . . For you were called to freedom brethern, only do not
use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh but through love be servants
of one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in this one word, 'you shall
love your neighbor as yourself'."
Have you accepted the gift of Life, responded to the call to freedom?
Has Jesus Christ, the Son of God released you from yourself? Do you know
the law of love and the power of God which makes men what they ought to
be? Why not take the gift which Jesus offers?
