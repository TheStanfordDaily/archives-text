# Agreement Reached On Sponsor Selection
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
Dr. Eric Hutchinson, Wilbur Fac
ulty Master, and Wilbur Head Spon
sor A 1 Taylor reached an agreement
Friday on a plan for selection of
next year's sponsors.
Under the new plan, the Sponsor
Selection Committee's choices would
be final unless Hutchinson has reser
vations on some of the selections, in
which case a student-faculty appeals
board would make the final decision
on these individual cases.
The compromise, however, came
after a meeting of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education (CUE) at
which that committee reaffirmed its
position that the final decision on
sponsor selection rests with CUE.
(The full text of CUE's resolution

appears on Page 3.)
The appeals board would be com
posed of two sponsors, to be chosen
by the Head Sponsor; one faculty
resident, to be chosen by the faculty
residents; one member of CUE, to be
chosen by CUE; and a fifth member
to be chosen unanimously by the
other four from the University as a
whole. None of the appeals board
members would be a member of the
original Selection Committee.
Rober J. Wert, Dean of Undergrad
uate Education and chairman of CUE,
said Sunday he had heard about the
new proposal, and planned to dis
cuss it with Taylor today.
According to Wert, Friday's resolu
tion is the last action CUE will take
on sponsor selection.

Wert said he has talked to Presi
dent Sterling, and the matter of spon
sor selection will probably be referred
to the Committee of Fifteen.
At a meeting Friday night the
sponsors unanimously accepted the
compromise plan agreed to that after
noon and rejected CUE's resolution.
It is expected that the faculty resi
dents and the house presidents will
also accept the compromise.
Taylor said "the sponsors are ex
tremely pleased that a satisfactory
agreement to the sponsor selection
problem has been reached by those
working together at Wilbur, the Fac
ulty Master, the faculty residents,
the freshmen, and the sponsors."
"We trust it will be evident to all
why the sponsors favor the agree

ment made with the Faculty Master.
It is oviously more desirable that an
appeals board with student repre
sentation have the final say than
that a solely faculty committee have
it," Taylor said.
Commenting on the probability

that the matter will be turned over
to the Committee of Fifteen, Taylor
added, "We are eager that the Com
mitee of Fifteen swiftly ratify the
agreement reached at Wilbur, in or
der that sponsor selection may be
undertaken as soon as possible."

The composition of the Selection
Committee has been generally agreed
upon, although there is still some
question concerning whether the Fac
ulty Master or CUE will have a veto
over the members appointed to the
committee.

problem has been reached by those
working together at Wilbur, the Fac
ulty Master, the faculty residents,
the freshmen, and the sponsors."
"We trust it will be evident to all
why the sponsors favor the agree

ment made with the Faculty Master.
It is oviously more desirable that an
appeals board with student repre
sentation have the final say than
that a solely faculty committee have
it," Taylor said.
Commenting on the probability

that the matter will be turned over
to the Committee of Fifteen, Taylor
added, "We are eager that the Com
mitee of Fifteen swiftly ratify the
agreement reached at Wilbur, in or
der that sponsor selection may be
undertaken as soon as possible."

The composition of the Selection
Committee has been generally agreed
upon, although there is still some
question concerning whether the Fac
ulty Master or CUE will have a veto
over the members appointed to the
committee.
Dr. Eric Hutchinson, Wilbur Fac
ulty Master, and Wilbur Head Spon
sor A 1 Taylor reached an agreement
Friday on a plan for selection of
next year's sponsors.
Under the new plan, the Sponsor
Selection Committee's choices would
be final unless Hutchinson has reser
vations on some of the selections, in
which case a student-faculty appeals
board would make the final decision
on these individual cases.
The compromise, however, came
after a meeting of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education (CUE) at
which that committee reaffirmed its
position that the final decision on
sponsor selection rests with CUE.
(The full text of CUE's resolution

appears on Page 3.)
The appeals board would be com
posed of two sponsors, to be chosen
by the Head Sponsor; one faculty
resident, to be chosen by the faculty
residents; one member of CUE, to be
chosen by CUE; and a fifth member
to be chosen unanimously by the
other four from the University as a
whole. None of the appeals board
members would be a member of the
original Selection Committee.
Rober J. Wert, Dean of Undergrad
uate Education and chairman of CUE,
said Sunday he had heard about the
new proposal, and planned to dis
cuss it with Taylor today.
According to Wert, Friday's resolu
tion is the last action CUE will take
on sponsor selection.

Wert said he has talked to Presi
dent Sterling, and the matter of spon
sor selection will probably be referred
to the Committee of Fifteen.
At a meeting Friday night the
sponsors unanimously accepted the
compromise plan agreed to that after
noon and rejected CUE's resolution.
It is expected that the faculty resi
dents and the house presidents will
also accept the compromise.
Taylor said "the sponsors are ex
tremely pleased that a satisfactory
agreement to the sponsor selection
problem has been reached by those
working together at Wilbur, the Fac
ulty Master, the faculty residents,
the freshmen, and the sponsors."
