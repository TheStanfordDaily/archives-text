### BARBARA LEVIN 
A total of $3000 in prizes will
be awarded to Stanford under
graduates this spring for crea
tive achievements in the arts
and sciences, according to Eliza
beth Webb, representative of
the Undergraduate Creative De
velopment Committee.
Thirty different awards, to be
known as the Stanford Prizes,
will be presented in nine cate
gories for original art works,
essays, and engineering designs.
First, second, and third prizes
of $150, $100, and $50, respective
ly, will be given in the fields of
art, music, poetry, fiction, and
engineering. The Departments of
English, Speech and Drama, En
gineering, Art, and Music have
worked with the sponsoring fac
ulty committee in the planning
of the competition, Mrs. Webb
commented.
Essays in the general areas of
humanities, social sciences, and
natural sciences will also be
judged and will receive special
awards. These papers, approxi
mately 7500 words, will be hon

ored by tjjree cash prizes in each
of the three divisions. The en
tries will be evaluated by mem
bers of departments most close
ly related to the topic. Senior
honors paper are eligible.
Deadlines Given
The rules for the more spe
cific areas have been estab
lished by the co-ordinating de
partment. In general the works,
if written, should be typed and
submitted in triplicate. The en
try dates vary with department.
The English Department has
asked that all poetry and fic
tion works be submitted by April
1. Music entries are due April
23, while art and drama have a
closing day of May 2. Engineer
ing projects will be accepted
until May 26.
Two sets of prizes are offered
in art, the divisions being de
termined by either two-dimen
sional or three â€¢ dimensional
works.
The Drama awards are open
to outstanding performances in
acting, directing, or scene de
sign as exhibited already in
Stanford theater productions
during the 1965-66 year. Original
plays and set designs will also
be considered.
The Music Department has re
quired that competitors file an
application with Professor Le
land Smith. Candidates will be
judged for either composition or
performanpe or both.
Prizes for engineering, per
haps the most unique aspect of
the series according to Mrs.
Webb, will be given to entries
which involve an original con
cept of general engineering. Ten
examples have been set up by
the judges, including an essay,
science fiction and a mathemati
cal theory.
Undergrade Only
Mrs. Webb explained that
only undergraduates at Stanford
are eligible for the prizes. She
added that more information
will be published on the Stan
ford Prizes and can be obtained
from her in her office, 92H, in
the Philosophy building.
The Undergraduate Develop
ment Committee which Mrs.
Webb represents is a faculty
sub-committee chaired by Pro
fessor Albert Guerard. This
group was appointed last year
to study the most effective ways
to employ a large donation given
to the University to enrich the
undergraduate program. Since
last spring this committee has
been instrumental in formu
lating the freshman seminars
and the Undergraduate Publica
tion Fund. The Stanford Prizes
are the most recent develop
ment.
"It is the donor's conception
that all humans have something
creative to give to the rest of
mankind. He has established this
fund to foster that idea here at
Stanford," said Mrs. Webb.
