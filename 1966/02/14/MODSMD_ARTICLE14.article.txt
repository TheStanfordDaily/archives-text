# HEINEMAN RAVES
## MJQ Turns To Blues 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Modern Jazz Quartet and
the Dizzy Gillespie Quintet
played a full and delightful con
cert yesterday to an enthusi
astic capacity audience at Mem
orial Auditoi ium.
The MJQ, ed by pianist John
Lewis and h ghlighted by vibra
harpist Milt Jackson, played a
program mj de up entirely of
blues—a fail ly sharp departure
from their normal repertoire,
which inclut es many complex
and classica iy - oriented pieces
But if their program was a bit

unexpected, their superb music
ianship was not.
Jackson, unquestionably the
best blues player on vibes ex
tant, constructed chorus after
chorus of lilting, funky, driving
lines, so logically conceived that
it is difficult to believe they are
improvised.
Lewis, not a virtuoso musici
an in the same sense that Jack
son is, has a sensitive ear for
accompaniment; his piano
"fills" behind the vibist were
always appropriate.
In his own solos, Lewis

played conservative, bluesy
piano. It is refreshing to hear a
pianist still playing almost com
pletely within the bop idiom of
20 years ago, for the idiom is
still eminently valid.
Percy Heath (bass) and Con
nie Kay (drums) did not take
much solo space. Neither is a
showy musician, and so their
audiences often take their back
ground percussion for granted.
This is unfortunate; both are
superlative players, and Heath's
bass lines, especially, comple
ment the group improvisiation
in a degree attained by few
other bassists.
After a brief intermission,
Dizzy Gillespie took over — lit
erally. His dynamic and humor
ous presence pervaded the quin
tet's entire set.
The group featuring James
Moody (flute, alto and tenor),
Kenny Barron (piano) and new
ly-acquired Frank Schifano
(Fender bass) and Candy Finch
(drums), led off with a fast
paced Barren composition call
ed "Trinidad, Goodbye."
They followed with the often
requested "Con Aima" and then
with a version of "Tin Tin Deo"
featuring Gillespie, Schifano
and Finch. Gillespie displayed
his incredible technical facility
on both pieces; his muted lyric
ism on the latter was excep
tional.
The backing of Finch, who re
sponds to the demands of solo
ists remarkably well, was also
noteworthy, and the sense of
group unity conveyed was
really surprising, considering
that the bassist and drummer
have been with Gillespie two,
count 'em, two days.
The quintet next performed a
medley featuring Moody and
Barron. Barron played with a
pleasing mixture of fat-chorded
blues licks and surprisingly
delicate wisps of chords; he
knows how to use silences effec
tively, a gift with which not
enough pianists are endowed.
Gillespie then clowned his
way through a calypso vocal en
titled "Oh. Joe," a standard
with him. They finished with
a foot-tapping "No More Blues"
in which the three main soloists
stretched out, started cooking,
and left the audience applaud
ing for more.
