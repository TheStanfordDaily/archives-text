# Willow Road Connections Asked By SU
## 
### 
The University asked the City
of Palo Alto on Friday for per
mission to make new road con
nections between El Camino
Real, Willow Road and the cam
pus.
In a letter to the City Coun
cil, Stanford business manager
Alf E. Brandin said the new
roads are needed to take
through traffic around the Stan
ford Shopping Center and Med
ical Center.
Brandin said the University
would pay all construction costs
and share with the city the cost
of the intersection and traffic
lights on El Camino Real near
San Francisquito Creek.
Brandin commented that, "The
reason for this new connection
is to eliminate the traffic that
now goes through the medical
center parking lot for travel be
tween Willow Road and the cam
pus."
Pasteur Link
The Willow Road-campus con
nection would be a new link
from Pasteur Drive, the divided
road entrance to the medical
center, to the northerly end of
Serra Street.
"The extension of Willow
Road to El Camino Real is an
obvious need," Brandin said,
"with benefits to foothill resi
dents headed for Palo Alto or
El Camino Real, to the Palo
Alto businesses and residents
in the Willow-Welch road area,
to employes and visitors to the
medical center, and to campus
traffic."
