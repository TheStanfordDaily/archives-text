# Baseball Frosh Beat Varsity
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's polished Frosh
baseball team took a page out
of the book of the UCLA frosh
cagers as they defeated the In
dian varsity, 5-3, Saturday.
Two-run rallies in the second
and third innings and the first
home run hit over the new fence
in Sunken Diamond told the
tale. After that three Frosh
pitchers held the varsity to a
measely two hits.
Sandy Vance started on the
mound for Coach Ray Young's
Frosh. In the three innings that
he threw he struck out six men,
allowed one bloop single and no
earned runs. Vance picked up
the win.
Tom Krause threw the fourth

inning, allowing one run. Then
Don Rose came in and kept var
sity bats at bay for the last five
innings. He almost faltered in
the bottom of the ninth when
with two outs he walked two
men in a row. Hard-hitting Jim
Hibbs stepped up to the plate.
Rose squelched any possible last
minute heroics, though, by strik
ing Hibbs out on a 1-2 pitch.
Centerfielder Jack Hodges led
off the top of the second for the
Frosh by blasting Daro Quiring's
first pitch up the middle for a
long single. Chuck Hoffmeister
followed with a blooper down
the right field line which moved
Hodges to third. Hodges raced
home when the throw from right
was bobbled. Hoffmeister wound

up at third when the play was
over.
Shortstop Russ Tweet then
followed suit and blooped anoth
er hit into right scoring Hoffmei
ster. A double play and a long
fly ended the inning.
Middlekauff Scores
Varsity first baseman Pete
Middlekauff got one-half of the
varsity's hits when he looped a
single into short center to lead
off the bottom of the second. He
raced to third on a passed ball
and scored on an error. Vance
stopped it right there, though,
with two strike-outs and a fly
ball.
The Frosh added two more
runs in the next frame when
pitcher Chris Martin walked
four men and threw a wild pitch

Stanford's varsity baseball
team wUI play California
State of Hayward this Tues
day, February 15, and will
play the University of San
Francisco Friday. Saturday,
the Indians will play Minor
League Ail-Stars. All three
games will be in the Sunken
Diamond.

to let in one run. Bill Holt re
placed Martin and another run
scored when Hoffmeister layed
down a perfect squeeze bunt.
A good relay from Hoffmei
ster in left field to third baseman
Bob Boone to catcher Dennis
King prevented a would be var
sity rally in the fourth. Middle
kauff and Steve Hovley walked,
and Dick Swan slapped a sharp
single to left. Middlekauff tried
to score from second, but he
was thrown out at the plate.
Hovley went to third ton the
play and scored when Frank
Duffy forced Swan at second.
Sport's First
Leading 4-2, Frosh first sack
er Bob Gallagher put a little
icing on the cake and accom
plished a Stanford sport's first.
With no one on in the fifth he
lifted a high fly over the new
fence in right field, for the first
home run ever over the new
fence. The left handed slugger
hit it about 350 feet.
Frosh pitcher Do*n Rose got
off to a shakey start in his first
inning, the fifth, by walking the
first three men he faced.
He maintained his poise like
a veteran, though. He struck out
Larry Heath, walked Middle
kauff to force in a run, and then
got Hovley to hit into a double
play.
Rose had no trouble protect
ing his 5-3 lead after that ex
cept for the ninth.
Catchers King and Bob Edie
have to be given credit for quite

a few saves. A number of times
with men on base they would
block pitches which bounced in
the dirt and keep the ball in
front of them.
Good Fielder
In the field, third baseman
Boone displayed a steady glove
and a strong arm.
Besides Gallagher's home run,
Tweet lined a shot to left in the
eighth which bounced over the
fence on one hop for a double.
If it had had a few more feet of
altitude it might have carried
over the fence.
The varsity took some big cuts
up at the plate and the fans ex
pected them to explode at any
time, but the Frosh pitchers did
a good job of keeping them off
balance.
Varsity pitchers' Terry Dock
en and John Mason did a credit
able job. Each pitched one in
ning and each struck out three
men.
