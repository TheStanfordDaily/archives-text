• Dominicans Strike
SANTO DOMINGO — Inter-Ameri
can Peace Force patrols were beefed
up early today after a U. S. soldier
was shot and critically wounded by
snipers armed with automatic weap
ons.
The Dominican Army was ordered
to quarters Saturday by President
Hector Garcia-Godoy. No immediate
official reason was given for this
measure. It was believed taken, how
ever, to remove as many sources of
provocation as possible. Anti-military
sentiment is high among leftist na
tionalists, sympathizers of the Rebel
Constitutionalist Movement.
Meanwhile Former President Juan
Bosch moved to rally wider support
for a general strike that now seemed
mainly aimed at forcing at least two
Dominican military leaders out of the
country.
He stressed that the strike was to
bring about compliance to a Presiden
tial order issued Jan. 6 changing the
military high command and transfer
ring abroad three of the top four offi
cers.
The government has not yet spelled
out its position on the strike which
is strongest among government em
ployes and in the state-owned sugar
industry, chief producer of dollar rev
enues.

officers were reported to have threat
ened last week to resign if the gov
ernment opts for purchase of the
American planes.

• Dominicans Strike
SANTO DOMINGO — Inter-Ameri
can Peace Force patrols were beefed
up early today after a U. S. soldier
was shot and critically wounded by
snipers armed with automatic weap
ons.
The Dominican Army was ordered
to quarters Saturday by President
Hector Garcia-Godoy. No immediate
official reason was given for this
measure. It was believed taken, how
ever, to remove as many sources of
provocation as possible. Anti-military
sentiment is high among leftist na
tionalists, sympathizers of the Rebel
Constitutionalist Movement.
Meanwhile Former President Juan
Bosch moved to rally wider support
for a general strike that now seemed
mainly aimed at forcing at least two
Dominican military leaders out of the
country.
He stressed that the strike was to
bring about compliance to a Presiden
tial order issued Jan. 6 changing the
military high command and transfer
ring abroad three of the top four offi
cers.
The government has not yet spelled
out its position on the strike which
is strongest among government em
ployes and in the state-owned sugar
industry, chief producer of dollar rev
enues.
