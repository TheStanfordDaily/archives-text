# Indians' Basketball Team Loses Twice
## 
### ART ROSENWEIG 
Stanford lost hope of regain
ing conference dominion this
weekend and fortified first place
Oregon State's position.
The varsity cagers were de
feated twice in enemy territory,
first on Friday to Oregon, 66-57,
and then on Saturday to league
leading Oregon State, 63-57.
Now carrying an even 4-4 rec
ord in the AAWU, the Indians
had entered the weekend hoping
to avenge the defeat of the week
before, which had dropped them
from a first place tie. Their new
mark sets them in fourth place.
Lost Last Week
Last weekend Stanford played
host to the Oregon teams. After
turning away their first guest,
Oregon, the Braves fought out a
tight, tense contest with Oregon
State, which was then their part
ner for league laurels, and lost
it on a last-second lay-up by their
opponents.
Stanford started this week
end's series on the right track,
and jumped to an early lead
against Oregon. The first half of
that tilt saw Stanford shooting

50 per cent from the field to Ore
gon's 30.
But the Indians, who played
that game without the help of
their elusive ball handler, Guard
Gary Petersmeyi; \ lost the ball
ten times that period, and for all
their accuracy, the mid-game
scoreboard showed them with
only a slight 30-i'o edge
Kosanke In Trouble
Oregon gained a slight advan
tage when Stanfo r d's 6-9 starting
center, Ray Kose nke, fell into
foul trouble and was relieved
early in the second half. The
Ducks picked off the rebounds
and stepped up i.heir accuracy

just enough to pi til ahead with
five minutes to and win the
game 66-57.
Guard Art Harris was Stan
ford's sole shininjj scorer in the
game. Harris popped 10 from the
field and went 4 for 5 from the
foul line, totalling the game-high
of 24. Kosanke scored 9 points.
After the Oregon upset which
knocked down Stanford's
chances of getting into the num
ber once conference spot, the In
dians made an unsuccessful bid
to displace Oregon State from
the crowned standing in which
they had placed ths week before.
Same As F'.efore
This weekend's slow-moving,
titfor-tat battle simulated its
predecessor. The first half
swayed back and forth as the ball
was netted alternately by one
team and the other, but Stan
ford's fouling gave the Beavers
the opportunity 1o score a five
point slew from the line towards
the end of the cha|: ter. The latter
held a 32-28 lead a 1: half time.
Oregon State c ominated the
second half with accurate field
marksmanship which the Indi
ans couldn't match. The Beavers'
spread went up to 13 and down
again but was easily retained.
Stanford's full-court press, put
on late in the gmne, brought it
within six points jf Oregon State
as time ran out.
Dallmar Comments
"If there is a j;ood defensive
job done on any one of our three
top scorers, Harr s, Kosanke or
Bedell, we've gc 1 an offensive
problem," said St inford's varsity
coach, Howie Dallnnar, after Sat
urday night's game.
