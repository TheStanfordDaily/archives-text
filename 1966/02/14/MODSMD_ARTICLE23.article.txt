# Indian Swimmers Remain Unbeaten
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The cold wind blew hard in the Eneina Pool last Saturday, hard
enough to blow away two NCAA freshman records, four pool rec
ords, and five Stanford freshman records.
Stanford's varsity stretched their season record to 8-0 with an
81-14 drubbing of Santa Ana JC and a 68-27 victory over UCSB in
the double dual meet. The varsity meets the big test next weekend
when they face UCLA and NCAA champion USC in Los Angeles.

The frosh will stab at more
records against Long Beach City
College, Saturday at 2:00 p.m.,
here.
Stanford's freshmen won
every event to register a 75-
20 win over UCSB's freshman
squad. The Papooses are now 3-0
for the season.
Roth Rips IM Record
Dick Roth, world record hold
er for 400 meters individual
medley and Olympic champion
in that event, smashed the exist
ing NCAA frosh record for 200
yards IM by nearly IV2 seconds.
Roth covered the variegated
course in 2:00.0 to take the
NCAA frosh mark and also skate
under Greg Buckingham's 2:00.1
pool record.
The freshmen had to wait for
the last event to get their sec
ond national freshman record.
Luis Nicolao, Pete Siebert, Paul
Meyer, and Dick Roth averaged
48.7 to blast out a 3:15.0 timing
for the 400 freestyle relay. The
old record was 3:15.2.
Nicolao, who won the 100 me
ters freestyle in the Bremen In
ternational Swim Fest in 53.2,
dropped in a 48.6 for the first
100 yard leg of the freestyle
tandem. Nicalao, still ailing
from a crippling heel infection,
will aim for the 46's when he
feels better.
Cold Wind Hurts Sprinters
The cold wind whipping about
the starting blocks generally
hurt the sprint performances
Saturday. In the longer dis-tance
races, with more time to loosen
up, times were somewhat fast
er. The freshman have the po
tential to beat their 400 relay
record by another 5 or 6 sec
onds.
Greg Buckingham, swimming
exhibition, wasn't hurt by the
cold. The national 400 yards in
dividual medley record holder
churned to a 4:51.5 effort for
500 yards freestyle. Buckingham,
who topped the Junior College
All-American listings in five
events last year, dropped his own
pool record by 4 seconds in the
500 free.
Kee KO's Two Records
Bill Kee, Stanford freshman
backstroker, goes for big jumps.
Kee was swimming 200 back

stroke around 2:15 last Decem
ber. In the first dual meet, Kee
surprised a lot of people with
a frosh record 2:06.5.
Saturday, Kee jumped down
to 2:03.4, which puts him among
the two or three best back
strokers on the West Coast, var
sity and frosh alike. Earlier in
the day, leading the 400 medley
relay, Kee lowered his freshman
100 backstroke record to 56.4.
Doug Miller also went for the
big drop. The sophomore butter
flier cut nearly three seconds
off his best time in the gruelling
200 butterfly, chugging to a
2:02.7 performance. Miller's 2:02
might switch a few things
around when the Indians invade
the South jthis weekend.
Parmely Wins Two
Mark Parmely won the var
sity 200 individual medley in
2:05.5. The versatile sophomore
later took the 500 freestyle in
5:05.1, .3 second ahead of bete
mate Gary Sheerer.
Perhaps the best race of the
day came in the varsity 400 free
relay. Jim Laney had half a
body length lead as he left on
the anchor leg against outdoor
AAU 100 champ, Don Roth of
UCSB. Laney held his lead, and
increased it in the last length to
preserve the Stanford victory.
Laney's split was 48.5.
Mike Wall tied for first in the
200 freestyle with UCSB's Don
Roth at 1:49.2. Bill Derrig took
the 50 freestyle for the Cards
with a cold 22.7.
Bill Freeman, undefeated in
dual meets, won the diving event
with a windswept 242.65 total.
