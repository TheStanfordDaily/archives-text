# Rugby Team Tied By UCLA; Looking Forward To Trojans
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford rugby team,
hampered by the loss of their
star kicker, needed a second
half rally to tie the UCLA rug
gers, 8-8, in a game played in
Los Angeles, Saturday.
Mike Grace, who handles all
the place-kicking duties for the
squad, came down with the flu
shortly before the team left
Stanford Saturday morning.
Andy Overstone took over the
kicking chores in Grace's ab
sence, but the Indian ruggers
lacked their usual scoring punch
with Grace missing from the
backfield.
UCLA Opens Scoring
UCLA opened the games scor
ing as Pete Nicklin, the Bruins
South African star, made a suc
cessful penalty kick. This was
the only scoring of the first half
by either team and the Bruins
led at half 3-0.
At the onset of the second
half, UCLA was able to push
the ball over the goal line from
a five yard scrum. The conver
sion attempt was good and the
Card ruggers trailed 8-0.
At this point the Indians be
gan to come to life. The usually
strong Stanford scrum, after a
slow first half, took charge and
the whole scrum actually scored
the Indians' first try of the day.
Card Scrum Scores
The scrum pushed the ball
over on a five yard scrum and
Randy Vahan fell on the ball in
the end zone for the three
points. Ovenstone made the con
version kick and UCLA's lead
was cut to 8-5.
With about 15 minutes remain
ing in the game, Stanford's Oven

stone, cornered by the UCLA de
fenders, kicked the ball down
into UCLA territory. The ball
rolled into the end zone and
Stanford wing Mac Wylie out
raced the Bruins to fall on the
ball for the score.
Ovenstone's conversion at
tempt was straight but needed
another inch of altitude as it
bounced back off the upright
leaving the game tied 8-8.
Gaines Ends Deadlocked
At this point the Bruins' de
fense stiffened and the teams
fought down to the final whistle
in the 8-8 deadlock.
Outstanding for the Bruins in
this defensive stand were former
Stanford rugby and football
players, John Wilbur and Dick
Shaw, now students at UCLA.
The Stanford Coach, Pete
Kmetovic, was disappointed in
the team's performance. "We

looked pretty sluggish in the
first half and couldn't make up
for it in the second period.
"I though Frank Pattitucci
and Dave Pugh did a fine job for
us in the scrum though."
Kmetovic also had praise for
Bill Ostrander who played the
second half at fullback when
Bob Burke was injured.
Next week the Indians tangle
with USC, in a game to be played
at Stanford, starting at 1:30 on
Saturday.
USC does not allow its foot
ballers to play rugby, but the
Trojans will have a few senior
football players on the squad
and should provide a stiff chal
lenge for the Card ruggers who
now stand with a 3-1-2 season
record.

Los Angeles, Saturday.
Mike Grace, who handles all
the place-kicking duties for the
squad, came down with the flu
shortly before the team left
Stanford Saturday morning.
Andy Overstone took over the
kicking chores in Grace's ab
sence, but the Indian ruggers
lacked their usual scoring punch
with Grace missing from the
backfield.
UCLA Opens Scoring
UCLA opened the games scor
ing as Pete Nicklin, the Bruins
South African star, made a suc
cessful penalty kick. This was
the only scoring of the first half
by either team and the Bruins
led at half 3-0.
At the onset of the second
half, UCLA was able to push
the ball over the goal line from
a five yard scrum. The conver
sion attempt was good and the
Card ruggers trailed 8-0.
At this point the Indians be
gan to come to life. The usually
strong Stanford scrum, after a
slow first half, took charge and
the whole scrum actually scored
the Indians' first try of the day.
Card Scrum Scores
The scrum pushed the ball
over on a five yard scrum and
Randy Vahan fell on the ball in
the end zone for the three
points. Ovenstone made the con
version kick and UCLA's lead
was cut to 8-5.
With about 15 minutes remain
ing in the game, Stanford's Oven

stone, cornered by the UCLA de
fenders, kicked the ball down
into UCLA territory. The ball
rolled into the end zone and
Stanford wing Mac Wylie out
raced the Bruins to fall on the
ball for the score.
Ovenstone's conversion at
tempt was straight but needed
another inch of altitude as it
bounced back off the upright
leaving the game tied 8-8.
Gaines Ends Deadlocked
At this point the Bruins' de
fense stiffened and the teams
fought down to the final whistle
in the 8-8 deadlock.
Outstanding for the Bruins in
this defensive stand were former
Stanford rugby and football
players, John Wilbur and Dick
Shaw, now students at UCLA.
The Stanford Coach, Pete
Kmetovic, was disappointed in
the team's performance. "We

looked pretty sluggish in the
first half and couldn't make up
for it in the second period.
"I though Frank Pattitucci
and Dave Pugh did a fine job for
us in the scrum though."
Kmetovic also had praise for
Bill Ostrander who played the
second half at fullback when
Bob Burke was injured.
Next week the Indians tangle
with USC, in a game to be played
at Stanford, starting at 1:30 on
Saturday.
USC does not allow its foot
ballers to play rugby, but the
Trojans will have a few senior
football players on the squad
and should provide a stiff chal
lenge for the Card ruggers who
now stand with a 3-1-2 season
record.
