# Gymnasts Suffer Once Again; Swamped By San Jose, USF
## 
### 
Stanford's gymnasts faced two
state college contingents this
weekend only to fall Friday eve
ning to San Jose State by the
score of 124-91 and to succumb
to San Francisco State Satur
day afternoon, 142-87.
There seems to be a mishap
for every Indian gymnastics
meet and this weekend proved
no exception. Captain Bob Cook,
who was marked up to now as
the only invulnerable man on
the squad, was the victim this
time, hurting his knee in the
trampoline competition in the
San Francisco meet. He was
forced to skip the horizontal
bar and long horse events.
Cook, the mainstay of the
Stanford team as all-around
man, did go on to perform de
spite his injury in the parallel
bars and the rings. Though he
was forced into an awkward dis
mount in the rings because of
the injury, he won the event
with an other-wise good 7.8 rou
tine.
Could Have Been 100
Cook also got second in the
side horse and third in the floor
exercise for a 26 point total in
the four events he participated
in.
If Cook had gone the full com

plement of events he usually
goes in meets, the Indians would
easily have broken 100 points
for the first time this season.
Pete Gibson, last week's cas
ualty, was able to compete this
weekend, though he could not
yet do a free exercise routine
because of a sore ankle he was
nursing.
Close to Victory
In the San Jose meet, the In
dians came closer to victory
than they have all season, but
were still hampered by those
terrible "If's" and by a talented
Spartan named Tony Capolla.
Capolla won no less than five
of the seven events for a 45.70
Ail-Around score. Cook, who
garnered second place in the
Floor Exercise and the rings
collected 42.30 Ail-Around
points.
Indian Bill Fisher equaled his
best-ever effort in the long horse
with an 8.05 for second place in
that event.
The individual Tribe perform
ances over the weekend showed

marked increase in difficulty in
routines, and this should show
up in their score in later meets.
The Indians will travel this
weekend to Los Angeles for a
meet with strong USC. Coach
John Gilmore hopes to have four
healthy athletes to take with
hiin Gibson, Cook, Fisher, and
Bob Smith for a possible sea
son's best performance.
