The Committee of 15 will have another hot
dispute on its hands this week. This time, how
ever, the issue is one that appears to have been
favorably resolved already.
Wilbur head sponsor A 1 Taylor and Faculty
Master Eric Hutchinson agreed last Friday eve
ning to the creation of a five-man committee to
review reservations Prof. Hutchinson might
have on any of the new sponsors chosen by the
Sponsor Selection Committee. The proposed re
view committee would have representatives
from the various parties concerned with Wilbur
—the sponsors, the faculty, and the Committee
on Undergraduate Education (CUE) —and as
such avoids the pitfall of any one individual or
body giving the final word on who should or
should not be a sponsor.
Earlier last Friday, before Taylor and Hutch
inson had reached the compromise, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education affirmed its
prerogative to have final veto power over the
sponsor selections. The sponsors, who had al
ready voiced their valid opposition to such a
mandate, reaffirmed their objections to a veto
and endorsed the compromise Friday night.

In the meantime, CUE chairman Robert J.
Wert reportedly has asked President Sterling to
request the Committee of 15 to take up the dis
pute. When the committee meets this Friday,
it will presumably begin discussion on the basis
of the CUE resolution.
A lot of time and wasted effort would be
saved, however, if the Committee of 15 could
turn its discussion to the compromise solution.
Tilt' compromise already has the joint approval
of the sponsors and Prof. Hutchinson, the two
parties who presumably know the most about
Wilbur Hall, and it would be incongruous for
an arbitrative body such as the Committee of
15 to spend time on the already-unacceptable
resolution of the less knowledgeable Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
Technically, of course, CUE could reject a
favorable Committee of 15 recommendation on
the compromise, but to do so would only re
open a wound that seems to have healed itself
within Wilbur. It's time that the rest of the cam
pus hierarchy catch up with the freshman dorm
itory so that energies can be focused again on
die essential concern, that of education.
