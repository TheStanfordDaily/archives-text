## No Easy Sex Guide 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Being part of that often-com
mented-upon but seldom-com
menting commodity at Stanford
—the freshman women—l feel
compelled to write in respone to
the unfortunate fallacies (or
should I say misconceptions?)
put forth by Miss Ilandke and
the Sexual Rights Forum. I am
not a conservative. When I came
to Stanford six months ago I
was for the abolishment of so
cial regulations for women —
but this was because I felt by
having a superstructure of de
cisions placed upon us, we were
not learning to make them on
our own. A university with no
social regulations would, of
course, have to consist of wom
en who were willing to accept
the responsibility of making
choices, and after listening to
the views of Miss Handke and
others, I am not at all sure that
this could be accomplished.
Without a doubt I agree with
her statement, "Prevention is
easier than cure," but this is the
very attitude which is so danger
ous in today's morality — we are
looking for easy answers. The
Sexual Rights Forum would le
galize prostitution, homosexual
ity, sodomy, abortion, adultery,
and non-marital intercourse; all
for the purpose of eliminating
the responsibility of making
choices. The "coed" would then
no longer have to confront deci
sions, and likewise the respon
sibility would be lifted from the
shoulders of the "poor boy." This
viewpoint is the outcome of hav
ing no stable frame of reference
in today's society, and even the
most ultra-conservative in sex
ual matters has this in common
with the Sexual Rights Forum:
they are both attempting to es
cape from responsibility — the
former by placing a rigid code
of conduct on himself to fall
back on, and the latter by tak
ing away the code altogether.
But is this what we want? Can
we really risk taking the easy
way out even in matters of mor
ality?
"A brave new coed with a
brave new code?" Hardly. One
cannot be legislated morally; in
stead, a new attitude must some
how develop, one which would
produce a community of con
cerned, responsible people will
ing to face the admittedly diffi
cult task of making decisions.
And I do not believe that Miss
Handke's is this attitude.

• On Nymphomania
Editor, The Daily:
TO A CAMPUS NYMPH
For many years, when I was free
I longed to know a lass like thee
'Cause then one had to compro
mise
To gain what you now advertise.
A curse upon my unkind fate
That now you've come, it's all
too late.
It makes me sad that this great
school
Does seem to lack the will or tool

To implement a plan so good
For undermining maidenhood.
I'd like to know the reason why
Just you and this crusader guy
Can't find a quiet sequestered
place
And quell your need for front
page space.

• Morality And War
Editor, The Daily:
The other day we read a letter
by Mark Fogelman and Rand
McQuinn (The Daily, February
10) offering a tightly argued
case for our staying in Vietnam
which started with the rhetorical
statement: "No one will deny
that war is a horrible thing,"
and ended with the high-powered
conclusion that "War is a grue
some thing and it is immoral."
Though this would seem to in
dicate some faint uneasiness
about the war, the writers ap
parently meant to justify the
U. S. position in Vietnam with
their concluding afterthought:
"But let's not forget that the
highest morality is that of self
preservation."
This ending philosophy causes
a little speculation. War, by the
writers' own confession, is im
moral. We often hear about this
"high morality." It makes a nice
scheme of self-j us t if i c a
tion where one's own drives and
needs become the higher moral
ity. It goes even beyond the in
anity of attempting to describe
war in moral terms (Can a war
be moral?), to attempt to extend
morality to include self-preser
vation. This brand of morality
could raise many delicate ques
tions. Can one kill a little bit
or a lot to preserve oneself and
still be moral? Should your vic
tims be black, white, or yellow?
Morality is a hollow enough
word without diluting it to mean
any desire or wish that is to
one's own interest.
I was also interested by the
exactitude of their information:
"11,500 ruthless assassinations
of Vietnamese officials and civili
ans" by the Viet Cong. It was
nice that the number was even.
I'm reminded of the conclusive,
in the-hand proof that Joseph
McCarthy once presented to the
public; that there were 205, or
57, or 81 known Communists in
our State Department.

• The Question Man
Editor, The Daily:
In order to stimulate debate,
I have compiled a list of provoca
tive questions relating to the
war in Vietnam:
• Are we fighting for democ
racy or for the undemocratic
government of Premier Ky?
• Are we fighting Commu
nists or are we fighting peasants
who just want to better their
lives?
• Is this a race war? Would
we be fighting them if they
were Anglo-Saxons?
• If there were a free election
and a majority of the Vietna

mese people chose Ho Chi Minh
as their leader, do we believe
enough in Democracy to let them
have the government of their
choice?
• Is there any idea that is
worth killing or dying for? If
so, what?
• What are we fighting for
in Vietnam?
• It is true that most of us
are poorly informed. Is it rea
sonable to fight and possibly
die over issues that we don't un
derstand?
• Why are a disproportionate
number of Negroes being asked
to fight in Vietnam?
• What is the relationship of
the war to the economy? Can
meaningful jobs be created for
those now working in war indus
tries?
• What is the best economic
system for an underdeveloped
nation?
• How has this "war for free
dom" affected our civil liber
ties at home?
• Are you willing to kill and
possibly die in Vietnam?

• Poor Taste?
Editor, The Daily:
I am disappointed in your
taste in publishing Mr. Howells'
letter in Wednesday's Daily. Lan
guage of that caliber has no
place in any respectable human
endeavor, and only demonstrates
the writer's inability to express
himself among rational beings.
This reader was only embar
rassed and insulted, not im
pressed.

letter should serve as ail ex
planation.)
• Ne'er The Twain . . .
Editor, The Daily:
The letter printed in Wednes
day's Daily, signed by W. D.
Howells, is (I believe) actually
part of a very humorous letter
written to Howells by his good
friend, Samuel Clemens. The
whole letter reads approximate
ly as follows:
I would like to know what
kind of a goddam constitution
this is that can't be criticized
and says that a senator can't
question the goddam Presi
dent and his goddam foreign
policy any goddam time he
likes without having anarchy.
We nerd another goddam
amendment.
W. I). HOWELLS
Dear Howells,
The above letter Is a copy
of the one I sent to the editor
of the New York Times. I
signed your name to it be
cause I thought it WTMihl have
more weight.
Your friend,
MARK TWAIN
As you can see, this letter
was a joke on Howells and was
probably never meant for pub
lication.
