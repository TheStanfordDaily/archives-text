## Hoffa Signs Up The Pros 
### Art Buchwald 
Mr. James R. Hoffa of the
Teamsters' Union has offered to
organize all the professional ath
letes in the United States into
his union. The sport that needs
it the most, they say, is pro
football. While there may be
many advantages to having the
pro football players in the Team
sters Union, there could be
some disadvantages, as you will
see if you come into the locker
room of the Washington Tough
skins. It is half time and the
Toughskins are behind 34 to 0.
The coach is standing in front
of his blackboard.
Bunch of Bums
"You're playing like a bunch
of bums. Higgledorf, why didn't
you take out the left end on
play number 31?"
"I'm not supposed to take out
ends. The union contract says
I only have to take out tackles.
If I took out the end, I'd be tak
ing a job away from a block
ing back."
The coach, trying to keep his
temper: "All right, let's forget
that. Mickazinski, why did you
drop that pass that was right in
your arms?"
"I caught my quota for the
half. If I caught another one,
the guys would have thought I
was trying to speed up the
game."
"Well, if you drop another
pass, I'm pulling you out of the
game and putting Wallnicki in."
"You can't do it. I've got three
years seniority over Wallnicki.
If you pull me out, the entire
team walks off the field."
The coach clenches his teeth.
"Harrison, you're the foreman
as well as the quarterback. Can't
you get any more work out of
the men?"
Harrison says, "You're lucky
we're here at all. We're not sup
posed to play on Sunday."

The coach says, "But you're
getting time-and-a-half."
"We want double pay, and we
also want to be paid for the time
we spend going to and from the
locker room."
"All right, bring it up at con
tract time. But right now I'm
concerned with winning the
game. The defense has been
lousy. What happened to you,
Brantowski, when they made
that hole rhrough off center?"
"I was resting. It says here,
'The linebackers are entitled to
take a rest after every th r e e
plays.' If I didn't take the rest,
I would have been fined by the
union."
The coach wheels on his de
fensive back.
"And where were you, Eber
hardt, when they threw the
screen pass?"
"Screen passes aren't in my
jurisdiction. My job is to cover
the flanker. If you want me to
cover screen passes, you're go
ing to have to get authorization
from the local."
One for Hoffa
"Okay, okay," the coach says.
"Now I wasn't going to tell you
this, but it looks like I've got to.
Just before Jimmy Hoffa went
to the Supreme Court to appeal
his jail sentence, he said to me,
'Coach, if ever things get rough,
and the team is down, and
they're getting the hell beat out
of them, tell them — tell them
to win one for The Hoffa.' "
Tears start welling in the
players' eyes.
"Gee, coach," the halfback sobs,
"You wouldn't be kidding us?"
The coach looks at them.
"Those were the last words Jim
my Hoffa said to me. Well, what
do you say, team?"
The foreman jams on his hel
met and shouts, "LET'S GO
OUT THERE, GUYS, AND
MURDER THE BUMS."
