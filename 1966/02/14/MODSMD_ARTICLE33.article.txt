# Dogmatists And Relativists Really Two Of A Kind...
## 
### JEFF WATTLES DAVID CORNBERG 
It is usually when I am almost
asleep in class that I reflect upon
the strange breeds that inhabit
Stanford Univeisity. When I am
fully awake I take them for
granted. They do not hinder my
wakeful pursuit of technical
competence. But what kind of
waking is this, anyway? Let's
rouse these vague, narrow-mind
ed generalizations about strange
breeds.
Several groups have consid
ered educational problems at
Stanford, but few have articu
lated the species known (or else
not known) as The Dogmatist.
The Dogmatist
The typical dogmatist either
rejects as vague, narrow-minded,
or irrelevant everything he hears
from a viewpoint which he finds
alien or else he forcibly con
strues it into accord with his own
viewpoint. At the suggestion
that other types of thought have
grasped things in a different
way, the dogmatist declares the
others to be inferior, unless they
can persuade him on the basis of
his own preconceptions about
rationality and evidence; but the
dogmatist cannot articulate the
preconceptions of the culture in
which he is naively installed. He
lacks cosmic wonder; his con
cepts are ossified, so that he un
derstands everything monolithi
cally. He takes the most funda
mental aspects of any inquiry
for granted, and he reacts emo
tionally against an attempt at
radical criticism, as though criti
cism wore a sort of crime.
Viewpoint
The most naive type of dog
matist fails to recognize the fact
that he has a point of view. View
point cannot be a problem for
him because he is so obviously
right: I don't have any particu
lar point of view. Points of view
are limited, distorting perspec
tives associated with private

subjective beliefs and attitudes:
I'm just interested in the facts.
In a disagreement this dogma
tist is apt to say: We just have
to define our terms; there's real
ly no problem here—we're just
using words differently. In other
words, reality is not problematic,
and language is mere conven
tion, so that our definitions are
arbitrary, or trivial.
The relativist is a more sophis
ticated dogmatist: Everything is
relative, and each person de
cides the truth for himself.—
And is that judgment relative?
—No, you see, I'm just describ
ing the way things are. The rel
ativist becomes an absolutist,
but not by overcoming his rel
ativism. If we ask him which
is the true view he dodges:
True for me, or true for you?
This second type of dogmatist
is willing to admit that he has
a view point—his vote in the in
tellectual democracy. And what
is the viewpoint of the ruling
majority? There are a million
points of view. Each person has
a right to his own, and every
body has a different one; try
ing to type a person is like
putting people into little boxes;
there is so much variation that
it is useless to lump people to
gethr. This dogmasist resents
the whole project of characteri
zation; he finds our attempt to
describe a type of thought to be
merely an ego-battle.
'Know Thyself
Is it possible that it is a prob
lem to come to know our own
point of view? Does the exhor
tation "Know thyself" pose a
problem in cultural history?
And what sort of high-flying
dogmatism do the authors man
ifest by presuming that there
really are types and cultures as
though they were something
more than just collections of in
dividuals? We know your kind.
