# Breakers Abolish Rush As Against 'Philosophy'
## 
### 
Breakers Eating Club has unani
mously voted to end selective rush and
open its membership to any student
on campus who wishes to join.
By doing so, the club becomes the
first selective-membership living
group at Stanford to do away with the
voting system for rush.
Bruce Finstead, Breakers "non
rush" chairman, told The Daily that
by taking the move "the club has
brought its practices into conformity
with its philosophy."
He explained that the general feel
ing of the members was that indi
viduals "have the right to be what
they want to be, and it is not up to us
to pass value judgments upon them.
Selection Reversed
"The selection process is reversed,"
he continued. "All hypocrisy over

whether the rushee chooses the club
or the club chooses the rushee is gone,
for if somebody wants to join, he is
welcome to do so."
Rather than distribute bids, the
club will place a box of them near the
door on and after March 31, the date
on which bidding begins for all fra
ternities and eating clubs. Students
who wish to join will be able to "bid
themselves" at will.
Breakers will continue to have
open houses and dinner guests. Fred
Bennett, the club's business manager,
said this will allow prospective mem
bers "to know what they are getting
into" before joining. He added that
emphasis would be put upon inviting
"non-rushers" to meals, as eating is
the activity around which the club is
organized.
