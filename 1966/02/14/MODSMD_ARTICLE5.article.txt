# 'PILLS PLEASE'
## SSRF On The Warpath 
### KIRK HANEN 
Blasting the University Health
Service's contraceptive policy as
"hypocritical," the Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum (SSRF) takes its pro
gram to the student body in the form
of an initiative today and tomorrow.
The legislative initiative proposal
of the five-member SSRF asks stu
dent support in urging that the
Health Service "be authorized to pre
scribe contraceptives to any student
desiring them."
SSRF will circulate petitions at a
table in front of the post office today
and tomorrow between 9 a.m. and
3 p.m., as well as through living
groups and graduate departments.
The present policy of the Health
Service, (according to Executive Di
rector, Dr. Maurice Osborne) is:
• To prescribe contraceptives to
any married student desiring them.
• To prescribe them to any student
with a bona fide "intent" to marry
within two months ("intent" consti
tuting the completion and legal certi
fication of a pre-marital health re
view and blood test).
• To discuss with any student the
responsibilities and problems the stu
dent faces if he or she elects to pro
ceed with contraception.
Service Denounced
In a statement accompanying their
petition, the SSRF denounced the
Health Service policy as "hypocrit
ical and in contradiction with the Uni
versity's aim of encouraging students
to make their own decisions regard
ing personal behavior."
The basic contention of the Sexual
Rights Forum is that "this policy of
discrimination against unmarried stu
dents should be eliminated."
In a statement issued to The Daily,
Dr. Osborne characterized the SSRF
petition as a "tragically crude and
simplistic approach to an enormously
complex and sensitive issue."
Orgy Coming?
"On one side, I do not believe that
such a policy would turn Stanford
into a Saturnalian orgy — or serious
ly increase the incidence of pre mari
tal intercourse — any more than I be
lieve that the "Stanford View" bar

will become a haven for perverts,
dope-pushers and sex-peddlers," Dr.
Osborne said.
"On the other hand, I continue to
have some serious doubts about such
a policy. Some have to do with real
considerations of whether such a
policy would, in fact, entirely reduce
unwanted pregnancy and its often
tragic consequences.
"Some," Dr. Osborne added, "have
to do with a concern for the suscep
tibility and vulnerability of many
young people to social pressures—
which at times promote and urge in
tercourse upon those who do not
want it, or are not ready. I would

not wish the Service to contribute —
even unintentionally—to such pres
sures."
"Nor would I wish to contribute to
the misuse of contraceptive materials
and advice by self-appointed student
'counselors,' " he added.
"This is an issue on which there
is not only a lack of general agree
ment, but there are deep and sincere
ly felt divisions of belief among the
persons and groups who constitute
the University," said Osborne. "If
progress is wanted, these differences
must not be ignored, exploited, or in
flamed—but seriously understood."
Too Late?
Further on in his extensive analys
is of the contraceptive problem at
Stanford, Dr. Osborne said, "Speak
ing purely personally, and not for
Stanford, I think it might have been
reasonable to explore the possibility
of extending our policy to include
married students over 21, and stu
dents presenting validated parental
consent. . . ."
"Now I am not sure that the neces
sary atmosphere hasn't been pol
luted," he concluded.
Jim Sayre, a 23-year-old graduate

student in mineral engineering who
masterminded SSRF's plans for the
initiative expressed confidence in the
outcome of the movement:
"Having found the administration
and faculty sympathetic, we think
it's time to find out if the student
body is behind us."
