# Annual 'Rediscovery' At Wilbur
## A 						NEWS ANALYSIS 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
"One of the most exciting aspects
of the Wilbur Program, is that many
educational philosophies are applied
at the same time with reasonable sue

cess. There is a joint effort, yearly re
newed by all those participating in
Wilbur, to discover what Wilbur is."—
Wilbur Sponsors' Report.
While concerning itself mainly with
the controversy over sponsor selec
tion, the Wilbur Sponsors' Report re
leased last week raised deeper ques
tions about the philosophy of Wilbur
and the role the Faculty-Master and
Ihe sponsors. The Institution of the
Faculty-Master Program is admitted
ly an experiment, and a very signifi
cant one, since its successes or failures
will be reflected in the planning for
Moore and Jacks Halls. Thus the an
nual problem of rediscovering "what
Wilbur is" has become more heated.
Announcing the new program last
spring the Committee on undergradu
ate Educaticfn (CUE) stressed the free
dom of the Faculty-Master. Dean Rob
ert Wert, Chairman of CUE, told The
Daily yesterday the committee had
envisioned the role of the Faculty-
Master as a "general superintendent"
of Wilbur who would attempt to
creat a more intellectual atmosphere.
"The first consideration of the com
mittee was to get a good person,"
Wert noted. No specific guidelines

for the Faculty-Master post were pro
posed by CUE. Wert said specifics
would eventually evolve through con
tinual evaluation of the program by
the Faculty-Master and the commit
tee.
After nearly five months as the
first Faculty-Master, Professor Eric
Hutchinson believes "the lack of spe
cifics makes life difficult when you
do not have a tradition to follow." In
an interview with The Daily, he de
scribed the role of the Faculty-Master
as "building by whatever means he
sees fit a genuine scholarly input into
the system." In more concrete terms,
Hutchinson hopes to fulfill this goal
by increasing the amount of formal
and informal teaching at Wilbur.
Summarizing his position, he said
he had been asked by CUE to "find
out what kind of thing would be use
ful" at Wilbur.
Dichotomy In Types
While accepting Hutchinson's con
ception of "academic inputs," the
Sponsor Report suggested a dichoto
my in the types of education being
fostered by the sponsors and the Fac
ulty-Master. Distinguishing "educa
tion that aims at the inculcation and
skill and knowledge . . . from educa
tion that has as its aim the fullest
possible development of the individu
al, the report said "This might account
for what appears to be a lack of rap
port between Dr. Hutchinson and the
sponsors as well as explaining a va
riety of misunderstandings arising
from differing educational assump
tions."
Commenting Friday, Hutchinson
doubted that the sponsors "preserved
any one form of education." He was
also critical of the view that the two
types of education were mutually ex
clusive. He judged more formal as
pects of the program, such as in
creased faculty-s t u d en t contacts
equally valuable in realizing the final
goal of a more intellectual atmosphere
as informal sponsor counselling and
discussions.
In fact, the faculty-freshman con
tacts have been few and the number
of seminars have been limited al
though successful. Hutchinson admits
that increased faculty cooperation
would go a long way to promoting the
program. Yet no proposal has been
worked out which would allow proml

nent faculty members to reduce their
departmental duties in order to de
vote time to freshman.
Other features of the "formal pro
gram, including a festival in the arts
and various contests are only now
beginning to take shape.
Hutchinson discounted the differ
ence in educational theories as the
cause for sponsor-master dissidence.
"I see the sponsors as a large body;
very few sponsors talk to me about
individual problems," he said. The Fac
ulty-Master rejected sponsor criticism
that their role might be relegated to
that of an employee. Since their room
is paid by Counselling and Testing,
technically sponsors have long been
employees of the Dean of Students
Office, according to Hutchinson.
In Friday's interview as cm other
occasions he praised the sponsors for
their dedication to the freshman. "In
interpersonal counselling the Wilbur
sponsor is going to have a rapport
with freshman which no other ele
ment of the University is going to
have," the Master said.
However Hutchinson admitted that
a shift in the role of the sponsor to
include more administrative duties
may also cause a basic change in the
nature of the sponsorship. "In gain
ing one aspect, administrative skills,
we may well lose another, dedication
to the freshmen," but Hutchinson said
there was not guarantee that this had
to be the case.
Not Intended
The interplay between the Faculty-
Master and the sponsors is not in
tended to be very strong, Hutchinson
stated. Hutchinson doubted that the
new Wilbur constitution had ham
pered the sponsors in expressing their
views on controversial issues to the
freshman. "However that may be the
way they perceive it,"he added.
Hutchinson said he had no clear idea
as to how the sponsor's role might be
changed. At the end of fall quarter
he suggested to CUE that a study be
made of the problem. In Hutchinsoti's
view, such a study would rely heavily
on the opinion of those who were sev
eral years out of Wilbur.
It is against this background of in
ternal change in the Wilbur System
that the selection controversy is being
played.

Wilbur Sponsors' Report.
While concerning itself mainly with
the controversy over sponsor selec
tion, the Wilbur Sponsors' Report re
leased last week raised deeper ques
tions about the philosophy of Wilbur
and the role the Faculty-Master and
Ihe sponsors. The Institution of the
Faculty-Master Program is admitted
ly an experiment, and a very signifi
cant one, since its successes or failures
will be reflected in the planning for
Moore and Jacks Halls. Thus the an
nual problem of rediscovering "what
Wilbur is" has become more heated.
Announcing the new program last
spring the Committee on undergradu
ate Educaticfn (CUE) stressed the free
dom of the Faculty-Master. Dean Rob
ert Wert, Chairman of CUE, told The
Daily yesterday the committee had
envisioned the role of the Faculty-
Master as a "general superintendent"
of Wilbur who would attempt to
creat a more intellectual atmosphere.
"The first consideration of the com
mittee was to get a good person,"
Wert noted. No specific guidelines

for the Faculty-Master post were pro
posed by CUE. Wert said specifics
would eventually evolve through con
tinual evaluation of the program by
the Faculty-Master and the commit
tee.
After nearly five months as the
first Faculty-Master, Professor Eric
Hutchinson believes "the lack of spe
cifics makes life difficult when you
do not have a tradition to follow." In
an interview with The Daily, he de
scribed the role of the Faculty-Master
as "building by whatever means he
sees fit a genuine scholarly input into
the system." In more concrete terms,
Hutchinson hopes to fulfill this goal
by increasing the amount of formal
and informal teaching at Wilbur.
Summarizing his position, he said
he had been asked by CUE to "find
out what kind of thing would be use
ful" at Wilbur.
Dichotomy In Types
While accepting Hutchinson's con
ception of "academic inputs," the
Sponsor Report suggested a dichoto
my in the types of education being
fostered by the sponsors and the Fac
ulty-Master. Distinguishing "educa
tion that aims at the inculcation and
skill and knowledge . . . from educa
tion that has as its aim the fullest
possible development of the individu
al, the report said "This might account
for what appears to be a lack of rap
port between Dr. Hutchinson and the
sponsors as well as explaining a va
riety of misunderstandings arising
from differing educational assump
tions."
Commenting Friday, Hutchinson
doubted that the sponsors "preserved
any one form of education." He was
also critical of the view that the two
types of education were mutually ex
clusive. He judged more formal as
pects of the program, such as in
creased faculty-s t u d en t contacts
equally valuable in realizing the final
goal of a more intellectual atmosphere
as informal sponsor counselling and
discussions.
In fact, the faculty-freshman con
tacts have been few and the number
of seminars have been limited al
though successful. Hutchinson admits
that increased faculty cooperation
would go a long way to promoting the
program. Yet no proposal has been
worked out which would allow proml

nent faculty members to reduce their
departmental duties in order to de
vote time to freshman.
Other features of the "formal pro
gram, including a festival in the arts
and various contests are only now
beginning to take shape.
Hutchinson discounted the differ
ence in educational theories as the
cause for sponsor-master dissidence.
"I see the sponsors as a large body;
very few sponsors talk to me about
individual problems," he said. The Fac
ulty-Master rejected sponsor criticism
that their role might be relegated to
that of an employee. Since their room
is paid by Counselling and Testing,
technically sponsors have long been
employees of the Dean of Students
Office, according to Hutchinson.
In Friday's interview as cm other
occasions he praised the sponsors for
their dedication to the freshman. "In
interpersonal counselling the Wilbur
sponsor is going to have a rapport
with freshman which no other ele
ment of the University is going to
have," the Master said.
However Hutchinson admitted that
a shift in the role of the sponsor to
include more administrative duties
may also cause a basic change in the
nature of the sponsorship. "In gain
ing one aspect, administrative skills,
we may well lose another, dedication
to the freshmen," but Hutchinson said
there was not guarantee that this had
to be the case.
Not Intended
The interplay between the Faculty-
Master and the sponsors is not in
tended to be very strong, Hutchinson
stated. Hutchinson doubted that the
new Wilbur constitution had ham
pered the sponsors in expressing their
views on controversial issues to the
freshman. "However that may be the

ing one aspect, administrative skills,
we may well lose another, dedication
to the freshmen," but Hutchinson said
there was not guarantee that this had
to be the case.
Not Intended
The interplay between the Faculty-
Master and the sponsors is not in
tended to be very strong, Hutchinson
stated. Hutchinson doubted that the
new Wilbur constitution had ham
pered the sponsors in expressing their
views on controversial issues to the
freshman. "However that may be the
way they perceive it,"he added.
Hutchinson said he had no clear idea
as to how the sponsor's role might be
changed. At the end of fall quarter
he suggested to CUE that a study be
made of the problem. In Hutchinsoti's
view, such a study would rely heavily
on the opinion of those who were sev
eral years out of Wilbur.
It is against this background of in
ternal change in the Wilbur System
that the selection controversy is being
played.
"One of the most exciting aspects
of the Wilbur Program, is that many
educational philosophies are applied
at the same time with reasonable sue

cess. There is a joint effort, yearly re

Wilbur, to discover what Wilbur is."—
Wilbur Sponsors' Report.
While concerning itself mainly with
the controversy over sponsor selec
tion, the Wilbur Sponsors' Report re
leased last week raised deeper ques
tions about the philosophy of Wilbur
and the role the Faculty-Master and
Ihe sponsors. The Institution of the
Faculty-Master Program is admitted
ly an experiment, and a very signifi
cant one, since its successes or failures
will be reflected in the planning for
Moore and Jacks Halls. Thus the an
nual problem of rediscovering "what
Wilbur is" has become more heated.
Announcing the new program last
spring the Committee on undergradu
ate Educaticfn (CUE) stressed the free
dom of the Faculty-Master. Dean Rob
ert Wert, Chairman of CUE, told The
Daily yesterday the committee had
envisioned the role of the Faculty-
Master as a "general superintendent"
of Wilbur who would attempt to
creat a more intellectual atmosphere.
"The first consideration of the com
mittee was to get a good person,"
Wert noted. No specific guidelines

for the Faculty-Master post were pro
posed by CUE. Wert said specifics
would eventually evolve through con
tinual evaluation of the program by
the Faculty-Master and the commit
tee.
After nearly five months as the
first Faculty-Master, Professor Eric
Hutchinson believes "the lack of spe
cifics makes life difficult when you
do not have a tradition to follow." In
an interview with The Daily, he de
scribed the role of the Faculty-Master
as "building by whatever means he
sees fit a genuine scholarly input into
the system." In more concrete terms,
Hutchinson hopes to fulfill this goal
by increasing the amount of formal
and informal teaching at Wilbur.
Summarizing his position, he said
he had been asked by CUE to "find
out what kind of thing would be use
ful" at Wilbur.
Dichotomy In Types
While accepting Hutchinson's con
ception of "academic inputs," the
Sponsor Report suggested a dichoto
my in the types of education being
fostered by the sponsors and the Fac
ulty-Master. Distinguishing "educa
tion that aims at the inculcation and
skill and knowledge . . . from educa
tion that has as its aim the fullest
possible development of the individu
al, the report said "This might account
for what appears to be a lack of rap
port between Dr. Hutchinson and the
sponsors as well as explaining a va
riety of misunderstandings arising
from differing educational assump
tions."
Commenting Friday, Hutchinson
doubted that the sponsors "preserved
any one form of education." He was
also critical of the view that the two
types of education were mutually ex
clusive. He judged more formal as
pects of the program, such as in
creased faculty-s t u d en t contacts
equally valuable in realizing the final
goal of a more intellectual atmosphere
as informal sponsor counselling and
discussions.
In fact, the faculty-freshman con
tacts have been few and the number
of seminars have been limited al
though successful. Hutchinson admits
that increased faculty cooperation
would go a long way to promoting the
program. Yet no proposal has been
worked out which would allow proml

nent faculty members to reduce their
departmental duties in order to de
vote time to freshman.
Other features of the "formal pro
gram, including a festival in the arts
and various contests are only now
beginning to take shape.
Hutchinson discounted the differ
ence in educational theories as the
cause for sponsor-master dissidence.
"I see the sponsors as a large body;
very few sponsors talk to me about
individual problems," he said. The Fac
ulty-Master rejected sponsor criticism
that their role might be relegated to
that of an employee. Since their room
is paid by Counselling and Testing,
technically sponsors have long been
employees of the Dean of Students
Office, according to Hutchinson.
In Friday's interview as cm other
occasions he praised the sponsors for
their dedication to the freshman. "In
interpersonal counselling the Wilbur
sponsor is going to have a rapport
with freshman which no other ele
ment of the University is going to
have," the Master said.
However Hutchinson admitted that
a shift in the role of the sponsor to
include more administrative duties
may also cause a basic change in the
nature of the sponsorship. "In gain
ing one aspect, administrative skills,
we may well lose another, dedication
to the freshmen," but Hutchinson said
