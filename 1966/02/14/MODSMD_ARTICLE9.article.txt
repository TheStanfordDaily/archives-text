Kaplan Wins Legion Of Honor
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, professor and executive head of the depart
ment of radiology at the School of Medicine, has been awarded the
French Legion of Honor "in gratitude for his exceptional contribu
tion to the development of Franco-American scientific relations and
in esteem for his remarkable scientific work."
The Legion of Honor was established by Napoleon as a military
award in 1802. Under subsequent governments it has often been
granted to civilians for distinguished service to France. Within
the last two years it has again become a primarily military award,
and civilian presentations are less frequent. Kaplan received the
award Wednesday afternoon at the Faculty Club from the French
Consul General Claude Bataula.
Dr. Kaplan was a leading figure in the design and use of SLAC's
"cancer gun" and is presently continuing work on this and related
projects in high-energy radiation treatment of cancer.

Kaplan Wins Legion Of Honor
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, professor and executive head of the depart
ment of radiology at the School of Medicine, has been awarded the
French Legion of Honor "in gratitude for his exceptional contribu
tion to the development of Franco-American scientific relations and
in esteem for his remarkable scientific work."
The Legion of Honor was established by Napoleon as a military
award in 1802. Under subsequent governments it has often been
granted to civilians for distinguished service to France. Within
the last two years it has again become a primarily military award,
and civilian presentations are less frequent. Kaplan received the
award Wednesday afternoon at the Faculty Club from the French
Consul General Claude Bataula.
Dr. Kaplan was a leading figure in the design and use of SLAC's
"cancer gun" and is presently continuing work on this and related
projects in high-energy radiation treatment of cancer.
