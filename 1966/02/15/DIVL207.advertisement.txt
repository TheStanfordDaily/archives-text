The Evil Within Us
Nearly thirty years ago the noted Swiss psychologist Carl Junk warned
of the grave danger to the human race from disintegrating moral and spiritual
vaiues which provide man with "spiritual safeguards and means of defense
against the immediate experience of the forces waiting for liberation in the
unconscious mind." Evil, he observed, was to be found within each one of us.
look at all the incredible savagery going on in our so-called civilized
world, all of which is derived from human beings and their mental condition!
Look at the devilish means of destruction! They are invented by perfectly
harmless gentlemen, reasonable, respctabl citizns, being all we hope to be.
And when the whole thing blows up and causes an indescribable inferno of
devastation, nobody seems to be responsible. It simply occurs yet it is all man
made. But since evfcry person is blindly convinced that he is nothing but his
very moaest and unimportant consciousness, which neatly fulfills duties and
earns a moderate living, nobody is aware that this whole relationally organized
crowd, coiled a state or nation, is run by seemingly impersonal, imperceptible
but terrific power, checked by nobody and nothing. This ghastly power is
mostly explained by fear of the neighboring nation, which is supposed to be
possessed by a malevolent devil. As nobody is capable of recognizing where
and how much he himself is possessed and unconscious, one simply projects
one's own condition upon the neighbor, and thus it becomes a sacred duty to
have the biggest guns and the most poisonous gas" ("Psychology and Religion,"
1938).
Jung's diagnosis of our ills agrees with Jeremiah who said, "The heart is
deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt," and with Jesus Christ:
"Out of the heart are the issues of life. For out of the heart come evil
thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These
are what defile a man.'
To solve the problem of your human depravity, God had Jesus Christ
die your death for you, and carry your evil deeds upon Himself to a bloody
cross. God is now in a position to forgive you, acquit you freely, and change
that evil heart. "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himseff, not
counting men's trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of
reconciliation . . . We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
For our sake God made Christ to be sin for us, he knew no sin, so that in
Christ we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthinians 5).
What all men need is a change of heart. Why not do something about
the evil within, but accepting God's cure and effective remedy. Jesus Christ
is what you need to be changed inside.

very moaest and unimportant consciousness, which neatly fulfills duties and
earns a moderate living, nobody is aware that this whole relationally organized
crowd, coiled a state or nation, is run by seemingly impersonal, imperceptible
but terrific power, checked by nobody and nothing. This ghastly power is
mostly explained by fear of the neighboring nation, which is supposed to be
possessed by a malevolent devil. As nobody is capable of recognizing where
and how much he himself is possessed and unconscious, one simply projects
one's own condition upon the neighbor, and thus it becomes a sacred duty to
have the biggest guns and the most poisonous gas" ("Psychology and Religion,"
1938).
Jung's diagnosis of our ills agrees with Jeremiah who said, "The heart is
deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt," and with Jesus Christ:
"Out of the heart are the issues of life. For out of the heart come evil
thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These
are what defile a man.'
To solve the problem of your human depravity, God had Jesus Christ
die your death for you, and carry your evil deeds upon Himself to a bloody
cross. God is now in a position to forgive you, acquit you freely, and change
that evil heart. "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himseff, not
counting men's trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of
reconciliation . . . We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
For our sake God made Christ to be sin for us, he knew no sin, so that in
Christ we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthinians 5).
What all men need is a change of heart. Why not do something about
the evil within, but accepting God's cure and effective remedy. Jesus Christ
is what you need to be changed inside.

The Evil Within Us
Nearly thirty years ago the noted Swiss psychologist Carl Junk warned
of the grave danger to the human race from disintegrating moral and spiritual
vaiues which provide man with "spiritual safeguards and means of defense
against the immediate experience of the forces waiting for liberation in the
unconscious mind." Evil, he observed, was to be found within each one of us.
look at all the incredible savagery going on in our so-called civilized
world, all of which is derived from human beings and their mental condition!
Look at the devilish means of destruction! They are invented by perfectly
harmless gentlemen, reasonable, respctabl citizns, being all we hope to be.
And when the whole thing blows up and causes an indescribable inferno of
devastation, nobody seems to be responsible. It simply occurs yet it is all man
made. But since evfcry person is blindly convinced that he is nothing but his
very moaest and unimportant consciousness, which neatly fulfills duties and
earns a moderate living, nobody is aware that this whole relationally organized
crowd, coiled a state or nation, is run by seemingly impersonal, imperceptible
but terrific power, checked by nobody and nothing. This ghastly power is
