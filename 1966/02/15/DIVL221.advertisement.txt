Doobie Doo. A hardback novel by Ivan C. Karp that is
not only unrequired, but, according to some early read
ers and reviewers, un-American.
Doobie Doo is the history of a pioneer of pleasure who
has his cake and eats it without dire results. Except to
the cake. It is an investigation into the dazed plight of
sophisticated, husbandless city girls which raises the
question: How much love should wisely be given to the
desperately needy?
Until it was published last month, we had dozens of
lines like this to use describing Doobie Doo. Now the
reviewers have taken it away from us. (See below.)
Nearly all of us have had a marvelous time reading it.

"Doohik Doo is u novel with convoluted plot — complete with sub-plot
that in the end sets projVerly hooked up with the main plot — [which] is
a parody of novels with convoluted plots and a spoof of the spoof genre
and is awfully funny . . . The chief performers in the circus that Roes
lickety-cut are Maynard Ricefield, a musicologist who works, on the
periphery of his vocation, in a company that manufactures clavichords,
harpsichords and harpsichord kits, and the two beautiful ({iris between
whom he divides his evenings fair and square . . . 'Whoever said that life
was real was living in a dream world," observes Clarissa (one of the
heroines, the 'wordly' one). The book is full of such profoundities as this
which, while they bring the reader to the brink of lunacy, do not bog
down the narrative." —jean Stafford
"A wildly funny avant-garde novel with n message. The message is:
'If everybody refused to sing commercials, there would be no singing
commercials'." -CHARLES I'OORE, N. V. Time«
"An outrageously funny novel ... a little Rock and Roll running amok
might be just what the American novel needs at this stage. Hang on
Henry James. Henry James, hang on."
-DONALD D. JONES, Kantian City Star
"A doozey . . . Karp ha>i real talent. He is funny, hip, cynical, brazen -
and he can write." —JOHN HAKKIIAM, Saturday Review Syndicate
"Roy I.ichtenstein has helped . . . with a Pop book jacket that billboards
a red-dotted girlfnce and a great, cliff-hanging tear, poised on the lower
cilia. Hut what Karp does with this hokum i; to reach right inside the
tear. Funny tear. It is not empty, but full of salt, humor, damp warmth,
and, I think most important, refractions that bring out all the sparkle and
plenty that so many shnooks claim is missing from Today's Living. Funny.
funny, saving tear." —brock bower. Hook Week

this column to Anchor Books, but couldn't resist the
temptation to slip one special hardcover book in.
