• Humphrey Pledges Aid
BANGKOK, Thailand <AP) — Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey
pledged today that the United States
will give increased military aid to
build up and modernize the forces of
communist-threatened Thailand.
Humphrey and Premier Thanom
Kittikachorn agreed there is "urgent
necessity" to strengthen Thailand's
defenses.
While in Thailand, Humphrey also
flew to neighboring Laos for talks
with Premier Souvanna Phouma.
The vice president was briefed dur
ing his stay in Thailand on slowly
growing communist subversion in the
impoverished northeast. This is an
area just across the Mekong river
from Laos, which has been battling
communist insurgency for years.
• Churches Still Untaxed
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) The
Maryland Court of Appeals rejected
today a plea that it order an end to
the historic practice of granting tax
exemptions to church-owned property.
The state's highest court said the
exceptions do not violate either the
Maryland or United States constitu
tions. It said they are a recognition
of the contributions made by religious
organizations to the general public
welfare.
The suit contended that because
religious groups were given tax ex
emptions, other property owners were
forced to pay higher taxes, and that
this amounted to taxation in support
of religion.
The case was brought or iginally by
Madalyn Murray who initiated one
of the suits which resulted in the
U. S. Supreme Court ruling that com
pulsory prayers in public schools are
unconstitutional.
The court, in today's unanimous
ruling by the five judges who heard
the case, conceded that religious or
ganizations do benefit from the ex
emptions.
"Economically, they are in the
same position as though they paid
taxes to the city and state and then
received back the amounts paid in
the form of direct grants," the opin
ion by Judge Reuben Oppenheimer
said.
• Poverty War To Escalate
WASHINGTON— The government
hopes to begin a new kind of federal
attack on poverty this year. The tar
get. is rural America. The initial cost
is low and the theme is self-help.
The vehicle for the new govern
ment program is the Rural Commun
ity Development Service, a planning
aegncy authorized last year. Presi
dent Johnson has asked congress for
$5 million to give the agency the go
ahead to begin operations in all 50
states.
The service's main goal is to set up
hundreds of rural planning districts
and provide the incentive for them to
tackle the immediate —and future—
problems in their areas on a local
level.
Rural America has long withstood
the government's antipoverty pro
grams. Statistics show that its pov
erty rate is nearly twice that of the
rest of the nation. Its children lag two
years behind urban dwellers in educa
tion and receive 33 per cent less med
ical attention. Twenty-five per cent of
its nonfarm homes lack even run
ning water.
