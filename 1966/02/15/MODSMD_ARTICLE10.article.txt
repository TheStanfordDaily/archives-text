# Leninism Explained By Wolfe
## 
### BARBARA SHAW 
"Lenin believed in centralism, his
own views on every subject" and the
enforcement of those ideas by mili
tary means in almost every case. This
is the core of Leninism as presented
by Dr. Bertram Wolfe in the second
of the Tresidder series on Commu
nism last night.
Lenin's most outstanding trait was
his tendency to split the party over
tiny details whenever other members
disagreed with him. He broke with his
five fellow editors of the original
party newspaper over the definition
of a "member" in the party constitu
tion.
Dr. Wolfe stated that while Lenin
claimed to revere Marx and Engles
and follow their writings to the finest
detail, he revised and rejected their
ideas at every turn. This he rational
ized by claiming that their policies
were good for their times, but that
new "expansions" were required for
new times.
While he accused his opponents of
revising the doctrines of the founders
of the party, he himself was guilty of
"sweeping revisionalism," Wolfe
stated.
A Selfless Egoist
The personality of Lenin had a
great effect on his policies. He was a
"selfless egoist," in Professor Wolfe's
words. He was selfless because he
never mentioned himself in his works,
and did not constantly check the "Mir
ror of history" to see what kind of
image he was leaving behind.
But above all he was an "egoist,"
his opinions on any subject were the
final word and were infallible. Every
minor point of disagreement was a
"point of honor" which had to be de
cided in his favor. He did not shrink
from the use of violence in dealing
with factions, Wolfe said.
Remade Himself
Since Lenin was himself a member
of the hereditary nobility in Russia,
he had to constantly perform "self
surgery" in order to remake himself
according to the blueprint of a revo
lutionist that he had created. How
ever, his noble birth did not make
him feel alienated from the working
class's problems. In fact it gave him
the perfect right to solve them.
According to his theory, the work
ing class could never achieve a "soc
ialist consciousness." It could only
rise to a unionist mentality which
would never effect the revolution.
The True socialist spirit must come
from the intellectual class which has
the time and the ability to deal with
the questions of class problems.
Lenin was completely removed
from emotion in his later life. He con
fessed that he could not listen to
music very often because it made him
want "to stroke the heads" of his
comrades, and he knew that what
he really should be doing is "striking
them on the head."
