# Stanford's Schooner Sails Again
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Stan
ford University s 135-foot schoon
er Te Vega, overhauled and
ready for new voyages of marine
biology research, will depart Bay
Area shipyards before dawn to
day for her home port at Mon
terey.
Repairs, which included re
painting, several new spars and
extensive overhaul of machinery
and equipment, were performed
by the Triple A Machine Shop
and Bethlehem Steel Co. of San
Francisco.
It was the ship's first refitting
after two years and over 60,000
miles of voyaging in South Pa
cific and Indian Ocean waters.
Given fair winds, she should com
plete the 80-mile trip to Monte
rey by the late afternoon.
Most of the TeVega's scientific
equipment was removed when
she arrived home at Monterey
in September. It will be rein
stalled after she returns there
and before she resumes her
teaching and research program.
Prof. Rolf Bolin, chief scien
tist of Te Vega Expeditions and
associate director of Stanford's
Hopkins Marine Station at Pa
cific Grove, said the vessel's next
mission will be investigation of
widespread "oxygen-minimum"
layers in the waters off the Cali
fornia coast. As before, the work
will be supported by the Nation
al Science Foundation (NSF).
These curious undersea re
gions occur throughout the
world, but reach nearest to total
oxygen depletion in the Pacific.
They occur in layers at interme
diate depths, apparently mixing
very little with the surrounding
waters.
"Since the oxygen - minimum
layer is well established along
the California coast and reaches
its maximum development in
Mexican waters," said Prof. Bo
lin, "Monterey is a good base
from which to attack the prob
lem. Field investigations can be
gin in this area about one hour
after leaving port."
Bolin added that "With the be
ginning of Stanford's spring aca
demic quarter in March, a for
mal complement of three senior
scientists and 10 graduate stu
dents on NSF fellowships will
commence a scheduled program
of research.
The formal program will con
sist of several short trips of
about two days, alternating with
periods ashore for lectures and
analysis of results of each
cruise. A few longer cruises of
10 days or so will take the in
vestigators about 500 miles off
shore and south to the Channel
Islands off Santa Barbara and
Los Angeles.
Bolin said that "Each student
will be assigned one of the more
important systematic categories
of the macro-plankton (molluscs,
amphipods, tunicates, fishes, etc.)
and will be responsible for the
identification and enumeration
of the individuals in each haul,
and for the correlation of his re
sults with the physics-chemical
variables, particularly the oxy
gen. Additional activities, in part
for the training of students and
in part dictated by the research
requirements of the scientists
participating, will be pursued as
time and opportunity permit."
