# Tribe Boxers Drop Decision To Nevada, 8-4
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Scoring two knockouts but
losing several close matches,
Stanford's boxing team dropped
an extremely close contest to
the University of Nevada last
Saturday, 8-4. With about 700
loyal fans supporting them the
Nevada crew won five of the
nine bouts.
Jim Marlar and Dan Cabrera
provided the dynamite in the
match as they both exploded
with solid punches that put their
opposition down for the fatal
ten-count. Dave Oswald, fighting
as a heavyweight, also knocked
his foe down for a nine-count
and went on to decision his Ne
vada opponent.
Bellows, Jenks Robbed
George Bellows and Tom Jenks
both suffered heart-breaking
losses as the three Nevada
.judges awarded victories to their
Reno heroes. This was Jenks
first varsity loss.
As Coach Lunny put it,"The
worst that Bellows and Jenks
deserved was a draw. And here
the judges awarded the bouts to
Nevada."
Jenks' body attack was not ef
fective enough to counter the
jabs and right-hands of his foe.
Bellows who effectively em
ployed a left jab for the first
time this year and made a de
termined effort to win the fight
in the third, but the judges saw
the fight as mastered by the
Nevada boxer.
Price Victor
John Price was also a Stan
ford victor as his open style of
fighting won him a decision. Af
ter dominating the fight in the
first two rounds with his peck

ing and jabbing Price merely
kept away from his Nevada chal
lenger in the third and won a
strong decision.
Dave Hibbits and Eric de-
Cooyer also did creditable jobs
on working their opposition over
but lost to decisions. Muscling
his way into short confines with
his Nevada foe, Hibbits slugged
toe-to-toe with his opponent, but
the strong right-hand of the Reno
rapper bothered Hibbits through
out the fight.
De Gooyer, who was described
in a Nevada paper as being "gi
gantic," was also very effective
in his fight but gave way to the
more experienced but poorly
conditioned Nevada opponent.
The defending conference
champion in the 147-pound divi
sion, Bill Georgeson, proved to
be too much for Bill Thomas.
Georgeson controlled the fight
from the start but Thomas
played with his foe throughout
the bout only to lose by decision.
