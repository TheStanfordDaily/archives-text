# BRIGHT SIGNS THOUGH
## Wrestlers Win One Of Four 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity wrestling
squad salvaged only one win out
of four meets in the Great North
west last weekend. The Card s
downed Washington, 34-3, but
fell to Oregon 21-6, Oregon
State 28-2, and Washington
State 26-10.
Oregon State, last year's
AAWII champions, went on to
capture the national AAU crown
last spring.
While the meet scores left the
Indians on the desolate side of
the fence, Stanford coach Bill
Leland thinks the Cards came
out the winners in several ways.
The experience and the wealth
of information obtained through
the encounters with the north
ern teams should prove invalua
ble, according to Leland.
Experience Valuable
Leland sees the Oregon experi
ence as a stepping stone in Stan
lord wrestling. "There could be
no better thing for a young,
promising team than this kind
of experience."
In Leland's words, "We were
beaten by some very good
teams, better than we are to
day." Leland was pleased, if
not enthusiastic with the manner
in which every team member im
proved over the weekend. "They
are tough, well-conditioned wres
tlers, and we have all learned a
great deal."
Leland expects a large meas
ure of improvements to demon
strate itself by the time of the
conference tournament, three
weeks away.
Hazelton Wins Three
Leland cited John Hazelton as
the Tribe's outstanding grappler
on the road trip. Hazelton, who
has tied down the lighter side
of the Indian line-up this sea
son, won three of four 123 pound
matches last weekend.
The Indians met Oregon first.
After Hazelton won his match,
the drought began. The Ducks
won every decision until the
heavyweight division, where
Rick Lindsley won a 6-5 decision
for Stanford. Mike Davison, 177
pound Stanford co - captain
dropped a tough 2-1 decision to
the Ducks' Kent Studebaker.
After Oregon, the Cards trav
eled to Corvallis to meet the im
pressive Beavers. Oregon, with
two returning conference cham
pions and a formidable degree
of depth, surrendered a 4-4 draw
to the Indians' Frank Pratt and
took every other decision.
Washington wrestled with a
weak team, the Huskies forfeit

ing five divisions. Hazelton won
16-1, and Bill Vogelpohl took a
13-2 decision in the 152 division.
Steve Schaum ran up a total of
12 points to his opponents 3 at
167 pounds. Mike Davison came
out on the wrong side of a 9-7
decision.
Washington State met the
Cards on Saturday night. Al
though Stanford was tired from
the three matches before, coach
Leland thought that in many
ways the Indians wrestled bet
ter than in their first encoun

ters.
Hazelton opened the meet
with a victory. Marshall Ott won
by forfeit, Steve Schaum battled
for nine minutes only to finish
with a 0-0 tie.
Stanford hosts Cal Poly of Po
mona this Friday afternoon at
2:00 p.m. in the Encina Gym.

conference tournament, three
weeks away.
Hazelton Wins Three
Leland cited John Hazelton as
the Tribe's outstanding grappler
on the road trip. Hazelton, who
has tied down the lighter side
of the Indian line-up this sea
son, won three of four 123 pound
matches last weekend.
The Indians met Oregon first.
After Hazelton won his match,
the drought began. The Ducks
won every decision until the
heavyweight division, where
Rick Lindsley won a 6-5 decision
for Stanford. Mike Davison, 177
pound Stanford co - captain
dropped a tough 2-1 decision to
the Ducks' Kent Studebaker.
After Oregon, the Cards trav
eled to Corvallis to meet the im
pressive Beavers. Oregon, with
two returning conference cham
pions and a formidable degree
of depth, surrendered a 4-4 draw
to the Indians' Frank Pratt and
took every other decision.
Washington wrestled with a
weak team, the Huskies forfeit

ing five divisions. Hazelton won
16-1, and Bill Vogelpohl took a
13-2 decision in the 152 division.
Steve Schaum ran up a total of
12 points to his opponents 3 at
167 pounds. Mike Davison came
out on the wrong side of a 9-7
decision.
Washington State met the
Cards on Saturday night. Al
though Stanford was tired from
the three matches before, coach
Leland thought that in many
ways the Indians wrestled bet
ter than in their first encoun

ters.
Hazelton opened the meet
with a victory. Marshall Ott won
by forfeit, Steve Schaum battled
for nine minutes only to finish
with a 0-0 tie.
Stanford hosts Cal Poly of Po
mona this Friday afternoon at
2:00 p.m. in the Encina Gym.
The freshmen and JV's tangle
with the Mare Island Naval Sta

MIKE WIIITK, assistant coach
of the Stanford varsity football
team, lias been appointed direc
tor of the Stanford Sierra Camp
at Fallen Leaf Lake, Alumni As
sociation President Lewis Fen
ton announced today. White,
who joined the coaching staff
in early 1964. is a former Uni
versity of California football
great who lettered in football,
baseball, track and rugby.
Stanford's varsity wrestling
squad salvaged only one win out
of four meets in the Great North
west last weekend. The Card s
downed Washington, 34-3, but
fell to Oregon 21-6, Oregon
State 28-2, and Washington
State 26-10.
Oregon State, last year's
AAWII champions, went on to
capture the national AAU crown
last spring.
While the meet scores left the
Indians on the desolate side of
the fence, Stanford coach Bill
Leland thinks the Cards came
out the winners in several ways.
The experience and the wealth
of information obtained through
the encounters with the north
ern teams should prove invalua
ble, according to Leland.
Experience Valuable
Leland sees the Oregon experi
ence as a stepping stone in Stan
lord wrestling. "There could be
no better thing for a young,
promising team than this kind
of experience."
In Leland's words, "We were
beaten by some very good
teams, better than we are to
day." Leland was pleased, if
not enthusiastic with the manner
in which every team member im
proved over the weekend. "They
are tough, well-conditioned wres
tlers, and we have all learned a
great deal."
Leland expects a large meas
ure of improvements to demon
strate itself by the time of the
conference tournament, three
weeks away.
