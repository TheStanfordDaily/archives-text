# LASSU Go Home
## 
### 
A large number of LASSU members seem
to be under the illusion that student represen
tation on the Committee of 15 exists at the will
and whim of the Legislature. Last Thursday,
for instance, several legislators voiced the opin
ion that a few of the five student members on
the Committee have not been taking a suffi
ciently radical line; this Thursday a bill will
be introduced which would effectively replace
these "moderates" with students more attuned
to LASSU's mode of thinking.
We find this attitude toward Stanford's first
genuine administration-faculty-student arbitra
tion group to be totally deplorable.
The Committee of 15 was formed last year
in the belief that it is possible for a group of
rational adults to resolve conflicts through dis
cussion rather than through displays and as
sertions of power.
At the time of its creation, the Committee
was lauded by many students, including most
of the Legislature, as a means by which the
University might become more amenable to
student opinion. It was thought that if the fac
ulty and administration were given an oppor
tunity to gain a thorough understanding
of the student viewpoint, Stanford's higher
echelons would surely take action on a few of
the studentry's more legitimate complaints.
Such was the case with the Judicial Compe
tence resolution unanimously agreed upon by
the Committee last September.
What the student members of the commit
tee perhaps did not realize was that the dis
cussions within the Committee would also have
the opposite effect —that the student, con
fronted with the full complexities of the Uni
versity's stands on certain issues, could no long
er claim that only the student stand was "right"
and that only the administration's position was
"wrong." Such was the case when two students,

after hearing the University's point of view on
the closing of Union Residence, voted with the
administration and faculty members of the
Committee in recommending that the issue be
dropped.
And now members of Legislature —most of
whom have never been through the cathartic
experience of sitting down and reasoning with
representatives of the faculty and administra
tion —are asking the student members of the
Committee to ignore their own powers of rea
son and to accept the LASSU "line." Such an
attitude seems wholly inconsistent with the
scholarly respect of one intellect for another
which forms the basis of the University com
munity.
Moreover, by asking for more radical repre
sentation on the Committee, the complaining
members of LASSU seem to be under the im
pression that only by taking an extreme line
and holding to it can anything be gained. The
simple fact is that in a committee of this sort,
the elder members tend to look for compromise
and react to pressure.
And finally, we would question LASSU's
very assertion that it has the power to control
student representation on the Committee of 15.
The founding agreement which set up the
Committee made no mention as to who should
appoint the student representatives; it would
seem more reasonable that the power should
rest with the student body president, or direct
ly with the students, rather than with the
LASSU speaker, who chose the current repre
sentatives.
Under ordinary circumstances, our sand-box
Legislature is harmless. But when that body
begins to have a deleterious effect upon genuine
chance for much-needed change, then it is
time that its members either shape up or get
out.
