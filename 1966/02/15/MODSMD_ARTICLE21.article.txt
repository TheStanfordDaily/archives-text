# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Sponsor System Analyzed 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Having spent some time on
both sides of the fence, I would
like to make some purely per
sonal remarks on the unusually
dysfunctional sponsor of Wilbur
Hall. I was excited and proud to
have been selected a sponsor for
the year 1904-65 and can, to this
day, think of no position open to
the undergraduate that is more
educationally rewarding. At the
same time, the realization that
the sponsor is the agonizing
problem child of the University
lessened my pride of member
ship throughout the year.
The functionability of any
greater system depends upon
the cooperation and the stimula
tion of the smaller system with
in that contribute to it. I think
it is phenomenal that Stanford
University has allowed the Wil
bur Sponsor Program to con
tinue in its somewhat stereo
typed and certainly dysfunction
al form. The sponsor, while he
has contributed to the Univer
sity community, has most defi
nitely not been co-operative, and
his stimulation to the adminis
trative system has become a de
graded jibe, with touches of irre

sponsibility and arrogance
thrown in on the side. The spon
sor suffers, I think, from delu
sions of grandeur and from a
persecution complex. This "posi
tional paranoia" occurs because
he has delegated to himself the
authority to administrate Wil
bur; certainly no one else has.
Let's face it, at best the spon
sor it a fine young man, serving
as a good example and posses
sing the ability to empathize.
He is never a trained educator;
he is never a trained psycholo
gist, and he is most likely lack
ing in administrative experience.
When he attempts to usurp
judgement in these areas, he is
impetuous youth epitomized.
To the "sponsor body" I would
suggest that the greatest ends,
both in magnitude and in sheer
numbers, are accomplished when
the tenor of institutional relation
ship is comprised of co-opera
tion and respect. To the majori
ty of the individual sponsors,
who invariably serve the Stan
ford community remarkably
well, I suggest that the few
rabble-rousing fires be squelch
ed. It is these few who yelp and
leap at the same time who cre

ate the hostility you see so
plainly about you, hostility that
does, in some measure, perme
ate every portion of the Uni
versity community.

• It's Parliamentary, Sir
Editor, The Daily:
While it is obvious that no
thing can be done to prevent
The Daily from taking flagrant
liberties with the most elemen
tary facts as long as it is intent
on doing so, it is incumbent on
those who know better to point
out such obvious errors.
The implication in The Daily
February 3 that Senator Dirk
sen rose on the floor of the Sen
ate and blocked a meeting of
the Foreign Relations Commit
tee in order to prevent a debate
on the Vietnam question is
demonstrably spurious if you
would bother to pay attention
to any news other than that
from Vietnam. Senator Dirk
sen's move was part of a parlia
mentary strategy to defeat the

administration's attempts to re
peal Secion 14-b of the Taft-
Hartley Act — the "right-to
work" section, an issue on
which the American public has
overwhelmingly voiced its sen
timents for retention. The tactic
involves blocking all committee
meetings while the Senate is in
session; it is in no way related
to any issue of foreign policy.
Your criticism might be bet
ter directed at the administra
tion for attempting to foist this
special interest piece of legisla
tion on an unwilling body of
public opinion at a time when
such vital issues as Vietnam
are at stake.
