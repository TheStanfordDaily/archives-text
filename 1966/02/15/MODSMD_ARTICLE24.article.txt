# Monkey On My Back

### Mike Couzens 
See the Row. Tours leave every
ten minutes. But don't forget
your Rush Booklet. It will tell
you the places You Can't Afford
to Miss and the places to Avoid
Like the Plague. For instance:
"At Alpha Sigma Phi that tra
dition has been built around the
brotherhood and around the indi
vidual .... At Alpha Sigma Phi
the spirit of fraternity has found
a successful blend with the role
of the individual, and it is the
blending of these two aspects of
university life that provides for
the unique and creative style of
fraternity living."
Welded
On the other hand, "The ATO
house has no stereotyped image
to which one must conform. Yet
it is a house that is tightly weld
ed together—not driven apart—
by the differences present in it."
In contrast, "What most no
ticeably characterizes the Beta
house, however, is its distinct
personality as a whole— a per
sonality that is a conscious
blend, not a chance conglomera
tion, of three important traits:
individuality, diversity and
unity."
Be that as it may, they con
tinue, "this is the real meaning
of individualism and diversity.
But the greatest strength of the
Beta house comes in its unity,
the blending of the individuals
into a proudly recognizable
whole."
But we have still not seen the

whole spectrum. "Delts share a
strong common bond of brother
hood and at the same time re
spect their brothers' individu
ality .... The Delts are proud
of their diversity and their corrv
patibility."
"The key to KA is a diversity
of background and interests
combined in the close and con
genial atmosphere at the heart
of the fraternity system."
"But above all, Kappa Sigma
is a fraternity in the true sense
of the word, a place in which
intimate friendships develop,
yet a place in which a great
breadth of interests is always
maintained."
All things considered, "Di
versity within unity is the key
to Phi Delta Theta."
Calling a Spade
Some are willing to call a
spade a spade. "It is difficult to
characterize the present "Fiji"
house. The members come
from many and diverse geogra
phical areas and educational
backgrounds. Many of us hold
different and conflicting goals
and aspirations. Yet there are
certain ideals which we hold in
common, ideals which we feel
create strong bonds between
us."
Other houses attest that you
will be in good hands since,
"Phi Kappa Sigma is a close
knit living system made up of a
group of guys who have a vital
interest in the well-being, suc
cess, and common interest of the
individual.
"Still, this diversity does not
limit the ability of members of
the house to create a close bond
with one another."
If you insist upon a different
approach, consider Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. "It is recognized that
voluntary association with the
group is involved, and thus the
individual member cannot be
forced to conform to any cer
tain standards of behavior. This
feeling leads to a loose, yet har
monious consensus under which
the house operates."
Philosophy
There are even those who wax
philosophical. "If we have a
philosophy, it's probably this;
that fraternity living requires a
certain degree of unity if the
group is to accomplish its ob
jectives, but that a meaningful
undergraduate living situation
must also encourage the individ
ual member to pursue his per
sonal interests. Thus we have
at Theta Chi a diverse group of
individuals who enjoy living to
gether in the cooperative sys
tem of the fraternity."
And so, dear freshman, you
have seen the smorgasbord.
Your fork dangles over these
myriad delicacies. Can't decide?
Well, any port in the storm, as
Dean Wert is wont to remark.
Turn to the last page of the
booklet for a breath of fresh
air. This group is so out, it's in.
"We would like to character
ize Serra by its diversity and
tolerance, but you'll probably
be tired of reading that by the

feeling leads to a loose, yet har

the house operates."
Philosophy
There are even those who wax
philosophical. "If we have a
philosophy, it's probably this;
that fraternity living requires a
certain degree of unity if the
group is to accomplish its ob
jectives, but that a meaningful
undergraduate living situation
must also encourage the individ
ual member to pursue his per
sonal interests. Thus we have
at Theta Chi a diverse group of
individuals who enjoy living to
gether in the cooperative sys
tem of the fraternity."
And so, dear freshman, you
have seen the smorgasbord.
Your fork dangles over these
myriad delicacies. Can't decide?
Well, any port in the storm, as
Dean Wert is wont to remark.
Turn to the last page of the
booklet for a breath of fresh
air. This group is so out, it's in.
"We would like to character
ize Serra by its diversity and
tolerance, but you'll probably
be tired of reading that by the
time you get to our page."
See the Row. Tours leave every
ten minutes. But don't forget
your Rush Booklet. It will tell
you the places You Can't Afford
to Miss and the places to Avoid
Like the Plague. For instance:
"At Alpha Sigma Phi that tra
dition has been built around the
brotherhood and around the indi
vidual .... At Alpha Sigma Phi
the spirit of fraternity has found
a successful blend with the role
of the individual, and it is the
blending of these two aspects of
university life that provides for
the unique and creative style of
fraternity living."
Welded
On the other hand, "The ATO
house has no stereotyped image
to which one must conform. Yet
it is a house that is tightly weld
ed together—not driven apart—
by the differences present in it."
In contrast, "What most no
ticeably characterizes the Beta
house, however, is its distinct
personality as a whole— a per
sonality that is a conscious
blend, not a chance conglomera
tion, of three important traits:
individuality, diversity and
unity."
Be that as it may, they con
tinue, "this is the real meaning
of individualism and diversity.
But the greatest strength of the
Beta house comes in its unity,
the blending of the individuals
into a proudly recognizable
whole."
But we have still not seen the

whole spectrum. "Delts share a
strong common bond of brother
hood and at the same time re
spect their brothers' individu
ality .... The Delts are proud
of their diversity and their corrv
patibility."
"The key to KA is a diversity
of background and interests
combined in the close and con
genial atmosphere at the heart
of the fraternity system."
"But above all, Kappa Sigma
is a fraternity in the true sense
of the word, a place in which
intimate friendships develop,
yet a place in which a great
breadth of interests is always
maintained."
All things considered, "Di
versity within unity is the key
to Phi Delta Theta."
Calling a Spade
Some are willing to call a
spade a spade. "It is difficult to
characterize the present "Fiji"
house. The members come
from many and diverse geogra
phical areas and educational
backgrounds. Many of us hold
different and conflicting goals
and aspirations. Yet there are
certain ideals which we hold in
common, ideals which we feel
create strong bonds between
us."
Other houses attest that you
will be in good hands since,
"Phi Kappa Sigma is a close
knit living system made up of a
group of guys who have a vital
interest in the well-being, suc
cess, and common interest of the
individual.
"Still, this diversity does not
limit the ability of members of
the house to create a close bond
with one another."
If you insist upon a different
approach, consider Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. "It is recognized that
