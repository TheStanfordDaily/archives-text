# New Projects Keeping PACE With Funds

Campus administrators always agree
on one point concerning university ex
pansion and fund raising: the process
never stops.
Robert Funk, assistant to the Dean
of Undergraduate Education, told the
DAILY that some projects in prog
ress now are in the process of
being financed. As the man assigned
to prepare the final PACE report last
year, he named the following PACE
projects that will be ready for occu
pancy this fall:
• Undergraduate Library.
• Herrin Biological Sciences Center.
• Student Health Center.
• Graduate School of Business.
• Clinical Sciences Research Build
ing.

• Bing School of Nursing.
Four other projects for which sub
stantial funds have been raised and
which will begin construction in the
near future are a new engineering
building, its laboratory, a Hoover
Tower addition at Serra and Galvez,
and the remodeling of the old Union
into the Student Services Building.
Even as PACE ended, budgets were
in the planning stages for the next
several fiscal years, and efforts have
had to be redoubled to make certain
that income did not drop off after
PACE'S unprecedented success.
Stanford has long faced a thorny
problem with its image as a wealthy
university. As Stanford's plant and
prestige has grown, it has taken addi
tional revenues to maintain these im
provements.

Excellence has its price, and offi
cials admit that the general plant still
lags behind its people and programs,
both in size and quality; the gap must
be filled if the school is to continue
to recruit the top academic talent in
the nation.
The fund-raising goal for 1965-66
is $25.5 million. In the peak PACE
year, more than $3S million was col
lected. Jack Shepard, Director of De
velopment, estimates that $-10 to Sl5
million will be needed by 1970. Fur
thermore, no university-wide fund
raising program like PACE is fore
seen to help raise this additional
amount.
Who are the people whose year
round efforts permit Stanford such

a fantastic rate of growth? Accord
ing to Shepard, most of Stanford's
fund raising is done by volunteers
"starting with the Board of Trustees
on down" except for faculty and ad
ministration assistance.
One of the chief committees con
cerned with university finances is the
Stanford Cabinet headed by Charles
Ducommun, Los Angeles trustee.
Members of the cabinet are two repre
sentatives from the Stanford Associa
tion, the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion, and the chairmen of the Stan
ford Annual Fund and Major Gift?;,
Corporations and Bequests commit
tees. One non-alumnus parent also at
tends.
Shepard particularly gives the Stan
ford Associates credit for getting the

PACE program underway when the
Ford Foundation promised its $25 mil
lion matching grant in 1960. But be
fore that grant was even conceived,
the Stanford Associates were tackling
the problem of how to raise the esti
mated $346 million budget for the
1960'5.
The effects of PACE are even being
felt at other universities. Carolyn
French, Stanford Associates staffer,
said she couldn't begin to name all
the schools who have borrowed fund
raising ideas innovated by PACE.
Highest flattery came from the Uni
versity of Chicago when it appointed
Richard F. O'Brien Vice President for
Planning and Development as a result
of his work as Director of Develop
ment during the PACE campaign.
