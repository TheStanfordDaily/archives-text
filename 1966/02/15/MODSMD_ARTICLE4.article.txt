# Spangler Says Press Moving To Controls
## 
### 
More and better crime reporting is
needed —not less, concluded Raymond
Spangler, Redwood City Tribune pub
lisher, in a speech last night. But, he
said, the United States is moving to
ward British-style control of the press
despite the First Amendment.
Fair trial and free press are not ir
reconcilable, but mutually dependent,
Spangler told an audience gathered in
Cubberley Auditorium to hear the sec
ond annual Carlos McClatchy Memo
rial Lecture.
Spangler facetiously defined the
average person's concept of fair trial
and free press: "When a crime is com
mitted by someone else, he wants to
know all about it; that's free press.
But if the crime involves him, he
wants it kept out of the paper. That's
fair trial."
"We—the press," Spangler said,
"are accused of poisoning the font of
justice before it begins to flow by
publishing prejudicial material." Span
gler pointed out, however, that it was
a journalist who first disclosed and
"then diligently reported the illegal
activities which have since become
known as the Billy Sol Estes case."
Ironically, the United States Su
preme Court reversed Estes' convic
tion because of prejudicial pre-trial
publicity. "I doubt," Spangler said,
"that any one of the nine justices
has had any experience with a tele
vised or broadcast trial."
It is possible to have full television
and press coverage of a trial without
interfering with the judicial proc
ess, Splanger maintained. He cited
two examples where cameras were so
inohtrusive that witnesses barely no
ticed them.
