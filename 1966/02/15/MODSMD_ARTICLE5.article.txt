The Institute for International Re
lations (IIR) has postponed both its
Africa and Middle East Weeks but has
scheduled another event in the near
future.
The date of Africa week has been
recently moved to an indefinite time
next quarter in order to complement
an African cultural week sponsored
by the Federation of African Students.
The Middle East Week has also been
set for Spring Quarter but the exact
date has not yet been decided upon.
