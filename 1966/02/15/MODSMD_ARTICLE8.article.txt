# Students Now Pay Less To Fly
## 
### ERIC OLSEN 
Some of the greatest transporta
tion baragins ever offered are now
available to Stanford students in the
half fare plans recently announced by
many of the country's major airlines.
Most of the plans work this way:
by presenting three dollars and proof
of age, anyone between the ages of
12 and 21 may buy a card entitling
him, until his 22nd birthday, to fly
space available at half the regular
coach fare. This means Stanford stu
dents can fly to New York for $145.10
round trip plus tax, to Chicago for
$105.45, or to Seattle for $42.35.
Many of the airlines have student
card sales. Other cards must be pur
chased at the airport. Information of
representatives on campus to handle
all the cards is available at the Se
quoia Travel Service in Tresidder
Union.

The half fare plans are limited in
several respects. Most of the cards
may be used almost anywhere inside
the United States, but not within the
state of California or to Hawaii, Can
ada, or Mexico.
A second important limitation is
that the cards are not valid during a
few peak travel periods. This year
the cards for most of the airlines may
not be used April 7, November 23 and
27, and December 15 through 24. This
means the cards are good for the
spring break and the summer, but
not for Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Youth fare card holders fly space
available, meaning no reserved seats.
Regular reservations have first
choice of seats, then the military per
sonnel who fly at reduced rates get
a crack, and finally the youth fares
get what is left.
The chance of getting a seat varies
greatly with the time of year and
the particular flight. Airline repre
sentatives say that except during
heavy travel periods, scats are easily
available to half fare students.
Another disadvantage is the possi
bility of being bumped by a full fare
passenger at an intermediate land
ing.
Variations
Some of the airlines, especially the
smaller ones, do not follow the same
pattern as the rest. Pacific Air Lines,
for example, offers a ten dollar card
good for a year on any day tvithin
California.
Another important factor to look
into when buying a card is the possi
bility that some of the airlines may
accept each other's cards. Every few
days the situation changes, but the
latest information is that TWA may

accept United's card, and similar
agreements may be made among
other airlines.
American Airlines revived the
youth fare idea last month by asking
the Civil Aeronautics Board to ap
prove the plan for a one-year trial
period. Other airlines immediately
followed suit to remain competitive,
although some were reluctant to do
so because of poor experiences with
reduced fare plans in the past. Other
opposition to the plans comes from
some of the student ticket agencies
and travel services, which loose com
missions when students fly space
available.
Abuses
In 19G1 several airlines experi
mented with youth fare plans, but
soon dropped them because the priv
ilege was being abused. Bargain fare
students were selling tickets to older
passengers at a profit, and often the
students would reserve seats by
phone, only to cancel out at the last
minute and fly standby at half fare.
The identification card idea, de
veloped by Bonanza Airlines in 1961,
guarantees the airlines against the
illegal selling of tickets to older pas
sengers. The travel agencies are unit
ing with the airlines to combat the
second abuse by not making reserva
tions for students holding youth
fares.
The competition among the air
lines establishing half fare plans has
been intense. TWA distributed forms
throughout the dorms even before the
CAB approved the plans. American
Airlines has lined up several hotel
chains to honor the cards for special
privileges. Some airlines may soon
accept each other's cards.

representatives on campus to handle
all the cards is available at the Se
quoia Travel Service in Tresidder
Union.

The half fare plans are limited in
several respects. Most of the cards
may be used almost anywhere inside
the United States, but not within the
state of California or to Hawaii, Can
ada, or Mexico.
A second important limitation is
that the cards are not valid during a
few peak travel periods. This year
the cards for most of the airlines may
not be used April 7, November 23 and
27, and December 15 through 24. This
means the cards are good for the
spring break and the summer, but
not for Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Youth fare card holders fly space
available, meaning no reserved seats.
Regular reservations have first
choice of seats, then the military per
sonnel who fly at reduced rates get
a crack, and finally the youth fares
get what is left.
The chance of getting a seat varies
greatly with the time of year and
the particular flight. Airline repre
sentatives say that except during
heavy travel periods, scats are easily
available to half fare students.
Another disadvantage is the possi
bility of being bumped by a full fare
passenger at an intermediate land
ing.
Variations
Some of the airlines, especially the
smaller ones, do not follow the same
pattern as the rest. Pacific Air Lines,
for example, offers a ten dollar card
good for a year on any day tvithin
California.
Another important factor to look
into when buying a card is the possi
bility that some of the airlines may
accept each other's cards. Every few
days the situation changes, but the
latest information is that TWA may

accept United's card, and similar
agreements may be made among
other airlines.
American Airlines revived the
youth fare idea last month by asking
the Civil Aeronautics Board to ap
prove the plan for a one-year trial
period. Other airlines immediately
followed suit to remain competitive,
although some were reluctant to do
so because of poor experiences with
reduced fare plans in the past. Other
opposition to the plans comes from
some of the student ticket agencies
and travel services, which loose com
missions when students fly space
available.
Abuses
In 19G1 several airlines experi
mented with youth fare plans, but
soon dropped them because the priv
ilege was being abused. Bargain fare
students were selling tickets to older
passengers at a profit, and often the
students would reserve seats by
phone, only to cancel out at the last
minute and fly standby at half fare.
The identification card idea, de
veloped by Bonanza Airlines in 1961,
guarantees the airlines against the
illegal selling of tickets to older pas
sengers. The travel agencies are unit
ing with the airlines to combat the
second abuse by not making reserva
tions for students holding youth
fares.
The competition among the air
lines establishing half fare plans has
been intense. TWA distributed forms
throughout the dorms even before the
CAB approved the plans. American
Airlines has lined up several hotel
chains to honor the cards for special
privileges. Some airlines may soon
accept each other's cards.
Some of the greatest transporta
tion baragins ever offered are now
available to Stanford students in the
half fare plans recently announced by
many of the country's major airlines.
Most of the plans work this way:
by presenting three dollars and proof
of age, anyone between the ages of
12 and 21 may buy a card entitling
him, until his 22nd birthday, to fly
space available at half the regular
coach fare. This means Stanford stu
dents can fly to New York for $145.10
round trip plus tax, to Chicago for
$105.45, or to Seattle for $42.35.
Many of the airlines have student
card sales. Other cards must be pur
chased at the airport. Information of
