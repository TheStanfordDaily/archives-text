# Lewis Deplores The Public's Ignorance Of American Jazz
## 
### 
John Lewis, musical director for the
Modern Jazz Quartet, said yesterday,
in the final winter quarter lecture of
the Stanford Jazz Year, that Ameri
cans do not really understand jazz and
have not been given an opportunity to
learn about it.
"We want to know about the food
wo eat and the water we drink," he
stated, "and I think music is equally
important." Lewis suggested that uni
versities provide people who could
inform listeners about jazz, and that
people, when they are still young, go
to as many live performances as pos
sible.
Citing the steadiness of boat as es
sential to good jazz, Lewis said that
until recently most Americans had
no conception of this rhythm. He add
ed, however, that the new rock 'n roll
singers of England like the Beatles
had improved the situation some

what.
Lewis told the audience that "sim
ply listening to music is not onough."
He suggested that people do more
studying of the social history of jazz,
why people play it, what instruments
are used, the effect of Broadway musi
cals on jazz, but most of all, the rea
sons how and why jazz developed as
an American art form.
Lewis said that from his experi
ences on tours of Europe he found
that Europeans know much more
about their national music than do
Americans. He pointed out that in
one Italian village practically every
one knew the operas of that country
down to the individual notes.
He concluded, that although some
American composers had been keep
ing up with the times, thr bands were
falling behind the British in fields like
individual improvization.
