When our representative visits your campus, take ad
vantage of an interview session to probe beneath the
surface of a company that means many things to many
people. Because it never stops coming up with new
surprises.
Don't be too surprised when he gives you a complete run
down of our research and development groups...and
you suddenly realize that our well-known office copiers
share the "internal" spotlight with more than a score of
other seemingly unrelated studies, devices, products and
systems.
Ask him what we mean when we say that the real busi
ness of Xerox is graphic communications. Draw him out
on how we came to start a revolution in office copying,
and transformed this success into an interdisciplinary
assault on the global information explosion.
Let him explain LDX (Long Distance Xerography) — what
it is today, and what it implies in the context of to
morrow's integrated computer/communication networks.
Learn the roles of chemistry, physical optics, mathemati
cal analysis and systems engineering for new products
still as much as a decade away from the light of day.
Then, if you're intrigued enough (and there's time
enough), let him ask a few leading questions of his own.
