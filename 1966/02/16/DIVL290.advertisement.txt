Suppose, for the sake of argument, all men faced a great accounting of
of their lives, at the end of time:
"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and
books were opened. And the dead were judged by what was written in
the books, by what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead that was
in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were
judged by what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into
the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire,- and if any one's
name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire'' (Revelation 20).
Suppose, for purposes of discussion, Jesus Christ knew what he was
talking about when he said,
"Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead
will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For
as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have
have life in himself, and has given him authority to execute judgment,
because he is the Son of man. Do not marvel at this; for the hour is com
ing when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice, and come forth,
those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have
done evil, to the resurrection of judgment" (John 5).
Suppose, Paul's words in the book of Romans applied to VOU as well as
to the rest of all mankind,
"Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for your
self on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by
patience and well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will
give eternal life,- but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth
but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury, There will be tribula
tion and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and
also the Greek ... for God shows no partiality'' (Romans 2).
Suppose, after all, the Bible turns out to be true, and Jesus Christ is who
he claims to be, the Son of God and Righteous Juduge of all mankind?
Wouldn't it be a serious mistake to ignore the possibility of eternal life and
take the consequences? Why not check out the possibilities and look into the
evidence and personal proof which God offers. Suppose you've been wrong
and stay that way? What might happen then?

Suppose, for purposes of discussion, Jesus Christ knew what he was
talking about when he said,
"Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead
will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For
as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have
have life in himself, and has given him authority to execute judgment,
because he is the Son of man. Do not marvel at this; for the hour is com
ing when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice, and come forth,
those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have
done evil, to the resurrection of judgment" (John 5).
Suppose, Paul's words in the book of Romans applied to VOU as well as
to the rest of all mankind,
"Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for your
self on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by
patience and well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will
give eternal life,- but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth
but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury, There will be tribula
tion and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and
also the Greek ... for God shows no partiality'' (Romans 2).
Suppose, after all, the Bible turns out to be true, and Jesus Christ is who
he claims to be, the Son of God and Righteous Juduge of all mankind?
Wouldn't it be a serious mistake to ignore the possibility of eternal life and
take the consequences? Why not check out the possibilities and look into the
evidence and personal proof which God offers. Suppose you've been wrong
and stay that way? What might happen then?

Suppose, for the sake of argument, all men faced a great accounting of
of their lives, at the end of time:
"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and
books were opened. And the dead were judged by what was written in
the books, by what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead that was
in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were
judged by what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into
the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire,- and if any one's
name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire'' (Revelation 20).
