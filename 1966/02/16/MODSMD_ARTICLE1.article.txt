• Bombing Stop Urged
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y.—Nguyen
Duy Lien, South Vietnam's perma
nent U.N. observer, said today his
government was "not yet committed"
to unconditional negotiations to end
the war. He said South Vietnam's con
ditions for official negotiations were
that North Vietnam must withdraw
its men and arms from South Vietna
mese territory and that the Viet Cong
must stop fighting.
The United States, in its 14-point
peace proposals, has declared itself
"prepared for discussions or negotia
tions without any prior conditions
whatsoever on the basis of the Gene
va accords of 1954 and 1962."
Asked whether South Vietnam was
willing to engage in such discussions
or such a conference, Lien replied that
it was "not yet committed" to either

course and, until it sconditions were
fulfilled, would not go beyond "pri
vate consultations."
• Cambodia May Join VC
TOKYO — Cambodia's Chief of
State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, was
quoted today as saying that Cam
bodia, if invaded, would form a united
front with communist forces in Viet
nam, Laos and Thailand.
Peking's New China News Agency,
in a broadcast monitored here, said
the statement was made Monday in
an address to Cambodia's Parliament.
After accusing Thailand and South
Vietnam of conducting "daily increas
ing incursions and provocations"
against Cambodia, Sihanouk said:
"We therefore inform the world, and
in particular, the imperialists and
their lackeys, our enimies, that we

will unhesitatingly join the fraternal
peoples of Vietnam (North Vietnam
and Viet Cong), of Laos (The Pathet
Lao), and of Thailand (The Patriotic
Front) to form a united front against
the aggressors."
• Italian Crisis Continues
ROME, — President Giuseppe Sara
gat tonight gave Aldo Moro a two-day
extension in Moro's search for a com
promise solution to the 25-day-old
Italian government crisis.
Moro resigned as Italy's Premier

Jan. 21 after parliamentary defeat
of a major government-sponsored bill
on public nursery schools. The Presi
dent asked him to form another gov
ernment. Moro tried but gave up Feb.
5 when the four coalition parties hit
an impasse over the makeup of a new
cabinet.
• British Buy F-l ll's
LONDON — The British govern
ment decided today to buy American
supersonic bombers to form the main

thrust of Britain's strategic nuclear
strike force.
The decision was reached during a
sweeping review of defense policy for
the 1970s carried out by Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson's labor cabinet
in 6V2 hours of discussion yesterday.
Although it represented a major de
feat for the royal navy, no resigna
tions were reported after today's
final cabinet meeting. Informants
tended to discount widespread re
ports that naval ministers and several
admirals were considering resigna
tion.
• South Vietnam Sulks
DURHAM, N.C.—A conference co
ordinated by eight Democratic Con
gressmen urged today that the U.S.
stop its bombing of North Vietnam
and that the Viet Cong be included in

peace talks to end the conflict in Viet
nam.
Eighteen specific recommendations,
drafted at a mid-January meeting in
Washington, were released by Dr.
Arthur Larson, Director of the Rules
on Liw Research Center at Duke
University, who served as chairman
of the group.
He said the congressmen "believe
their office requires a more funda
mental examination of foreign policy
than that allowed by even the most
careful consideration of specific legis
lation."
The Congressmen were Benjamin
S. .Rosenthal, D N.Y., Charles C. Diggs
Jr., D-Mich., Don Edwards, D Calif.,
Leonard Farbstein, D-N.Y., Donald
