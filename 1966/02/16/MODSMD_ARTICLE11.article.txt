Packer Talks On Fiction
"If a woman does not know what she thinks until she hears what
she has to say, a writer does not know what he understands until
he sees it written out in a story," Nancy Packer told the 1966 Stan
ford Conference in Phoenix.
A contributor to Harper's, The Kenyon Review, the Yale Review,
Contact, and the Southwest Review, Mrs. Packer holds the E. H.
Jones lectureship in creative writing here.
For undergraduates as for professionals, she suggested, "writing
fiction is a way of dealing imaginatively with experience which
causes the writer some kind of internal trouble. "Writing is a tech
nique of solving problems by projecting them imaginatively."

water, as opposed to desalting the sea.
