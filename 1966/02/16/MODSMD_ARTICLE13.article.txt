# Chathem Pres-Sees Student-Faculty Strife

### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J. (CPS)
â€”"The coming strife in educa
tion will be an encounter be
tween the faculty and the stu
dents," Dr. Edward D. Eddy,
president of Chathem College,
predicted Friday.
Dr. Eddy, who has become a
national figure in recent years
by being virtually the only col
lege president to enunciate the
dilemma of the college student,
said that students are going to
demand more and more from
their professors.
Speaking to the Education
Writers Association, Dr. Eddy
said that "despite a possible
trend in the other direction, it
still remains valid that the cur
rent reward for good teaching is
less teaching."
He pointed out that a teacher
who performs well is given a
lighter load and more graduate
students to assist him with his
work as a demonstration of the
college's appreciation. "Thus,"
Dr. Eddy said, "the student is
even more impaired."
Asked why the gap between
the student and the teacher
seemed to be widening, Dr. Ed
dy said it was no longer "fash
ionable" for faculty members to
be close to students.
