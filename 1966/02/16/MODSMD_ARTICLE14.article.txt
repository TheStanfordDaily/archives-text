# Protesters, Pills, And The Health Service
## 
### Maurice M. Osborne 
The petition being circulated by the Stan
ford Sexual Rights Forum "that the Univer
sity Health Service be authorized to prescribe
contraceptives to any student desiring them"
seems to me a tragically crude and simplistic
approach to an enormously complex and sensi
tive issue.
Even when I try to view it in a purely hypo
thetical context (assuming that such a policy
was in effect; and assuming by some imagi
nary legerdemain the general support, or neu
trality, or perhaps even the non-existence, of
the University community), I remain unable,
despite much thought and some experience,
to resolve some serious divisions in my own
opinions and beliefs. I can see contraception
as a possible preventive measure against the
often-pathologic consequences of pre-marital
pregnancy, but am not sure it would be used
when most needed. I do not believe it would
promote mass fornication, but I fear it might
reinforce existing pressures that already urge
premarital intercourse on some who are not
ready or basically willing, and encourage
some students who are exploitive and preda
tory. I can see that professional control might
be helpful, but I fear to equip, even unknow
ingly, a set of self-appointed student "sex
counsellors" and gatekeepers.
Naive Assumption
To be more detailed, I do not believe that
such a policy would turn Stanford into a Satur
nalian orgy nor seriously increase the inci
dence of premarital intercourse, anymore than
I believe that the "Stanford View" bar will
become "a haven for perverts, dope pushers,
and sex peddlers." Such fears are based on
the naive assumption that fear of pregnancy
is virtually the sole deterrent, along with V.D.,
to premarital intercourse, ignoring such con
siderations as that it's just possible most stu
dents continue to have strong ethical and
moral values that form their chief restraint;
that many do not feel personally ready or even
desirous for such a degree of involvement; and
that in the main they wish neither to use nor
be used by one another, sexually or other
wise. Such fears also ignore the findings of
responsible scholars, such as Drs. Nevitt San
ford and Mervin Frcedman who find (despite
the fairly wide availability and use of contra
ceptives in the last few years) very little
change in the incidence of premarital inter
course on our campuses over the past three
Idecades, notwithstanding the crescendo of
concerned (and fascinated!) alarmists. But I
am less sure that such a policy would not en
courage some affairs that were better not to
happen.
I can wish, and would like to be much surer
than I am, that a policy of "universal prescrip
tion" would avert some premature and pa
thetic marriages (and the involvement of chil
dren in weak homes, or in early divorce) and
prevent some truly tragic consequences of
unwanted and illegitimate pregnancy, up to
and including near-death and mutilation re
sulting from illegal and septic abortion.
No Condemnation
I cannot honestly condemn a mutually con
siderate, discreet premarital sexual relation
between two people who are sincerely involved
with each other primarily as human beings,
nor can I flatly condemn their desire for con
traception, particularly if they are honestly
not sure of a permanent union in a world
that has so many threats to permanence. How
ever, I am not at all sure I could be wise
enough to distinguish the serious from the
frivolous, nor if I should try.
There may also be some validity to the no
tion that some serious, as opposed to casual,
premarital experience in love, including its
sexual dimension, might lead to sounder and
more fulfilled marriage, in that the partners
might come to it with fewer illusions and
false expectations. (I must classify this as
conjecture, not fact—and certainly not en
dorsement.) Despite such possible benefits
(still viewing it hypothetically, and as if it
were solely a matter between the Health Ser
vice and students,) I continue to have further
serious doubts about such a policy.
Some have to do with whether or not we
are kidding ourselves that such a policy
would, in fact, effectively reduce unwanted
pregnancy and its often tragic consequences.
In this connection, I would remain concerned
about the students who, despite all official ap
proval and all professions of confidentiality,
will still be loath to use such a service because
of a- fear that seeking of contraception will
be recorded "against them," but who will still
have intercourse. I would remain concerned,
too, about the sensitive and idealistic student
who feels that to use contraceptives (particu
larly those requiring daily ingestion, when so
many days are busy and unromantic) is to
bring a degree of heartless calculation to a
deep and wonderful passion, a passion in
which the quality of spontaneity seems very
close to the quality of selflessness and honesty
in an otherwise contrived and self-seeking
world.
Social Pressures
Some doubts have to do with a concern for
the susceptibility and vulnerability of many
young people to social pressures—which at
times promote and urge intercourse upefn
those who do not want it, who are not ready,
and for whom the very lack of "easy" contra
ception can be a mutually acceptable refuge.
A girl in love, or wishing to be, who is faced
with an ultimatum ("If you don't Baby, it's
all over,") faces a cruel choice. It is cynical
to suggest that her dilemma would be easily
diminished by a prescription. Here the vulner
ability would not. lie in the dangers of preg
nancy to be sure, but in some more subtly
destructive confusion and degradation of self
worth and of her attempt to relate as a person,
not just an object.
The same could apply just as well to a sen
sitive young man, desiring group approval
but fearful of his readiness, who is made to
feel that failure "to make out" is tantamount
to ostracism.
I would remain concerned that, even with
the best of intentions, University endorsement
of what I believe should remain a personal
and highly individualized decision would, in
some cases, be construed as tacit encourage

ment to accept a simple pharmacologic solu
tion to situations really needing much more
than that, including the neurotic self-victimi
zation of some students, and exploitiveness of
others, in meaningless, destructive, and sor
did uses of sex. Neither the Service nor the
University could, for instance, piously dis
claim responsibility for even unwittingly help
ing to set up a "pigeon" for the degradation
of a sick party involving serial and exhibition
ist intercourse, however "willing" the victim.
There would be some serious problems in
volving our ability to meet the professional
obligations such a policy would impose on
the Service. I am by no means confident, in
the context of Health Service practice, that we
could distinguish the student needing a great
deal more than a prescription, and yet our
obligation would be to attempt it. I am some
what more confident that our attempt to han
dle each case on its overall clinical and human
merits would result in a charge of "discrimi
nation." It is also not unlikely that the stu
dent we saw might not be the one needing
guidance, but the invisible partner.
A Pill Machine
The alternative, probably fostered by the
very volume of student health visits (for all
purposes), by real difficulties in diagnosis, and
by the doctor's bent to remain neutral and
nonjudgmental, would be to reduce the pro
fessional function to something no more re
sponsible nor constructive than a well-designed
vending machine with pills and suitable in
structions. Doctors, in or out of Health Ser
vices, are not, or never should allow them
selves to be, vending machines or drugstores,
and this would be no exception.
I would be concerned with the almost in
evitable transition from professional supervi
sion to potentially-disastrous student dispen
sing and "counselling." While I am sure there
are students who, as individuals and couples,
are responsible, mutually considerate, and
respectful of the sensibilities of others; I am
equally sure that there are others riding a
group wave, for whom possession of contra
ceptive pills, or devices, is a status symbol not
to be used only for private, personal use, but
to influence others for whom they can be
come the non-professional, potentially manipu
lative, and at least unqualified gatekeeper of
both the contraceptive and the misinforma
tion that likely goes with it. I have known of
instances in which, by the time the pills got
to the third member of a clique, one only had
to take "a few" before a date. Of course this
goes on now, but it is another matter to un
dertake institutional and professional respon
sibility for a policy and practices of which
such abuses could be a part.
Idealism And Reform
In the foregoing paragraphs I have tried
to examine the issues, pro and con, from the
viewpoint of an hypothetical absence of com
munity reaction, and an equally hypothetical
assumption that the petitioners' policy were
adopted. I hope the petitioners' assumptions
stem from the idealism motivating many stu
dent reformers, idealism without which re
forms anywhere are hardly possible.
But in this case (as in many others around
the Bay Area) the hoped for idealism appears
to be accompanied by a kind of tunnel vision
which appears to ignore (or reject) the fact
that Stanford (or Berkeley, or anywhere) is
a social entity depending upon exceedingly
complex inter-relationships for its survival
and growth. Great differences of honest opin
ion and of perception exist among the many

people and groups that make up the Univer
sity, and the real strength and hope of the
University lies in its ability not only to accom
modate them, but to do so in a manner that
by and large results in more valid progress
than it is credited with.
With respect to contraception, both the
strengths and divergences of sincere belief are
very marked and very real, much more so
than in respect to liquor policy. In the latter
issue, there is something much closer .to a
consensus than can possibly yet be true in
respect to contraceptives, and without such
a consensus the chances of viable policy are
negligible.
It is naive to think that a policy such as
that proposed by the Stanford Sexual Rights
Forum could possibly remain within a con
text of a confidential doctor-patient relation
ship. In alt its actions (both acceptable and
controversial) the Health Service represents
the University. When the Service goofs, it is
almost always the institution that is angrily
written to (usually in the person of President
Sterling), and it is only when there is some
general approval of acceptance of practice and
policy that the Service can function.
Health Service Policy
The present Health Service policy (quite
accurately though briefly set forth by the
petitioners) provides a good example of this
process. For clarification I will outline it
again.

Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Jr., Exectitive
Director of the University Health Service,
has prepared this reply to a petition being
circulated on campus by the Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum. The petition asks for a stu
dent body vote on the proposal,
Be it hereby resolved that the Associated
Students of Stanford University urge that
the University Health Service be authorized
to prescribe contraceptives to any student
desiring them.
Attached to the petition is a statement
by the SSRF delineating the Forum's re
quest for a change in Health Service policy.
The statement reads-.
We feel that the University Health Ser
vice should be authorized to prescribe con
traceptives to any student desiring them.
Presently, the Health Service will pre
scribe contraceptives to any married stu
dent. Unmarried students are usually re
ferred to private doctors in nearby areas.
Women students who definitely plan to be
married, and as evidence of this will take
required blood tests, may obtain prescrip
tions for contraceptives from the Health
Service.
We find the present University Health
Service policy hypocritical. It is in contra
diction with the University's aim of en
couraging students to make their own deci
sions regarding personal behavior. We
strongly feel that this policy of discrimina
tion against unmarried students should be
eliminated.

The Health Service Is authorized:
• To prescribe contraceptives to any mar
ried student desiring them.
• To prescribe contraceptives to a student
who wishes them and who has bona fide
intent to marry within one or two months.
(The evidence of bona fide intent is the com
pletion of a premarital health review which
includes legal certification of the review and
blood test, and which is valid for 60 days.)
• To discuss the problem of contraception
with any student as a matter of information
and education—with emphasis placed (a) on
discussion of the kinds of problems and re
sponsibilities the student will assume if he or
she elects to proceed, and (b) on the fact that
such a decision must be the student's personal
responsibility (including whether or not to
involve parents), and (c) on helping the stu
dent to ask if he or she is ready to assume
such responsibilities.
If the student decides to proceed, it must
be on the basis of a private doctor-patient
relationship undertaken as an individual, out
side the Health Service or any University
context. It remains a private decision and ac
tion, in which the University simply cannot
be a partner until such time (if it ever comes)
when there is some general agreement that
it should be. It is one thing for a University
to say (as John Galbraith has suggested) that
it should have no role in its students' personal
lives, and quite another for students to insist
that their University officially participate in
their private and personal lives—on their
terms, yet.
Feelings Of Parents
The difficulties in approaching such a new
consensus, without which any real decision
is impossible, are enormous, and require much
thought and sympathetic understanding.
Among the most important factors are the
feelings of many parents who cannot be uni
formly wrong; who, even when less liberal
than some, usually are sincere in their beliefs;
and who in any case have a legal position re
their children under 21 that gives them the
right to sue for contributing to the delinquen
cy of a minor should they disapprove of these
children being prescribed contraceptives.
Another difficulty is that the University,
because of its real dependence on community
support and subsidies, cannot be wholly in
different to adverse publicity and opinion,
particularly in an area in which it cannot
honestly and wholeheartedly defend, let alone
be widely supported in. Thus, when actions
and statements in such a sensitive area as
contraceptives (no matter how well meant)
boomerang in the form of headlines, strongly
felt opposition, or disappointment (again, re
garless of how sincere or how irresponsible
the response), it is fatuous to assume that
one can simply brush these reactions aside
as of no consequence: they can hurt the Uni
versity in an area in which it can't fight back,
except by repression.
Most basic of the difficulties is the real gap
in understanding between the generations. To
some extent it has always existed, but it
seems wider to me now than it once was.
People of my generation and beyond have
grown up and made more or less successful
adaptations to the World while carrying along
whole sets of assumptions that (probably be
cause they seem to have "worked") we have
not really questioned nor thought about very
much. They are particularly strong in areas
relating to sex, and though they may or may
not be "right," they are for the most part
sincerely held by men and women of good
will. It is extremely difficult to re-examine
the long-held tenets of one's life and actions,
and it comes even a little harder to have it done
for one, gratis, by much younger individuals.
As a matter of fact it is as hard to take as it
is for serious and thoughtful students to find
that they are not taken seriously.
Hypocrisy
The charge of hypocrisy, or phoniness, is
among the most frequent of charges leveled
at their elders by this generation of students
and there are numerous instances in which
it is justified. For example, one phony notion
is the one—widely held by many of us who
were in college 20-odd years ago—that while
one couldn't take liberties with "nice" girls,
it was okay to make out with a girl from the
wrong side of the tracks.

But the term gets pretty loosely bandied
about and gets incorrectly applied to areas
where real complexity is inherent, where no
easy answers are forthcoming, and where ad
mittedly uneasy and imperfect compromises
must exist if one is to have anytldng. It is
tempting to all of us, and perhaps even more
to youth, to be rid the the strain of living
with imperfection and complexity by some
clean, pure stroke of consistency, and once
in a blue moon someone brings it off. I just
hope no one needed to have both ends of the
rope connected when the Gordian Knot was
sliced.
Our present policy is termed hypocritical
and I believe I partly understand why, par
ticularly when I see a septic, illegal abortion
that might have been prevented.
But I find something equally hypocritical in
the petition about to be circulated. I cannot
believe that the petitioners are totally unaware
of many, if not all, the complexities and quite
probable reactions to the petition. I've no
doubt that sufficient signatures can be ob
tained and I've little doubt that LASSU would
pass the resolution. The way things are they
would almost have to.
Bi-Polar Power Politics
And once again an issue that deserves
truly considerate, open, and dispassionate dis
cussion at many levels by people who should
be trying primarily to understand one another
may be reduced to the level of bi polar power
politics, an atmosphere most surely oblitera
tive of any chance for openminded discussion.
The adoption of a resolution that deals so
summarily with a complicated and sensitive
issue seems to me likely to increase the polari
zation that so sadly afflicts student-adminis
tration exchange; to inflame reactions; and to
foster a defensive stance on the University's
part that would jeopardize the stated goals
of SSRF. I find this hypocritical.
Speaking purely personally, and not for
Stanford, I thing it might have been reason
able to explore (out of the Klieg-lights) the
possibility of extending our policy to include
unmarried students over 21, and students pre
senting validated parental consent. I could
make no decision, but might have explored its

possibility. Now I am not sure that the neces
sary atmosphere hasn't been polluted.
There is a real thirst for information and
discussion which the SSRF might have helped
to meet. With diplomacy, they might even
have involved administrators, trustees, alum
ni—and might have influenced them.
If they genuinely wish to see liberalization
and progress, they must somehow have the
patience, tact, and tolerance to promote and
foster real exchange and understanding. And
of course, "we" must remain open-minded and
receptive as well. I am open to argument and
persuasion, and think by no means that I (or
anyone) has all the answers.
f?Torig Tactics
But buttons, headlines, and bald petitions
do not constitute arguments, least of all con
structive or sensitive arguments. In terms of
gaining the stated objectives such tactics
seem like the use of a blunt instrument to per
form a delicate operation. I must admit (and
maybe this was the petitioners' aim!) that
the campaign has had the effect of getting
tnie off my duff and forcing me to think
harder about the subject than I have before.
I just hope that chances have not been jeopar
dized for serious thought and discussion at
many levels, for I don't believe for a minute
that the real problems of premarital sex will
go away, least of all if we refuse to discuss
them. But for Aphrodite's sake let's discuss
them, not just manipulate them, and realize
that it's hard to make love by legislation.
Anyone for the long hard exchange?

P.S. Since drafting the above, and before it
appeared, I have been scooped!—by a very
lucid and pertinent letter in Monday's Daily
by Deborah Hartel, which is precisely the kind
of thoughtful discussion we need, and by a de
lightful poem by Evan Just on the same day
("To a Campus Nymph") which makes me
feel very ponderous. Lest it appear that I am
swatting a gnat with a baseball bat, let me
simply add that my long statement is by no
means directed primarily at the SSRF, but at
the Stanford community at large.
