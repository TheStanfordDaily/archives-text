### HERBIE HINKS 
As an intrepid Daily reporter, I
knew my duty. I had to go the Alpha
Delts to get a rush story.
And to ogle at their topless hostess.
I walked up to the door and was
promptly told to go through and
leave by the back door. The Alpha
Delts suspected that I was an Alpha
Sig, their mortal enemies.
I forgave them for the insult,
showed them my student body card,
and was allowed to enter.
Ouch!
She was standing there, pinning on
name tags, her breasts hanging out of
her extremely low cut dress.
I, with my identity cleverly con
cealed as Herbie Hinks, viewed the
hostess. I learned that her name is
Holly, she worked at the Cameo Club
in Palo Alto for a while, but is now
working in The City.
Alpha Dclt rush chairman Les
Brown explained to me that she cost
only fifty dollars. Some of the host
esses told me that they were shocked
out of their minds. They also told me
they came from San Jose State.
What's Next?
So I had to have my name tag
pinned on eventually. I was standing
in line when I heard Holly tell the
rushoe in front of me, "Now you've
looked at my hair, my eyes, my dress,
and my watch. Isn't there anything
else you'd like to see?"

"Yes," said the rushoe, "I'd like to
see your naval."
We all viewed Holly's naval, then
she pinned my name tag on. It was a
bizarre experience, but then that's
what I came to The Farm for.
Off to The Teke's
From there I wandered up and down
the row, never turning down a glad
hand. Out of a sea of fixed smiles and
talk of majors, hometowns, and why
I wasn't a jock, I finally came to the
Teke house.
Unfortunately, for me, there is no
Teke house on this campus.
It turned out to be a collection of
eating clubs members, RFing the poor
freshmen. It's ar. annual thing with
them.
I stood around telling lies about my
self to the "Teke members" for about
a half hour with several other fresh
men before we were told it was all a
joke. I must admit, though, that the
hostesses for the Teke's, i.e. the girls
of Guthrie, where the open house was
held, were the finest I had seen all
â€¢night.
The Winner
The intrepid Daily reporter returned
to Wilbur, only to be regaled by fel
low freshmen with tales of how they
had been invited to parties, dinners,
and future open houses. I wasn't and
don't really expect to be.
But who cares?
I got a date with Holly for next
Saturday.
