# Hoover Sees Communists In Protests

### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)â€”The
latest group of demonstrations
against the war in Vietnam has
prompted J. Edgar Hoover, di
rector of the FBI, to issue one
of his occasional reports charg
ing that the current "insurrec
tionary climate" on American
campuses is serving the Moscow
cause.
Writing in his monthly letter
to U. S. law enforcement offi
cers, the FBI director said that
the college student today "is be
ing subjected to a bewildering
and dangerous conspiracy"
through "a feigned concern for
the vital rights of free speech,
dissent, and petition."
Hoover said the Communist
Party is "jubilant" over the de
velopments on the American
campus and is exploiting them
with a two-part movement: "a
much-publicized college speak
ing program and the campus
oriented Communist W.E.B. Du-
Bois Clubs."
He said on many campuses the
Communists are helping create
a "turbulence built on unre
strained individualism, repulsive
dress and speech, outright ob
scenity, disdain for moral and
spiritual values, and disrespect
for law and order."
