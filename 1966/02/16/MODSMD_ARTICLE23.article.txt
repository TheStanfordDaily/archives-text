Biz, and Law I.
Mr. Iliggins, the Director of

nament. Although there will not
be time to complete it this quar
ter, the finals will take place in
the spring.
With the Winter Quarter ra
pidly approachin gan end, the
living groups on campus prepare
to play the last games of the
regularly scheduled season be
fore the tournament begins on
February 28th. Out of the more
than fifteen leagues only the
top two teams in each league
will advance to the tournament.
Among the fraternities Sigma
Chi appears as one af the favor
ites on the basis of their fine
performances. Both the Chi I
and Ch. II teams are leading
their respective leagues with
perfect records. The Chis how
ever will have to get by a strong
Theta Xi team to stay unbeaten.
The Theta Xis have lost only
one, a tough game to the un
beaten ATOs. The Tau's also ap
pear as a strong tournament
hopeful.
Theat Delts Bc&fan
Last year's champions, Theta
Delta Chi, will have to beat a
once beaten Phi Kap squad to
be able to even defend their ti
tle. The Theta Delts lost a dis
puted overtime contest to the
Alpha Sigs. The Kappa Sigs will
be the other team in the tourna
ment from that league, as they
have already completed their
season with a 3-1 record.
The Delts have won their
league already, but the other
spot in the tournament is up
for grabs. The big game will be
the D.U.S.A.E. contest with the
winner advancing to the tourna
ment. Other fraternities which
can ot be overlooked are the
K.A.s and the Chi Psis.
Toro Strong
In the Eating Clubs the big
guns are all eating their meals
at Toro. The Bulls have a 3-0
record and appear a cinch to en
ter the tournament along with
Campo who is 3-1.
Among the Stern Houses, Fre
mont continues to keep up its
image by having swept through
an unbeaten season. Stern foot
ball champs Muir, along with
Larkin, are also undefeated.
Over in Wilbur Madera and
Otero are the leaders. Competi
tion with the Stern houses
though has lowered most of the
Wilbur teams records and will
thus keep them out of the tour
nament.
