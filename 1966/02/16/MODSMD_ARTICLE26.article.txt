# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						Conscientious Objector 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a com
mon misconception expressed by
Mr. Rahn in his letter in the
Feb. 9 Daily. Any man .who
claims to be a conscientious ob
jector and asks his draft board
for this classification is not try
ing to avoid the draft. If he is
classified as a CO, he is required
to perform 2 years of civilian al
ternative service "contributing
to the maintainence of the na
tional health, safety, or inter
est" during the same time that
he would normally have been in
the armed forces. A person who
seeks the CO classification does
not necessarily object to being
the draft by hiding or pretend
country, but he does object to
the type of service that is now
required and is asking for a
legal alternative.
There are also conscientious
objectors who do not feel that
this country should draft them
for any type of service. How
ever, if these people are truly
conscientious in their opposi
tion, they do not try to dodge
the draft by hiding of pretend
ing homosexuality, but instead
they go to the induction center
and openly confront, the system.
To do this usually means sev
eral years in federal prison,
which was the case for Mr. Paul
Salstrom who spoke on campus
February 10. I would hardly
call it "dodging" when a person
is willing to spend 2 years in
jail instead of going against his
conscience.
For any interested men, there
is literature and counseling
about conscientious objection
available on campus by contact
ing me at ext. 4600 or 32G-7469
or through the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.

• Tsola Rebutted
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Isola has suggested in his
letter to The Daily (Feb. 15)
that, while the majority of spon
sors serve the University com
munity well, there exist a "few
rabble-rousing fires" which, in
the experienced opinion of the
junior administrator, should be
"squelched." I can't believe that
Mr. Isola meant to imply that
the sponsor body is subject to
manipulation by a few dema
gogic individuals within it. In
the current controversy over the
method of sponsor selection the
sponsors have consistently
chosen the most moderate
among alternative courses of Ac
tion and have done so unani
mously.
Nor have any of the sponsors,
individually or as a group, dele
gated to themselves the author
ity to administrate Wilbur Hall.
On the contrary, as Mr. Isola
should know, sponsors are gen
erally very reluctant to act as
administrators. If we aspire to
any category, it would much
sooner be "educator" than "ad
ministrator." Furthermore, our
statement, "Sponsor Selection
and the Veto," which appeared
in The Daily on Feb. 7, should
make clear to all who can read
that we by no means intend to
usurp sole authority for the ad
ministration of Wilbur Hall.
Mr. Isola feels that the "func
tionability" of any greater sys
tem depends upon the degree of
cooperation obtaining between
the various sub-systems within.
This is true. It is also perhaps
true that any system which
hopes to be innovational must
not only acknowledge but also
welcome and provide for the in
evitable instances of conflict and
stress within the system. Clock
work is no model for the Uni
versity.
But cooperation has its value,
of course. So does consultation.
Consultation might not be suf
ficient, but it is often necessary
for cooperation. (The Wilbur
sponsors learned of the Admin
istration's plan for the selection
of their successors no less than
one month after it had been
agreed upon by Dean Wert and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, without prior
consultation of students, not to
mention sponsors,)
I can speak for the sponsors
in issuing an invitation to Mr.
Isola to atend our next sponsor
meeting. This would certainly
l>e one opportunity to further

the cause of cooperation. Be
sides, speaking for myself, I re
main confused by much of his
letter. Perhaps at that time Mr.
Isola might elaborate. on his
"purely personal" remarks con
cerning the sponsor system; or,
he might present the view of
the Administration on this Issue
—provided, of course, that the
two can be distinguished.

• Ravenswood Project
Editor, The Daily:
There are two members of
the community who are at this
time deserving of our acclaim
and support, of our deepest re
spect. With little public recog
nition, Dick Williams and Shel
don Shaeffer have worked tire
lessly to make the Ravenswood
tutoring project one of the
most successful and worthwhile
student efforts at Stanford.
Much credit must go, of course,
to Mrs. Pearce and the School
of Education, but without stu
dent support and participation
the program would have failed
long ago.
Few are acquainted with t}ie
hardships the leaders of this
program have encountered.
There was even a question last
fall of whether or not buses
would be available to carry stu
dents to Ravenswood. And the
overall problem of sustaining
the idealism within both tutor
and student has always been
present. But these obstacles
have been overcome.
Mr. Williams was recently
the sponsor of a successful bill
in the Legislature allotting one
thousand dollars for the pro
gram. In his report to LASSU,
Mr. Williams addressed himself
to a problem that is a critical
one for the program. While the
program has been successful, it
has reached only the most cap
able Ravenswood students. How
Is it to reach the despondent,
less motivated student who has
little interest in signing up for
a tutor? This will be the true
test of the work so well begun.
There is however, one slight
criticism I would make of Mr.
Williams report. It is a highly
detailed, documented piece, but
in its emphasis on the imple
mentation of the latest methods
of counseling and testing it
loses sight of the spirit that has
been so important within the
program: the spontaneity of all
involved, not only of the Stan
ford tutors, but most signifi
cant, of the Ravenswood stu
dents. This spirit has been the
key to the program, and those
who would replace it with the
latest innovations of modern re
search run the risk of strikng
the program a cruel blow.
But lest this criticism be
taken too deeply, the purpose
here is to accord two dedicated
individuals their due recogni
tion.

• Jiggers! The Cops!
Editor, The Daily:
I am delighted to see that the
Stanford Police Department
still leads the West in entrepre
neurial law enforcement. As of
Tuesday, the former Union Res
idence Parking Lot is a trap.
Only Union residents can park
there, and since there are no
longer any students living in
Union, one might assume that
former Union residents and oth
er girls living in Hoskins House
just might use that facility for
on-campus parking. As a matter
of fact, the parking lot has
been used for this purpose since
the beginning of the quarter.
However, the riot-pen squad has
put an end to what seems to me
a reasonable transfer of parking
privileges from Union residents
to Union alumnae and other
Hoskin residents.

I congratulate Breakers on
their decision to abolish rush. I
hope their good sense and moral
courage will spread to other eat

"discrimination" is a dirty word

• Peace Vs. Dow-J ones
Editor, The Daily:
I had to laugh when I heard
on the news that a "peace scare"
had sent the Dow-Jones indus
trial averages tumbling several
points. Presumably by the end
of the day the speculators on the
market had been assured that
the threat of peace did not exist
and that we would continue the
war. Optimism was restored and
prices rose. Relax, industrialists,
the war which has done so much
to stimulate the economy has
many fiscal years to go.

Editor, The Daily:
In response to "To a Campus
Nymph" in the February 14 is
sue of The Daily: I would like to
compliment Mr. Evan Just for
the subtleness of his poem. It is
precisely that sort of thing
which makes Europeans view
American adults as big, muscu
lar, very cean 10-year-olds, with
a knack for complicated gadget
ry and as much finesse as a buf
falo. I suggest that, in the fu
ture, Mr. Just reserve his medio
cre talents for versification for
his Friday night church social.

• No Help Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Hurrah for Mr. Robert Clark's
letter of February 11. I agree
that the omission of John Han
cock's name from the list of the
endorsers of the Walter Army
Society's letter was an outrage
which The Daily staff should be
reminded of again and again lest
they forget and (horrors!) let it
happen again sometime. As Mr.
Clark aptly demonstrates in his
letter, the Walter Army Society
can make a fool of itself quite
easily without the help of the
Daily staff.

ity to administrate Wilbur Hall.
On the contrary, as Mr. Isola
should know, sponsors are gen
erally very reluctant to act as
administrators. If we aspire to
any category, it would much
sooner be "educator" than "ad
ministrator." Furthermore, our
statement, "Sponsor Selection
and the Veto," which appeared
in The Daily on Feb. 7, should
make clear to all who can read
that we by no means intend to
usurp sole authority for the ad
ministration of Wilbur Hall.
Mr. Isola feels that the "func
tionability" of any greater sys
tem depends upon the degree of
cooperation obtaining between
the various sub-systems within.
This is true. It is also perhaps
true that any system which
hopes to be innovational must
not only acknowledge but also
welcome and provide for the in
evitable instances of conflict and
stress within the system. Clock
work is no model for the Uni
versity.
But cooperation has its value,
of course. So does consultation.
Consultation might not be suf
ficient, but it is often necessary
for cooperation. (The Wilbur
sponsors learned of the Admin
istration's plan for the selection
of their successors no less than
one month after it had been
agreed upon by Dean Wert and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, without prior
consultation of students, not to
mention sponsors,)
I can speak for the sponsors
in issuing an invitation to Mr.
Isola to atend our next sponsor
meeting. This would certainly
l>e one opportunity to further

the cause of cooperation. Be
sides, speaking for myself, I re
main confused by much of his
letter. Perhaps at that time Mr.
Isola might elaborate. on his
"purely personal" remarks con
cerning the sponsor system; or,
he might present the view of
the Administration on this Issue
—provided, of course, that the
two can be distinguished.

• Ravenswood Project
Editor, The Daily:
There are two members of
the community who are at this
time deserving of our acclaim
and support, of our deepest re
spect. With little public recog
nition, Dick Williams and Shel
don Shaeffer have worked tire
lessly to make the Ravenswood
tutoring project one of the
most successful and worthwhile
student efforts at Stanford.
Much credit must go, of course,
to Mrs. Pearce and the School
of Education, but without stu
dent support and participation
the program would have failed
long ago.
Few are acquainted with t}ie
hardships the leaders of this
program have encountered.
There was even a question last
fall of whether or not buses
would be available to carry stu
dents to Ravenswood. And the
overall problem of sustaining
the idealism within both tutor
and student has always been
present. But these obstacles
have been overcome.
Mr. Williams was recently
the sponsor of a successful bill
in the Legislature allotting one
thousand dollars for the pro
gram. In his report to LASSU,
Mr. Williams addressed himself
to a problem that is a critical
one for the program. While the
program has been successful, it
has reached only the most cap
able Ravenswood students. How
Is it to reach the despondent,
less motivated student who has
little interest in signing up for
a tutor? This will be the true
test of the work so well begun.
There is however, one slight
criticism I would make of Mr.
Williams report. It is a highly
detailed, documented piece, but
in its emphasis on the imple
mentation of the latest methods
of counseling and testing it
loses sight of the spirit that has
been so important within the
program: the spontaneity of all
involved, not only of the Stan
ford tutors, but most signifi
cant, of the Ravenswood stu
dents. This spirit has been the
key to the program, and those
who would replace it with the
latest innovations of modern re
search run the risk of strikng
the program a cruel blow.
But lest this criticism be
taken too deeply, the purpose
here is to accord two dedicated
individuals their due recogni
tion.

Editor, The Daily:
I am delighted to see that the
Stanford Police Department
still leads the West in entrepre
neurial law enforcement. As of
Tuesday, the former Union Res
idence Parking Lot is a trap.
Only Union residents can park
there, and since there are no
longer any students living in
Union, one might assume that
former Union residents and oth
er girls living in Hoskins House
just might use that facility for
on-campus parking. As a matter
of fact, the parking lot has
been used for this purpose since
the beginning of the quarter.
However, the riot-pen squad has
put an end to what seems to me
a reasonable transfer of parking
privileges from Union residents
to Union alumnae and other
Hoskin residents.

R. L. PAGE
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a com
mon misconception expressed by
Mr. Rahn in his letter in the
Feb. 9 Daily. Any man .who
claims to be a conscientious ob
jector and asks his draft board
for this classification is not try
ing to avoid the draft. If he is
classified as a CO, he is required
to perform 2 years of civilian al
ternative service "contributing
to the maintainence of the na
tional health, safety, or inter
est" during the same time that
he would normally have been in
the armed forces. A person who
seeks the CO classification does
not necessarily object to being
the draft by hiding or pretend
country, but he does object to
the type of service that is now
required and is asking for a
legal alternative.
There are also conscientious
objectors who do not feel that
this country should draft them
for any type of service. How
ever, if these people are truly
conscientious in their opposi
tion, they do not try to dodge
the draft by hiding of pretend
ing homosexuality, but instead
they go to the induction center
and openly confront, the system.
To do this usually means sev
eral years in federal prison,
which was the case for Mr. Paul
Salstrom who spoke on campus
February 10. I would hardly
call it "dodging" when a person
is willing to spend 2 years in
jail instead of going against his
conscience.
For any interested men, there
is literature and counseling
about conscientious objection
available on campus by contact
ing me at ext. 4600 or 32G-7469

Mr. Isola has suggested in his

that, while the majority of spon

There was even a question last
fall of whether or not buses
would be available to carry stu
dents to Ravenswood. And the
overall problem of sustaining
the idealism within both tutor
and student has always been
present. But these obstacles
have been overcome.
Mr. Williams was recently
the sponsor of a successful bill
in the Legislature allotting one
thousand dollars for the pro
gram. In his report to LASSU,
Mr. Williams addressed himself
to a problem that is a critical
one for the program. While the
program has been successful, it
has reached only the most cap
able Ravenswood students. How
Is it to reach the despondent,
less motivated student who has
little interest in signing up for
a tutor? This will be the true
test of the work so well begun.
There is however, one slight
criticism I would make of Mr.
Williams report. It is a highly
detailed, documented piece, but
in its emphasis on the imple
mentation of the latest methods
of counseling and testing it
loses sight of the spirit that has
been so important within the
program: the spontaneity of all
involved, not only of the Stan
ford tutors, but most signifi
cant, of the Ravenswood stu
dents. This spirit has been the
key to the program, and those
who would replace it with the
latest innovations of modern re
search run the risk of strikng
the program a cruel blow.
But lest this criticism be
taken too deeply, the purpose
here is to accord two dedicated
individuals their due recogni
tion.

Editor, The Daily:
I am delighted to see that the
Stanford Police Department
still leads the West in entrepre
neurial law enforcement. As of
Tuesday, the former Union Res
idence Parking Lot is a trap.
Only Union residents can park
there, and since there are no
longer any students living in
Union, one might assume that
former Union residents and oth
er girls living in Hoskins House
just might use that facility for
on-campus parking. As a matter
of fact, the parking lot has
been used for this purpose since
the beginning of the quarter.
However, the riot-pen squad has
put an end to what seems to me
a reasonable transfer of parking
privileges from Union residents
to Union alumnae and other
Hoskin residents.

the threat of peace did not exist

the war which has done so much

Hurrah for Mr. Robert Clark's
letter of February 11. I agree
that the omission of John Han
cock's name from the list of the
endorsers of the Walter Army

which The Daily staff should be
reminded of again and again lest
they forget and (horrors!) let it
happen again sometime. As Mr.
Clark aptly demonstrates in his

can make a fool of itself quite
easily without the help of the

R. L. PAGE
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a com
mon misconception expressed by
Mr. Rahn in his letter in the
Feb. 9 Daily. Any man .who
claims to be a conscientious ob
jector and asks his draft board
for this classification is not try
ing to avoid the draft. If he is
classified as a CO, he is required
to perform 2 years of civilian al
ternative service "contributing
to the maintainence of the na
tional health, safety, or inter
est" during the same time that
he would normally have been in
the armed forces. A person who
seeks the CO classification does
not necessarily object to being
the draft by hiding or pretend
country, but he does object to
the type of service that is now
required and is asking for a
legal alternative.
There are also conscientious
objectors who do not feel that
this country should draft them
for any type of service. How
ever, if these people are truly
conscientious in their opposi
tion, they do not try to dodge
the draft by hiding of pretend
ing homosexuality, but instead
they go to the induction center
and openly confront, the system.
To do this usually means sev
eral years in federal prison,
which was the case for Mr. Paul
Salstrom who spoke on campus
February 10. I would hardly
call it "dodging" when a person
is willing to spend 2 years in
jail instead of going against his
conscience.
For any interested men, there
is literature and counseling
about conscientious objection
available on campus by contact
ing me at ext. 4600 or 32G-7469
or through the Stanford Com

• Tsola Rebutted
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Isola has suggested in his
letter to The Daily (Feb. 15)
that, while the majority of spon
sors serve the University com
munity well, there exist a "few
rabble-rousing fires" which, in
the experienced opinion of the
junior administrator, should be
"squelched." I can't believe that
Mr. Isola meant to imply that
the sponsor body is subject to
manipulation by a few dema
gogic individuals within it. In
the current controversy over the
method of sponsor selection the
sponsors have consistently
chosen the most moderate
among alternative courses of Ac
tion and have done so unani
mously.
Nor have any of the sponsors,
individually or as a group, dele
gated to themselves the author
ity to administrate Wilbur Hall.
On the contrary, as Mr. Isola
should know, sponsors are gen
erally very reluctant to act as
administrators. If we aspire to
any category, it would much
sooner be "educator" than "ad
ministrator." Furthermore, our
statement, "Sponsor Selection
and the Veto," which appeared
in The Daily on Feb. 7, should
make clear to all who can read
that we by no means intend to
usurp sole authority for the ad
ministration of Wilbur Hall.
Mr. Isola feels that the "func
tionability" of any greater sys
tem depends upon the degree of
cooperation obtaining between
the various sub-systems within.
This is true. It is also perhaps
true that any system which
hopes to be innovational must
not only acknowledge but also
welcome and provide for the in
evitable instances of conflict and
stress within the system. Clock
work is no model for the Uni
versity.
But cooperation has its value,
of course. So does consultation.
Consultation might not be suf
ficient, but it is often necessary
for cooperation. (The Wilbur
sponsors learned of the Admin
istration's plan for the selection
of their successors no less than
one month after it had been
agreed upon by Dean Wert and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, without prior
consultation of students, not to
mention sponsors,)
I can speak for the sponsors
in issuing an invitation to Mr.
Isola to atend our next sponsor
meeting. This would certainly
l>e one opportunity to further

the cause of cooperation. Be
sides, speaking for myself, I re
main confused by much of his
letter. Perhaps at that time Mr.
Isola might elaborate. on his
"purely personal" remarks con
cerning the sponsor system; or,
he might present the view of
the Administration on this Issue
—provided, of course, that the
two can be distinguished.

Editor, The Daily:
I had to laugh when I heard
on the news that a "peace scare"
had sent the Dow-Jones indus
trial averages tumbling several
points. Presumably by the end
of the day the speculators on the
market had been assured that
the threat of peace did not exist
and that we would continue the

prices rose. Relax, industrialists,
the war which has done so much
to stimulate the economy has
many fiscal years to go.

Hurrah for Mr. Robert Clark's
letter of February 11. I agree
that the omission of John Han
cock's name from the list of the
endorsers of the Walter Army

which The Daily staff should be
reminded of again and again lest

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a com
mon misconception expressed by
Mr. Rahn in his letter in the
Feb. 9 Daily. Any man .who
claims to be a conscientious ob
jector and asks his draft board
for this classification is not try
ing to avoid the draft. If he is
classified as a CO, he is required
to perform 2 years of civilian al
ternative service "contributing
to the maintainence of the na
tional health, safety, or inter
est" during the same time that
he would normally have been in
the armed forces. A person who
seeks the CO classification does
not necessarily object to being
the draft by hiding or pretend
country, but he does object to
the type of service that is now
required and is asking for a
legal alternative.
There are also conscientious
objectors who do not feel that
this country should draft them
for any type of service. How
ever, if these people are truly
conscientious in their opposi
tion, they do not try to dodge
the draft by hiding of pretend
ing homosexuality, but instead
they go to the induction center
and openly confront, the system.
To do this usually means sev
eral years in federal prison,
which was the case for Mr. Paul
Salstrom who spoke on campus
February 10. I would hardly
call it "dodging" when a person
is willing to spend 2 years in
jail instead of going against his
conscience.
For any interested men, there
is literature and counseling
about conscientious objection
available on campus by contact

• Tsola Rebutted
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Isola has suggested in his
letter to The Daily (Feb. 15)
that, while the majority of spon
sors serve the University com
munity well, there exist a "few
rabble-rousing fires" which, in
the experienced opinion of the
junior administrator, should be
"squelched." I can't believe that
Mr. Isola meant to imply that
the sponsor body is subject to
manipulation by a few dema
gogic individuals within it. In
the current controversy over the
method of sponsor selection the
sponsors have consistently
chosen the most moderate
among alternative courses of Ac
tion and have done so unani
mously.
Nor have any of the sponsors,
individually or as a group, dele
gated to themselves the author
ity to administrate Wilbur Hall.
On the contrary, as Mr. Isola
should know, sponsors are gen
erally very reluctant to act as
administrators. If we aspire to
any category, it would much
sooner be "educator" than "ad
ministrator." Furthermore, our
statement, "Sponsor Selection
and the Veto," which appeared
in The Daily on Feb. 7, should
make clear to all who can read
that we by no means intend to
usurp sole authority for the ad
ministration of Wilbur Hall.
Mr. Isola feels that the "func
tionability" of any greater sys
tem depends upon the degree of
cooperation obtaining between
the various sub-systems within.
This is true. It is also perhaps
true that any system which
hopes to be innovational must
not only acknowledge but also
welcome and provide for the in
evitable instances of conflict and
stress within the system. Clock
work is no model for the Uni
versity.
But cooperation has its value,
of course. So does consultation.
Consultation might not be suf
ficient, but it is often necessary
for cooperation. (The Wilbur
sponsors learned of the Admin
istration's plan for the selection
of their successors no less than
one month after it had been
agreed upon by Dean Wert and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, without prior
consultation of students, not to
mention sponsors,)
I can speak for the sponsors
in issuing an invitation to Mr.
Isola to atend our next sponsor
meeting. This would certainly
l>e one opportunity to further

the cause of cooperation. Be
sides, speaking for myself, I re
main confused by much of his
letter. Perhaps at that time Mr.
Isola might elaborate. on his
"purely personal" remarks con
cerning the sponsor system; or,
he might present the view of
the Administration on this Issue
—provided, of course, that the
two can be distinguished.

• Ravenswood Project
Editor, The Daily:
There are two members of
the community who are at this
time deserving of our acclaim
and support, of our deepest re
spect. With little public recog
nition, Dick Williams and Shel
don Shaeffer have worked tire
lessly to make the Ravenswood
tutoring project one of the
most successful and worthwhile
student efforts at Stanford.
Much credit must go, of course,
to Mrs. Pearce and the School
of Education, but without stu
dent support and participation
the program would have failed
long ago.
Few are acquainted with t}ie
hardships the leaders of this
program have encountered.
There was even a question last
fall of whether or not buses
would be available to carry stu
dents to Ravenswood. And the
overall problem of sustaining
the idealism within both tutor
and student has always been
present. But these obstacles
have been overcome.
Mr. Williams was recently
the sponsor of a successful bill
in the Legislature allotting one
thousand dollars for the pro
gram. In his report to LASSU,
Mr. Williams addressed himself
to a problem that is a critical
one for the program. While the
program has been successful, it
has reached only the most cap
able Ravenswood students. How
Is it to reach the despondent,
less motivated student who has
little interest in signing up for
a tutor? This will be the true
test of the work so well begun.
There is however, one slight
criticism I would make of Mr.
Williams report. It is a highly
detailed, documented piece, but
in its emphasis on the imple
mentation of the latest methods
of counseling and testing it
loses sight of the spirit that has
been so important within the
program: the spontaneity of all
involved, not only of the Stan
ford tutors, but most signifi
cant, of the Ravenswood stu
dents. This spirit has been the
key to the program, and those
who would replace it with the
latest innovations of modern re
search run the risk of strikng
the program a cruel blow.
But lest this criticism be
taken too deeply, the purpose
here is to accord two dedicated
individuals their due recogni
tion.

Editor, The Daily:
I am delighted to see that the
Stanford Police Department
still leads the West in entrepre
neurial law enforcement. As of
Tuesday, the former Union Res
idence Parking Lot is a trap.
Only Union residents can park
there, and since there are no
longer any students living in
Union, one might assume that
former Union residents and oth
er girls living in Hoskins House
just might use that facility for
on-campus parking. As a matter
of fact, the parking lot has
been used for this purpose since
the beginning of the quarter.
However, the riot-pen squad has
put an end to what seems to me
a reasonable transfer of parking
privileges from Union residents
to Union alumnae and other
Hoskin residents.

seeks the CO classification does
not necessarily object to being
the draft by hiding or pretend
country, but he does object to
the type of service that is now
required and is asking for a
legal alternative.
There are also conscientious
objectors who do not feel that
this country should draft them
for any type of service. How
ever, if these people are truly
conscientious in their opposi
tion, they do not try to dodge
the draft by hiding of pretend
ing homosexuality, but instead
they go to the induction center
and openly confront, the system.
To do this usually means sev
eral years in federal prison,
which was the case for Mr. Paul
Salstrom who spoke on campus
February 10. I would hardly
call it "dodging" when a person
is willing to spend 2 years in
jail instead of going against his
conscience.
For any interested men, there
is literature and counseling
about conscientious objection
available on campus by contact
ing me at ext. 4600 or 32G-7469
or through the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.

• Tsola Rebutted
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Isola has suggested in his
letter to The Daily (Feb. 15)
that, while the majority of spon
sors serve the University com
munity well, there exist a "few
rabble-rousing fires" which, in
the experienced opinion of the
junior administrator, should be
"squelched." I can't believe that
Mr. Isola meant to imply that
the sponsor body is subject to
manipulation by a few dema
gogic individuals within it. In
the current controversy over the
method of sponsor selection the
sponsors have consistently
chosen the most moderate
among alternative courses of Ac
tion and have done so unani
mously.
Nor have any of the sponsors,
individually or as a group, dele
gated to themselves the author
ity to administrate Wilbur Hall.
On the contrary, as Mr. Isola
should know, sponsors are gen
erally very reluctant to act as
administrators. If we aspire to
any category, it would much
sooner be "educator" than "ad
ministrator." Furthermore, our
statement, "Sponsor Selection
and the Veto," which appeared
in The Daily on Feb. 7, should
make clear to all who can read
that we by no means intend to
usurp sole authority for the ad
ministration of Wilbur Hall.
Mr. Isola feels that the "func
tionability" of any greater sys
tem depends upon the degree of
cooperation obtaining between
the various sub-systems within.
This is true. It is also perhaps
true that any system which
hopes to be innovational must
not only acknowledge but also
welcome and provide for the in
evitable instances of conflict and
stress within the system. Clock
work is no model for the Uni
versity.
But cooperation has its value,
of course. So does consultation.
Consultation might not be suf
ficient, but it is often necessary
for cooperation. (The Wilbur
sponsors learned of the Admin
istration's plan for the selection
of their successors no less than
one month after it had been
agreed upon by Dean Wert and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education, without prior
consultation of students, not to
mention sponsors,)
I can speak for the sponsors
in issuing an invitation to Mr.
Isola to atend our next sponsor
meeting. This would certainly
l>e one opportunity to further

the cause of cooperation. Be
sides, speaking for myself, I re
main confused by much of his
letter. Perhaps at that time Mr.
Isola might elaborate. on his
"purely personal" remarks con
cerning the sponsor system; or,
he might present the view of
the Administration on this Issue
—provided, of course, that the
two can be distinguished.

• Ravenswood Project
Editor, The Daily:
There are two members of
the community who are at this
time deserving of our acclaim
and support, of our deepest re
spect. With little public recog
nition, Dick Williams and Shel
don Shaeffer have worked tire
lessly to make the Ravenswood
tutoring project one of the
most successful and worthwhile
student efforts at Stanford.
Much credit must go, of course,
to Mrs. Pearce and the School
of Education, but without stu
dent support and participation
the program would have failed
long ago.
Few are acquainted with t}ie
hardships the leaders of this
program have encountered.
There was even a question last
fall of whether or not buses
would be available to carry stu
dents to Ravenswood. And the
overall problem of sustaining
the idealism within both tutor
and student has always been
present. But these obstacles
have been overcome.
Mr. Williams was recently
the sponsor of a successful bill
in the Legislature allotting one
thousand dollars for the pro
gram. In his report to LASSU,
Mr. Williams addressed himself
to a problem that is a critical
one for the program. While the
program has been successful, it
has reached only the most cap
able Ravenswood students. How
Is it to reach the despondent,
less motivated student who has
little interest in signing up for
a tutor? This will be the true
test of the work so well begun.
There is however, one slight
criticism I would make of Mr.
Williams report. It is a highly
detailed, documented piece, but
in its emphasis on the imple
mentation of the latest methods
of counseling and testing it
loses sight of the spirit that has
been so important within the
program: the spontaneity of all
involved, not only of the Stan
ford tutors, but most signifi
cant, of the Ravenswood stu
dents. This spirit has been the
key to the program, and those
who would replace it with the
latest innovations of modern re
search run the risk of strikng
the program a cruel blow.
But lest this criticism be
taken too deeply, the purpose
here is to accord two dedicated
individuals their due recogni
tion.

• Jiggers! The Cops!
Editor, The Daily:
I am delighted to see that the
Stanford Police Department
still leads the West in entrepre
neurial law enforcement. As of
Tuesday, the former Union Res
idence Parking Lot is a trap.
Only Union residents can park
there, and since there are no
longer any students living in
Union, one might assume that
former Union residents and oth
er girls living in Hoskins House
just might use that facility for
on-campus parking. As a matter
of fact, the parking lot has
been used for this purpose since
the beginning of the quarter.
However, the riot-pen squad has
put an end to what seems to me
a reasonable transfer of parking
privileges from Union residents
to Union alumnae and other
Hoskin residents.

• Peace Vs. Dow-J ones
Editor, The Daily:
I had to laugh when I heard
on the news that a "peace scare"
had sent the Dow-Jones indus
trial averages tumbling several
points. Presumably by the end
of the day the speculators on the
market had been assured that
the threat of peace did not exist
and that we would continue the
war. Optimism was restored and
prices rose. Relax, industrialists,
the war which has done so much
to stimulate the economy has
many fiscal years to go.

Editor, The Daily:
In response to "To a Campus
Nymph" in the February 14 is
sue of The Daily: I would like to
compliment Mr. Evan Just for
the subtleness of his poem. It is
precisely that sort of thing
which makes Europeans view
American adults as big, muscu
lar, very cean 10-year-olds, with
a knack for complicated gadget
ry and as much finesse as a buf
falo. I suggest that, in the fu
ture, Mr. Just reserve his medio
cre talents for versification for

• No Help Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Hurrah for Mr. Robert Clark's
letter of February 11. I agree
that the omission of John Han
cock's name from the list of the
endorsers of the Walter Army
Society's letter was an outrage
which The Daily staff should be
reminded of again and again lest
they forget and (horrors!) let it
happen again sometime. As Mr.
Clark aptly demonstrates in his
letter, the Walter Army Society
can make a fool of itself quite
easily without the help of the
Daily staff.
R. L. PAGE
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a com
mon misconception expressed by
Mr. Rahn in his letter in the
Feb. 9 Daily. Any man .who
claims to be a conscientious ob
jector and asks his draft board
for this classification is not try
ing to avoid the draft. If he is
classified as a CO, he is required
to perform 2 years of civilian al
ternative service "contributing
to the maintainence of the na
tional health, safety, or inter
est" during the same time that
he would normally have been in
the armed forces. A person who
seeks the CO classification does
not necessarily object to being
the draft by hiding or pretend
country, but he does object to
the type of service that is now
required and is asking for a
legal alternative.
There are also conscientious
objectors who do not feel that

for any type of service. How
