# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Up Out Of The Sand Box And All Over 'The Daily' 
### Tim Haight 
Before "shaping up or getting
out," one member of the Legis
lature would like to explain
some criticisms of the Commit
tee of Fifteen and its student
representatives.
First, one of the "student"
representatives on the commit
tee is no longer a student. Gary
Feldman, to mention names.
Second, the negotiations of
the Committee are confidential.
Neither LASSU nor the student
body can know anything about
what goes on there until its all
over. Then the Union girls or
who-have-you can only feel con
fused or sold out. They certain
ly are not and were not given
detailed statements of exactly
what happened.
Astounding-
Third, for the amount of im
portant business going on in
that Committee, the fact that
only five students are involved
is astounding. So far Social
Regs, Union Residence, judicial
reform, The Daily, and sponsor
selection have been discussed.
We can expect that liquor, open
house or any other important
issue will also come there for
negotiation.
In many cases there is so
much business that the Com
mittee can't handle it all. So
they appoint subcommittees.
But only the members of the
original committee may serve.
Instead of opening the way
for more students to go
"through the cathartic experi
ence of sitting down and reason
ing with representatives of the
faculty and administration," the
Committee has only granted ac
cess to five students. And people
talk of the Legislature being un
representative?
Fourth, while Mr. Roise in his
editorial seems to think it more
logical that the ASSU President
or the student body as a whole
should choose the student repre

sentatives, some people don't.
LASSU is the only body that
can send any student-initiated
business to the Committee. It
must also approve the final de
cisions, along with the Univers
ity President and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.
One Man, No Vote
But even if this weren't so,
would it be more representative
to have one man, the Student
Body President, appoint such
important delegates? As for
having general elections, the
farce that the off-campus
LASSU representative elections
have become gives the lie to
that idea. Last election, the re
sults coincided with the highest
names on the ballot. People just
checked names until they ran
out of votes. The voter turnout
was 10 per cent.
Fifth, the founding agreement
did make mention of who should
appoint the student representi
tives. I refer Mr. Roise to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965, which set up
the Committee. It said, "A mech
anism should be established
through which duly appointed
representatives of the President
of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature
meet to discuss University prob
lems and policies . . . . " (Sec
tion sa, boldfacing mine).
Five Students
Finally, we might ask if the
student body is going to channel
all discussion on important
issues to five students, with no
control over them, no informa
tion about what's going on, and
no guarantee that the members
are even students.
Or are we going to provide for
some way we can be heard, as
individuals who care about what
happens to us? Each living
group has a LASSU representa
tive; talk to him.

We can expect that liquor, open
house or any other important
issue will also come there for
negotiation.
In many cases there is so
much business that the Com
mittee can't handle it all. So
they appoint subcommittees.
But only the members of the
original committee may serve.
Instead of opening the way
for more students to go
"through the cathartic experi
ence of sitting down and reason
ing with representatives of the
faculty and administration," the
Committee has only granted ac
cess to five students. And people
talk of the Legislature being un
representative?
Fourth, while Mr. Roise in his
editorial seems to think it more
logical that the ASSU President
or the student body as a whole
should choose the student repre

sentatives, some people don't.
LASSU is the only body that
can send any student-initiated
business to the Committee. It
must also approve the final de
cisions, along with the Univers
ity President and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.
One Man, No Vote
But even if this weren't so,
would it be more representative
to have one man, the Student
Body President, appoint such
important delegates? As for
having general elections, the
farce that the off-campus
LASSU representative elections
have become gives the lie to
that idea. Last election, the re
sults coincided with the highest
names on the ballot. People just
checked names until they ran
out of votes. The voter turnout
was 10 per cent.
Fifth, the founding agreement
did make mention of who should
appoint the student representi
tives. I refer Mr. Roise to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965, which set up
the Committee. It said, "A mech
anism should be established
through which duly appointed
representatives of the President
of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature
meet to discuss University prob
lems and policies . . . . " (Sec
tion sa, boldfacing mine).
Five Students
Finally, we might ask if the
student body is going to channel
all discussion on important
issues to five students, with no
control over them, no informa
tion about what's going on, and
no guarantee that the members
are even students.
Or are we going to provide for
some way we can be heard, as
individuals who care about what
happens to us? Each living
group has a LASSU representa
tive; talk to him.
Before "shaping up or getting
out," one member of the Legis
lature would like to explain
some criticisms of the Commit
tee of Fifteen and its student
representatives.
First, one of the "student"
representatives on the commit
tee is no longer a student. Gary
Feldman, to mention names.
Second, the negotiations of
the Committee are confidential.
Neither LASSU nor the student
body can know anything about
what goes on there until its all
over. Then the Union girls or
who-have-you can only feel con
fused or sold out. They certain
ly are not and were not given
detailed statements of exactly
what happened.
Astounding-
Third, for the amount of im
portant business going on in
that Committee, the fact that
only five students are involved
is astounding. So far Social
Regs, Union Residence, judicial
reform, The Daily, and sponsor
selection have been discussed.
