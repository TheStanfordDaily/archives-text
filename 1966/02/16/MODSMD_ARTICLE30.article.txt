						Conscientious Objector Reflects On 'The System'

(Editor's note: The author of
this column, who was graduated
from Stanford last year and who
was Head Sponsor of Wilbur
Hall in 1964-65, is himself a con
scientious objector. The column
is written in the advent of a
visit to Stanford next Sunday by
Arlo Tatum, executive secretary
of the Central Committee for
Conscientious Objectors.)

"I am by reason of my reli
gious training and belief consci
entiously opposed to participa
tion in war in any form and I
am further conscientiously op
posed to participation in non
combatant training and service
in the Armed Forces. I, there
fore, claim exemption from both
combatant and noncombatant
training and service in the
Armed Forces."
—Page 1, Selective Service
Form 150 for Conscientious Ob
jectors.
A common misunderstanding
of the conscicntious objector's
position is a failure to distin
guish between the personal use
of violence and the socially or
ganized use of violence.
A conscientious objector does
not claim he will never lose his
temper or get in a fight, or use
force in self-defense. He does
claim he will never willingly par
ticipate in the socially organized
use of violence.
I think most C.O.'s would also
distinguish between the discrimi
nate and limited use of force by
police where the force is used
with the intent to rehabilitate
the suspect and the rather in
discriminate and less limited Use
of force by an army where the
force is more often used with
the intent of annihilating the
"enemy."
Religious Grounds
One thing that is clear in most
people's minds is that when Con
gress passed the Selective Ser
vice Act, it made the provision
for conscientious objection out
of considerations for religious
liberty, and it is only on reli
gious grounds that one can re
quest a l-O or 1-AO (the two
classifications for C.O.'s).
Until recently the draft boards
and courts tended to think of
religion in terms of church at
tendance and belief in a supreme
being.
Now, however, the courts have
held that religious teaching can
come merely from life experi
ence; and last year the Supreme
Court decided that if the appli
cant's life was guided by gen
eral. principles which played a
role in his life parallel to the
role belief in a supreme being
played in the life of someone
who obviously qualified, then
the applicant also qualified.
Unjust Wars
What about the person who
refuses to fight only in unjust
wars? The inadequacy of the
present Selective Service law on
this point was recently outlined
in a KFRC editorial by Ben Sea
ver, the Peace Secretary of the
American Friends Service Com
mittee in San Francisco:
"Our government argues that,
no one has a constitutional right
to exemption from military ser
vice," he said, "but in order not
to interfere with religious liber
ty exemptions for religious ob
jectors to all wars are permitted.
"But objections to all wars is
the pacifist position, a minority
Christian position since Emper
or Constantino in the fourth cen
tury made Christianity the state

religion of the Roman Empire,
whereas the idea that a good
Christian could only fight in a
just war has been the majority
position for at least the last
seven hundred years.
"If the government wants to
honor religious liberty shouldn't
it recognize the majority posi
tion of those who object to un
just war as well as the minority
pacifist position?"
Questions
To those who feel they will
fight only in a "just" war I
would ask several questions.
What are the criteria on which
one judges whether a war is just
or unjust? Who judges — a
church official, a chief of staff,
a political representative, or
each individual? (I doubt an
army can allow each soldier to
question the orders of those who
make the decisions.) If the Viet
nam war is an unjust war are
those who fight against us wag
ing a just war?
The key question, though, in
bringing out the difference be
tween a conscientious objector's
stand and an I'll-pick-my-o w n
wars stand, is: How, in terms of
what one objects to in war, is
this Vietnam war different from
any other war?
No Basic Difference
The C.O. would say there is
no basic difference. Men, wom
en, and children are killed,
maimed, displaced and general
ly mistreated in all wars. As Ca
mus pointed out in 19-16 in his
essay "Neither Victims Nor Exe
cutioners," the key question ev
ery man must face is whether
he will legitimize murder.
A professor of mine once said:
"I myself believe this is the
mark of a religious man: the
full-hearted and consistent ac
ceptance of those ethical princi
ples which moral thinkers
throughout the ages have called
God because they represent a
fulfillment of what is thought
to be man's nature."
What Camus suggests we all
do is consider a basic question
about man's nature.
