# Notes and Observations
## Why Liberal Orthodoxy Reigns 
### John E. Bonine 
The controversy over academ
ic balance in the past few weeks
has not driven to deep enough
levels the questioning of why
there is no representation of dis
senting views in several academ
ic departments at Stanford.
Dr. Robert MacAfee Brown
best defined the problem of or
thodoxy versus diversity in his
letter to The Daily on Jan. 13:
The basic issue, of course,
is that the presentation of con
flicting views is the very life
blood of a university, and that
the moment one subscribes to
the notion that all should think
alike, he has ceased to think
about a university and has
started thinking' about a
propaganda mill.
This one-sidedness contra
venes the oft-heard arguments
for a "free marketplace of ideas"
—the creation of conditions in
which truth emerges from the
free interplay of diverse view
points.
Tiiinking Alike
Due to the absence of con
servative professors, and the ab
sence of conservative books on
the reading lists, students are
denied the option of considering
respectable intellectual alterna
tives, and they end up thinking
largely alike. This is what con
servatives deplore in the make
up of social science departments
at Stanford as well as elsewhere,
It is largely the reason that the
university years thin the ranks

of conservatism and swell those
of liberalism.
To say this, however, is not
to say that it is necessarily done
with nefarious motives. A Uni
versity of Denver professor in
formed me in December that
"To be educated is t6 be a lib
eral." The arrogance of this at
titude is matched only by its
frankness.
A well-known professor of po
litical science at Stanford has
expressed his surprise that some
of his "A" students could hold
conservative views. The logic of
this position leads to the opin
ion that a conservative is, by
definition, not wholly educated.
If persons holding this view
then proceed on the assumption
that they can hire further facul
ty members solely on the basis
of their academic qualifications,
they end up with nothing but lib
erals.
If this seems too bold a way
to express the situation, con
sider the normal reaction of a
person confronted with a per
son or viewpoint with whom he
disagrees; he feels that the ad
versary has not read the "prop
er" sources or has not under
stood them.
In like manner, the liberal
does not select conservative
books for his reading list be
cause he feels they are "incor
rect," "confused," or "shallow,"
although in reality they may be
equally as scholarly as the oth
er materials in his course.
At the very least, then, a con

servative professor has to be
more rigorously schooled, better
qualified, or simply more reti
cent about his views in order
to obtain and hold a position
over a liberal candidate. Con
servative reading material must
be at the very peak of excel
lence in order to find its way
onto a syllabus—and even that
is usually "not enough. Liberal
books may get by despite medio
crity.
Liberalism Reigns
In sum, liberalism reigns be
cause liberals think themselves
right, and they think that con
servatives cannot compete with
them on an intellectual plane.
And as liberal courses beget new
liberals. The situation gets worse.
Columnist Art Fisher ques
tions whether there are many
conservative professors availa
ble. The answer is that there is
more abundance than most peo
ple think. Even more impres
sive, though, is the abundance
of non-liberal books. In the past
15 years, conservatives have
taken upon themselves the task
of creating a body of sound
works in every area of social sci
ence.
If a department might protest
that it would like to hire con
servatives, but cannot find
them, what is its excuse for not
making use of the vast resource
of books which dissent from the
prevailing orthodoxy? There is
no question about their availa
bility.
The liberal hegemony does

much to hamper free discussion
and the spirit of scholarly in
quiry which looks at all sides
of an issue before deciding one's
position. Ideally, some sort of
balance would be desirable, but
it would be a breakthrough if
even grudging concessions were
made to conservative views in
various areas.
For Example
If, for example, the R o us h
economics chair in a free enter
prise economy were to be filled
by a competent conservative
economist; if someone like Will
moore Kendall were brought
back to teach courses in political
theory; if the uniformly-liberal
Western Civ instructors would
include a wider range of view
points in their syllabi; if read
ing lists in economics, political
science, and sociology were to
include conservative books as
a regular, not an exceptional
matter.
Then at least a few students
would be encouraged to ask
searching questions which are
rarely asked now. They would
really be forced to rethink their
convictions — their new, intel
lectually-faddish liberal ones as
well as their homegrown con
servative ones.
A new spirit of tolerance and
respect for conservative dissent
ers from the orthodoxy would
arise, and liberals might be
forced to ground their own phi
losophy on something more than
being the"camp" thing to be
lleve.

Dr. Robert MacAfee Brown
best defined the problem of or
thodoxy versus diversity in his
letter to The Daily on Jan. 13:
The basic issue, of course,
is that the presentation of con
flicting views is the very life
blood of a university, and that
the moment one subscribes to
the notion that all should think
alike, he has ceased to think
about a university and has
started thinking' about a
propaganda mill.
This one-sidedness contra
venes the oft-heard arguments
for a "free marketplace of ideas"
—the creation of conditions in
which truth emerges from the
free interplay of diverse view
points.
Tiiinking Alike
Due to the absence of con
servative professors, and the ab
sence of conservative books on
the reading lists, students are
denied the option of considering
respectable intellectual alterna
tives, and they end up thinking
largely alike. This is what con
servatives deplore in the make
up of social science departments
at Stanford as well as elsewhere,
It is largely the reason that the
university years thin the ranks

of conservatism and swell those
of liberalism.
To say this, however, is not
to say that it is necessarily done
with nefarious motives. A Uni
versity of Denver professor in
formed me in December that
"To be educated is t6 be a lib
eral." The arrogance of this at
titude is matched only by its
frankness.
A well-known professor of po
litical science at Stanford has
expressed his surprise that some
of his "A" students could hold
conservative views. The logic of
this position leads to the opin
ion that a conservative is, by
definition, not wholly educated.
If persons holding this view
then proceed on the assumption
that they can hire further facul
ty members solely on the basis
of their academic qualifications,
they end up with nothing but lib
erals.
If this seems too bold a way
to express the situation, con
sider the normal reaction of a
person confronted with a per
son or viewpoint with whom he
disagrees; he feels that the ad
versary has not read the "prop
er" sources or has not under
stood them.
In like manner, the liberal
does not select conservative
books for his reading list be
cause he feels they are "incor
rect," "confused," or "shallow,"
although in reality they may be
equally as scholarly as the oth
er materials in his course.
At the very least, then, a con

servative professor has to be
more rigorously schooled, better
qualified, or simply more reti
cent about his views in order
to obtain and hold a position
over a liberal candidate. Con
servative reading material must
be at the very peak of excel
lence in order to find its way
onto a syllabus—and even that
is usually "not enough. Liberal
books may get by despite medio
crity.
Liberalism Reigns
In sum, liberalism reigns be
cause liberals think themselves
right, and they think that con
servatives cannot compete with
them on an intellectual plane.
And as liberal courses beget new
liberals. The situation gets worse.
Columnist Art Fisher ques
tions whether there are many
conservative professors availa
ble. The answer is that there is
more abundance than most peo
ple think. Even more impres
sive, though, is the abundance
of non-liberal books. In the past
15 years, conservatives have
taken upon themselves the task
of creating a body of sound
works in every area of social sci
ence.
If a department might protest
that it would like to hire con
servatives, but cannot find
them, what is its excuse for not
making use of the vast resource
of books which dissent from the
prevailing orthodoxy? There is
no question about their availa
bility.
The liberal hegemony does

much to hamper free discussion
and the spirit of scholarly in
quiry which looks at all sides
of an issue before deciding one's
position. Ideally, some sort of
balance would be desirable, but
it would be a breakthrough if
even grudging concessions were
made to conservative views in
various areas.
For Example
If, for example, the R o us h
economics chair in a free enter
prise economy were to be filled
by a competent conservative
economist; if someone like Will
moore Kendall were brought
back to teach courses in political
theory; if the uniformly-liberal
Western Civ instructors would
include a wider range of view
points in their syllabi; if read
ing lists in economics, political
science, and sociology were to
include conservative books as
a regular, not an exceptional
matter.
Then at least a few students
would be encouraged to ask
searching questions which are
rarely asked now. They would
really be forced to rethink their
convictions — their new, intel
lectually-faddish liberal ones as
well as their homegrown con
servative ones.

Then at least a few students
would be encouraged to ask

servative ones.

The controversy over academ
ic balance in the past few weeks
has not driven to deep enough
levels the questioning of why
there is no representation of dis
senting views in several academ
ic departments at Stanford.
Dr. Robert MacAfee Brown
best defined the problem of or
thodoxy versus diversity in his
letter to The Daily on Jan. 13:
The basic issue, of course,
is that the presentation of con
flicting views is the very life
blood of a university, and that
the moment one subscribes to
the notion that all should think
alike, he has ceased to think
about a university and has
started thinking' about a
propaganda mill.
This one-sidedness contra
venes the oft-heard arguments
for a "free marketplace of ideas"
—the creation of conditions in
which truth emerges from the
free interplay of diverse view
points.
Tiiinking Alike
Due to the absence of con
servative professors, and the ab
sence of conservative books on
the reading lists, students are
denied the option of considering
respectable intellectual alterna
tives, and they end up thinking
largely alike. This is what con
servatives deplore in the make
up of social science departments
at Stanford as well as elsewhere,
It is largely the reason that the
university years thin the ranks

of conservatism and swell those
of liberalism.
To say this, however, is not
to say that it is necessarily done
with nefarious motives. A Uni
versity of Denver professor in
formed me in December that
"To be educated is t6 be a lib
eral." The arrogance of this at
titude is matched only by its
frankness.
A well-known professor of po
litical science at Stanford has
expressed his surprise that some
of his "A" students could hold
conservative views. The logic of
this position leads to the opin
ion that a conservative is, by
definition, not wholly educated.
If persons holding this view
then proceed on the assumption
that they can hire further facul
ty members solely on the basis
of their academic qualifications,
they end up with nothing but lib
erals.
If this seems too bold a way
to express the situation, con
sider the normal reaction of a
person confronted with a per
son or viewpoint with whom he
disagrees; he feels that the ad
versary has not read the "prop
er" sources or has not under
stood them.
In like manner, the liberal
does not select conservative
books for his reading list be
cause he feels they are "incor
rect," "confused," or "shallow,"
although in reality they may be
equally as scholarly as the oth
er materials in his course.
At the very least, then, a con

servative professor has to be
more rigorously schooled, better
qualified, or simply more reti
cent about his views in order
to obtain and hold a position
over a liberal candidate. Con
servative reading material must
be at the very peak of excel
lence in order to find its way
onto a syllabus—and even that
is usually "not enough. Liberal
books may get by despite medio
crity.
Liberalism Reigns
In sum, liberalism reigns be
cause liberals think themselves
right, and they think that con
servatives cannot compete with
them on an intellectual plane.
And as liberal courses beget new
liberals. The situation gets worse.
Columnist Art Fisher ques
tions whether there are many
conservative professors availa
ble. The answer is that there is
more abundance than most peo
ple think. Even more impres
sive, though, is the abundance
of non-liberal books. In the past
15 years, conservatives have
taken upon themselves the task
of creating a body of sound
works in every area of social sci
ence.
If a department might protest
that it would like to hire con
servatives, but cannot find
them, what is its excuse for not
making use of the vast resource
of books which dissent from the
prevailing orthodoxy? There is
no question about their availa
bility.
The liberal hegemony does

much to hamper free discussion
and the spirit of scholarly in
quiry which looks at all sides
of an issue before deciding one's
position. Ideally, some sort of
balance would be desirable, but
it would be a breakthrough if
even grudging concessions were
made to conservative views in
various areas.
For Example
If, for example, the R o us h
economics chair in a free enter
prise economy were to be filled
by a competent conservative
economist; if someone like Will
moore Kendall were brought
back to teach courses in political
theory; if the uniformly-liberal
Western Civ instructors would
include a wider range of view
points in their syllabi; if read
ing lists in economics, political
science, and sociology were to
include conservative books as
a regular, not an exceptional
matter.
