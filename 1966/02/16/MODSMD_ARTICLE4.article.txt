# IIR Book Drive To Aid Schools In Africa, Asia
## 
### 
Institute of International Relations'
Overseas Books Project (OBP) today
launches a three-day campaign to col
lect books and magazines.
Boxes for depositing books and
magazines have been placed in the liv
ing groups and tables are located on
campus in front of the Bookstore, the
library, and Tresidder.
The project was set up to help sup
ply schools and libraries in Asia and
Africa with desperately needed educa
tional materials. A catalogue of avail
able books and magazines is sent to
those affiliating with the project and
the items they order are then sup
plied. In this way mass shipments of
unwanted books is avoided.
The Magazines People-to-People pro
gram, an adjunct of the Overseas
Book Project, gets people to send
their old magazines to specific indi
viduals in Asia. "This is an important
way to show what America is really
like, and helps offset communist
propaganda," Pat Jackson, director of
the project, pointed out. The cost is
less than 40 cents a month. Applica
tion forms are available in the dorms
and at the tables.
The seven students on the staff
have been sorting and cataloguing
the 9000 hooks and magazines they
have already obtained. Informational
letters have been sent to over 30
schools in Africa and Asia, and an
"eager" reply has already been re
ceived from Thailand. The first cata
logue will go out this quarter.
Many people and organizations have
helped the project including D H.
Winbigler, Dean of Students; the Palo
Alto J.C.'s; the Stanford Library; and
the Hoover Institute.
