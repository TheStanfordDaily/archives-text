# "The Green Beret..."
## Dekes Get VN Thank-you 
### 
Delta Kappa Epsilon has received
a letter from American Special Forces
in Vietnam thanking Stanford stu
dents for the 6,000 books that were
sent to Southeast Asia as a result of
the DKE Christmas Book Drive.
Captain Bob Nielson wrote to thank
all those involved for "your generosity
and thoughtfulness It is appreciated."

After receiving some of the books
by helicopter, Nielson found the DKE
address and thought that all those
who donated the books would be in
terested to know where they ended up.
Nielson is at Vinh Gia, in the Me
kong River Delta. He explained the
Special Forces role as "one of sur
veilance, as we are only 1,500 meters

from Cambodia. The role we play is
that of an advisor.
"Our only real problem here is lo
gistics. We receive the vast majority
of our supplies by boat—this is in
convenient," Nielson wrote.

Commenting on the letter, Kirk Mc-
Allister of the Dekes said the drive
had probably faded from the mind of
its contributors. "But for the Ameri
cans in Vietnam, life is the same from
one hot, humid day to the next. They
do not have the option to choose a
new cause if frustrated at their pres
ent job.
"There is no way of knowing how
many hamlets, like Nielson's, received
the 6000 books collected in the Deke
drive. Most would' agree that the
drive was worthwhile if it served only
to break the monotony at Vmh Gia,"
McAllister asserted.
"Again thank you for the books. I
sincerely hope you all have a good
school year, lots of dates and good
grades. You have my best wishes al
ways," were Nielson's closing re
marks.
