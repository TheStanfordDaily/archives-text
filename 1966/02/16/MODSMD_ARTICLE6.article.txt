# Committee Of Fifteen To Review Sponsors
## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen will
probably consider the Wilbur sponsor
selection controversy when it meets
on Friday, according to committee
chairman Philip Rhinelander.
Rhinelander, Professor of Philoso
phy, said that "the committee has
been following this situation very
closely, and it is my expectation that
it will come up at our next meeting."
Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert J. Wert requested that Presi
dent Sterling ask the Committee of
Fifteen to consider sponsor selection
after his Committee on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) and the Wilbur
sponsors were unable, after a long
period of controversy, to come to any
agreement concerning the selection of
next year's sponsors.
Rhinelander says that the commit
tee may want to form a subcommittee
to study the problem or discuss it
now before the entire committee, but
that its first job will be "to see what
the facts are."
No Agreement
In a resolution last Friday, CUE re
tained the final decision on Wilbur
sponsors. This resolution was CUE's
last statement on the controversy, ac
cording to Wert.

While this resolution was being con
sidered, Faculty Master Eric Hutchin
son and Head Sponsor A 1 Taylor
agreed upon a compromise plan Un
der which any differences in opinion
between the selection committee and
Dr. Hutchinson would be acted upon
by a five man student-faculty appeals
committee.
Hutchinson and the sponsors both
agree to accept and support the settle
ment of the arbitration board. Hutch
inson says that CUE will have to pass
on the final choices. The sponsors,
however, feel that any decision which
has the support of the Faculty Mas
ter and the representative support of
the sponsors, the faculty residents,
and the freshmen should not need to
be approved by CUE.
Dean Wert has had no comment on
this, since CUE has made its final
resolution and handed the matter over
to the Committee of Fifteen.
Committee of Fi ft e<u
The Committee of Fifteen is com
posed of five students, five faculty
members, and five administrators. "It
is a very peculiar committee," accord
ing to Rhinelander, "it has no powers
other than to advise."
"Our job is not to do the work of
other committees already established,
but to provide a forum for discussion
when differences occur and generally
to encourage people to consult with
other interested parties before they
act and not afterwards."

agreed upon a compromise plan Un
der which any differences in opinion
between the selection committee and
Dr. Hutchinson would be acted upon
by a five man student-faculty appeals
committee.
Hutchinson and the sponsors both
agree to accept and support the settle
ment of the arbitration board. Hutch
inson says that CUE will have to pass
on the final choices. The sponsors,
however, feel that any decision which
has the support of the Faculty Mas
ter and the representative support of
the sponsors, the faculty residents,
and the freshmen should not need to
be approved by CUE.
Dean Wert has had no comment on
this, since CUE has made its final
resolution and handed the matter over
to the Committee of Fifteen.
Committee of Fi ft e<u
The Committee of Fifteen is com
posed of five students, five faculty
members, and five administrators. "It
is a very peculiar committee," accord
ing to Rhinelander, "it has no powers
other than to advise."
"Our job is not to do the work of
other committees already established,
but to provide a forum for discussion
when differences occur and generally
to encourage people to consult with
other interested parties before they
act and not afterwards."
The Committee of Fifteen will
probably consider the Wilbur sponsor
selection controversy when it meets
on Friday, according to committee
chairman Philip Rhinelander.
Rhinelander, Professor of Philoso
phy, said that "the committee has
been following this situation very
closely, and it is my expectation that
it will come up at our next meeting."
Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert J. Wert requested that Presi
dent Sterling ask the Committee of
Fifteen to consider sponsor selection
after his Committee on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) and the Wilbur
sponsors were unable, after a long
period of controversy, to come to any
agreement concerning the selection of
next year's sponsors.
Rhinelander says that the commit
tee may want to form a subcommittee
to study the problem or discuss it
now before the entire committee, but
that its first job will be "to see what
the facts are."
No Agreement
In a resolution last Friday, CUE re
tained the final decision on Wilbur
sponsors. This resolution was CUE's
last statement on the controversy, ac
cording to Wert.

While this resolution was being con
sidered, Faculty Master Eric Hutchin
son and Head Sponsor A 1 Taylor
agreed upon a compromise plan Un
der which any differences in opinion
between the selection committee and
Dr. Hutchinson would be acted upon
by a five man student-faculty appeals
committee.
Hutchinson and the sponsors both
