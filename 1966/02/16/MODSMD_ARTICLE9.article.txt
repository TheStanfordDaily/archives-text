# LEGGETT:
## 'Canadian Cold Stunts Growth'

Permafrost, the perennial frozen
condition of the ground in northern
Canada, provided the background for
Dr. Robert F. Leggett's Tuesday Eve
ning Series slide lecture "The Can
adian North: An Illustrated Tour In
cluding Remote Places Seldom Seen
by Travelers."
Dr. Leggett, a noted Canadian civil
engineer and permafrost expert who
heads the Division of Building Re
search of the Canadian National Re
search Council in Ottawa, described
Uie Canadian north to the near-capac

ity Dinkelspiel audience as "the last
frontier of North America."
However, he added that it has only
been since the discovery of oil there
in the 1920's that this largely virgin
territory has been explored. Prev
iously it had been the unhampered
domain of fur trappers, the Hudson
Bay Co., the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and scattered bands of Eski
mos.
Progress Stymied
With this "discovery" of the North,
there was also the accompanying
realization that progress would be
stymied by what Leggett described
as the "most basic and common prob
lem of the north —permafrost."
Where does the problem lie? In
winter, permafrost presents few real
worries. In the short but potent sum
mer season though, when the sun
shines 24 hours a day in most places,
the top 18-24 inches of ground thaws,
and no one can pass over it without
sinking up to his knees in muskeg—
the slimy moss covering.
"People always ask me why we
Canadians don't use our wonderful,
green northlands," said Leggett, add
ing, "If they'd ever seen the muskeg
in summer they'd know. It's perfect
for the breeding of flies. The further
north the worse the flies become."
"And, speaking of summer, I've
been on the Artie coast when the
temperature was 90 Fahrenheit,"
added Leggett.
Because of the adverse conditions
brought about by permafrost and
muskeg, all buildings have to be con
structed on piles—timers driven into
the ground and used as a foundation.
Highway construction presents sim
ilar problems. Sand and gravel have
to be laid without breaking the sur
face of the muskeg. If a break were
to occur, the road would be useless
by the following summer.

north the worse the flies become."
"And, speaking of summer, I've
been on the Artie coast when the
temperature was 90 Fahrenheit,"
added Leggett.
Because of the adverse conditions
brought about by permafrost and
muskeg, all buildings have to be con
structed on piles—timers driven into
the ground and used as a foundation.
Highway construction presents sim
ilar problems. Sand and gravel have
to be laid without breaking the sur
face of the muskeg. If a break were
to occur, the road would be useless
by the following summer.

Permafrost, the perennial frozen
condition of the ground in northern
Canada, provided the background for
Dr. Robert F. Leggett's Tuesday Eve
ning Series slide lecture "The Can
adian North: An Illustrated Tour In
cluding Remote Places Seldom Seen
by Travelers."
Dr. Leggett, a noted Canadian civil
engineer and permafrost expert who
heads the Division of Building Re
search of the Canadian National Re
search Council in Ottawa, described
Uie Canadian north to the near-capac

ity Dinkelspiel audience as "the last
frontier of North America."
However, he added that it has only
been since the discovery of oil there
in the 1920's that this largely virgin
territory has been explored. Prev
iously it had been the unhampered
domain of fur trappers, the Hudson
Bay Co., the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and scattered bands of Eski
mos.
Progress Stymied
With this "discovery" of the North,
there was also the accompanying
realization that progress would be
stymied by what Leggett described
as the "most basic and common prob
lem of the north —permafrost."
Where does the problem lie? In
winter, permafrost presents few real
worries. In the short but potent sum
mer season though, when the sun
shines 24 hours a day in most places,
the top 18-24 inches of ground thaws,
and no one can pass over it without
sinking up to his knees in muskeg—
the slimy moss covering.
"People always ask me why we
Canadians don't use our wonderful,
green northlands," said Leggett, add
ing, "If they'd ever seen the muskeg
in summer they'd know. It's perfect
for the breeding of flies. The further
north the worse the flies become."
