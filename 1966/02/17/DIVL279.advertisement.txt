ZOMBIES
The walking dead men of Haitian folklore have long been featured in B
grade flicks where they scare the heroine and terrify the natives. Animated
and controlled by Unseen Evil, they draw no breath and feel no pain, walking
sightless through mist ridden swamps at the command and call of the black
Unknown. Unable to live they can not die. Grave rot and mold does not
set them free.
Living dead are not confined to Haiti. They are all around. On borrowed
time they hate to die, but do not find life. Death, the Bible says, is never
extinction nor loss of consciousness, but absence of the life of Christ within
the soul. Describing phony religious leaders Jude says, "they feast with you,
feeding themselves without fear, clouds without water, carried about by the
winds, trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, TWICE DEAD, plucked up by
the roots,- raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
To be dead, the New Testament says, is to be out of personal touch with
God. Admonishing the crowds Jesus Christ said, For as the Father raises the
Jead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will ... He
who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. Truly,
truly I say to you, he who hears my word and believes in him who has sent
me HAS eternal life,- he does not come into judgment, but has passed from
death to life . . . You search the scriptures, because you think that in them
you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me, yet you refuse
to come to me that you might have life" (John 5).
To be made alive is to come to Jesus Christ for a fresh new start and
spiritual awakening. Paul writes, "And you he made alive, when you were
dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following
the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the
spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. Among these we all
once lived in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of mind and
body, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us,
even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together
with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him, and
made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming
ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward
us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this
is not your own doing, it is the gift of God —not because of works, lest any
man should boast" (Ephesians 2).
Are you a Zombi in a modern world, without God and without hope?
What you seek and what you need is Jesus Christ, Lord of glory. Trust Him
today and watch what happens.

The walking dead men of Haitian folklore have long been featured in B
grade flicks where they scare the heroine and terrify the natives. Animated
and controlled by Unseen Evil, they draw no breath and feel no pain, walking
sightless through mist ridden swamps at the command and call of the black
Unknown. Unable to live they can not die. Grave rot and mold does not
set them free.
Living dead are not confined to Haiti. They are all around. On borrowed
time they hate to die, but do not find life. Death, the Bible says, is never
extinction nor loss of consciousness, but absence of the life of Christ within
the soul. Describing phony religious leaders Jude says, "they feast with you,
feeding themselves without fear, clouds without water, carried about by the
winds, trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, TWICE DEAD, plucked up by
the roots,- raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
To be dead, the New Testament says, is to be out of personal touch with
God. Admonishing the crowds Jesus Christ said, For as the Father raises the
Jead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will ... He
who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. Truly,
truly I say to you, he who hears my word and believes in him who has sent
me HAS eternal life,- he does not come into judgment, but has passed from
death to life . . . You search the scriptures, because you think that in them
you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me, yet you refuse
to come to me that you might have life" (John 5).
To be made alive is to come to Jesus Christ for a fresh new start and
spiritual awakening. Paul writes, "And you he made alive, when you were
dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following
the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the
spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. Among these we all
once lived in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of mind and
body, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us,
even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together
with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him, and
made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming
ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward
us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this
is not your own doing, it is the gift of God —not because of works, lest any
man should boast" (Ephesians 2).
Are you a Zombi in a modern world, without God and without hope?
What you seek and what you need is Jesus Christ, Lord of glory. Trust Him
today and watch what happens.
