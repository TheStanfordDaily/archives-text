# Museum Exhibits Accelerator Components

### WENDY WEINER 
Gleaming metals surround youâ€”copper, sil
ver, and gold against the stark background
of white museum-walls. A voice fills the room
and your eyes travel to its source.
The words are being emitted by an ani
mated model showing how electrons in the
Linear Accelerator are accelerated. You are
puzzled. Art or technology?
In a unique exhibit now open at the
Stanford Museum, the Stanford Art Depart
ment and the Linear Accelerator Center have
combined their talents. The result of this joint
effort, "Design for Nuclear Research," is a
display of components from the Linear Ac
celerator placed in a setting usually reserved
for pure art forms.
Dr. Lorenz Eitner, head of the Stanford Art
Department explained the motivation behind
the show by focusing on the significance of
the Linear Accelerator. He envisions the proj
ect as being as "large and ambitious as the
pyramids." People will travel thousands of
miles to view the wonders of the world, Eit

ner said, but this exhibit will give them the
opportunity to see one that "is right here."

"We are not trying to aestheticize or pret
tify these machines," Eitner said. "We are not
putting a machine on a pedestal and calling
it sculpture. It is still a machine, and if it
has aesthetic qualities, they are those of the
machine."
The machine itself, the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator, has been described as "one of the
largest gadgets ever devised to explore some
thing that can't be seen." It accelerates elec
trons to energies of 10-20 BEV (billion elec
tron volts) and bombards atomic nuclei with
these electrons.
One of the aims of the exhibit is to familiar
ize the non-scientist with this remarkable
machine. To give people a chance to see the
accelerator in a setting less forbidding than
its new two mile site, a 40-foot segment of the
instrument will be the focal point of the ex
hibition.
Aesthetically Speaking
Other components, from copper rings and
cylinders to a model of a beam switchboard,

can be explored, for a purely visual experi
ence. The color, form, and materials of the ob

jects on display are exciting against the al
most asceptic background of their museum
setting.
In one display, glass bells envelop dazzling
tangles of copper wire. The eye follows the
intricacies of the patterns and then moves
on to the next presentation. Here, sight is ar
rested by the geometric forms of disks and
cylinders, arranged with simplicity on a bare
wooden table.
Although Eitner is careful to distinguish
the machine from the work of art, he ob
served that in society today, "more people's
feelings are governed by the machine than by
conventional works of art."
But rather than taking the place of the
fine arts, Eitner sees in the Linear Accelerator,
and in the machine in general, "a new source
of forms. Science and technology, could serve
artists as an alternative to the traditional
repertory of nat u re-derived or art-derived
forms."
