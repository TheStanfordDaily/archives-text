# Places Available On Education Committee
## 
### 
Interviews will start next week
for those interested in sitting
on the Legislature's newly
formed Education Commission.
The body, created by a bill
passed by LASSU on February
10, was formed to encourage
study of the purposes of educa
tion. According to the sponsor
of the legislation, Ilmar Wald
ner, the commission will also
"encourage an experimental at
titude toward education.
"It will also advise the Legis
lature and other University
bodies on proposed changes,
which might detract from or en
hance the quality of education,"
Waldner commented.
Two resolutions which were
introduced in past weeks in
LASSU meetings will be re

ferred tonight to the Education
Commission. Those include a
bill dealing with non-directed
courses, and a plan for re-vitali
zation of the senior colloquia
program.
Twenty-one positions will be
available on the Commission, ac
cording to choosing Committee
member Tom Sherman. All
members of the Stanford com
munity are eligible for member
ship.
Students may pick up appli
cation blanks in the ASSU bull
pen in Tresidder tomorrow. Ap
plications must be returned to
the LASSU mailbox by 5 p.m.
the following Friday, February
25.
Nonstudents are asked to call
the LASSU secretary at exten

Interviews for the positions
will be held from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
