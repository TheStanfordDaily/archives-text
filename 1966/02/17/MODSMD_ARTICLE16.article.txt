# Strike Still On At St. John's
## 
### Collegiate Press Service 
St. John's University entered
a new semester last week with
pickets outside its doors, stu
dents considering transfers, and
dozens of teachers looking for
other jobs.
It all is a result of a teach
ers' strike which began on Jan.
4 after the university's admin
istration had dismissed 31 teach
ers late in December.
The St. John's chapter of the
American Association of Uni
versity Professors went on rec
ord last weekend as opposing
actions of the striking teachers.
