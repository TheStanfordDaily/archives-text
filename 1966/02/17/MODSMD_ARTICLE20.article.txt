# Boxers Ready For Cal Battle
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Stanford's boxing team will
attempt a spoiler role when
they meet Cal tonight at Berke
ley. Cal is undefeated this sea
son while the Indians are sport
ing a 1-3 record.
Coach Ray Lunny will be tak
ing six boxers up to Cal to com
pete against the Bears' 11-man
team. The 12th Naval district
will fill in the remaining weight
divisions.
Last week the Indians fell to
the University of Nevada in
Reno, 8-4, with several disputed
matches taking their toll of
Stanford boxers. A big winner
for Stanford last week and who
will be fighting Dick Wein
brandt tonight was Jim Marlar.
He won his fight by a knockout.
Archibald Top Boxer
Top fighters for Cal are Dave

Archibald, who administered a
knockout in his first meeting
with Stanford; this year heavy
weight Walt Cummingham, and
Paul Bell who will compete in
the 132-pound division against a
strong Navy fighter.
In their previous match Cal
defeated Stanford, 8-5. Since
then, however, the Indians have
made considerable improve
ment, although their record
may not indicate it.
Stanford forfeits three
matches which immediately
gives their opposition a three
point advantage. A glance at
Stanford's boxing scores this
season shows that their foes
have never scored more than
eight points indicating how
close the actual varsity matches
have been.
This will be Stanford's final
conference match of the season.
The conference tournament will
be held in Nevada March 25 and
26 and several Stanford boxers
should make impressive show
ings.
