and Charlotte Farber, victim of
a bad fall at the top of the long

tions, Stanford placed 9th and
10th in the slalom and giant sla
lom respectively.
More Most
High finisher in both events
was Dana More, placing 17th in
the giant slalom and 28th in

trained racers from the Sierra
colleges.
Once again unable to enter a
