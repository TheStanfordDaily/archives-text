# LASSU, Again
## 
### 
Zok! Pow! Another nasty irritation out of the
way!
Such seems to be the approach that a small
cabal of LASSU's Roman Senators are taking
toward the problem of student representation
on the Committee of 15. After meeting for many
long hours yesterday, a self-appointed band of
legislators concluded that four'of the five stu
dent members of the Committee have got to be
replaced. The charge? Nasty personalities and
a tendency toward compromise.
As a consequence, a resolution will be intro
duced in the Legislature tonight which would
effectively replace all five of the student repre
sentatives on the Committee of 15 —with the
exception of LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane. Be
fore the rest of the august body falls pell-mell
into line with its complaining members, we
would suggest that legislators reflect upon a
few questions:
• What sort of student representation on the
student-faculty-administration committee will
be most effective in gaining needed change? Of
the four proposed new appointees, three, on the
surface at least, are hard-line activists. Along
with Kadane, they would present an imposing
—but not very effective —force in dealing with
a faculty and an administration that respect
reasoning, not belligerence, The fifth proposed
representative, kindly added by yesterday's
cabal in hopes of giving the student representa
tion some "balance," would be a reactionary
who in past LASSU meetings has shown more
concern for parliamentary procedure than pro
gress, a student who could hardly be called
a respectable representative of the conservative
viewpoint.
Among those who would no longer be on the
Committee is the ASSU president—the only
one of the 15 elected by the student body as a
whole.
• Is it wise to make such drastic changes in
the middle of the year? Faculty and administra

tion membership on the Committee has to date
remained fairly constant. If the student mem
bership is subjected to the proposed revision,
the work of the committee —and the strength of
the student position —would be severely hin
dered while the new members "learn the ropes."
• Has the present Committee of 15 been
given sufficient time to prove its worth? The
whole idea of students, faculty, and administrat
ors negotiating on an equal level was such a
dramatic change from the past that it has taken
the Committee a few months just to find its foot
ing. Now that the Committee has begun discus
sing issues, would it not be fair to give it suffici
ent time to bring about results? Understandably,
many students expected more and expected it
sooner, but it takes time and patience to over
come the inertia of a bureaucracy the size of
Stanford's.
• What effect would the changed represen
tation have upon the Committee of 15's subcom
mittees? Three of the four students who would
be dropped from the Committee are members
of subcommittees which are conducting in
depth studies of specific issues. Since the Com
mittee of 15 has voted that no non-member of
the larger body shall sit on a subcommittee,
these students would have to leave —and the
work of the smaller bodies thus far would be
destroyed. Under these circumstances, it might
be wise for the Legislature to postpone action
for a week, and first request the Committee of
15 to change that policy when it meets tomor
row. Another argument for postponement would
be that many legislators will not be in attend
ance tonight due to rush —and full attendance
seems imperative when an issue of this import
is being discussed.
These are but a few of the questions that legis
lators might ask themselves tonight. It took 75
years for the University to create a Committee
of 15. We hope it won't be destroyed in an eve
ning.
