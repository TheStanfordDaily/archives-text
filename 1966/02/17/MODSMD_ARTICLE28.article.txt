## 'Confrontation' With China Resembles Korea Situation 
### Walter Lippmann 
The televised hearings, at
which Gen. James Gavin and
Ambassador George Kennan ap
peared before the Senate For
eign Relations Committee, have
done an inestimable service to
our people. For they broke
through the official screen and
made visible the nature of the
war and where our present pol
icy is leading us.
On the rule that if you can
not beat them, join them, which
in its modern form is that if you
cannot debate with them, say
you agree with them, the Presi
dent takes the position that
there is not much difference be
tween the Gavin-Kennan thesis
and the Rusk-McNamara policy.
Limited vs. Unlimited
There is, in fact, a radical dif
ference—the difference between
a limited and an unlimited war.
The President may not want to
fight an unlimited war. I have
no doubt myself that he does
not want to do so. But the prom
ises he made in Honolulu which
the Vice President is now broad
casting so lavishly in Saigon
and Bangkok, are —if they are
to be taken seriously—an unlim
ited commitment of American
soldiers and American money.
It is this unlimited commit
ment which those of us who be
long to the Gavin-Kennan school
oppose. For we see that as the
numbers of our troops and the
range of our bombing are esca
lated, and as the theater of the
war becomes widened, it is high
ly probable, indeed it is well
night inevitable that the United
States will find itself confront
ing China in a land war on the
mainland of Asia.
Confrontation
Last week's hearings made
visible that this is where the
course we are taking leads.
Gen. Maxwell Taylor, who
since 1961 has played a leading
part in our military interven
tion in South Vietnam, has rec
ognized that the prospect of a
land war with China is today
our greatest worry. In an inter
view published in the current
issue of U. S. News and World
Report, Gen. Taylor is asked
about the danger of "a military
confrontation with Communist
China." He replies that "One
can never rule out the possibil
ity. But I would list the proba
bility quite low in ternis of per
centage."
Resemblance
This has an ominous resem
blance to the colloquy in 1950
between President Truman and
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur (c.f.,
Lawson, "The United States in
the Korean War," Page 79):
"In your opinion," Presi
dent Truman asked Gen. Mac-
Arthur, "is there any chance
that the Chinese might enter
the war on the side of North
Korea?"
Mat-Arthur shook his head.
"I'd say there's very little
chance of that happening.
They have several hundred
thousand men north of the

Yalu, but they haven't any air
force. If they tried to cross
the river our Air Force would
slaughter them. At the most
perhaps 60,000 troops would
make it. Our infantry could
easily contain them. I expect
the actual fighting in North
Korea to end by Thanksgiv
ing. We should have our men
home, or at least in Japan, by
Christmas."
At the very moment that
President Truman and Gen.
Mac Arthur were talking there
were already more than 100,-
000 Chinese Communist troops
in North Korea and another
200,000 were ready to cross
the Yalu. By mid-November
at least 300,000 Chinese would
be poised to strike—and the
ROK, the American and other
U.N. forces would not even be
aware of their presence. Be
fore the war was over the Chi
nese Communist armies in
Korea would reach a peak
strength of more than a mil
lion men.
On the question of the need
to contain the military expan
sion of Red China, there is vir
tually universal agreement in
this country. The containment
of Red China today, like the con-
Stalinist Russia aft
er the World War, is necessary
to the peace of the world and is
a vital interest of the United
States. What is debatable is the
diplomatic policy we are pursu
ing in order to contain Red
China. If we compare what
Rusk and William Bundy are
doing with the diplomatic pol
icy by which some 15 years ago
Stalin was contained, the differ
ences are very striking.
The cardinal difference is that
our Chinese containment policy
is a unilateral American policy
whereas our Stalinist contain
ment policy was shared with
and participated in by all the
Western Allies.
It is often said officially that
in the Far East today we are
repeating what was done so suc
cessfuly in Europe. If this were
what we are doing, there would
be an alliance to contain China
in which Japan, Russia, India,
Pakistan, the Uni ted States,
Great Britain and France were
aligned in a Far Eastern Mar
shall Plan and NATO. Instead,
owing to the miscalculations
and blundering of the Vietna
mese war, we have alienated
and indeed neutralized all the
great powers of the Asian main
land.
The difference between the
containment policies—in Europe
and in the Far East—is the dif
ference between realism and
verbalism, between professional
ism and amateurism. Our pres
ent policy is as if we had set
out to contain Stalinist Russia
by ignoring the British, the
French, the Italians and the
Germans and had decided to
make our stand against commu
nism of—let us say—Bucharest.
