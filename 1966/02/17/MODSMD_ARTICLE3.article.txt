# Hoffman Calls Viet Problem Political Only
## 
### JAN WELLS 
"Vietnam is not a moral issue; it is
not a legal problem. It is neither a
purely local nor a geo political prob
lem. In Vietnam we are dealing with
a political problem only," according
to Dr. Stanley Hoffman, Harvard pro
fessor of government, currently at
the Institute for Behavioral Sciences,
and main speaker at Political Union's
fourth FOCUS program on Vietnam.
"In Vietnam we are engaged in a
fight with limited objectives, by lim
ited means." Professor Hoffman feels
that the major danger is that to justi
fy escalating means we will escalate
objectives, leading to a further escala
tion of means.
"The precedents of Munich and
Korea arc irrelevant," Dr: Hoffman
maintained. "A much truer analogy
can be drawn to the French position
in Algeria."
Similarities between Algeria include
the growth of the rebellion, the ab
sence of a political force that could
be engaged to rebuild the countries,
internal escalation, military build-up
and demands for internal social re
forms by the outside power, and the
mobilization of liberal elements as
apologists for the administration dur
ing early stages of fighting.
Differences are that in Algeria the
French were not dealing with com
munists and that the French had
achieved a virtual military victory at
the time of their withdrawal from Al
geria.
Recognition of the Viet Cong and
agreement to negotiation with it is
the solution according to Hoffman.
After all, "the French got nowhere in
Algeria until they recognized the
FALN."
During a debate following his pre
sentation, Professors Gordon Craig
and Lyman Van Slyke questioned
Hoffman's claim that no stable politi
cal force exists for a basis of govern
ment in South Vietnam.
