# Sterling To Present Report On Religion To Board Today
## 
### 
A report by President Sterling on
religion and discussion of ASSU con
stitutional changes are among the
items on the agenda of the Board of
Trustees, meeting today in San Fran
cisco, a University spokesman told
The Daily yesterday.
Content of the report on religion
has not been made public, but pre
sumably Sterling will be speaking on
a proposal to allow denominational
groups to hold worship services on
campus. Present policy prohibits all
worship except the non-denomina
tional services of Memorial Church.
The policy stems from the Found
ing Grant of the University which
states that "the University must be
forever maintained upon a strictly
non partisan and non-sectarian basis.
. . . the moral and religious develop
ment of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free from all
denominational alliances, however
slight the bond may be."
Since the War, there have been al
most annual investigations of religion,
resulting in pleas for liberalization of
the policy on the grounds that Stan

ford has created a bond with Prot
estantism and that allowing all
groups to worship would both better
implement the intentions of the
Founders and more fully recognize
the contemporary religious situation
of pluralism.
Two years ago, LASSU and The
Daily completed the last of these sur
veys of religion and shortly thereaf
ter the University received a $1.3 mil
lion grant for "the expansion of Me
morial Chapel and related activities."
