# New Social Regs Create Turmoil

### SUE WICKIZER 
The turmoil occuring over the ex
tension of overnight sign-out for wom
en poses the question of just how
much the social regulations can he
changed within the next three years.
The change in the overnight sign
out time was and is still considered
minor by the majority of the mom
as a premeditated act. The extension
tee. On January 27 the committee ex
tended the overnight sign-out until

2:30 a.m. for freshmen and sopho
mores and 6 a.m. for juniors and sen
iors.
Although the change was unani
mously passed by LASSU that night,
the Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee did not approve the proposed
change.
In a letter to the social regulations
committee, Professor Alfred Grom
mon, Chairman of Student Affairs and
Services, stated that last year it was
"unanimously agreed that the present
regulations would stand without sub
stantive change for the next three
years."
Disapproval
Student Affairs and Services disap
proved of the extension of overnight
sign-out because it appeared to the
committee to be a "significant sub
stantive change in policy and defini
tion" presented without "enough in
formation about the rationale for and
need of the change."
The definition, however, is only an
understood one, and not explicitly
stated in the'literature on social regu
lations. The Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee views an overnight
of the sign-out time would place over
nights on a more spontaneous basis.
But according to one member of the
social regulations committee, "not
many girls work under this definition
of an overnight."
The judicial council representative
to the social regulations committee
stated that "pragmatically, the change
is not major. The majority of the stu
dents, while using overnights consci
entiously, do not consider them to be
qualitatively more serious and de
manding more forethought.

"It is unfortunate that overnights
are going to be used under the theo
retical context," she added.
Mrs. Ellen Otto, chairman of the
social regulations committee, con
siders the difference between mid
nght and 2:30 a.m. "negligible as far
as planning ahead."
Because of the committee's uncer
tainty as to what comprises a major
or minor social regulations change,
they are also uncertain of the juris
diction of the Student Affairs and
Services Committee over social regu
lations.
When the sign-out extension was
passed, the social regulations commit
tee did not originally send it to Stu
dent Affairs and Services for approval
because they considered it too minor
a change. Student Affairs and Ser
vices learned of the regulation change
through other sources.
"The controversy over the deadline
extension came about because the
committee did not realize the kind of
thing Student Affairs and Services
does when it reviews social regula
tions," stated Mrs. Otto.
Hastiness
"There was hastiness in the com
mittee not on the decision, but in
writing it up and sending it. It simply
hadn't occurred to us that Student
Affairs and Services would be inter
ested in reviewing it."
Some members of the social regula
tions committee feel that Student Af
fairs and Services should not have
jurisdiction over minor regulation
changes.
"For a change of such small magni
tude, it undermines the trust put in
the students to have the wisdom to

make their own decisions," one mem
ber commented.
"A precedent has been set. The com
mittee has been set up to make
changes and meet crises throughout
the whole year, and the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee is taking
away our autonomy."
Legislature
The members of the Legislature,
however, believe the faculty and ad
ministration should be consulted if
they have a "legitimate interest" in
the issue, even though LASSU con
sidered the social regulation change
"neither major nor substantive."
Last week LASSU rescinded the
February 27 deadline for the imple
mentation of the change because the
body believed the deadline violated the
joint resolution forming the Commit
tee of Fifteen, a negotiating commit
tee of students, faculty and adminis
trators.
The resolution states that each con
stituency of the Committee of Fifteen
must consult the other two in mat
ters of general interest.
Jay Kadane, Speaker of the Legis
lature and a member of the Commit
tee of Fifteen, explained that "other
constituencies were concerned with
the problem besides the student
body."
Study
The Legislature directed that over
night sign-out procedure be included
in a general study of social regula
tions which the social regulations
committee will complete this spring.
At least until then, it is the con
sensus of the committee that no ma
jor, and few minor, changes can be
passed.

Legislature
The members of the Legislature,
however, believe the faculty and ad
ministration should be consulted if
they have a "legitimate interest" in
the issue, even though LASSU con
sidered the social regulation change
"neither major nor substantive."
Last week LASSU rescinded the
February 27 deadline for the imple
mentation of the change because the
body believed the deadline violated the
joint resolution forming the Commit
tee of Fifteen, a negotiating commit
tee of students, faculty and adminis
trators.
The resolution states that each con
stituency of the Committee of Fifteen
must consult the other two in mat
ters of general interest.
Jay Kadane, Speaker of the Legis
lature and a member of the Commit
tee of Fifteen, explained that "other
constituencies were concerned with
the problem besides the student
body."
Study
The Legislature directed that over
night sign-out procedure be included
in a general study of social regula
tions which the social regulations
committee will complete this spring.
At least until then, it is the con
sensus of the committee that no ma
jor, and few minor, changes can be
passed.
The turmoil occuring over the ex
tension of overnight sign-out for wom
en poses the question of just how
much the social regulations can he
changed within the next three years.
The change in the overnight sign
out time was and is still considered
minor by the majority of the mom
as a premeditated act. The extension
tee. On January 27 the committee ex
tended the overnight sign-out until

2:30 a.m. for freshmen and sopho
mores and 6 a.m. for juniors and sen
iors.
Although the change was unani
mously passed by LASSU that night,
the Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee did not approve the proposed
change.
In a letter to the social regulations
committee, Professor Alfred Grom
mon, Chairman of Student Affairs and
Services, stated that last year it was
"unanimously agreed that the present
regulations would stand without sub
stantive change for the next three
years."
Disapproval
Student Affairs and Services disap
proved of the extension of overnight
sign-out because it appeared to the
committee to be a "significant sub
stantive change in policy and defini
tion" presented without "enough in
formation about the rationale for and
need of the change."
The definition, however, is only an
understood one, and not explicitly
stated in the'literature on social regu
lations. The Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee views an overnight
of the sign-out time would place over
nights on a more spontaneous basis.
But according to one member of the
social regulations committee, "not
many girls work under this definition
of an overnight."
The judicial council representative
to the social regulations committee
stated that "pragmatically, the change
is not major. The majority of the stu
dents, while using overnights consci
entiously, do not consider them to be
qualitatively more serious and de
manding more forethought.

"It is unfortunate that overnights
are going to be used under the theo
retical context," she added.
Mrs. Ellen Otto, chairman of the
social regulations committee, con
siders the difference between mid
nght and 2:30 a.m. "negligible as far
as planning ahead."
Because of the committee's uncer
tainty as to what comprises a major
or minor social regulations change,
they are also uncertain of the juris
diction of the Student Affairs and
Services Committee over social regu
lations.
When the sign-out extension was
passed, the social regulations commit
tee did not originally send it to Stu
dent Affairs and Services for approval
because they considered it too minor
a change. Student Affairs and Ser
vices learned of the regulation change
through other sources.
"The controversy over the deadline
extension came about because the
committee did not realize the kind of
thing Student Affairs and Services
does when it reviews social regula
tions," stated Mrs. Otto.
Hastiness
"There was hastiness in the com
mittee not on the decision, but in
writing it up and sending it. It simply
hadn't occurred to us that Student
Affairs and Services would be inter
ested in reviewing it."
Some members of the social regula
tions committee feel that Student Af
fairs and Services should not have
jurisdiction over minor regulation
changes.
"For a change of such small magni
tude, it undermines the trust put in
the students to have the wisdom to

make their own decisions," one mem
ber commented.

nght and 2:30 a.m. "negligible as far
as planning ahead."
Because of the committee's uncer
tainty as to what comprises a major
or minor social regulations change,
they are also uncertain of the juris
diction of the Student Affairs and
Services Committee over social regu
lations.
When the sign-out extension was
passed, the social regulations commit
tee did not originally send it to Stu
dent Affairs and Services for approval
because they considered it too minor
a change. Student Affairs and Ser
vices learned of the regulation change
through other sources.
"The controversy over the deadline
extension came about because the
committee did not realize the kind of
thing Student Affairs and Services
does when it reviews social regula
tions," stated Mrs. Otto.
Hastiness
"There was hastiness in the com
mittee not on the decision, but in
writing it up and sending it. It simply
hadn't occurred to us that Student
Affairs and Services would be inter
ested in reviewing it."
Some members of the social regula
tions committee feel that Student Af
fairs and Services should not have
jurisdiction over minor regulation
changes.
"For a change of such small magni
tude, it undermines the trust put in
the students to have the wisdom to

make their own decisions," one mem
ber commented.
"A precedent has been set. The com
mittee has been set up to make
changes and meet crises throughout
the whole year, and the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee is taking
away our autonomy."
Legislature
The members of the Legislature,
however, believe the faculty and ad
ministration should be consulted if
they have a "legitimate interest" in
the issue, even though LASSU con
sidered the social regulation change
"neither major nor substantive."
Last week LASSU rescinded the
February 27 deadline for the imple
mentation of the change because the
body believed the deadline violated the
joint resolution forming the Commit
tee of Fifteen, a negotiating commit
tee of students, faculty and adminis
trators.
The resolution states that each con
stituency of the Committee of Fifteen
must consult the other two in mat
ters of general interest.
Jay Kadane, Speaker of the Legis
lature and a member of the Commit
tee of Fifteen, explained that "other
constituencies were concerned with
the problem besides the student
body."
Study
The Legislature directed that over
night sign-out procedure be included
in a general study of social regula
tions which the social regulations
committee will complete this spring.
At least until then, it is the con
sensus of the committee that no ma
jor, and few minor, changes can be
passed.
The turmoil occuring over the ex
tension of overnight sign-out for wom
en poses the question of just how
much the social regulations can he
changed within the next three years.
The change in the overnight sign
out time was and is still considered
minor by the majority of the mom
as a premeditated act. The extension
tee. On January 27 the committee ex
tended the overnight sign-out until

2:30 a.m. for freshmen and sopho
mores and 6 a.m. for juniors and sen
iors.
Although the change was unani
mously passed by LASSU that night,
the Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee did not approve the proposed
change.
In a letter to the social regulations
committee, Professor Alfred Grom
mon, Chairman of Student Affairs and
Services, stated that last year it was
"unanimously agreed that the present
regulations would stand without sub
stantive change for the next three
years."
Disapproval
Student Affairs and Services disap
proved of the extension of overnight
sign-out because it appeared to the
committee to be a "significant sub
stantive change in policy and defini
tion" presented without "enough in
formation about the rationale for and
need of the change."
The definition, however, is only an
understood one, and not explicitly
stated in the'literature on social regu
lations. The Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee views an overnight
of the sign-out time would place over
nights on a more spontaneous basis.
But according to one member of the
social regulations committee, "not
many girls work under this definition
of an overnight."
The judicial council representative
to the social regulations committee
stated that "pragmatically, the change
is not major. The majority of the stu
dents, while using overnights consci
entiously, do not consider them to be
qualitatively more serious and de
manding more forethought.

"It is unfortunate that overnights
are going to be used under the theo
retical context," she added.
