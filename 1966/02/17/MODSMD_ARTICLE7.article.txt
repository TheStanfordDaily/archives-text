# Debate To Begin On Rep Changes
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
A proposal to replace the present
LASSU representatives to the new
ly-formed Committee of Fifteen will
be introduced during committee-of
the-whole debate in the regular Legis
lature meeting tonight.
The expected controversy centers
around the dissatisfaction of some
LASSU representatives on the past
student voting on the Committee of
Fifteen. The debate will probably fo
cus on a vote last quarter in which
a majority of the student representa
tives on that committee sided with
the administration on the Union issue.
A resolution will be introduced re
questing the five members to reveal
their votes on that and other issues
throughout the year.
'Hard Line' Policy
The proposal to change the mem
bership will probably be introduced
by a group of students who favor a
"hard-line" policy when conducting ne
gotiations with the administration.
The group is comprised of both lib
eral and conservative representatives.
In other business, the Legislature
is scheduled to refer two bills to a
new education commission and a bill
concerning electioneering rules to the
By-laws Committee.
Under legislation not known to be
controversial, the Legislature will
consider a bill affecting membership
of the Social Regulations Committee
as well as bills concerning the Stan
ford Community Aid Commission and
the Social Coordinating Committee.
A piece of legislation entitled "Is

sues of Student Concern" would pro
vide for referendum action in case
the student body wanted to pass a
resolution concerning off-campus is
sues.
The bill is designed to compensate
for the fact that LASSU is prohibited
by legislation passed last year to con
sider off-campus issues.
Legislation known to be controver
sial includes the consideration of two
requests for fund allocations reported
unfavorably out of the student finan
cial committee. The requests vere
made by the Institute of Internation
al Relations and KZSU.
Political Action
A resolution concerning political ac
tion which was put on the agenda
three weeks ago may be brought to
the floor tonight. It affirms the right
of any members of the Stanford Com
munity to mount and promote politi
cal activities on the campus. The reso
lution was written last month when
a group of Berkeley protestors was
threatened with punishment after
holding more than one rally in a week.
A final bill which would change the
time of LASSU meetings may be con
sidered.
According to LASSU speaker Jay
Kadane, none of the legislation known
to be controversial or uncontrover
sial may come to the floor by cause
of limited time.
A resolution asking for reevalua
tion of the draft system will not be re
ported out of committee because of
the crowded agenda.
The meeting will begin at 7:30 in
room 370.
