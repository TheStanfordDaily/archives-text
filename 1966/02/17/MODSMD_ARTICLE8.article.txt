# Teller To Discuss Communication
## 
### 
Dr. Edward Teller, Professor of
Physics at the University of Califor
nia, will be speaking tonight at 7 p.m.
in Muir Lounge at Stern Hall on
"The Right Language."
Teller will discuss the need for
Americans abroad, particularly in un
derdeveloped countries, to communi
cate with and understand foreigners.

An informal discussion will follow
Teller's talk; punch and cookies will
be served.
Teller, one of the world's foremost
physicists, has been noted for his po
litical commentary on controversial
subjects, including his Senate testi
mony in opposition to the nuclear
test ban treaty.
Born in Budapest, Hungary, in
1908, Dr. Teller received his univer
sity education in Germany, receiving
his Ph.D. from the University of Leip
zig in 1930. Until 1939 he worked in
theoretical physics.
After research and teaching in Got
tingen, Copenhagen, and London in
the early 1930'5, he came to the
United States and was Professor of
Physics at George Washington Uni
versity, Washington, D. C., from
1935 to 1941.
His wartime assignments took him
from Columbia University, to the
Univ. of Chicago until 1952, and since
then at the University of California.
Unlike many of the nuclear physi
cists who helped develop the world's
first atomic bomb, Dr. Teller contin

ued to work on nuclear weapons af
ter Hiroshima and the end of World
War 11.
Teller did this in the firm belief
that there were many unexplored ap
plications of nuclear energy and he
cause he felt that the United States
would need advanced nuclear weap
ons to oppose successfully future dan
gers.
After World War 11, Dr. Teller
made significant contributions to the
development of atomic weapons and
the design of the world's first hydro
gen bomb.
A member of the General Advisory
Committee of the Atomic Energy
Commission from 1956 to 1958, he
helped establish the nation's second
nuclear weapons laboratory at Liver
more, Calif.
He was Assistant Director of the
Los Alamos Science Laboratory, New
Mexico, 1949-1951. He received the Al
bert Einstein Award in 1958 and the
Research Institute of America Living
History Award in 1960.
