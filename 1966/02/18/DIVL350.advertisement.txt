The Most Important Thing in Life
All of us must die. None knows when nor how the dark angel of death
will claim us in the end. We've no choice in the matter, just one life to live.
To find the purpose of existence, and eternal life with God is the most im
portant task in life, yet one we all neglect and push aside.
Helmut Thielicke writes, "I believe that we people are such fanatics for
security, such blind,mad, sham-realists, because we no longer understand
that this is the basic, important thing— to get into the clear with God and
put the altar at the beginning. Because we have forgotten this, we live
in the delusion that we must do everything ourselves. We think: first I must
set my job in order, put my business on a solid basis, pass this particular
examination or get over that hurdle in my path. First I must settle the so
called elementary areas of life—and only then, when I have all this behind
me, can I permit myself to think about the inner comfort of life; then I'll have
time to cultivate my soul and the inner man a bit. But when I think in this
way I have already gambled away the decisive thing in life. For it is axio
matic that God does not come when it fits my schedule. There we have him
down for the time after our second heart attack. But, alas, God who is thus
put down in our date book never shows up. God doesn't allow himself to be
dealt with dilatorily, for he insists on being the elementary thing in my life
and not just the symbol of a bit of additional spiritual comfort or of certain
pious symptoms of advancing age .
Reminding men of their responsibility to God, and the importance of a
daily walk with Him, Jesus told this parable, ' A man's life does not consist
in the abundance of his possessions. The land of a rich man brought forth
plentifully, and he thought to himself, 'what shall I do, for I have nowhere to
store my crops? I will do this.- I will pull down my barns, and build larger
ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my
soul, Soul you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat,
drink, be merry.' But God said to him, Fooll This night your soul is required
of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' So is he who
lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God'' (Luke 12).
Some miss out with God until too late. Some never find eternal life,
but forfeit all. Why should you lose out? Let us know if we can help. -
