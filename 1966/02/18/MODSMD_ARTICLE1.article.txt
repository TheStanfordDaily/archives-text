# TRUSTEES GRANT 'TRIAL' WORSHIP
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
The Board of Trustess yesterday
approved sectarian worship "on a
trial basis," but ambiguities remain
as to the scope of worship.
The Board accepted the reform as
"part of an overall expansion of the
University's religious program," a
University statement said.
If sufficient interest is shown in
the services, the statement continued,
the University would consider apply
ing to the courts for appropriate
change in its Founding Grant.
Details of the program have still
to be worked out between President
Sterling, Chaplain R. M. Minto, the
denominational ministers, and the
President's Committee on Religious
Activities.

The most important question left
unresolved is whether services will be
limited to Memorial Church. Rabbi
Charles Familant, Hillel Director, has
previously stated he will refuse to
worship in the Church.
Stanford religious policy has been
based on an amendment to the Found
ing Grant, read as an address to the
Board of Trustees by Mrs. Stanford
October 3, 1902. The statement reads:
"The University must forever be
maintained upon a strictly non-parti
san and non-sectarian basis. It must
never become an instrument in the
hands of any political party or any
religious sect or organization.
"I believe that the moral and reli
gious development of the University
will be better accomplished if entirely
free from all denominational alli

ances, however slight the bond may
be."
"The services in the Memorial
Church must be simple and informal
in character, and the theological ques
tions, services, and observances upon
which the sects differ should not be
entered upon, so that members of
every church may worship and re
ceive instruction therein not incon
sistent with their individual beliefs."
The policy has been the object of
nearly every annual review since the
Second World War, most of which
concluded with pleas for liberaliza
tion of the policy on the grounds that
Stanford has created a bond with
Protestantism by allowing only the
services in Memorial Church and that
allowing all groups to worship would
both better implement the inten

tions of the Founders and more fully
recognize the contemporary pluralis
tic religious situation.
The last of these investigations was
made two years ago by The Daily
and the Legislature. The survey con
cluded that "it is apparent that reli
gion at Stanford is not now meeting
student needs. Both the opportunity
and necessity for changes and in
creases in the entire religious pro
gram are very much in order."
The prime recommendation of the
Committee was that worship for all
denominations be allowed on campus.
Shortly thereafter, the University
received a $1.3 million gift from alum
nus Lowell Barry "for Memorial
Chapel and related activities."
As a result, the Presidential Com
mittee on Religion was formed. The

Committee, under Dean Richard Ly.
man became active the following fall,
and"it was not long after we began
looking at religion in toto that we
were confronted with the restrictions
on worship," Lyman states.
Basic recommendations were made
to the President last winter; "they
have subsequently been refined in
detail although the general thrust has
remained the same," Lyman said yes
terday.
Sterling has discussed freedom of
worship with the Board over a period
of the last few months and recent
Committee work has been the an
swering of questions about worship
from the Board. Religion was dis
cussed at the December Trustee meet
ing, but final action was deferred un
til the meeting yesterday.
There has been sporadic participa

tion in Memorial Church services by
denominational groups ever since the
Church was dedieatwl in 1903. Minis
ters and rabbis have frequently
preached from the pulpit and the
archbishop of San Francisco gave the
Baccalaureate sermon two years ago.
Several times, denominational ser
vices have been allowed as liturgy
demonstrations. The last such series
was last year and included a Roman
Catholic mass and services of the Epis
copal, and Russian Orthodox Church
es, and the Church of South India.
Recognition for denominational
groups was made official in a 1963
policy statement by the Board which
permitted use of University facilities
by denominational groups for closed
meetings subject to scheduling and
open meetings subject to approval by
the Committee on Religious Affairs.
