# Controversy Brews Around Encina Art
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
A controversy over modern
art is swelling in, of all places,
Encina Hall, business headquar
ters of the University.
Encina's art has been inciting
comment and negative reactions
ever since the first display in
January, 1964 by Joseph Jedd,
student accounts supervisor.
Forced to yield to heavy pres
sure from Encina employes and
administration officials, Jedd re
moved several paintings by Ann
Raymond, local artist, last week.
Those taken down, Jedd said,
were nudes, but he commented
that most of the adverse reac
tions have been against modern
art in general.
Bland Walls
Jedd and Controller Kenneth
D. Creighton, who co-sponsored
the project, have been faced
with the problem ever since
they decided to liven up the nor
mally bland walls of Encina and
replaced the Alpine landscapes
with student art and works by
local, well-known artists.
Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton feels, like others op
posed to the showings, that the
paintings, particularly the "un
gainly nudes," are offensive.
Houghton also found most of
the art "morose." "I don't think
that some of the pictures hung
are the kind that students hav
ing to go to the Cachier's Office

and employees working in the
office should be forced to view,"
he stated. He claimed that the
"exhibits seem to be going from
bad to worse".
Captive Audience
"If they want an art exhibit to
be controversial, it should be
where people are free to see it
or not. Encina has a captive aud
ience," Houghton said.
But Jedd said students seem
unanimously in favor of the
showings.
Linda Paulsen, senior psy
chology major who viewed the
works, expressed shock and sur
prise at seeing the nudes, "but
in a positive wayâ€”it's good for
people to learn to tolerate an
other form of expression".
Ruth Arnon, Branner gradu
ate associate, wonders if En
cina Is perhaps the best place
since it is the business front of
the school, but thinks the show
ing are "reflective of the adven
turous spirit of the school.
"I would hate to see them en
during for eternity because I
don't believe they are beautiful
works of art. However, I am
very much for experiment in
art," she said.
Disappointment
In a Daily interview, Ann
Raymond indicated disappoint
ment that some of her paintings
had been removed, but asserted
that she likes the differing opin
ions because "when there is con
troversy, things happen; when
everyone accepts things, there
is no change". However, she is
dismayed when people object to
subject matter or the mood of
the painting.
"This says something only
about the person who thinks it's
bad."
People, she feels, should try
to understand the ingredients of
the work, analyze and under
stand its many levels. Other
wise, "they're like the person
who says 'I don't know any
thing about it, but I know what
I like'."
The artist said that "if they
were reacting to the painting,
I'd feel better. If they're react
ing to the nudes, then they're
letting their prejudices and lack
of knowledge show through."
