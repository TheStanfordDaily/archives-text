# I-Series Focus On Soviet Life
## 
### 
Stanford students will be trans
ported to the Soviet Union on
Saturday, February 19, through
films and music to be presented
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. A
color film, "Adventures in Mos
cow," made by Dr. Henry May
er of Redwood City, will give
the audience a visual back
ground for the music to follow.
After a piano concert of Rus
sian music, a variety of popular
and folk songs will be sung by
Stanford's two exchange stu
dents from the USSR, Jadim
Golovanov and Viktor Sendyuk,
who emphasize that they are not
stars of the Bolshoi Opera.
Following the entertainment
the audience will move to the
International Center where a
number of displays and photo
montages of the USSR will be
on display, and refreshments
will be served. The program is
open to all interested members
of the Stanford community.
