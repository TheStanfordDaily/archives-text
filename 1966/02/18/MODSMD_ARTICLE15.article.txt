# Students Work In Hong Kong
## 
### HENRY ALLEY 
"When you come back from
Asia," said Dwight Clark,
"you're pretty well hooked." As
proof of this, his new teaching
project, Volunteers in Asia
(VIA), hopes to expand service
to four countries instead of one:
Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand,
and Vietnam.
Each summer since 1963, 25
Stanford students have worked

on various projects in Hong
Kong alone—some teaching Eng
lish to Hong Kong students and
doctors, others supervising rec
reation and instruction in an
orphanage. Provided all plans
are confirmed, this summer's
volunteers, who will have sub
mitted applications by Febru
ary 19, will participate in three
additional projects.
• Thailand: English instruc

tion will be given in Bangkok
secondary schools. Also, four
volunteers will work at a coop
erative farm in the far north
western tip of Thailand.
• Vietnam: Two medical stu
dents will help at a clinic in
Dampao, a village in South
Vietnam. A second, but still ten
tative, project will send from 6
to 12 men (21 and older) to im
prove refugee camps in South
Vietnam. These camps provide
sanctuary for those fleeing Viet
Cong terrorism.
• Korea: If arrangements are
confirmed, a community devel
opment center will offer Eng
lish instruction. Stanford stu
dents will serve as personal tu
tors to Koreans who will later
study at American colleges.
Organized Three Years Ago
Clark formed the voluntary
group three years ago when a
number of the '66 freshman
class wanted to leave the univer
sity cloister and "give of them
selves in a more total way."
Students put up $925 for plane
fare and additional expenses.
Each of the three years, World
University Service (WUS), an
organization characterized by
Clark as "a college-age CARE
program," has helped find proj
ects for the 25 freshmen.
Each year, however, VIA has
relied less on the world organi
zation. This year, two Asian
groups have approached VIA di
rectly: the Hong Kong based
Chinese Student Weekly, and
the Un Long school, located
five miles from the Communist
Chinese border.
Other Projects
Other projects in last year's
VIA program included:
• Roof-top schools: The volun
teers taught English on the tops
of Seven-story resettlement cen
ters — immense "Asian Wilbur
Halls," as Clark calls them. Rec
reation was also provided for
the 5 to 18 year-old pupils.
The centers were built in
Kowloon, that part of Hong
Kong located on the main
land. They house about 600,000
persons and come under the di
rection of the crown colony
government.
• English instruction for col
lege and secondary students:
Some of the students assisted
the faculty of United College,
one of the three institutions in
the Chinese University of Hong
Kong. Two Stanford volunteers
taught English to secondary
school students as part of a
project called Promise, Inc.; still
others helped at Queen Maude
Middle School.
Sacrifices for Education
All of these young Chinese
have made sacrifices to get
their education; many of them
are refugees from mainland
China. All hoped to develop a
command of English that enable
them to get better jobs.
• Project Concern: Dr. James
Turpin, an American physician,
established this relief organi

zation to bring medical and edu
cational help to the deprived.
Two Stanford volunteers helped
at three Concern clinics, one lo
cated among the lean-tombs of
Hong Kong's Jordan Valley, an
other in the Walled City, and a
third on two Chinese junks.
They sorted and transported
drugs and took part in the child
feeding program.
• English instruction for doc
tors: This gave Hong Kong phy
sicians better preparation for
permanent service in the British
ruled colony. Considerable time
was spent on medical terminol
ogy-
• Ronnie's Mill Student Aid
Project: At this orphanage lo
cated on Junk Bay, outside Kow
loon, two Stanford students
taught English and typing to
Chinese boys who wanted to con
tinue their schooling through
the summer. Parental dope ad
diction, sickness, or death had
left these children virtually
homeless.
• Macao: Thirty miles west of
Hong Kong, in the Portuguese
colony, two Stanford students
assisted English teachers and in
structed high-school students.
26 Last Year
Last June 23, 26 students, four
of them women, left San Fran
cisco on Japan Air Lines, two
of them had paid for the flight
through scholarship checks, but
most had earned the fare by
working as janitors or hashers.
Before arriving in Hong Kong,
they spent 13 days in Japan
and four in Taiwan.
During the six-week project,
Stanford volunteers stayed in
the Hong Kong YMCA. On
weekends, those working at Vic
toria Island would ferry across
the harbor, while those working
in mainland Kowloon would take
buses to their various projects.
"These volunteers were under
no illusions that they would
save Hong Kong in a few
weeks," Clark said. "They hoped
to spread intercultural under
standing and experience person
al growth."
Character Change
Although the various members
had different reasons for volun
teering, almost all can recount
some experience that was more
than a reward — an experience
usually brief and undramatic.
Pat Mc Dermid, a sophomore
volunteer on the summer school
staff of Promise, Inc., says that
Hong Kong students had never
been taught to read poetry. "I
had to teach them that it was
not a sin to interpret literature,"
he recalls. Mc Dermid went on
to describe his lecture on "Fern
Hill." "I wrote the first stanza
on the board," he said, "and by
the next day they'd memorized
it."
Bill Callison, another sopho
more, tells how volunteers
achieved personal contacts with
their students. During the Eng
lish evening classes, he had
made friends with an engineer

who had left Red China.
During the sessions of the
roof-top schools he had also felt
close to many of the 3rd, 4th,
and sth graders. The small pu
pils especially inspired him sev
eral times. "It happened," he

says, "when one would catch
one and make fantastic efforts
to communicate in the little Eng
lish he knew."
John Tracy worked at the Ron
nie's Mill Orphanage, an hour
away from Kowloon. Along

with project member Mike Hef
fert, he organized soccer and
basketball games and taught
both typing and English. The
two lived in a solid, adequate
cement shack on Junk Bay.
When questioned about hi s
motives for going to Hong
Kong, Tracy replied that he had
nothing more than a general de
sire to contribute. "Now it's
hard adjusting to academic life
and not being able to help peo
ple," he said.
This Year
Applications for this June's
project are available at the lIR
The deadline is Saturday, Feb.
19. VIA, which has its own board
of trustees, will form a selec
tion committee made up of past
volunteers. About half of VlA's
funds will be used to help Stan
ford students pay for the trip.
As Dr. Clark explained, the
volunteers do not think they
have revolutionized Asia with
Western love. The project has,
however, brought about lasting,
and sometimes drastic changes
in many of the volunteers and
many of the Asians who were
helped.
