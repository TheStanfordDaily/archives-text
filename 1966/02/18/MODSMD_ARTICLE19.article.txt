# Keio Students To Arrive Here
## 
### 
Ten Japanese students from
Tokyo's Keio University arrive
tomorrow as part of a unique
foreign student exchange pro
gram which brings Japanese
students to the Stanford cam
pus for the spring and sends
Stanford students to Japan for
the summer. According to Mar
ty Kuehnert, chairman of the
llRsponsored Keio Committee,
this is the only entirely student
run program in the United
States.
The Japanese students will be
met by ten Stanford students
who have been chosen to spend
two months in Japan this sum
mer as part of the program and

who will be living with the fami
lies of Keio students.
The two month exchange is
essentially cultural, offering no
academic credit. The program is
aimed at establishing a greater
understanding between Japan
and the United States.
Live in Families
During the next month the
Japanese students will live with
families from St. Bede's Church
in Ladera Heights and are to be
treated just as a member of the
family.
A trip to Southern California
with Stanford students has been
planned for spring vacation.
Kuehnert noted that the ex
change students have expressed
special interest in seeing Disney
land.
Returning to Stanford after
the break, they will live on cam
pus for the first month of spring
quarter. The boys will be guesrts
of fraternities and eating clubs,
while the girls will be housed in
dormitories. ASSU is financing
the girls' stay.
During their month on cam
pus, the Keio exchange students
will audit courses in their major
and take intensive instruction
in English conversation under
Professor Clara Bush of the
Speech and Drama Department.
Night in Japan
At the end of the nine-week
program, the Japanese students
will present "An Evening in Ja
pan" which will be open to the
Stanford community. Last year,

three hundred people enjoyed a
Japanese dinner and viewed
demonstrations of the tea cere
mony and of karate on "Japan
Night."
Stanford's Keio Committee
also sponsors a year's exchange
program in which one student
from each university takes a
full academic load in the other
university. The Keio participant
is one of three annual ASSU
scholars. This year's Keio schol
ar, Hidey Hirota, lives at the
Kappa Sigma house and will
graduate from Stanford in the
spring.
The thirty-five member Keio
Committee is a self-perpetuating
group. Former exchange partici
pants are responsible for the se
lection both of Stanford's year
scholar and its summer ex
change participants.
Selected on Interest
The summer exchange stu
dents are selected solely on the
basis of personality and inter
est. There are no language or
academic requirements. While
the Stanford students receive no
financial aid, transportation and
living costs are minimal.
Application for the summer
program takes place in the fall.
Next Thursday, February 24,
there will be a reception for the
Keio students at 4:15 at the I-
Center. Deans Cooper, Winbig
ler, and Snyder, and President
Sterling are expected to attend.
All members of the Stanford
community are welcome.
