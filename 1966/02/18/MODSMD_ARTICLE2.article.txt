# LASSU REVISES COMMITTEE OF 15
## New Representatives Chosen 
### JOE ROSEN BLOOM Managing Editor 
After a three-hour hassle the Legis
lature last night by a vote of 46 to
15 accepted a resolution replacing
three student representatives on the
Committee of Fifteen and making
all sudent representatives subject to

the recall of the Legislature "by a
vote of no confidence."
The purpose of the measure was,
as stated in the resolution, to cor
rect the "regrettable lack of com
munication between the members of
the Committee of Five and the Legis
lature which has caused the Commit

tee of Five to carry out its duties in
effectively."
The Committee of Five constitutes
the student representation to the
Committee of Fifteen, a combined
student, faculty and administration
board which arbitrates University
disputes.

The three new members appointed
to the Committee of Five are gradu
ate-student Tom Forstenzer, law-stu
dent Martin Gerry and Wilbur spon
sor, John Butler. They replace Mi
chael Couzens, Jennifer Watkins and
Gary Feldman, who is no longer a
registered student.
The Legislature did not replace two
other members of the Committee,
ASSU President Sandy MacKenzie
and Legislature Speaker Jay Kadane.
Student Influence
The Legislature's actions repre
sent an attempt to make student in
fluence within the Committee of Fif
teen more effective. It reflected dis
content among many Legislature
members with the progress that has
been made by that Committee.
There seemed to be wide agreement
in the Legislature to make the stu
dent representatives subject to re
call, and, despite the large margin by
which the resolution was finally
passed, the controversial issue was
the replacement of representatives.
In a meeting of the committee of
of the whole, a meeting of the entire
Legislature as a committee, where
the issue was vigorously debated, the
resolution's proponents urged that
representatives to the Committee of
Fifteen should be, as one member put
it, "effective advocates of the student
opinion."
The new representatives, it was
said, would fulfill this function,
whereas the previous representatives
would not.
The advocates of the resolution as
serted further that students should
have a strong voice in the direc
tion and management of the Univer
sity and that the Committee of Fif
teen should be the vehicle for that
Solid Resistance
Those opposed to the resolution
maintained that an "unreasonable and
pushy" stance by the students on the
Committee of Fifteen would meet
solid resistance from the faculty and
administrative members of the Com
mittee and would jeopardize all effect
ivness of the Committee.
Such a course might lead to "dis
aster," one Legislature member
warned.
In other business, the Legislature
passed unanimously a resolution com
mending the Board of Trustees for
acting to "liberalize religious policy
in regard to worship on the .Stanford
campus," but also noted that "there
seems to be ambiguity as to whether
or not the Trustee resolution applies
to Memorial Church alone."
Since one non-Christian group,
Hillel, has already expressed "strong
reservations against worshiping in
Memorial Church," the Legislature
resolved that "we hope the declara
tion would be interpreted to include
worship outside Memorial Church
where specific traditions make wor
ship in a building usually devoted to
Christian worship unacceptable."
