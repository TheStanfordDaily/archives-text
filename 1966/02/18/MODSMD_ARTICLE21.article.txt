# 'Spy From Cold' Not Frosty
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
To an audience increasingly dis
appointed by the surfeit of su
per-slick, super-spy epics, "The
Spy Who Came in From the
Cold" should come as a remark
ably compelling change of pace.
The picture, produced and di
rected by Martin Ritt, is a sub
tle, unmelodramatic study of
the dull grey actuality of coun
ter-espionage as depicted by
John LeCarre in the novel of
the same title. In Ritt's produc
tion, the actors look like people,
real people, not stylized carica
tures; the dialogue gives the il
lusion of being real, without be
ing tedious; the cinematography
and Sol Kaplan's lean but inter
esting score heighten the feel
ing of petty sordidness which in
fests even the characters' most
heroic moments.
Burton's Genius
And Richard Burton, as Brit
ish agent Alec Leamas, rekin
dles the spark of genius that has
been missing from all his movie
efforts since "Look Back in An
ger." There are no dramatic py
rotechnics. He must play a
small, cynical man caught in a
web of international squalor, a
man who does not believe in
what he is doing, but believes in
nothing else, either, and must
keep up his momentum lest he
be forced into introspection. The
portrayal is near-perfect.
The film follows the novel's
tortuous plot faithfully in most

places. Leamas, recalled from
his post as head of the Berlin
counter-espionage station, is In
structed to behave as if he had
been fired, to begin drinking ex
cessively and, generally to feign
dissipation. He will be ap
proached by the Communists, he
is told, and asked to defect to
the East.
Once in Communist hands, he
is to give them a great deal of
correct information, but also to
plant a lie which will make his
interrogators think Leamas' op
posite number, Mundt, head of
Communist counter-intelligence,
is really a Western double
agent. Mundt, a dangerous
thorn in the side of the "demo
cratic" powers, will then be de
posed, probably to be replaced
by his second-in-command, Fied
ler (Oskar Werner), a Jew de
spised by ex-Nazi Mundt.
Movie Strays From LeCarre
Leamas begins his downhill
slide, in the course of which he
meets and has an affair with a
young librarian (Claire Bloom)
who is a dedicated, romantic
Communist. The movie misses
on two coifnts here: in the nov
el, the protagonist begins to en
joy wallowing in his own degen
eration, while Burton's Leamas
is merely acting in the line of
duty. And, Claire Bloom, though
she gives her usual superlative
performance, is more attractive
than is the girl ill LeCarre's
book.

These two flaws, decidedly mi
nor, nonetheless demonstrate
the refusal on someone's part
to keep the movie consistently
at the ultimate level of mean
ness achieved in the book.
The plan proceeds smoothly—
almost too smoothly—and just
when the viewer is beginning to
be disturbed by the clockwork
like execution of the plot, he dis
covers, at the same moment as
does Leamas, that he has been
seduced, betrayed, that Leamas'
superior was using him and his
girl exactly as Leamas thought
he was using the Communists.
The conclusion of the film, taut,
fast-paced, understated and hor
rifying in its implications about
the expandability of human lives
in both physical and psycholog
ical terms, is electrifying.
No Bad Performances
There are no bad perform
ances, and, intentionally, no
hysterically dramatic ones. Wer
ner is superb, and the entire
cast, notably Peter Van Eyck
and Sam Wanamaker (whose
name sounds like a suppressed

desire) is quietly and skillfully
effective. But it is Burton's film,
and he carries it beautifully.
"The Spy Who Came in Frotn
the Cold" is primarily an enter
tainment vehicle, but a superior
one. If it makes no profound
comments about the human con
dition, it makes several telling
ones about the condition of the
myriad pawns of the Cold War.
They are pawns linked in a pet
ty chain of superior-inferior re
lationships — and each member
exploits his underlings and is
exploited by his commander.
Their common ethic is voiced by
Leamas' chief: "Just because
our countries' policies are benev
olent doesn't mean we can af
ford to be less evil than our en
emies."
olood Spy Story
Maybe—in view of that state
ment and of the fact that we
never see the end of the chain
of pawns—maybe the film says
quite a bit about the human
condition, at that. A first-rate
spy story with a message?
James Bond forfend!
And thank goodness he hasn't.
