# Comedy In 'The Great Race' Laps Field To Win 1st Place
## 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
Director Martin Rossoff was
given an unlimited budget and
Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and
Peter Falk with which to make
a funny movie. The result is
"The Great R a c e," a comedy
that is every bit as momentous
as the millions of dollars and
talent that went into the pro
duction.
The plot is reminiscent of
"Eighty Days Around the
World" and involves an automo
bile race from New York to
Paris pitting Tony Curtis as the
Great Leslie, who smiles and the
world smiles with him, against
the mean, diabolically ruthless,
child-hating Professor Fate
played by Jack Lemmon.
44 Per Cent Fewer Cavities
To set the characterization in
perspective, Leslie is the type
that will enter the toothpaste
contest and never brush his
teeth, yet still be on the side of
the 44 per cent fewer cavities—
in fact he never has had a cavity
or even bad breath. Professor
Fate is the other type who has
never beaten anyone in anything
and enters the contest to get
revenge. He brushes his teeth
eight times a day, gargling a
jigger of peroxide bleach before
bed every night. And just to
make sure that he will win, in
between brushing, he will sneak
into the other guy's bathroom
and put chocolate syrup into his
toothpaste tube. Then, as he
goes for his final dental check
up, he gets run over by a truck
and has all of his teeth smashed
out.)
Truth Vs. Treachery
To gap the parentheses and
continue with the plot, Leslie
and Fate set out from New
York and drive cross-country
through the U. S., Russia, and all
points west to the finish line in
Paris. Leslie, driving the Leslie
Special and dressed always in
immaculate white, trys to prove

that with truth, honor, and a
philanthropic savoir-faire he can
best the black-garbed villian
Professor Fate whose only as
sets are treachery, lechery, and
debauchery in that order.
Wood Best IJnbarked
Natalie Wood as the self-des
ignated Emancipator of Wom
en's Rights gives up her own
entry in the race and rides with
Leslie so that she can cover the
contest for her newspaper. Her
performance is adequate and
improves with the plot, mainly
because as the story reels her
clothes unreal. To be frank, Nat
alie Wood lacks much as an ac
tress but when cast with Lem
mon, Falk, and Curtis her in
competence is barely noticed.
Peter Falk and Keenen Wynn
play the side-kicks of Fate and
Leslie respectively. Falk espe
cially is good in his role and
really helps to distinguish Lem
mon's comic scenes from the
falderal of slapstick comedy.
In his dual role as Professor
Fate and Prince Guadiconivich,
heir to the throne of Paduogo
viashlinner, Jack Lemmon is
particularly terrific. So many
comedians leave you snoring in
the aisles, and it is not so often
the fault of the script but rather
the comedian's lack of timing.
Lemmon's lines and his expres
sions all are precisely timed to
produce the most laughable ef
fect.
Impeccable Hero
Tony Curtis' acting ability is
also somewhat limited as a rule,
but as the Great Leslie he por
trays admirably the courageous
and impecably heroic protago
nist. It is well, though, that Cur
tis is the straightman and not
the funny one.
"The Great Race" Is a perfect
ly matched marriage of comedy
past and present: it has some
thing old (the slapstick of Lau
rel and Hardy and the riotous
chase scenes), something new
(Henri Mancini's score, Jack
Lemmon, and appropriately lav
ish settings), something bor
rowed (occasional "processed"
shots with studio backdrops and
Mancini's intermittent insertion
of the old-time "chase" music)
and something blue (this re
view) !

and something blue (this re

Director Martin Rossoff was
given an unlimited budget and
Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and
Peter Falk with which to make
a funny movie. The result is
"The Great R a c e," a comedy
that is every bit as momentous
as the millions of dollars and
talent that went into the pro
duction.
The plot is reminiscent of
"Eighty Days Around the
World" and involves an automo
bile race from New York to
Paris pitting Tony Curtis as the
Great Leslie, who smiles and the

the mean, diabolically ruthless,
child-hating Professor Fate
played by Jack Lemmon.
44 Per Cent Fewer Cavities
To set the characterization in
perspective, Leslie is the type
that will enter the toothpaste
contest and never brush his
teeth, yet still be on the side of
the 44 per cent fewer cavities—
in fact he never has had a cavity
or even bad breath. Professor
Fate is the other type who has
never beaten anyone in anything
and enters the contest to get
revenge. He brushes his teeth
eight times a day, gargling a
jigger of peroxide bleach before
bed every night. And just to
make sure that he will win, in
between brushing, he will sneak
into the other guy's bathroom
and put chocolate syrup into his
toothpaste tube. Then, as he
goes for his final dental check
up, he gets run over by a truck
and has all of his teeth smashed
out.)
Truth Vs. Treachery
To gap the parentheses and
continue with the plot, Leslie
and Fate set out from New
York and drive cross-country
through the U. S., Russia, and all
points west to the finish line in
Paris. Leslie, driving the Leslie
Special and dressed always in
immaculate white, trys to prove

that with truth, honor, and a
philanthropic savoir-faire he can
best the black-garbed villian
Professor Fate whose only as
sets are treachery, lechery, and
debauchery in that order.
Wood Best IJnbarked
Natalie Wood as the self-des
ignated Emancipator of Wom
en's Rights gives up her own
entry in the race and rides with
Leslie so that she can cover the
contest for her newspaper. Her
performance is adequate and
improves with the plot, mainly
because as the story reels her
clothes unreal. To be frank, Nat
alie Wood lacks much as an ac
tress but when cast with Lem
mon, Falk, and Curtis her in
competence is barely noticed.
Peter Falk and Keenen Wynn
play the side-kicks of Fate and
Leslie respectively. Falk espe
cially is good in his role and
really helps to distinguish Lem
mon's comic scenes from the
falderal of slapstick comedy.
In his dual role as Professor
Fate and Prince Guadiconivich,
heir to the throne of Paduogo
viashlinner, Jack Lemmon is
particularly terrific. So many
comedians leave you snoring in
the aisles, and it is not so often
the fault of the script but rather
the comedian's lack of timing.
Lemmon's lines and his expres
sions all are precisely timed to
produce the most laughable ef
fect.
Impeccable Hero
Tony Curtis' acting ability is
also somewhat limited as a rule,
but as the Great Leslie he por
trays admirably the courageous
and impecably heroic protago
nist. It is well, though, that Cur
tis is the straightman and not
the funny one.
"The Great Race" Is a perfect
ly matched marriage of comedy
past and present: it has some
