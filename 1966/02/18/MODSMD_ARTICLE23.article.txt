THEATER
Ram's Head will present Lysistrata at 8:30 tonight and tomorrow
evening in the Little Theater, and in a matinee at 2:30 on Sunday.
The production will continue Thursday through Saturday. Twelfth
Night will be presented by the Speech and Drama Department Tues
day through Saturday in Tresidder Large lounge (tickets are on
sale at Tresidder Box Office at 75c.)
FILMS
An American In Paris is slated for tonight's Tresidder film.
Awarded the Best Picture of the Year in 1951, this film incorporates
a 20 minute ballet sequence and hopefully establishes dance as more
than a background for the musical sing fest.
Tresidder features The Music Room in its Saturday Film Series.
You see, the story goes like this: there's this Indian who can't
forget about all the parties that Geronimo threw in his hayday.
This curse of memory leads to his downfall but, and I want to make
this most emphatic, kindles his spiritual rebirth.
A double gruesome haunts the Sunday Flicks in the guise of
The Horror Chambers of Dr. Fanstus and The Vampire. A prize
of fricaseed Transylvanian eggplant, the only known staple food
of vampires, will be awarded to the first girl bitten on the neck
during the movie.
The International Film Discussion Series will present Road To
Life, a Russian production, on Wednesday at the I-Center.
Tom Jones and Irma La Douce have returned to our hamlet and
are now featured at the Bijou. If you have missed either of these
films, it is simply a must that you go. Believe me, what Tom
doesn't have Irma does have.
CONCERTS
The Stanford Concert Band and the Wind Ensemble will present
a concert of contemporary wind music this Sunday at 3:30 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel. On Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. the Wolfgang Von Karajan
Organ Ensemble will present a concert in Memorial Auditorium.
