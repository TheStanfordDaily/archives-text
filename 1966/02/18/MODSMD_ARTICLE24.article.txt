# FACE WASHINGTON, WSU
## Roundballers Seek 'Groove' 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
Stanford's Indians, sporting a
4-4 league mark, are on the war
path again this weekend in the
hope of salvaging a successful
season. The Braves play host to
Washington University on Fri
day and Washington State on
Saturday.
By virtue of last weekend's
unsuccessful trip to Oregon,
where they dropped one contest
to Oregon and a crucial one to
Oregon State, the Indians are
now down to fourth place in the
AAWU.
Knocking down the two teams
from Washington could put
Stanford back into the spot
light, but that's easier said than
done. Although both opponents
are lower on the conference

Stanford's frosh and varsity
track teams will begin their sea
son tomorrow morning at 10:00
In Stanford's Stadium. Both
teams have been split up into
two supposedly even squads the
"reds" and the "whites" who
will compete against each other.

standings than the Indians,
Washington at 2-6 and WSU at
3-5, they're no pushovers.
Friday night's game against
the Huskies does not pose too
big a threat to the Indians,
Washington was stomped last
weekend by UCLA, 100-71, but
the fact that they scored that
high shows that they've got po
tential. The loss put them in sev
enth place just ahead of rear
guard Cal.
WSU Tilt Tighter
The Washington State tilt
should be tighter. The Cougars
have just finished two succes
sive weekends of play against
the southern schools. Two weeks
ago they defeated both UCLA,

84-83, and USC 75-62. This past
series they lost by fairly close
scores, bowing to UCLA, 61-88,
and being edged by USC, 76-75.
The Cougars boast two potent
sophomore stars, center Jim
McKean and guard Ray Stein.
McKean, who is their leading
scorer with 323 points in 20
games for a 16.2 average, held
the spotlight last weekend. He
tallied 40 points and grabbed 21
rebounds in the series.
Washington State also owns

two good marksmen in forward
Dennis Kloke and guard Tom
Tommervik. Kloke is averaging
13.8 per game, and Tommervik
is at 13.4.
Field Goal Stats High
In the conference field goal
stats the Cougars are second
only to league leader Oregon
State. They have netted 197 out
of 440 attempts, giving them a
.448 pet. Stanford is close behind
with 201 field goals in 453 tries
and a .444 pet.

The Cougars boast speed and
quickness and should be a good
match for Stanford's efficient
defense. They are sixth in the
league with a 3-5 mark, but are
12-8 overall.
Stanford's elusive guard, Gary
Petersmeyer, is back in action
this weekend after missing last
week's couple because of an in
jured ankle. The Indians felt his
loss last week in Oregon, but
this week he'll be back up to
par.
