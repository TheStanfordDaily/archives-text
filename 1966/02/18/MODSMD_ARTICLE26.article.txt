# Tribe Baseball Squad To Host USF, Minor League All-Stars
## 
### 
The supposedly powerful
Stanford Baseball team will be
looking to break out of the dol
drums this weekend against USF
Friday at 3:00 p.m. and the Mi
nor League All-Stars Saturday
at 2:00 p.m.
Both games are in Sunken
Diamond.
The varsity got two hits
against the Frosh last Saturday
and managed just about the
same amount against Cal State
at Hayward Tuesday.

The Hayward game ended in
a 3-3 tie when the game was
called on account of darkness.
The seventh inning was typi
cal of the Stanford effort up at
the plate. Stanford loaded the
bases, scored two runs on wild
pitches, and they left three men
stranded.
Coach Dutch Fehring will still
be experimenting and trying out
his pitchers this weekend. But
his probable starting line-up
will be similar to what it has

been the last two games.
The probables are Mike Scho
maker (left field), Ron Yett
(right field), Steve Hovley (cen
terficld), Jim Hibbs (catcher),
Pete Middlekauff (first base),
Dick Swan (second base), Frank
Duffy (shortstop), Tom Melzer
(third base), and the pitcher's
spot.
The Frosh team will also be
playing this weekend. Friday
afternoon at 3:00 p.m., they play
the San Jose State frosh at San
