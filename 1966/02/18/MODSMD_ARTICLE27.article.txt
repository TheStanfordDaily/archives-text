# Stanford Wrestlers Tackle Pomona, SFS Tournament
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Indian wrestling squad,
after a devastating though in
structive weekend in Washing
ton and Oregon, meets tamer
foes this week. The Cards host
Cal Poly at Pomona at 2:00 in
the Encina Gym.
Tomorrow, the gfapplers par
ticipate in the San Francisco
State Tournament with seven
other teams.
Stanford won only one of
four meets last weekend, but
the trip proved worthwhile in
light of the experience gained.
The Cards will have the
chance to try out some of their
newly inculcated know-how. Cal
Poly has been unimpressive in
earlier outings this season.

The Indians have humbled, ei
ther in dual meet competition or
in the Nor Cal Invitational, the
majority of the teams in the SF
State tournament.
Frosh Excel in Tourney

AAU tournament while the var

sentatives wrestled in the tour
