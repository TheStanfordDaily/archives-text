# USC And UCLA Test Swimmers
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity swimmers
put a flashy 8-0 season record to
the most severe of tests this
weekend. The tankers jump into
USC's pool this afternoon, hop
ing to upset the NCAA cham
pions. Tomorrow, the Indians
face an impressive UCLA naval
aggregation.

The Stanford freshman squad,
fresh from last weekend's rec
ord-setting spree, host Long
Beach City College at 2:00 p.m.
in the Encina Pool. The Papoos
es will be gunning for a few
more NCAA freshman records,
having sunk two already.
Southern California burst into
the national swimming scene in
a big way two years ago. The
Trojans upset the "unbeatable"
Indiana and swam past a strong
Yale contingent to carry away
the NCAA championship. Last
season, USC staged a repeat per
formance.
USC has won every one of its
last 65 dual meets and have
brought the AAWU crown back

to Troy every year since 1961.
USC has never faced, however,
a Stanford team as strong as the
contingent that flies to Los An
geles this morning.
Southern Cal has Its share of
the world's great swimmers. Roy
Saari won a gold and a silver
medal in the Olympics. Saari
holds five of 19 NCAA records,
winning three events in the
Championships last year.
Sandy Gilchrest, middle dis
tance freestyler, breaststrokers
Bill Craig and Wayne Anderson,
and sprinter-IM man Rich Mc-
Geagh are the remainder of
USC's Olympic complement.
Trojarui Deep
Mike Caretto, Dean Wille
ford, Chuck Milam, and Mike

Siebert have hurt opponents
from every corner of the line
up. All of these Trojans, with
the exception of sophomore Sie
bert, placed well in the Nationals
last winter.
USC led the conference stand
ings in nine of 11 events last
week—Roy Saari on top of four.
But it takes second places to
win swimming meets, and a sin
gle competitor can swim only
in two events and a relay.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
anticipates an exceedingly close
meet with the Trojans. To upset
USC would require top perform
ances from every man in the In
dian lineup, and even then it
would be eight.
Mike Wall will hold the fort
in the distance freestyle events.

Bob Momsen will be in hot wa
ter with USC's two breast
strokers.
Mark Parmely and Jim Laney
could swim anywhere in the line
up, depending on the need. Diver

The Stanford varsity golf
team selected Loy Martin, a
junior letterinan from Tulsa, as
its 1966 captain. Greg Pitzer of
Los Angeles was chosen to lead
the Papoose divoteers.

Bill Freeman has his work cut
out for him on the springboard.
Doug Miller will go against
an array of swift SC butterfli
ers. Gary Sheerer will play the
role of the versatile freestyler
—pick your distance. Bill Meyer
and Bill Derrig will blast out in
the sprints. Captain Bill Schu
bach will take out the medley re
lay next to USC's backstroker.
USC beat UCLA, 70-25, earlier
this season, but Gaughran sees
the Bruins as stronger than the
lopsided score indicates. Stan
ford meets UCLA Saturday af
ternoon in what should be the
tribe's second grueling encoun
ter of the weekend.
Frosh Aim For Medley
Stanford's frosh will open
their meet this afternoon with a
shot at the NCAA freshman
record for the 400 medley relay.
Bill Kee, Dick Roth, Luis Nico
lao, and Morgan Manning will
take off to beat the existing
mark of 3:40.2 set by USC.
Later in the meet, world rec
ord holders Roth and Nicolao
will duel at 500 yards freestyle.
Bill Kee, who turned in a 2:03.1
backstroke, best on the Coast,
will take another fling at the
event, eyes to the sky.
