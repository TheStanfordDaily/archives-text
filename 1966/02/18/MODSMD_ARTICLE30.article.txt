# Gymnasts Head South To Threaten Trojans, Gauchos
## 
### 
The Indian Gymnasts take to
the air this weekend for a trip
to Los Angeles to meet USC and
UCSB and hope to remain aloft
long enough for high-flying to
become part of their system.
Bob Cook, Pete Gibson, Bob
Smith, and Bill Fisher will ac
company coach John Gilmore on
the jaunt — the most men the
Tribe has competed with since
the first meet of the season.
Gibson, however, still suffers
from a sore ankle and will not
be able to participate in the free
exercise event. Fisher and Cook
will go six events apiece, Will
Smith will go two.
New Trojan Coach
The USC Trojans, sporting a

new coach in '64 Olympian Ron
Barreck, have a depth problem
similar to Stanford's, but have
scored 160 points against Long
Beach State. Backbone of the
squad is All - Around man Le
Moyne Durham, who has scored
as high as 50.20 points for the
six events. Durham ranks high
on the coast with an 8.27 in the
high bar.
The meet promises to be a
very close one between the Tro
jans and UCSB. The Gauchos
have to their credit a 158-point
output, just two off USC's best.
Highlight of the Gaucho acro
batic attack is a brother duo
named Haven and Hillary Sil
ver.
