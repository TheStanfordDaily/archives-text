# A 						Good Beginning

The Board of Trustees finally caught up with
the mid-Twentieth Century yesterday in voting
to allow an expansion of religious worship ser
vices on the Stanford campus. We sincerely
congratulate the Board on its action, and hope
that President Sterling will proceed immediate
ly to implement plans for widening of Stan
ford's religious programs.
One of the more significant aspects of yes
terday's tradition-breaking decision is the large
role that students have played in bringing it
about. Over two years ago, Daily editor Ilene
Strelitz opened a prolonged study of the prob
lem of campus worship. Later that year ASSU
President Bud Wedin commissioned a student
committee to research the existing program and
make recommendations for its improvement.
Since that time, various student groups and
committees have continued to push the issue
to the fore through in-depth studies and discus
sions, with the result that Stanford's adminis
tration, and now the Board of Trustees, have
seen fits to seek an acceptable solution. Deter
mination and patience do pay off.
There is at least one ambiguity in yesterday's
decision which we hope the proper authorities
will take steps to clarify as soon as possible.
The Board's resolution provides for worship
services on a regular schedule "in Memorial
Church." Rabbi Charles Familant, who is di
rector of the campus Hillel Foundation, has
previously stated that Jane Stanford's memo
rial to her husband and God is, because of its

Christian symbolism, an unacceptable setting
for Jewish services. If a true conflict exists on
this point, then Stanford has made no real
progress. However, reliable sources have told
us that the conflict is not a serious one, and
can be resolved. We hope that such is the case.
In line with the general conservatism of the
Board, the Trustees' resolution is an extremely
cautious one. The expanded program is viewed
by the Board as an experiment through which
the University can gain the experience needed
"for consideration of an application to the
courts for appropriate amendment to the pro
visions of the Founding Grant." This seems to
represent an overly-cautious concern that free
dom of worship will bring problems. Tradi
tionally, however, it has been American uni
versities without, rather than with freedom of
worship that have been subject to religious con
flicts. We think that Stanford will prove to be
no different.
Yesterday's decision signifies Stanford's of
ficial entry into the current world-wide eccu
menical movement. As such, it is a good be
ginning. It is now incumbent upon the Uni
versity to carry through with a bold program
which would serve the needs of all Stanford
students.
Once again, we congratulate the Board of
Trustees on its step into the present. It is a
much-needed and welcome reassurance that
Stanford truly does recognize the right of every
human being to his own beliefs.
