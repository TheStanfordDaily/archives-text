## A
						Committee Is Formed To Promote True Justice 
### Art Buchwald 
The trial of the two Soviet
writers, Yuli Daniel and Andrei
Sinyavsky, ended as famous
show trials always do. The de
fendants were found guilty of
writing anti-Soviet propaganda
and were sentenced to five and
seven years, respectively.
There has been a great deal
of protest in world-wide intel
lectual circles over the trial, and
many famous writers have open
ly sympathized with the convict
ed writers. But little concern
has been shown towards the
leading judge, the prosecutor,
and the government witnesses
who sent Daniel and Sinyavsky
away.
Trouble Coming
in the interests of justice, I
am starting a defense fund for
these people, who in all likeli
hood will be in trouble them
selves very soon.
This is why.
Whenever you have a trial of
this sort in the Soviet Union,
the judge, the prosecutor, and
the government witnesses are
ruthless in their denunciation of
the defendants. The Soviet press
also joins in on the attack and
for a while praise is heaped on
all the people who were respon
sible for sending the "traitors"
away.
This is all well and good. But
the climate keeps changing un
der the Soviet system, and to
day's patriots are tomorrow's
traitors and vice-versa.
Five years from now it's quite
possible that someone high up
in the government will decide
that the charges were rigged,
and should have never taken
place.
There will be a call for the
"rehabilitation" of the two writ
ers, who will be revealed as he
roes of the Soviet Union rather
than as enemies of the state.
They will be pardoned and each
given compensation and a dacha
in the country.

But under the Soviet system,
in order to rehabilitate some
one who has been unjustly tried,
you must find the people re
sponsible for trying them and
punish them for the miscarriage
of justice.
So it looks like the judge, Lev
Smirnov, and the prosecutor,
Oleg Tyomushkin, and the two
chief government witnesses, So
viet writers Zoya Kedrina and
Arkady Vasilyev, are the people
we must worry about. If every
thing goes according to plan,
they'll all be in the dock them
selves for sending Daniel and
Sinyavsky to prison.
I don't know any of these
learned men, but I'm sure there
was no malice in their prosecu
tion of the case. My committee
is asking for clemency now for
the judge, the prosecutor, and
the government witnesses on
the grounds that they did what
they did in order to keep their
jobs.
How could they know that in
five years from now Daniel's
and Sinyavsky's criticism of the
Soviet Union would be consid
ered justified?
Atmosphere
We are also asking that the
Soviet Union not be too
harsh on the Soviet newspaper
men who covered the trial and
wrote all those nasty things
about the two writers. They
were only caught up in the at
mosphere of the time.
We know that all the people
involved with sending Daniel
and Sinyavsky to jail will have
to be punished, but we hope this
plea from our committee will
be taken into consideration. If
the judge got five years, the
prosecutor five years, and the
two writers, Kedrina and Vasil
yev, were kicked out of the writ
er's union, we believe the pur
poses of Soviet justice will have
been served.
