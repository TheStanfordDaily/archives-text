# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Blue, White And Red 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We are shocked by the inane
and pretentious letter of Mr. J.
Delacroix in The Daily February
16. He seems to incarnate some
of the least attractive traits of
some types of French personali
ty, e.g. acute chauvinism, a
sense of innate superiority over
all non-Frenchmen, bad taste
and a complete lack of diploma
cy or appreciation toward his
host country.
French "intellectuals" like Mr.
Delacroix pride themselves on
being, in all things, logical and
Cartesian. But there is at least
one area where this "Cartesian
ism" seems to vanish: Prejudice
concerning America and Ameri
cans, so deeply rooted that it
resists actual "seeing for one
self," even in someone now re
ceiving part of his basic educa
tion in this country. Mr. Dela
croix spouts old and tired French
cliches about American adult
childishness; he makes it a point
to specify that he is Parisian,
but to us he displays a provin
cial mentality, that of ready
made ideas. But we are certain
that he lacks neither smooth
Parisian charm nor the pro
found wit traditionally associ
ated with Paris, even though in
his case it is of a childish level.
He will eventually grow up, and
perhaps learn to spread good
will for France. ,
Mr. Delacroix, what do you
suppose would happen to any
foreigner who voiced or pub
lished feelings like yours about
France, in France?

Editor, The Daily:
It was a pleasure to read Miss
Hartel's letter of Feb. 14. She
appears to be mature and artic
ulate to a degree that one unfor
tunately does not expect of a
freshman.
I wish to comment that one
statement she made is largely
irrelevant to the main content
of her letter, but is interesting
in its own right. She stated that
she is not a conservative, but
later implied that she believes
in principles and that an indi

vidual should make his own de
cisions and assume responsibil
ity for them and for his actions.
It is only fair to warn you,
Miss Hartel, that such attitudes
as these will soon cause you to
he separated from the liberal
ranks. If you are consistent in
maintaining these opinions you
will soon find yourself being
labeled a conservative by those
who delight in pinning labels
on people, and I believe as you
come to realize the present
meaning of the word, you won't
mind it a bit. Congratulations.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Deborah Hartel's letter
in The Daily February 14 is ex
emplary of the sort of confusion
common to people trying to live
under two different ethical sys
tems simultaneously. On the

one hand, Miss Hartel obviously
respects the integrity of the in
dividual and his right to make
his own moral judgements. But
on the other hand she can't con
ceive of a situation in which so
ciety has recognized this right
and responsibility. The result of
this unfortunate fusion is a
maze of contradictions.
When Miss Hartel states that
the goals of the Sexual Rights
Forum are "all for the purpose
of eliminating the responsibility
of making choices," she doesn't
seem to realize that moral
choices can exist independently
of the law. By advocating abol
ishment of many of the laws re
garding sex, the Sexual Rights
Forum joins a group of serious
organizations whose goal is to
foster greater responsibility.
Perhaps those who advocate the
abolishment of sex laws can be
accused of having a too-idealistic
view of the integrity and re

spcmsibijity of the individual,
but they certainly can't be ac
cused of seeking "the easy way
out."
Yet Miss Hartel says that this
attitude toward sex laws is one
of our society's "easy answers."
On the contrary, there are few
things more difficult than the
painful process of forming one's
own morality. It is easier just to
accept society's morality, but it
is not intellectually honest to do
so without questioning it. This
process of questioning is made
rather meaningless by our pres
ent sex laws.
The "easy way out" is not to
be found in the activities of
groups such as the Sexual
Rights Forum. (Witness the in
tended slurs on Jan Handke's
character.) The easy way out is
to happily bury one's head in
the sand and wait for "a new
attitude" to come drifting down
in the morning mist.

Re: Mr. Bonine's Conservative
Myth (The Daily, February 16:
I should like to take issue
with some of the statements
and assumptions of Mr. Bonine's
observations. Having taught
Western Civ for two years I
can assure him that the West
ern Civ staff is far from uni
formally liberal. No doubt the
"conservatives" on the staff re
sent his confusion. He complains
about a lack of conservatives on
the Syllabus. Let me cite some
conservatives from last year's
syllabus for the period 1789 to
the present—Burke, Chateaubri
and, Spencer, Treitschke. Dis
raeli, Comte, Teddy Roosevelt,
the fascist Barbu, Ortega y Gas
set, and Hayek. Adam Smith
and Matthews were apologists
for capit a 1 is m and so was
Keynes; Milland de Toqueville
were critics of liberalism. Per
haps we will be excused for put
ting in Robespierre, Marx, Len
in and Trotsky, but they illus
trate the French and Russian
Revolutions.
Mr. Bonine and I agree with
Professor Robert MacAfee
Brown that the University
should be a marketplace of
ideas. Why does not Mr. Bonine
also demand chairs for Social
ists and Communists and really
let the students shop around?
European Universities do just
this. Secondly, since the major
ity of Stanford students, par
ticularly freshmen, are already
indoctrinated at home in the
conservative persuasian, then a
"liberal" faculty is just what is
needed to (quoting Mr. Bohine)
at least encourage a few stu
dents "to ask searching ques
tions which are rarely asked
now. They would really be
forced to think their convic
tions."

Perhaps those who advocate the

Yet Miss Hartel says that this

On the contrary, there are few
things more difficult than the

accept society's morality, but it
is not intellectually honest to do
so without questioning it. This
process of questioning is made
rather meaningless by our pres

The "easy way out" is not to

Re: Mr. Bonine's Conservative

I should like to take issue
with some of the statements

observations. Having taught
Western Civ for two years I
can assure him that the West
ern Civ staff is far from uni
formally liberal. No doubt the
"conservatives" on the staff re
sent his confusion. He complains
about a lack of conservatives on
the Syllabus. Let me cite some
conservatives from last year's
syllabus for the period 1789 to
the present—Burke, Chateaubri
and, Spencer, Treitschke. Dis
raeli, Comte, Teddy Roosevelt,
the fascist Barbu, Ortega y Gas
set, and Hayek. Adam Smith
and Matthews were apologists
for capit a 1 is m and so was
Keynes; Milland de Toqueville
were critics of liberalism. Per
haps we will be excused for put
ting in Robespierre, Marx, Len
in and Trotsky, but they illus
trate the French and Russian
Revolutions.
Mr. Bonine and I agree with
Professor Robert MacAfee
Brown that the University
should be a marketplace of
ideas. Why does not Mr. Bonine
also demand chairs for Social
ists and Communists and really
let the students shop around?
European Universities do just
this. Secondly, since the major

ticularly freshmen, are already
indoctrinated at home in the
conservative persuasian, then a
"liberal" faculty is just what is
needed to (quoting Mr. Bohine)
at least encourage a few stu

now. They would really be

We are shocked by the inane
and pretentious letter of Mr. J.
Delacroix in The Daily February
16. He seems to incarnate some
of the least attractive traits of
some types of French personali
ty, e.g. acute chauvinism, a
sense of innate superiority over
all non-Frenchmen, bad taste
and a complete lack of diploma
cy or appreciation toward his
host country.
French "intellectuals" like Mr.
Delacroix pride themselves on
being, in all things, logical and
Cartesian. But there is at least
one area where this "Cartesian
ism" seems to vanish: Prejudice
concerning America and Ameri
cans, so deeply rooted that it
resists actual "seeing for one
self," even in someone now re
ceiving part of his basic educa
tion in this country. Mr. Dela
croix spouts old and tired French
cliches about American adult
childishness; he makes it a point
to specify that he is Parisian,
but to us he displays a provin
cial mentality, that of ready
made ideas. But we are certain
that he lacks neither smooth
Parisian charm nor the pro
found wit traditionally associ
ated with Paris, even though in
his case it is of a childish level.
He will eventually grow up, and
perhaps learn to spread good
will for France. ,

It was a pleasure to read Miss

appears to be mature and artic
ulate to a degree that one unfor
tunately does not expect of a

I wish to comment that one
statement she made is largely
irrelevant to the main content
of her letter, but is interesting
in its own right. She stated that
she is not a conservative, but
later implied that she believes
in principles and that an indi

vidual should make his own de
cisions and assume responsibil
ity for them and for his actions.
It is only fair to warn you,
Miss Hartel, that such attitudes
as these will soon cause you to
he separated from the liberal

will soon find yourself being
labeled a conservative by those

croix spouts old and tired French

childishness; he makes it a point
to specify that he is Parisian,

that he lacks neither smooth
Parisian charm nor the pro

his case it is of a childish level.
He will eventually grow up, and
perhaps learn to spread good

It was a pleasure to read Miss
Hartel's letter of Feb. 14. She
appears to be mature and artic
ulate to a degree that one unfor
tunately does not expect of a
freshman.
I wish to comment that one
statement she made is largely
irrelevant to the main content
of her letter, but is interesting
in its own right. She stated that
she is not a conservative, but
later implied that she believes
in principles and that an indi

vidual should make his own de
cisions and assume responsibil
ity for them and for his actions.
It is only fair to warn you,
Miss Hartel, that such attitudes
as these will soon cause you to
he separated from the liberal
ranks. If you are consistent in
maintaining these opinions you
will soon find yourself being
labeled a conservative by those
who delight in pinning labels
on people, and I believe as you
come to realize the present
meaning of the word, you won't
mind it a bit. Congratulations.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Deborah Hartel's letter
in The Daily February 14 is ex
emplary of the sort of confusion
common to people trying to live
under two different ethical sys
tems simultaneously. On the

one hand, Miss Hartel obviously
respects the integrity of the in
dividual and his right to make
his own moral judgements. But
on the other hand she can't con
ceive of a situation in which so
ciety has recognized this right
and responsibility. The result of
this unfortunate fusion is a
maze of contradictions.
When Miss Hartel states that
the goals of the Sexual Rights
Forum are "all for the purpose
of eliminating the responsibility
of making choices," she doesn't
seem to realize that moral
choices can exist independently
of the law. By advocating abol
ishment of many of the laws re
garding sex, the Sexual Rights
Forum joins a group of serious
organizations whose goal is to
foster greater responsibility.
Perhaps those who advocate the
abolishment of sex laws can be
accused of having a too-idealistic
view of the integrity and re

spcmsibijity of the individual,
but they certainly can't be ac
cused of seeking "the easy way
out."
Yet Miss Hartel says that this
attitude toward sex laws is one
of our society's "easy answers."
On the contrary, there are few
things more difficult than the
painful process of forming one's
own morality. It is easier just to
accept society's morality, but it
is not intellectually honest to do
so without questioning it. This
process of questioning is made
rather meaningless by our pres
ent sex laws.
The "easy way out" is not to
be found in the activities of
groups such as the Sexual
Rights Forum. (Witness the in
tended slurs on Jan Handke's
character.) The easy way out is
to happily bury one's head in
the sand and wait for "a new
attitude" to come drifting down
in the morning mist.

Re: Mr. Bonine's Conservative

I should like to take issue
with some of the statements
and assumptions of Mr. Bonine's
observations. Having taught
Western Civ for two years I
can assure him that the West
ern Civ staff is far from uni
formally liberal. No doubt the
"conservatives" on the staff re
sent his confusion. He complains
about a lack of conservatives on
the Syllabus. Let me cite some
conservatives from last year's
syllabus for the period 1789 to
the present—Burke, Chateaubri
and, Spencer, Treitschke. Dis
raeli, Comte, Teddy Roosevelt,
the fascist Barbu, Ortega y Gas
set, and Hayek. Adam Smith
and Matthews were apologists
for capit a 1 is m and so was
Keynes; Milland de Toqueville
were critics of liberalism. Per
haps we will be excused for put
ting in Robespierre, Marx, Len
in and Trotsky, but they illus
trate the French and Russian
Revolutions.
Mr. Bonine and I agree with
Professor Robert MacAfee
Brown that the University
should be a marketplace of
ideas. Why does not Mr. Bonine
also demand chairs for Social
ists and Communists and really
let the students shop around?
European Universities do just
this. Secondly, since the major
ity of Stanford students, par
ticularly freshmen, are already
indoctrinated at home in the
conservative persuasian, then a
"liberal" faculty is just what is
needed to (quoting Mr. Bohine)
at least encourage a few stu

now. They would really be
forced to think their convic

rather meaningless by our pres
ent sex laws.
The "easy way out" is not to
be found in the activities of
groups such as the Sexual
Rights Forum. (Witness the in
tended slurs on Jan Handke's
character.) The easy way out is
to happily bury one's head in
the sand and wait for "a new
attitude" to come drifting down
in the morning mist.

Editor, The Daily:
We are shocked by the inane
and pretentious letter of Mr. J.
Delacroix in The Daily February
16. He seems to incarnate some
of the least attractive traits of
some types of French personali
ty, e.g. acute chauvinism, a
sense of innate superiority over
all non-Frenchmen, bad taste
and a complete lack of diploma
cy or appreciation toward his
host country.
French "intellectuals" like Mr.
Delacroix pride themselves on
being, in all things, logical and
Cartesian. But there is at least
one area where this "Cartesian
ism" seems to vanish: Prejudice
concerning America and Ameri
cans, so deeply rooted that it
resists actual "seeing for one
self," even in someone now re
ceiving part of his basic educa
tion in this country. Mr. Dela
croix spouts old and tired French
cliches about American adult
childishness; he makes it a point
to specify that he is Parisian,
but to us he displays a provin
cial mentality, that of ready
made ideas. But we are certain
that he lacks neither smooth
Parisian charm nor the pro
found wit traditionally associ
ated with Paris, even though in
his case it is of a childish level.
He will eventually grow up, and
perhaps learn to spread good
will for France. ,
Mr. Delacroix, what do you
suppose would happen to any
foreigner who voiced or pub
lished feelings like yours about
France, in France?

Editor, The Daily:
It was a pleasure to read Miss
Hartel's letter of Feb. 14. She
appears to be mature and artic
ulate to a degree that one unfor
tunately does not expect of a
freshman.
I wish to comment that one
statement she made is largely
irrelevant to the main content
of her letter, but is interesting
in its own right. She stated that
she is not a conservative, but
later implied that she believes
in principles and that an indi

vidual should make his own de
cisions and assume responsibil
ity for them and for his actions.
It is only fair to warn you,
Miss Hartel, that such attitudes
as these will soon cause you to
he separated from the liberal
ranks. If you are consistent in
maintaining these opinions you
will soon find yourself being
labeled a conservative by those
who delight in pinning labels
on people, and I believe as you
come to realize the present
meaning of the word, you won't
mind it a bit. Congratulations.

• The Easy Way
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Deborah Hartel's letter
in The Daily February 14 is ex
emplary of the sort of confusion
common to people trying to live
under two different ethical sys
tems simultaneously. On the

one hand, Miss Hartel obviously
respects the integrity of the in
dividual and his right to make
his own moral judgements. But
on the other hand she can't con
ceive of a situation in which so
ciety has recognized this right
and responsibility. The result of
this unfortunate fusion is a
maze of contradictions.
When Miss Hartel states that
the goals of the Sexual Rights
Forum are "all for the purpose
of eliminating the responsibility
of making choices," she doesn't
seem to realize that moral
choices can exist independently
of the law. By advocating abol
ishment of many of the laws re
garding sex, the Sexual Rights
Forum joins a group of serious
organizations whose goal is to
foster greater responsibility.
Perhaps those who advocate the
abolishment of sex laws can be
accused of having a too-idealistic
view of the integrity and re

spcmsibijity of the individual,
but they certainly can't be ac
cused of seeking "the easy way
out."
Yet Miss Hartel says that this
attitude toward sex laws is one
of our society's "easy answers."
On the contrary, there are few
things more difficult than the
painful process of forming one's
own morality. It is easier just to
accept society's morality, but it
is not intellectually honest to do
so without questioning it. This
process of questioning is made
rather meaningless by our pres
ent sex laws.
The "easy way out" is not to
be found in the activities of
groups such as the Sexual
Rights Forum. (Witness the in
tended slurs on Jan Handke's
character.) The easy way out is
to happily bury one's head in
the sand and wait for "a new
attitude" to come drifting down
in the morning mist.
