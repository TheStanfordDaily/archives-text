# LETTER POLICY
## 
### 
The Daily is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
They must be typewritten on
Bft-space lines and double spared.
Letters should not exceed 300
words in length. Shorter letters
have a better chance of being
printed.
Ah a (general rule, unsigned
letters will not be printed, but
names will be withheld under
eertaln circumstances upon re
quest.
