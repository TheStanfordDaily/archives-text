# APPEALS BOARD REJECTED
## No Sponsor Compromise 
### 
The unresolved sponsor controversy
will be taken up by the Committee of
Fifteen when it meets today.
A compromise thought to have been
reached between Faculty Master Eric
Hutchinson and the sponsors on Feb.
11 proved Monday to be unacceptable
to Hutchinson.
This compromise provided for an
appeals committee composed of two
sponsors, one faculty resident, one
member of the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUE), and a
fifth member to be the unanimous
choice of the other committee mem
bers. The decision of this committee
was to have been final.
Hutchinson Changes Mind
On Monday the Faculty Master in
formed Head Sponsor A 1 Taylor that
he felt that CUE should have the final
say in sponsor selection.
Last Friday CUE reaffirmed its de
termination to retain the final deci
sion in all sponsor selection.
Taylor told The Daily that the Com
mittee's "legal position had been dam
aged by taking final authority away
from the Faculty Master." Earlier ar

guments had been advanced that the
Faculty Master was the necessary
sourcc of final authority, since it was
imperative that all sponsors chosen
be compatible with the Faculty Mas
ter. These arguments emphasized
that both the Faculty Master and
CUE must have final authority in
sponsor selection due to th? nature
of the University hierarchy.
Faculty Majority
According to Taylor, the sponsors
feel that the appeals committee is an
equitable, viable compromise. "The
committee provides for the participa
tion of both sponsors and CUE in the
final selection of sponsors within the
framework of a virtually inevitable
faculty majority."

Professor Philip Rhinelander, Chair
man of the Committee of Fifteen told
the Daily earlier in the week his com
mittee had been closely following the
development of the controversy.
The committee has only advisory
powers, but has proved to be instru
mental in settling campus disputes
since its inception as part of last
year's Judicial Competence Bill.
Rhinelander commented: "Our job
is not to do the work of other commit
tees already established, but to pro
vide a forum for discussion when dif
ferences occur and generally to en
courage people to consult with other
interested parties before they act and
not afterwards."
