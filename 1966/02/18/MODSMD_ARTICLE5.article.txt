# Teller Claims H-Bomb Worthless In Vietnam
## 
### 
Attacking both the indiscriminate
use of nuclear weapons and the lack
of language training of Americans in
foreign policy, Dr. Edward Teller,
physics professor at the University
of California, informally addressed
more than 60 people in the Muir
lounge last night.
Hungarian-horn Teller, willing to
speak on all topics while denying his
expert knowledge in any of them ap
plied both his protests to the war in
Vietnam.
Dr. Teller opposes use of nuclear
weapons in Vietnam not because he
fears escalation, but because he feels
they are unsuited to the guerilla war
fare being waged in Southeast Asia.
"Nuclear weapons," he said, "can
make a massive concentration of
army troops useless. But in Vietnam
we are faced with small groups whom
we can't find."
Another reason Dr. Teller offered
for not using nuclear weeapons was
that the United States mistakenly
used them in Japan in World War II
and brought on "shocks and repur
cussions."
"If we again use nuclear weapons
in anger, the opposition to us will be
a bitter fact we will have to pay for
now and in 30 years," he elaborated.

He feels however, that three uses
of nuclear weapons are necessary:
against cities in retaliation to an at
tack against us; against military tar
gets; and against incoming weapons,
that is, missile defense of our own ter
ritory.
Because he recognizes these uses of
nuclear weapons, Teller is opposed to
the nuclear test ban treaty because
"to inhibit testing would inhibit
knowledge."
Dr. Teller stated that all the United
State's mistakes in Vietnam—such as
supporting the Diem regime and then
backing his ouster and giving asylum
to the conspirators who killed him—
were due to ignorance and not ill
will.
This ignorance can be fought on
one front, he believes, if U. S. military
and diplomatic personnel were
trained in the native language.
He conceded that "economic recon
struction in the time of war is ad
mirable, but asked how we are to ac
complish it if we don't speak the lan
guage, and can't tell our friend from
our enemy.
In addition he remarked, "If you
speak the language, the Vietnamese
will not be constantly aware that you
are not one of them."

Attacking both the indiscriminate
use of nuclear weapons and the lack
of language training of Americans in
foreign policy, Dr. Edward Teller,
physics professor at the University
of California, informally addressed
more than 60 people in the Muir
lounge last night.
Hungarian-horn Teller, willing to
speak on all topics while denying his
expert knowledge in any of them ap
plied both his protests to the war in
Vietnam.
Dr. Teller opposes use of nuclear
weapons in Vietnam not because he
fears escalation, but because he feels
they are unsuited to the guerilla war
fare being waged in Southeast Asia.
"Nuclear weapons," he said, "can
make a massive concentration of
army troops useless. But in Vietnam
we are faced with small groups whom
we can't find."
Another reason Dr. Teller offered
for not using nuclear weeapons was
that the United States mistakenly
used them in Japan in World War II
and brought on "shocks and repur
cussions."
"If we again use nuclear weapons
in anger, the opposition to us will be
a bitter fact we will have to pay for
now and in 30 years," he elaborated.

He feels however, that three uses
of nuclear weapons are necessary:
against cities in retaliation to an at
tack against us; against military tar
gets; and against incoming weapons,
that is, missile defense of our own ter
ritory.
Because he recognizes these uses of
nuclear weapons, Teller is opposed to
the nuclear test ban treaty because
"to inhibit testing would inhibit
knowledge."
Dr. Teller stated that all the United
State's mistakes in Vietnam—such as
supporting the Diem regime and then
backing his ouster and giving asylum
to the conspirators who killed him—
were due to ignorance and not ill
will.
This ignorance can be fought on
one front, he believes, if U. S. military
and diplomatic personnel were
trained in the native language.
He conceded that "economic recon
struction in the time of war is ad
mirable, but asked how we are to ac
complish it if we don't speak the lan
guage, and can't tell our friend from
our enemy.
In addition he remarked, "If you
speak the language, the Vietnamese
will not be constantly aware that you
are not one of them."
