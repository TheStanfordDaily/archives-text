The Stanford University Board
of Trustees meeting; yesterday in
San Francisco approved a recom
mendation from Its Academic Af
fairs Committee, "that the Presi
dent of the University be author
ized to proceed with plans he out
lined to the Committee for expan
sion of the religious prog-ram at
Stanford.
"Under this plan, which the
President has worked out tenta
tively with the University chap-

lain and denominational ministers
serving; the student community, ar
rangements will be made for the
various denominations to hold
worship services on a regular
schedule in Memorial Church.
"It Ls anticipated that this pro
gram will enable the University to
accumulate actual experience as to
breadth and depth of interest in
campus sectarian services to be the
basis for consideration of an appli
cation to the courts for appropriate
amendment to the provisions of the
Founding- Grant."
