# Religious Policy Met With Mixed Reaction
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
The Trustee declaration was met
with a mixture of elation and reserva
tion by those most closely connected
with the effort to bring freedom of
worship to the campus.
They hailed the decision as a ma
jor step forward, but expressed
doubts as to the status of non-Chris
tian groups.
Richard Lyman, chairman of the
President's Committee on Religious
Activities, told The Dally yesterday
evening:
Lyman Encouraged
"Insofar as the Trustee's resolution
opens the way to a diversification of
opportunities for religious worship at
Stanford it is immensely encoura
ging."
"I am not yet clear in my own
mind, however, whether the fact that
the resolution speaks only of services
in Memorial Church is intended to
rule out all worship other than Chris
tian. I trust that such is not the case,
for I would find it hard to see how a
reasonable program of religious activ
ities could be developed on that re
strictive a basis."
Rabbi Charles Familant, Hillel Di
rector, expressed his concern that Jew
ishish students be allowed to worship
on campus but outside of Memorial
Church.

"While some Jewish students would
be prepared to have services in Memo
rial Church, there will always be a
certain percentage who will find the
general surroundings and symbols of
the Church incompatible with the
spirit that ought to be generated in
a Jewish worship service," he said.
"Since it is my concern to serve the
religious needs of all the Jewish stu
dents on campus, I would find it im
possible to conduct services in the
Memorial Church building," he stated.
ASSU Vice President Clark Brown
also expressed the hope that "the dec
laration would not be construed to
mean that those groups who did not
wish to worship in Memorial Church
would not be allowed to worship else
where on campus."
Various Groups Helped
"It should be noted that various
groups working together were large
ly responsible for bringing the issue
to a head. A great deal of credit must
be given to Hillel, UCCM, and New
man as well as to the other concerned
individuals who worked with the
Chaplain and his associates in urging
freedom of worship on campus," he
continued.
"The significant progress that has
been made this year on religion shows
that students, faculty, and adminis
trators can work together in solving
the important problems facing our
community," he concluded.

a Jewish worship service," he said.
"Since it is my concern to serve the
religious needs of all the Jewish stu
dents on campus, I would find it im
possible to conduct services in the
Memorial Church building," he stated.
ASSU Vice President Clark Brown
also expressed the hope that "the dec
laration would not be construed to
mean that those groups who did not
wish to worship in Memorial Church
would not be allowed to worship else
where on campus."
Various Groups Helped
"It should be noted that various
groups working together were large
ly responsible for bringing the issue
to a head. A great deal of credit must
be given to Hillel, UCCM, and New
man as well as to the other concerned
individuals who worked with the
Chaplain and his associates in urging
freedom of worship on campus," he
continued.
"The significant progress that has
been made this year on religion shows
that students, faculty, and adminis
trators can work together in solving
the important problems facing our
community," he concluded.
The Trustee declaration was met
with a mixture of elation and reserva
tion by those most closely connected
with the effort to bring freedom of
worship to the campus.
They hailed the decision as a ma
jor step forward, but expressed
doubts as to the status of non-Chris
tian groups.
Richard Lyman, chairman of the
President's Committee on Religious
Activities, told The Dally yesterday
evening:
Lyman Encouraged
"Insofar as the Trustee's resolution
opens the way to a diversification of
opportunities for religious worship at
Stanford it is immensely encoura
ging."
"I am not yet clear in my own
mind, however, whether the fact that
the resolution speaks only of services
in Memorial Church is intended to
rule out all worship other than Chris
tian. I trust that such is not the case,
for I would find it hard to see how a
reasonable program of religious activ
ities could be developed on that re
strictive a basis."
Rabbi Charles Familant, Hillel Di
rector, expressed his concern that Jew
ishish students be allowed to worship
on campus but outside of Memorial
Church.

"While some Jewish students would
be prepared to have services in Memo
rial Church, there will always be a
certain percentage who will find the
general surroundings and symbols of
the Church incompatible with the
spirit that ought to be generated in
a Jewish worship service," he said.
"Since it is my concern to serve the
religious needs of all the Jewish stu
dents on campus, I would find it im
possible to conduct services in the
Memorial Church building," he stated.
