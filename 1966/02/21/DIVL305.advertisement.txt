Most Advanced
Aid to Reading
In 500 Years
In 1450 Johannes Gutenberg
produced the first book ever
printed from movable type. His
invention was one of the most
important in man's history. It
made possible mass production
of the printed word.
Since Gutenberg's discovery,
millions of books have been
printed. The tragedy is thut
relatively few people have time
to read them, because they read
so slowly.
Five centuries passed before
anyone discovered a truly prac
tical way to learn to read the
printed word faster.
Now, after years of testing
at major colleges (University
of Utah, University of Dela
ware,etc.). EVELYN WOOD
brings to you an amazing tech
nique that has increased her
students' reading speed .'5 to
10 times (some even faster)
and with good comprehension.

TUTE, United States Senator
Talmadge said, "In my opinion
if these techniques were insti
tuted in the public and private
schools of our country, it would
be the greatest single step
which we could take in educa
tional progress."
Senator Proxmire exclaimed
on completing the course, "I
must say that this is one of the
most useful educational experi
ences I have ever had."
Not only Washington Sena
tors, but lawyers, doctors, stu
dents, housewives, professors
and business executives give
testimony to Mrs. Wood's dy
namic reading method. They
include 200,000 graduates of
Heading Dynamics Institutes
in ">7 cities.
To learn how you, too, can
at least triple your present
reading speed, make a note now
