The Symphony of God
"God not only grants us faith and peace of heart and the joy of security.
He is not only our rod and staff in the valley of the shadow and our Com
forter when our conscience torments us. God is also the Lord of the world; he
causes His eternal ordinances to prevail over all our mutual destructiveness
and all the powers of overthrow. He directs this feverish, threatened world
straight to the goal which itself knows not his throne.
We men may do what we will. Nebuchadnezzar may come and Genkhis
Khan and Mao Tse-Tung; none of them can break God's plans, but rather must
fulfill them—against their willl Even though what we hear now is the dark
miror tone, what is being played is still God's symphony, and it will be played
out to the end. The individual tones may think they are who knows what; they
may want to assert themselves and swing out on their own. And yet they
have all been composed into a score of which God alone is in command and in
which everything, when it is heard from heaven s vantage point, has its place in
God s succession of tones that end in his final chord. The rich of this world
are in the process of going, but the kingdom of God is in the process of com
ing' . . .
Therefore, even in the pressure zone of mass means of destruction and
growing tyranny, we must have the long view and the confident calmness of
those who know they have a secure place in the score of God s eternal sym
phony. For above the battle of the powers—the outcome of which we do not
know —above all the crises and threats in our personal life there sounds, like a
peaceful, comforting bell, the promise of God, While the earth remains, seed
time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not
cease.' Every time the world goes to its autumn rest and every day as the
peace of evening decends anew upon the earth we are to receive this message
like a blinking signal from the Eternal, I calmly pursue my course through all
the convulsions and derangements of your life. And just as I direct the rhythm
of days and seasons, so I encompass the islands and the continents, the men
of faith and the atheists, the constitutional states and the tyrannies. Don't ever
think that anybody will ever be able to break away from serving me, though
he renounces me ten times over! Even in the extreme perversion of authority, as
in the tyranny of a totalitarian state, men are compelled despite themselves to
preserve a remnant of my ordrr and they can never consistently succeed in
devilizing and ruining my world. And I, who have the power of the whole
world of space, should I not be able to encompass your little life, hear your
questions and your groans, and unravel the tangled skein of your threat?

peaceful, comforting bell, the promise of God, While the earth remains, seed
time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not
cease.' Every time the world goes to its autumn rest and every day as the
peace of evening decends anew upon the earth we are to receive this message
like a blinking signal from the Eternal, I calmly pursue my course through all
the convulsions and derangements of your life. And just as I direct the rhythm
of days and seasons, so I encompass the islands and the continents, the men
of faith and the atheists, the constitutional states and the tyrannies. Don't ever
think that anybody will ever be able to break away from serving me, though
he renounces me ten times over! Even in the extreme perversion of authority, as
in the tyranny of a totalitarian state, men are compelled despite themselves to
preserve a remnant of my ordrr and they can never consistently succeed in
devilizing and ruining my world. And I, who have the power of the whole
world of space, should I not be able to encompass your little life, hear your
questions and your groans, and unravel the tangled skein of your threat?

The Symphony of God
"God not only grants us faith and peace of heart and the joy of security.
He is not only our rod and staff in the valley of the shadow and our Com
forter when our conscience torments us. God is also the Lord of the world; he
causes His eternal ordinances to prevail over all our mutual destructiveness
and all the powers of overthrow. He directs this feverish, threatened world
straight to the goal which itself knows not his throne.
We men may do what we will. Nebuchadnezzar may come and Genkhis
Khan and Mao Tse-Tung; none of them can break God's plans, but rather must
fulfill them—against their willl Even though what we hear now is the dark
miror tone, what is being played is still God's symphony, and it will be played
out to the end. The individual tones may think they are who knows what; they
may want to assert themselves and swing out on their own. And yet they
have all been composed into a score of which God alone is in command and in
which everything, when it is heard from heaven s vantage point, has its place in
God s succession of tones that end in his final chord. The rich of this world
are in the process of going, but the kingdom of God is in the process of com
ing' . . .
Therefore, even in the pressure zone of mass means of destruction and
growing tyranny, we must have the long view and the confident calmness of
those who know they have a secure place in the score of God s eternal sym
phony. For above the battle of the powers—the outcome of which we do not
know —above all the crises and threats in our personal life there sounds, like a
peaceful, comforting bell, the promise of God, While the earth remains, seed
time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not
cease.' Every time the world goes to its autumn rest and every day as the
