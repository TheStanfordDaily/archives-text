### SUSAN DICKMAN 
Arlo Tatum, Extcutive Secretary of
the Central Committee for Conscien
tiosu Objectors (CCCO) explained the
legal'rights of conscientious objectors
lasl night at Tresidder.
Sinco the Supreme Court's decision
on the Seeger case, approximately
1,000 men have reappealed their cases,
he said. The Seeger decision ruled
that opposition to war might spring
from a "sincere and meaningful belief
which occupies in the life of its pos
sessor a place parallel that filled by
God of those admittedly qualifying
for" the status of conscientious ob
jector. Further, recent court decisions
make it clear that a claim need not
be based purely on "religious train
ing and belief."
The David Mitchell Case uses the
Nuremburg Principle. Mr. Mitchell
claims that the Gerrfians were hold
morally and legally responsible for
acts which they were ordered to per
form. and that he will not be held
similarly responsible for acts he is
ordered to perform in military serv
ice.
Presently, the CCCO is searching
for a case to test the principle that
a conscientious objector must be op
posed to war "in any form."
Tatum stated that ideally this case
would involve a religious person who
accepted "the Church's teaching from
the time of Constantine" of a just
war. The fact that there is no such
case "means that the principle of the
just war has been used to justify,
not to judge wars," Tatum stated.
Tatum classifies himself as "a con
scientious objector to conscription it
self." He has served two prison sen
tences for refusing to register for the
draft.
"It is one thing to say that every
man owes two years to his govern
ment," he said, "but it is another
thing to say that he must for two
years support that government's for
eign policy, no matter what it is.
Tatum said that the number of men
filing for CO classification had in
creased 350 per cent in the last six
months. Of these men, he stated 95
per cent obtain CO classification.
For those interested in finding out
about the positions taken by conscien
tious objectors, Tatum recommended
calling Dick Mullins (326-7469), Tom
Sherman (325-2762), or Fred Goff
(321-4149).
