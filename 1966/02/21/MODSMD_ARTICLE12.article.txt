# Possible Compromise Halts Sigma Chi-Colorado Suit
## 
### 
BOULDER, Colo. (CPS)—Sig
ma Chi fraternity's lawsuit
against the Regents of the Uni
versity of Colorado took a dra
matic turn last week with a sur
prise meeting in Denver be
tween Fred Winner, Sigma Chi
lawyer, and regional and nation
al officers of the fraternity.
The meeting was attended by
15 Coloradoans who hold fra
ternity alumni offices. Winner
said it was called to "discuss
the posture of the lawsuit."
At the same time, it was
learned from a source close to
the university that several mem

bers of the regents were appar
ently willing to compromise
with Sigma Chi.
The federal suit has been held
up until the possibilities of such
a compromise are explored by
both sides.
The national fraternity is
charging that the Colorado re
gents violated the U. S. Consti
tution when they suspended
the Boulder chapter of Sigma
Chi for alleged discriminatory
practices.
Reliable sources said that a
compromise in the case might
come along the lines of an "off
campus" agreement. The possi
ble agreement was not fully out
lined; it was believed that the
fraternity would continue to ini
tiate UC students but would
have no official connection with
the university.
