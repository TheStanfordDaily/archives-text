## 'Lysistrata' A Go Go 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
The Ram's I-load production
of Aristophanes' Lysistrata is
an immensely rewarding per
formance. Chock full of uproar
ious puns and wittery, the com
edy exudes a vitality in the first
degree of imagination and sa
lacity.
The production borrows little
more from Aristophanes than
the title and the women's bat
tlecry of "make love not war."
Lysistrata devises a conspiracy
to compel the warring states
of Greece to arbitrate peace.
She assembles all the women of
Greece under the roof of the
Acropolis in Athens and bars
the gates of demostic pleasures
to the battling husbands.
A Life of Celibacy
The painful life of celibacy to
which the husbands are reduced
leads to a score of comic epi
sodes. Eventually ambassadors
from both states, hard pressed
and at length's end. meet and
peace is concluded with the has
tiest dispatch.
The acting of the main cast
was generally successful on Fri
day night. Notably Pamela
Beach, Carol Rountree, and Rob
hert Serva turned in excellent
performances.
Miss Beach, as Kleonike, suc
ceeded in all that her role de

manded. At the start she was
hilarious as the woman who
would rather "walk barefoot
through fire" than forego the
marital intimacies that she so
patently devoured with relish.
As the show progressed, Miss
Beach, wallowing in martyrdom,
becomes the sex empress of the
set in her strong-headed, even
masculine, obsession with sex.
('anil Rountree Successful
In the title role, Miss Roun
tree was eminently successful
and compelling as chieftain of
the Greek womanhood. After a
briefly shaky start, she glided
easily into her role and seemed
to live the part of Lysistrata.
In the finale Miss Rountree took
complete command of the stage
and proved herself the showwo
man that she is.
Robert Sevra must also he
singled out for his fine acting
and truly humorous and realis
tic pantomime of agony. Mr.
Sevra alone was convincing as
a man in quest of peace of mind,
war or no.
The cast as a whole was com
petent and often quite good.
Carol Bentz, Vickie Davis, Lars
Kampmann, and Dick Grant es
pecially turned in excellent per
formances.
Director Lars Kampmann main
tains an intensity of humor
throughout most of the play and

there are few sticky, drawn out
scenes. The insertion of a news
caster is an added ninety that
comes off effectively.
However, the play is too heavi
ly seasoned with puns—the ple
thora of wit detracts markedly
from the subtlety of the "load
ed" lines. Also the male east
moans about the stage rather
monotonously and more like
they were suffering from gas
eous indigestion than from the
painful plight of abstention.
Sevra excluded, the whimpering
was only wimpery and the de
prived husbands seemed more
henpecked than cocksure.
Actors Not Singers
Another flaw was the poor
quality of singing which made
most of the songs unintelligible
if not cacophonous. An old Cur
tisian proverb proclaims that ac
tors cannot sing and singers
cannot act. With the exception
of Carol Rountree, the proverb
rang true on Friday evening.
The rock and roil music and
go-go dancing is handled with
a poJished touch. Kampmann
times the music beautifully to
blend with the action of the
characters and to keep the plot
alive. Nowhere does the score
stifle the comic output of the
show.
Mass Daneeathon
When the audience is herded
onto the stage for the finale, the
dancing does detract from the
play. The comedy, the music,
and the plot rises to a frenzied
and orgiastic crescendo at the
end; but then, when the action
is extended to include a mass
danceathon, the climax is sluf
fed over and the ending dribbles
off into the back stage.
Lysistrata is a thoroughly en
joyable experience and accom
plishes exactly what Lars Kamp
mann called for in the program
notes, "I ask everyone in the
audience to admit it if they fall
in love with the cast." Every
one did fall in love with the cast,
the production, and enchant
ment of the whole evening.
Lysistrata is a tribute to Aris
tophanes, no to Ram's Head,
almost assuredly —to the audi
ence, definitely.

of Aristophanes' Lysistrata is
an immensely rewarding per
formance. Chock full of uproar
ious puns and wittery, the com
edy exudes a vitality in the first
degree of imagination and sa
lacity.
The production borrows little
more from Aristophanes than
the title and the women's bat
tlecry of "make love not war."
Lysistrata devises a conspiracy
to compel the warring states
of Greece to arbitrate peace.
She assembles all the women of
Greece under the roof of the
Acropolis in Athens and bars
the gates of demostic pleasures
to the battling husbands.
A Life of Celibacy
The painful life of celibacy to
which the husbands are reduced
leads to a score of comic epi
sodes. Eventually ambassadors
from both states, hard pressed
and at length's end. meet and
peace is concluded with the has
tiest dispatch.
The acting of the main cast
was generally successful on Fri
day night. Notably Pamela
Beach, Carol Rountree, and Rob
hert Serva turned in excellent
performances.
Miss Beach, as Kleonike, suc
ceeded in all that her role de

manded. At the start she was
hilarious as the woman who
would rather "walk barefoot
through fire" than forego the
marital intimacies that she so
patently devoured with relish.
As the show progressed, Miss
Beach, wallowing in martyrdom,
becomes the sex empress of the
set in her strong-headed, even
masculine, obsession with sex.
('anil Rountree Successful
In the title role, Miss Roun
tree was eminently successful
and compelling as chieftain of
the Greek womanhood. After a
briefly shaky start, she glided
easily into her role and seemed
to live the part of Lysistrata.
In the finale Miss Rountree took
complete command of the stage
and proved herself the showwo
man that she is.
Robert Sevra must also he
singled out for his fine acting
and truly humorous and realis
tic pantomime of agony. Mr.
Sevra alone was convincing as
a man in quest of peace of mind,
war or no.
The cast as a whole was com
petent and often quite good.
Carol Bentz, Vickie Davis, Lars
Kampmann, and Dick Grant es
pecially turned in excellent per
formances.
Director Lars Kampmann main
tains an intensity of humor
throughout most of the play and

there are few sticky, drawn out
scenes. The insertion of a news
caster is an added ninety that
comes off effectively.
However, the play is too heavi
ly seasoned with puns—the ple
thora of wit detracts markedly
from the subtlety of the "load
ed" lines. Also the male east
moans about the stage rather
monotonously and more like
they were suffering from gas
eous indigestion than from the
painful plight of abstention.
Sevra excluded, the whimpering
was only wimpery and the de
prived husbands seemed more
henpecked than cocksure.
Actors Not Singers
Another flaw was the poor
quality of singing which made
most of the songs unintelligible
if not cacophonous. An old Cur
tisian proverb proclaims that ac
tors cannot sing and singers
cannot act. With the exception
of Carol Rountree, the proverb
rang true on Friday evening.
The rock and roil music and
go-go dancing is handled with
a poJished touch. Kampmann
times the music beautifully to
blend with the action of the
characters and to keep the plot
alive. Nowhere does the score
stifle the comic output of the
show.
Mass Daneeathon
When the audience is herded
onto the stage for the finale, the
dancing does detract from the
play. The comedy, the music,
and the plot rises to a frenzied
and orgiastic crescendo at the
end; but then, when the action
is extended to include a mass
danceathon, the climax is sluf
fed over and the ending dribbles
off into the back stage.
Lysistrata is a thoroughly en
joyable experience and accom
plishes exactly what Lars Kamp
mann called for in the program
notes, "I ask everyone in the
audience to admit it if they fall
in love with the cast." Every
one did fall in love with the cast,
the production, and enchant
ment of the whole evening.

ious puns and wittery, the com
edy exudes a vitality in the first
degree of imagination and sa
lacity.
The production borrows little
more from Aristophanes than
the title and the women's bat
tlecry of "make love not war."
Lysistrata devises a conspiracy
to compel the warring states
of Greece to arbitrate peace.
She assembles all the women of
Greece under the roof of the
Acropolis in Athens and bars
the gates of demostic pleasures
to the battling husbands.
A Life of Celibacy
The painful life of celibacy to
which the husbands are reduced
leads to a score of comic epi
sodes. Eventually ambassadors
from both states, hard pressed
and at length's end. meet and
peace is concluded with the has
tiest dispatch.
The acting of the main cast
was generally successful on Fri
day night. Notably Pamela
Beach, Carol Rountree, and Rob
hert Serva turned in excellent
performances.
Miss Beach, as Kleonike, suc
ceeded in all that her role de

manded. At the start she was
hilarious as the woman who
would rather "walk barefoot
through fire" than forego the
marital intimacies that she so
patently devoured with relish.
As the show progressed, Miss
Beach, wallowing in martyrdom,
becomes the sex empress of the
set in her strong-headed, even
masculine, obsession with sex.
('anil Rountree Successful
In the title role, Miss Roun
tree was eminently successful
and compelling as chieftain of
the Greek womanhood. After a
briefly shaky start, she glided
easily into her role and seemed
to live the part of Lysistrata.
In the finale Miss Rountree took
complete command of the stage
and proved herself the showwo
man that she is.
Robert Sevra must also he
singled out for his fine acting
and truly humorous and realis
tic pantomime of agony. Mr.
Sevra alone was convincing as
a man in quest of peace of mind,
war or no.
The cast as a whole was com
petent and often quite good.
Carol Bentz, Vickie Davis, Lars
Kampmann, and Dick Grant es
pecially turned in excellent per
formances.
Director Lars Kampmann main
tains an intensity of humor
throughout most of the play and

there are few sticky, drawn out
scenes. The insertion of a news
caster is an added ninety that
comes off effectively.
However, the play is too heavi
ly seasoned with puns—the ple
thora of wit detracts markedly
from the subtlety of the "load
ed" lines. Also the male east
moans about the stage rather
monotonously and more like
they were suffering from gas
eous indigestion than from the
painful plight of abstention.
Sevra excluded, the whimpering
was only wimpery and the de
prived husbands seemed more
henpecked than cocksure.
Actors Not Singers
Another flaw was the poor
quality of singing which made
most of the songs unintelligible
if not cacophonous. An old Cur
tisian proverb proclaims that ac
tors cannot sing and singers
cannot act. With the exception
of Carol Rountree, the proverb
rang true on Friday evening.
The rock and roil music and
go-go dancing is handled with
a poJished touch. Kampmann
times the music beautifully to
blend with the action of the
characters and to keep the plot
alive. Nowhere does the score
stifle the comic output of the
show.
Mass Daneeathon
When the audience is herded
onto the stage for the finale, the
dancing does detract from the
play. The comedy, the music,
and the plot rises to a frenzied
and orgiastic crescendo at the
end; but then, when the action
is extended to include a mass
danceathon, the climax is sluf
fed over and the ending dribbles
off into the back stage.
Lysistrata is a thoroughly en
joyable experience and accom
plishes exactly what Lars Kamp
mann called for in the program
notes, "I ask everyone in the
audience to admit it if they fall
in love with the cast." Every
one did fall in love with the cast,
the production, and enchant
ment of the whole evening.
Lysistrata is a tribute to Aris
tophanes, no to Ram's Head,
almost assuredly —to the audi
ence, definitely.
