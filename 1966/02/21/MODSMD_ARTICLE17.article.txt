# San Mateo Rabbi Speaks On Jews' Identity, Role In Society
## 
### 
Rabbi Sanford E. Rosen of
Peninsula Temple Beth El in
San Mateo, spoke yesterday at
Memorial Church on the prob
lem, "What Is a Jew?" The serv
ice combined Jewish music with
the usual Memorial Church serv
ice to create an atmosphere
which the guest preacher
termed "rich and rewarding."
The text of Rabbi Rosen's ser
mon attempted to define the
qualities of Judaism and the
Jew's role in society. The rabbi
fulfilled his first purpose by
saying that "Jews are a brother
hood with a common history,
language, and destiny." Previ
ously, he discredited the idea
that Jews are a nation, race, or
solely a religion.
Rabbi Rosen, a representative
of Conservative Judaism, stated,
"The Jews have been charged
to preserve the traditions of eth
ical monotheism." This duty he
assigned to "the miraculous
remnant of Judaism that has ex
isted for the past four thousand
years th r o u g h innumerable
hardships."
In his concluding rerharks, the
guest speaker emphasized the

basis for the Jews' recent active
interest in social reform prob
lems. "The Jew," he stressed,
"is an exulter of deeds and ac
tion and a worker for social jus
tice. Since God is one, all men
must also be one."
The special music for the serv
ice was selected from Ernest
Bloch's Sacred Service by choir
director, Harold Schmidt. Medi

cal student Edward Shapiro,
sung the lead or cantor part on
the modern arrangements of
traditional Hebraic melodies.
The Stanford choir accompanied
him.
Chaplain Minto explained that
the service was an annual event
sponsored by the Jewish Chau
tauqua Society, a national edu
cational organization.
