# UC Announces New Campus; Regents Undecided Over Site
## 
### 
The Regents of the University
of California have unanimously
approved a proposal to build a
new UC campus in the San Fran
cisco area.
The proposal calls for the new
site to open in 1972 as part of
the University's growth plan. A
controversy has arisen, how
ever, between those who pro
posed the city site and adherents
of another new campus in South
ern California.
In a revised version of the

growth plan, the San Francisco
site was affirmed as the Univer
sity's first choice, but provision
was made for alternative sites
in the North and for a later
campus addition in the South.
The choice of San Francisco
seemed less certain after the ad
dition of a clause in the new
growth plan which stated that
"there should be an unambigu
ous declaration of support in ad
vance of any determination to
start an urban campus."
