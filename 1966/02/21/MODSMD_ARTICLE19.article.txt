## Daily Sports 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Rallying after a slow first
half, the Stanford .Rugby team
came on with a strong finish to
shutout the USC ruggers, 14-0,
Saturday, in a game played at
Stanford.
The win, Stanford's fourth of
the season against one loss and
two tie games, set the stage for
the annual "Big Game Serum
Axe" series with California, be
ginning next week.
The winner of the "Scrum
Axe" is the team scoring the
most total points in the two

games played on a home-and
home basis. The first game will
be played at Stanford, the sec
ond at Berkeley.
USC Starts Fast
USC started out fast, in Satur
day's game. The Trojans were
unable to capitalize on any of
three penalty kicks early in the
game, but nevertheless ruled
the opening stages of play.
It was ten minutes into the
game before Stanford made a
strong backfield rush. However
this initial offensive thrust was
stopped when Andy Ovenstone's

attempted drop-kick was wide
of the goal.
The Indians finally got on the
scoreboard when, two minutes
later, Mike Grace booked a suc
cessful 20 yard penalty kick.
This gave the Cards a 3-0 lead

which turned out to be all they
needed for the game.
Just before halftime Grace
picked up a loose ball and head
ed for the USC goal. He was
stopped short and passed off to
Frank Pattitucci.
Pattitucci Scores
Pattitucci broke into the clear,
and though two Trojan defend
ers stopped most of him short
of the goal, he was able to place
the ball down in paydirt.
The conversion attempt by
Grace was wide, but Stanford
held a 6-0 lead as the teams took
the halftime break.
The Indians largely domi
nated play in the second half.
Eric Sutcliffe broke away from
a loose ruck and made a fine

broken field run before passing
off to Andy Ovenstone.
Ovenstone Makes Try
Ovenstone went in for the
score untouched and Grace
made the conversion. The score
stood at 11-0 and from this
point on, the game was played
mainly in the USC half of the
field.
Stanford's final score of the
day could be credited largely to
ihe Indian scrum, and the con
stant pressure they applied to
the USC fullback, Alex Loebig.
Loebig was forced into an off
balance kick which Mike Grace
got a hand on. Joe Neal re
covered the ball in the end zone,
for the score. However, Grace
narrowly missed the conversion
from a difficult angle.
The score was now 14-0 and
the game ended five minutes
later with no further scoring.
Kmetovic Apprehensive
Though pleased with the vic
tory, Coach Pete Kmetovic ex-

Stanford's lacrosse team de
feated the School of Business
in a game scrimmage Sunday,
7-5. The Indians will begin their
season next Saturday, February
26, against the Palo Alto La
crosse Club.

pressed a little apprehension
about next week's Cal game.
"We will have to play quite a
bit better if we expect to beat
Cal for the Scrum Axe. I do
hope we will be at full strength
for that game."
The Indians have been plagued
by injuries all year and just
when all members were ready to
go, the flu bug hit. Lost to the
team for Saturday's game was
Bob Newberry, the high-scoring
breakaway for the Tribe.
Fullback Problems
The Indians have also used
three fullbacks in the last two
games, another problem which
Coach Kmetovic hopes to have
solved for the Cal game.
John Kidde handled the full
back chores for this game and
did a fine job until he left the
game in its closing minutes with
a leg injury.
Stanford, loser in last year's
Scrum Axe Series, will be gun
ning for a big opening victory
next Saturday. The game, con
sidered the top rugby match of
the year for the Peninsula area,
will start at 1:30 on the rugby
field.
