# BEAT WASH, WASH ST.
## Basketball Squad Wins Two 
### HUGH WEST 
Twice this weekend Stanford's
basketballers pretended they
were't going to win, only to pull
out victories over visiting Wash
ington and Washington State,
75-73 and 80-61.
Friday night, the Indians let
the Washington Huskies think
they had a chance through half
of the first half and then pulled
away. Bored with an easy vic
tory, the Indians once again let
the Huskies get within striking
distance early in the second half
and teased them the rest of the

way for the two point victory.
The Huskies never had the lead.
In the Saturday night con
test, the Tribe gave up the de
ception a bit earlier. They al
lowed a close first half, which
ended at 38-32, but then spurted
early in the second half for the
nineteen point final margin.
Fast Pace
The Washington contest
opened at a swift, close pace, and
the Huskies and Indians
matched each other shot for
shot. Then with the score knot

ted at 11-11, Coach Howie Dall
mar ordered his Indians into a
press, and the Huskies lost the
ball twice in a row. The press
was only a temporary measure,
but poor Washington ball-han-

dling meant the Huskies lost the
ball thirteen times in the first
half.
The Indians then fas t
breaked their way to a 29-18
margin, and held for the 41-35
half-time lead.
Begin to Tease
It was in the second half that
the Tribe really began to tease.
They would allow the Huskies
to get as close as two points
and then would pull away. As
the quarter opened, a ten-footer
by Steve Olsen and a lay-up by
Doug Westlake made the score
41-39, but Ray Kosanke and Art
Harris soon recovered the six
point deficit.
The game oscillatted in this
fashion until the end, just reach
ing the two-point margin phase
as the game-ending buzzer
sounded.
With 4:06 left, Art Harris hav
ing fouled out, and the score
71-69, the Tribe went into a
stall. Bob Bedell and Ray Ko
sanke drew fouls for three
points for another five point
margin. Another Kosanke foul
shot and two last minute Husk
ie buckets made the score 75-73.
Win at Foul Line
The Indians won the game at
the foul line. Both teams shot
identical 44% field goal per
centages, but the Indians made
19 of 21 charity tosses to 13-19
for the Huskies.
Against the Washington State
Cougars, Stanford rode on the
strength of Art Harris' 25 point
output and a miserable 32%
Cougar shooting accuracy.
Harris sparkled with 11 of 15
field goals and 3 of 4 free throws
and played a masterful court
game. Bob Bedell contributed
20 points, while center Jim Mc-
Kean was the whole Cougar at
tack with 21 points.
The Indians frosh basketball
team set a school record against
Hartnell College. They won the
contest 120-62. They also de
feated Fresno State Friday
night.

sanke drew fouls for three
points for another five point
margin. Another Kosanke foul
shot and two last minute Husk
ie buckets made the score 75-73.
Win at Foul Line
The Indians won the game at
the foul line. Both teams shot
identical 44% field goal per
centages, but the Indians made
19 of 21 charity tosses to 13-19
for the Huskies.
Against the Washington State
Cougars, Stanford rode on the
strength of Art Harris' 25 point
output and a miserable 32%
Cougar shooting accuracy.
Harris sparkled with 11 of 15
field goals and 3 of 4 free throws
and played a masterful court
game. Bob Bedell contributed
20 points, while center Jim Mc-
Kean was the whole Cougar at
tack with 21 points.
The Indians frosh basketball
team set a school record against
Hartnell College. They won the
contest 120-62. They also de
feated Fresno State Friday
night.
Twice this weekend Stanford's
basketballers pretended they
were't going to win, only to pull
out victories over visiting Wash
ington and Washington State,
75-73 and 80-61.
Friday night, the Indians let
the Washington Huskies think
they had a chance through half
of the first half and then pulled
away. Bored with an easy vic
tory, the Indians once again let
the Huskies get within striking
distance early in the second half
and teased them the rest of the

way for the two point victory.
The Huskies never had the lead.
In the Saturday night con
test, the Tribe gave up the de
ception a bit earlier. They al
lowed a close first half, which
ended at 38-32, but then spurted
early in the second half for the
nineteen point final margin.
Fast Pace
The Washington contest
opened at a swift, close pace, and
the Huskies and Indians
matched each other shot for
shot. Then with the score knot

ted at 11-11, Coach Howie Dall
mar ordered his Indians into a
press, and the Huskies lost the
ball twice in a row. The press
was only a temporary measure,
but poor Washington ball-han-

dling meant the Huskies lost the
ball thirteen times in the first
half.
The Indians then fas t
breaked their way to a 29-18
margin, and held for the 41-35
half-time lead.
Begin to Tease
It was in the second half that
the Tribe really began to tease.
They would allow the Huskies
to get as close as two points
and then would pull away. As
the quarter opened, a ten-footer
by Steve Olsen and a lay-up by
Doug Westlake made the score
41-39, but Ray Kosanke and Art
Harris soon recovered the six
point deficit.
The game oscillatted in this
fashion until the end, just reach
ing the two-point margin phase
as the game-ending buzzer
sounded.
With 4:06 left, Art Harris hav
ing fouled out, and the score
71-69, the Tribe went into a
stall. Bob Bedell and Ray Ko
sanke drew fouls for three
points for another five point
margin. Another Kosanke foul
shot and two last minute Husk
ie buckets made the score 75-73.
