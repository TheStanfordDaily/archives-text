## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Shortstop Frank Duffy
slapped a two out single to cen
ter with the bases loaded in the
sixth inning of Friday after
noon's baseball game against
USF to give Stanford a 2-1 win.
Saturday's game against the
Minor League All Stars was
rained out.
Although the Indians won, it
can hardly be said that they
have even remotely approached
their 1965 CIBA championship
form. USF managed twice as
many hits as the Tribe. The
Dons got six hits.
Alas, A Walk
USF's downfall was the walk.
Steve Hovley fouled out to start
off the sixth. Jim Hibbs walked.
Then in a surprise move Coach
Dutch Fehring had Hibbs steal
second. Hibbs was successful
but it only served to shake up
the USF pitcher as Marty Erck,
subbing for Pete Middlekauff,
walked also.
The USF catcher tried to pick
Hibbs off at second on the first
pitch to Greg Taylor but threw
the ball into centerfield. Hibbs
took third and Erck held at
first.
Taylor, who filled in for Ron
Yett in rightfield, struck out. On
the strike out pitch, Coach Fehr
ing called an even more sur
prising move than Hibb's steal.
He had Erck steal second in an
attempted delayed steal play.
Holds Ground
Erck was safe when the throw
was high, and Hibbs held his

ground at third instead of try
ing to score.
USF then intentionally walked
second baseman Dick Swan to
load up the bases.
Duffy, batting number eight
in the order, singled to center
which scored Stanford's two
runs. Hibbs and Erck scored
easily on the play.
Tom Melzer ended the inning
when he grounded out sharply
to the shortstop.
Lone Run
The Dons scored their lone
run in the fourth inning. Cen
terfielder Joe Gill drew a walk
from starter John Mason, catch
er Tim Beasley singled to cen
ter putting runners on first and
second.
Bob Pendroh hit a slow
bounder to Melzer at third base
who handled the tricky hopper
cleanly and then hesitated for a
fraction of a second before de
ciding whether to tag the run
ner, force him at third, or go
for the double play. He wound
up tossing the ball to second
leaving runners on first and
third.
Leftfielder Larry Marietti
grounded to Melzer's left where
he scooped it up and threw the
batter out at first, but, mean
while, the runner at third
scored. Mason induced the next
man to ground out to short
stop.

the USF pitcher as Marty Erck,
subbing for Pete Middlekauff,
walked also.
The USF catcher tried to pick
Hibbs off at second on the first
pitch to Greg Taylor but threw
the ball into centerfield. Hibbs
took third and Erck held at
first.
Taylor, who filled in for Ron
Yett in rightfield, struck out. On
the strike out pitch, Coach Fehr
ing called an even more sur
prising move than Hibb's steal.
He had Erck steal second in an
attempted delayed steal play.
Holds Ground
Erck was safe when the throw
was high, and Hibbs held his

ground at third instead of try
ing to score.
USF then intentionally walked
second baseman Dick Swan to
load up the bases.
Duffy, batting number eight
in the order, singled to center
which scored Stanford's two
runs. Hibbs and Erck scored
easily on the play.
Tom Melzer ended the inning
when he grounded out sharply
to the shortstop.
Lone Run
The Dons scored their lone
run in the fourth inning. Cen
terfielder Joe Gill drew a walk
from starter John Mason, catch
er Tim Beasley singled to cen
ter putting runners on first and
second.
Bob Pendroh hit a slow
bounder to Melzer at third base
who handled the tricky hopper
cleanly and then hesitated for a
fraction of a second before de
ciding whether to tag the run
ner, force him at third, or go
for the double play. He wound
up tossing the ball to second
leaving runners on first and
third.
Leftfielder Larry Marietti
grounded to Melzer's left where
he scooped it up and threw the
batter out at first, but, mean
while, the runner at third
scored. Mason induced the next
man to ground out to short
stop.

Shortstop Frank Duffy
slapped a two out single to cen
ter with the bases loaded in the
sixth inning of Friday after
noon's baseball game against
USF to give Stanford a 2-1 win.
Saturday's game against the
Minor League All Stars was
rained out.
Although the Indians won, it
can hardly be said that they
have even remotely approached
their 1965 CIBA championship
form. USF managed twice as
many hits as the Tribe. The
Dons got six hits.
Alas, A Walk
USF's downfall was the walk.
Steve Hovley fouled out to start
off the sixth. Jim Hibbs walked.
Then in a surprise move Coach
Dutch Fehring had Hibbs steal
second. Hibbs was successful
but it only served to shake up
the USF pitcher as Marty Erck,
subbing for Pete Middlekauff,
walked also.
