# Swimming Team Loses Twice
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity swimmers
spent two days in Los Angeles
last weekend only to lose two
meets by a total of less than two
seconds in the freestyle relays.
NCAA champion USC had to
sweat to take a 53-42 victory
over the Cards F r i d a y, and
UCLA nipped Stanford in the
final relay to win, 51-44, Satur
day.
Southern Cal put its strong
est lineup against the Indians,
but met several surprises. Go
ing into the last relay, the Tro
jans were in danger of losing

their first dual meet in five
years. The USC relay, with Roy
Saari anchoring it, prevailed to
avert disaster.
UCLA set six varsity records
in its meet with Stanford. The
Indians, somewhat tired from
the strenuous meet the day be
fore, were slightly "off" where
it hurt. With the meet tied go
ing into the freestyle relay, the
Bruins touched out the Stanford
tandem by a hand.
Monson Upsets Trojans
A number of Stanford swim
mers came up with their best
performances of the year last

weekend. Bob Momsen upset
USC's two Olympic breaststrok
ers, Wayne Anderson and Bill
Craig, Momson streaked to a
2:15.5 timing, placing him
among the nation's top three
breaststrokers.
Doug Miller dropped his best
200 fly time more than a second
to 2:01.5 to wipe out USC's dy
namic butterfly duo of Hillam
and Carotto.
Mark Parmely surprised
Southern California, winning
both the 50 and 100 freestyle
against the Trojans and anchor
ing the Stanford free relay in
47.8.
Mike Wall won both the 200
and 500 freestyle races against
UCLA. Wall placed second in
the same two events behind
USC's NCAA record holder Roy
Saari.
Bill Freeman gained crucial
points in both meets as he domi
nated the diving competition.
Freeman accumulated 315.55
points against the Bruins, sur
passing his previous best by 55
points and taking over the
league leadership.
USC Opens Lead
USC opened the meet with a
victory in the 400 medley relay.
The Trojans increased their lead
in the 200 freestyle. Roy Saari
beat Mike Wall by .6 second.
After the 200 free, Stanford
gradually whittled away at
USC's 8 point lead. Mark Par
mely blasted out 22.5 to knock

off Trojan Rich McGeagh in the
50 freestyle.
Jim Laney placed second in
the 200 individual medley in
2:05.1 Bill Freeman won the div
ing event and Bill Kennedy took
third, reversing USC's 6-3 score
in the IM.
Doug Miller started the stren
uous 200 butterfly behind USC's
two fliers. Miller waited until
the 150 to make his move, catch
ing and passing the two Tro
jans.
Parmely, Ijiney 1-2
Stanford trailed by four points
going into the 100 freestyle.
Mark Parmely and Jim Laney
aeed the USC twosome. The In
dians gained a 3 point lead,
which USC promptly eradicated
with a 1-2 backstroke sweep.
Mike Wall and Gary Sheerer
again placed 2-3 behind Saari,

Stanford's intra squad track
meet was all but cancelled as
six events were held in the rain
Saturday. The big race was in
the 440 relay where freshman
Pat Morrison made a gallant
attempt to catch Larry Ques
tad on the last leg of the race
but was unsuccessful. Team of
Questad, Cox, Forbes, and Tap
ling won the event in 42.5 sec
onds.

this time in the 500 freestyle.
It fell to Bob Momsen in the
200 breastroke to pull the big
gest switch of the day, leaving
USC's touted pair of breast
strokers to watch his kick for
the last two lengths of the race.
Relay Deciding Factor
Mark Parmely left a body
length behind Saari on the an
chor leg, and could not shorten
the spread. USC won in 3:14.0,
their best of the season.
USC's win over Stanford was
the Trojan's 69th straight dual
meet victory. Sixty-nine may be
a fated number, however, for
the Trojans. Stanford's swim

ming class of 69, (when it turns
Greek next year) may provide
the added heft needed to ram
through the already besieged
Trojan stronghold.
Card Medley Slow
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
decided to gun for the medley
relay against UCLA. Each man
on the Indian foursome was a
half second off his best, and
UCLA won by two seconds.
Mike Wall and Gary Sheerer
stole first and second from the
Bruins. UCLA's Keller then won
the 50 free ahead of Bill Meyer
and Bill Derrig.
The Bruins widened their lead
to 2 points as Jim Bailey won
the 200 IM in 2:09.65, ahead of
Jim Laney and Charlie Burbach
of Stanford.
Bill Freeman then put on his
exhibition of diving perfection.
Bill Kennedy grabbed second
place, putting Stanford ahead,
24-19. Doug Miller knocked off
Bruin Stan Cole in the 200 fly.
Setbacks
Setbacks in the 100 free and
the 200 back put UCLA ahead,
36-34. Mike Wall won the 500 in
5:00.3 to shorten the gap. Bob
Momsen then staged his second
upset of the wekend, beating
UCLA's Russ Webb in the
breaststroke.
With the score tied 44-44, the
freestyle relay teams held the
whole wild meet in their hands.
Bruin Jim Bailey opened up a
body-length lead on Gary Sheer
er. Bill Meyer then paced Stan
Cole yard for yard.
Jim Laney dropped in a 48.4
split to catch the UCLA relay.
Mark Parmely left with Jim
Keller of UCLA. The Bruin took
a body length lead by the 75
yard mark. Parmely bombed
back in the last length but fell
six inches short of winning.
Back on the Farm, the Stan
ford frosh won every event,
whitewashing Long Beach City
College. Greg Buckingham
swam exhibition in the 200 in
dividual medley. Buckingham
finished in 1:52.2.
