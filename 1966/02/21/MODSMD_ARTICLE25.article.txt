# LOSE TO CAL
## Boxers Beaten, 8-2 
### 
Stanford's boxing team won
only two fights last Thursday
in losing to Cal, 8-2, in their
final conference match of the
season. The big winner for Stan
ford was Jim Marlar who has
amusingly garnered three
straight TKO victories.
Of the six varsity matches Cal
won four of them with Stanford
also forfeiting four bouts. Stan
ford's next competition will be
in the Navy-Collegiate Boxing
Festival a week from tomorrow,
March 1.
George Bellows and Bill Thom
as were both TKO victims fall

ing at the hands of their Bear
opposition.
Although losing by a decision,
Eric de Gooyer did a fine job
against Cal's excellent heavy
weight fighter Walt Cunning
ham. De Gooyer used his size
and reach to his advantage.
However, Cunningham was just
too experienced for de Gooyer.
Tom J en k s was the other
Stanford victor, winning a de
cision over his opponent. Jenks,
who has lost only one fight all
season, used his speed and jabs
to put his foe on the defensive
throughout the fight.
