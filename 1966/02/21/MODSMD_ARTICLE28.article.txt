# Of Politics And Petitions

The Legislature last Thursday once again
bit off more than a significant part of the stu
dent body is willing to chew, swallow, and
digest.
Before voting to replace three of the five
student representatives on the Committee of
15 with more "forceful" individuals and as
serting its right to recall those representatives
at will, the Legislature engaged in an extensive
and thorough debate over the impending reso
lution—a debate that seemed to be lacking only
in a perspective of what an administrator or a
faculty member really is.
Most adult scholars at Stanford come to the
university not because they wish to be partici
pant to the political power plays of the Real
World, but rather because they enjoy the phy
sical calm and intellectual fennent of what
John Gardner and President Sterling call the
Inner City. It is a place for them where the
traumas of the greater society can be attacked
with perspective rather than with force. It is
a place where education and its chief medium,
discussion, are considered more important
than the physical and political battles for which
the university* is preparing its students.
The vast majority of the student body, as
LASSU is painfully aware, is more concerned
with education than it is with politics —espe-
cially student politics—and its resultant power
plays, such as that of last Thursday. But many
of these students are still rightfully interested
in improving the University community, the
setting in which that education takes place. It
comes as no surprise, then, that students out
side student government are interested in so
cial regulations, the Wilbur Hall situation, and
religion policy —for all of these affect the edu
cation one receives at Stanford.

It also comes as no surprise that when a real
opportunity for bringing much-needed reform
to the University comes along, students outside
student goveniment show an interest in it. The
Committee of 15 is just such an opportunity.
Because the Committee attempts to stay above
power politics, because it is a 'true forum in
which mature adults can rationally discuss the
heart of an issue, and because it is a chance for
the student to meet the teacher and the admin
istrator on an equal footing —the Committee,
with only advisory powers, ironically is more
respected than the law-making student legisla
ture. And, it is felt, it is necessary that it be
preserved as an effective body.
Without reinterating the other arguments
against LASSU's decision of last Thursday, it
seems clear that the Legislature's attitude
toward the Committee is a disastrous form of
brinkmanship which may well bring an end to
co-existence on the Stanford campus. If the re
ports we have received of the first meeting of
the revised Committee of 15 last Friday are
any indication, the Committee may not have
long to live. The professors and administrators,
as we said above, have little patience with
shows of power. If real discussion cannot be
undertaken, they may well pack up their mar
bles and go home.
It is with this in mind that we take note of
the petition being circulated on campus today.
It is a vindictive measure, aimed as much at
hurting LASSU as at improving the Commit
tee. But perhaps it is what is needed. As the
petition's originator, Tom Galbraith — an ex
student-government man himself —points out,
it is hoped that the petition will force the Legis
lature to reconsider what it has done —this
time with a little more perspective.

preserved as an effective body.
Without reinterating the other arguments
against LASSU's decision of last Thursday, it
seems clear that the Legislature's attitude
toward the Committee is a disastrous form of
brinkmanship which may well bring an end to
co-existence on the Stanford campus. If the re
ports we have received of the first meeting of
the revised Committee of 15 last Friday are
any indication, the Committee may not have
long to live. The professors and administrators,
as we said above, have little patience with
shows of power. If real discussion cannot be
undertaken, they may well pack up their mar
bles and go home.
It is with this in mind that we take note of
the petition being circulated on campus today.
It is a vindictive measure, aimed as much at
hurting LASSU as at improving the Commit
tee. But perhaps it is what is needed. As the
petition's originator, Tom Galbraith — an ex
student-government man himself —points out,
it is hoped that the petition will force the Legis
lature to reconsider what it has done —this
time with a little more perspective.
The Legislature last Thursday once again
bit off more than a significant part of the stu
dent body is willing to chew, swallow, and
digest.
Before voting to replace three of the five
student representatives on the Committee of
15 with more "forceful" individuals and as
serting its right to recall those representatives
at will, the Legislature engaged in an extensive
and thorough debate over the impending reso
lution—a debate that seemed to be lacking only
in a perspective of what an administrator or a
faculty member really is.
Most adult scholars at Stanford come to the
university not because they wish to be partici
pant to the political power plays of the Real
World, but rather because they enjoy the phy
sical calm and intellectual fennent of what
John Gardner and President Sterling call the
Inner City. It is a place for them where the
traumas of the greater society can be attacked
with perspective rather than with force. It is
a place where education and its chief medium,
discussion, are considered more important
than the physical and political battles for which
the university* is preparing its students.
The vast majority of the student body, as
LASSU is painfully aware, is more concerned
with education than it is with politics —espe-
cially student politics—and its resultant power
plays, such as that of last Thursday. But many
of these students are still rightfully interested
in improving the University community, the
setting in which that education takes place. It
comes as no surprise, then, that students out
side student government are interested in so
cial regulations, the Wilbur Hall situation, and
religion policy —for all of these affect the edu
cation one receives at Stanford.

It also comes as no surprise that when a real
opportunity for bringing much-needed reform
to the University comes along, students outside
student goveniment show an interest in it. The
Committee of 15 is just such an opportunity.
Because the Committee attempts to stay above
power politics, because it is a 'true forum in
which mature adults can rationally discuss the
heart of an issue, and because it is a chance for
the student to meet the teacher and the admin
istrator on an equal footing —the Committee,
with only advisory powers, ironically is more
respected than the law-making student legisla
ture. And, it is felt, it is necessary that it be
preserved as an effective body.
