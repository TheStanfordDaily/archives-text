## The 						B&O Plays Monopoly In LASSU's Sand Box 
### Mike Couzens 
There was a get-together last
Thursday in Room 320 to play
Monopoly. The board was big,
as there were over 60 players.
Teller for the Bank was a
soft - spoken statistician who
passed out play money in direct
relation to the vociferousness of
the participants.
People from Wilbur were in
vited, but they had all gone
trick-or-treating. And the frater
nity players were at home wait
ing for them to arrive with their
masks and paper bags.
Hotel on Park Place
A large group of players de
cided to try for a hotel on Park
Place. They had become known
by the name of one of their ear
lier acquisitions, the B&O rail
road.
Pooling their play money, the
railroad entrepreneurs jockeyed
for position. They praised one
another with lofty rhetoric,
thereby conniving other players
to join the pool.
One of their number, they
said proudly, was a marbles
champion in his youth. It was
alleged that he was the best
shooter in the room, and on
more than one occasion got

everyone so agitated that they
picked up their marbles and
went home.
Another, they said, was so ef
fective that at a different uni
versity he upset the game board,
and in the resulting confusion
was able to put several hotels
on Boardwalk.
There was only one hitch in
the plan. Park Place already has
a house on it, though the B&O
people denounced it as a
"shack." Clearly, they urged, it
was time for urban renewal.
A minority felt this would
over-extend the resources of the
players. If they plopped down
on the wrong square, the rents
could wipe them out they could
lose the game.
Collect and Go
And there were other dangers.
After they bought the hotel, it
would be several weeks before
they could pass "Go" and collect
$200. Worst of all, the Commu
nity Chest cards were stacked
against them.
Far better, a member object
ed, "But it's only a game!" He
drew a chance card and went
directly to jail.
