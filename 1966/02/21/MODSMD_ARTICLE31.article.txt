# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Worship And The Rights Of Jews 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Like others on the Stan-ford
c,impus I am genuinely grateful
to the Trustees for opening up
the possibility of worship on
campus by various religious
groups. A glaring anachronism
has thereby been removed from
the locale where the winds of
freedom blow.
But we must immediately un
derstand that the issue is not
fully resolved if worship is re
stricted solely to Mem or i al
Church. When one considers the
shocking history of Christian
treatment of the Jews, it would
be an act of particularly insen
sitivity to insist that Jews wor
ship in a Christian building,
with its inexpungeable Christian
symbolism, so reminiscent to the
Jews of centuries of persecu
tion. torture and discrimination
visited upon them in the name
of the Prince of Peace.
1 make the point now because
it would be intolerable to leave
to the Jewish members of the
Stanford community the burden
of insisting on another place for
their campus worship. On the
contrary, it is precisely the job
of Christians to honor and make
provision for the right of Jew
ish students to worship else
where on campus than in Me
morial Church.

• "My Own Views"
Editor, The Daily:
Friends' reactions to my let
ter. published in The Daily on
February 16 made me realize
that I had not succeeded in con
veying my thought properly. In
this letter, I used a stereotype,
namely that Americans are "big,
muscular, very clean ten-year
olds with a knack for compli
cated gadget ry and as much fi
nesse as a buffalo." I want to
make it absolutely clear that
this does not represent my per
sonal viewpoint. I have lived in
this country for three and a half
years, associating almost exclu
sively with Americans.
If I had held such a stereo
type, life would have been un
bearable and I would have had
to bail out long ago. However,
being astride two cultures, T can
not. help noticing that pro-con
ceived notions exist and are re
inforced in both. One of these
notions commonly found among

Europeans who have not or lit
tle associated with Americans,
is that Americans are: "big,
etc. . . The object of my letter
was to point out the fact that
manifestations such as Mr.
Just's poem were likely to re
inforce such a notion wherever
it exists and perhaps contribute
to its birth. It constituted a
value-judgement on my part in
the same way that his poem was
a value-judgement on another
person and her activities. That
the prejudice does exist among
Europeans is easily verifiable on
this campus and elsewhere.
I am not sure that a like state
of things can be avoided but it
is certainly an unfortunate one
for everybody concerned. My let
ter was dictated by the same
tender care which prompts a
bigamous husband to do every
thing possible for his two wives
to like each other. It goes with
out saying that, in writing it,
I was also expressing my indig
nation at Mr. Just's gross attack
against a very brave girl who
does not shield her convictions
behind facile versified clever
ness.

• Plain Twain
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to a letter in The
Daily concerning students of
American literature you may be
interested in what one of those
"big, muscular, very clean 10-
year-old" American adults,
Mark Twain, wrote in an article
entitled "The French and the
Comanches":
"Let us all aid in helping
the Frenchman. Let lis take to
out hearts this disparaged
and depreciated link between
man and the simian and raise
him up to brotherhood witli
ns."
W. r. CARSON
• Personal Response
Editor, The Daily:
. . . His accusation was a
personal one to the writer of
the poem, not to the American
people as a whole. It is interest
ing to note that most of the
complaints to this effect have
come from Frenchmen them
selves. One may agree or dis
agree with M. Delacroix' ideas
- or the way in which he ex
pressed them but 1 hope most

Americans would not take of
fense at this for the mere fact
that the speaker happens to be
a Frenchman.
It is a sad situation when one
cannot, because he is a foreign
er, express his opinions about
an individual without being con
demned for criticism of "his
host country."

• Inanity
. . . Another trait of French
intellectualism, of which the
joint letter of Messrs. Bessiere
and Diament is a perfect illus
tration, is the self-complacent
inanity of Flaubert's Bouvard
and Pecuchet.

• Plumbing Show
Editor, The Daily:
The current "Design for
Nuclear Research" show at the
Stanford Museum is a scandal.
It might better be called a
plumbing show. Naturally one
is aware today of the powerful
inspiration which industrial
forms offer to artists. When the
artists use these themes we have
art suitable to museum presen
tation; otherwise we have sim
ply bolts and nuts. In the logic
of this show the next exhibit
may very well be plates of food,
half empty bottles of wine and
bouquets of flowers in an at
tempt to emulate various of the
masterpieces of still life.
Still industrial design can be
an exciting aesthetic subject.
One has only to think of the
new rooms in the Museum of
Modern Art which contain vari
ous practical objects designed
to achieve the maximum aesthe
tic pleasure consonant with the
object's inherent function. But
where in the Stanford exhibit
are we shown anything like?
The grid for the laser beam,
the handsome golden bolt in a
still life arrangement with a
copper speckled disk, these ob

jects are pleasing to see, but
there is no suggestion that they
are anything more than the en
gineer's prosaic solution to his
problem. As luck would have it
they are attractive. That is not
art.
Among the objects on display
are distinctly amateurish archi
tectural models of various sec
tions of the SLAC complex, sug
gestive of a museum of science
presentation. The captions de
scribing every object in the show
derive from the same mentality,
except that most museums of
science make some concession
to the ignorance of the museum
goer. Instead of discussing the
aesthetic implications of the
various objects, the captions dis
cuss their function in hopeless
jargon.
The implications of this bi
zarre exhibit are not pleasant.
Is the museum staff so bank
rupt of ideas that they must
fall back on SLAC for a show?
Have they no access to any trav
eling shows which might relieve
the monotony of the offerings
this year in the temporary exhi
bition room? Why must the of
ficers of SLAC intrude them
selves everywhere? Is it not
enough that they have the tax
money, that they have torn up
the Stanford backlands, that
they have permission to deco
rate Woodside and environs with
electricity lines? What do they
want? Respectability? Accept
ance? Anyone, I believe, can
take a guided tour of SLAC,
and it is an extremely interest
ing experience. Let's leave the
tours out on the hills, however,
and return the museum galleries
to art.

• Pardon Me
Editor, The Daily:
There is a serious mistake in
my letter (The Daily, February
18). It is Rocco who was a Fas
cist. The Civ students are wor
ried that the psychologist Barbu
is a Fascist. Also, it is Malthus
and not Matthews.
MEL EDLESTEIN
• Moral Cowardiee
Editor, The Daily:
RE: the Democratic students
that have supposedly splintered

from the Stanford Young Demo
crats (Daily, Feb. 8).
Last week the present chair
man of this group came to me
and demanded (literally) to
know why the YD's weren't ac
tively supporting our President
in Vietnam ("as are the Young
Republicans"). I explained that
the club took a position last
quarter that was highly critical
of present policy in that area.
Nevertheless, I offered them the
use of the weekly mimeo sheet
that the YD's have begun to dis
tribute to various campus dormi
tories so that they could express
their dissent. They declined.
They were then informed that as
members they could introduce a
resolution supporting Johnson's
policies at a specially called
meeting. Thus far, they have
not submitted any such resolu
tion. As with the rest of the
membership, they were in
formed at the beginning of the
quarter that there were several
openings on the Executive Board"
Neither of them applied for any
of these.
Quoting from our first news
letter, the YD's here at Stanford
are seen "not as representing
any particular political doctrine,
but as an organization that pro
vides the machinery than can be
used by Democratic students of
almost any opinion." Eight fac
ulty members—and the majority
of them do not agree with pres
ent Democratic policies — have
joined our faculty associate pro
gram so as to specifically en
dorse this conception of the club.
Groups formed around one side
of a specific issue are not organ
izations but rather movements—
because they cannot outlive the
issue that gave birth to them—
and thus have no real connec
tion with the Democratic Party,
which is an organization. Neither
can they be dynamic (which is
not to say that they can't be vo
cal i for, with only one side rep
resented. productive debate can
not take place. A group wherein
all the members pat each other
on the back is sterile.
It would seem to indicate a
type of moral cowardice for in
telligent students to leave one
organization, not because their
dissenting voice in that organi
zation is stiffled, but because
they cannot bear the brunt of
contrasting opinion.
