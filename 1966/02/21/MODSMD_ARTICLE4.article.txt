# TRUSTEE DECISION
## Sectarian Worship Heralded 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
"The Trustees made the only deci
sion they could, given the facts. Now
that we no longer have to siphon off
our energies on a basically procedural
matter, we can address ourselves to
the problem of office space arid to
the expansion of the religious pro
gram at Stanford."
That was the reaction of Methodist
campus minister James Corson to the
Trustee declaration of last Thursday
allowing sectarian worship services
on campus.
"I am pleased and relieved that the
situation appears to have been satis
factorily resolved," he continued.
"The only question remaining seems
to be where the Jews and other non-
Christian groups will worship."
Concern for Non-Christians
Dean Richard Lyman, chairman of
the President's Committee on relig
ious activities, announced Friday that
he has called a meeting of the Com
mittee for late this week to discuss
the Trustee declaration.
In a statement released Friday, Ly
man said: "The Trustee resolution
speaks only of services in Memorial
Church.... I would find it hard to see
how a reasonable program of reli
gious activities could be developed
(if all worship other than Christian
is ruled out)."
Professor of Religious Studies Rob
ert McAfee Brown, also a member of
the Religion Committee, stated that
he is "very happy that a major hurdle
to freedom of worship on campus has
been overcome by the Trustees' ac
tion. I hope also that provision can
be made for services of worship for
those religious groups who in fidelity
to their own traditions cannot con

scientiously worship in a Christian
structure."
Chaplain R. M. M in to feels that
"there are no problems; all has been
discussed and we know what people
want. It's just a matter of administra
tive housekeeping.
"The decision," he continued, "will
be widely welcomed as a further ex
pression of religious cooperation at
Stanford. It is along the lines which
we have all been discussing. Recog
nizing the central place of worship
for all religious groups will ultimate
ly promote a deeper sense of unity
and enrich the total religious life of
our community.
Long-Standing Inequity
"A true ecumenical atmosphere is
our aim," he concluded, "and a more
lively sense of cooperation should be
produced by these new opportunities."
Father John Duryea, Catholic chap
lain to Stanford, stated he was "very
happy that the Trustees have spoken
and that this long-standing inequity
has been corrected. I hope that before
long a satisfactory schedule can be
worked out among the interested cler
gy and students."
He said he was "not greatly con
cerned about where I say mass; I
would prefer intimacy to formality."
Permission for him to say mass out
side of St. Ann's Chapel in Palo Alto
must be granted by the Archbishop
of San Francisco. "I wrote the Arch
bishop Friday and hope for an answer
by the end of the week," he said.
Praise For Cooperation
ASSU Vice President Clark Rrown
praised the Trustee decision. "I am
sure that the different groups will
take advantage of the trial period
and demonstrate that there is indeed
a genuine desire for sectarian worship
at Stanford."
"Certainly the President must be
congratulated in recognizing the
need for freedom of worship at Stan
ford and for forcefully taking it to
the Trustees," he said.
Successful resolution of the worship
question "is an example of what can
be done when varied elements of the
community work together on an area

of common concern to meet the needs
of the times," Corson stated.
"We welcome it as a progressive
action, complementing other actions
taken this year: the decision to give
the denominational ministers official
status by naming them chaplain's as
sociates and the intention of providing
office space for the ministers," he
said.
New Building Next
"The ultimate solution of the of
fice space problem will probably be
the construction of a building which
would include a small chapel to be
used by all faiths, an expanded vestry
library, offices for the ministers, and
related facilities," Corson stated.
"It is my opinion that many de
nominations would be willing to con
tribute to such a project in preference
to building separate denominational
facilities," he concluded.
"Since the future of the women's
clubhouse seems to be in doubt for
meeting places," added Father Du
ryea, "a church house would have
great advantage in the long run by
providing office space for all the min
isters together."
"No minister desires an on-campus
facility for just his own group," he
said.
"The Trustees made the only deci
sion they could, given the facts. Now
that we no longer have to siphon off
our energies on a basically procedural
matter, we can address ourselves to

Christian groups will worship."
Concern for Non-Christians
Dean Richard Lyman, chairman of
the President's Committee on relig
ious activities, announced Friday that
he has called a meeting of the Com
mittee for late this week to discuss
the Trustee declaration.
In a statement released Friday, Ly
man said: "The Trustee resolution
speaks only of services in Memorial
Church.... I would find it hard to see
how a reasonable program of reli
gious activities could be developed
(if all worship other than Christian
is ruled out)."
Professor of Religious Studies Rob
ert McAfee Brown, also a member of
the Religion Committee, stated that
he is "very happy that a major hurdle
to freedom of worship on campus has
been overcome by the Trustees' ac
tion. I hope also that provision can
be made for services of worship for
those religious groups who in fidelity
to their own traditions cannot con

scientiously worship in a Christian
structure."
Chaplain R. M. M in to feels that
"there are no problems; all has been
discussed and we know what people
want. It's just a matter of administra
tive housekeeping.
"The decision," he continued, "will
be widely welcomed as a further ex
pression of religious cooperation at
Stanford. It is along the lines which
we have all been discussing. Recog
nizing the central place of worship
for all religious groups will ultimate
ly promote a deeper sense of unity
and enrich the total religious life of
our community.
Long-Standing Inequity
"A true ecumenical atmosphere is
our aim," he concluded, "and a more
lively sense of cooperation should be
produced by these new opportunities."
Father John Duryea, Catholic chap
lain to Stanford, stated he was "very
happy that the Trustees have spoken
and that this long-standing inequity
has been corrected. I hope that before
long a satisfactory schedule can be
worked out among the interested cler
gy and students."
He said he was "not greatly con
cerned about where I say mass; I
would prefer intimacy to formality."
Permission for him to say mass out
side of St. Ann's Chapel in Palo Alto
must be granted by the Archbishop
of San Francisco. "I wrote the Arch
bishop Friday and hope for an answer
by the end of the week," he said.
Praise For Cooperation
ASSU Vice President Clark Rrown
praised the Trustee decision. "I am
sure that the different groups will
take advantage of the trial period
and demonstrate that there is indeed
a genuine desire for sectarian worship
at Stanford."
"Certainly the President must be
congratulated in recognizing the
need for freedom of worship at Stan
ford and for forcefully taking it to
the Trustees," he said.
Successful resolution of the worship
question "is an example of what can
be done when varied elements of the
community work together on an area

of common concern to meet the needs
of the times," Corson stated.
"We welcome it as a progressive
action, complementing other actions
taken this year: the decision to give
the denominational ministers official
status by naming them chaplain's as
sociates and the intention of providing
office space for the ministers," he
said.
New Building Next
"The ultimate solution of the of
fice space problem will probably be
the construction of a building which
would include a small chapel to be
used by all faiths, an expanded vestry
library, offices for the ministers, and
related facilities," Corson stated.
"It is my opinion that many de
nominations would be willing to con
tribute to such a project in preference
to building separate denominational
facilities," he concluded.
"Since the future of the women's
clubhouse seems to be in doubt for
meeting places," added Father Du
ryea, "a church house would have
great advantage in the long run by
providing office space for all the min
isters together."
"No minister desires an on-campus
facility for just his own group," he
said.
"The Trustees made the only deci
sion they could, given the facts. Now
that we no longer have to siphon off
our energies on a basically procedural
matter, we can address ourselves to
the problem of office space arid to
the expansion of the religious pro
gram at Stanford."
That was the reaction of Methodist
campus minister James Corson to the
Trustee declaration of last Thursday
allowing sectarian worship services
on campus.
"I am pleased and relieved that the
situation appears to have been satis
factorily resolved," he continued.

the Religion Committee, stated that
he is "very happy that a major hurdle
to freedom of worship on campus has
been overcome by the Trustees' ac
tion. I hope also that provision can
be made for services of worship for
those religious groups who in fidelity
to their own traditions cannot con

scientiously worship in a Christian
structure."
Chaplain R. M. M in to feels that
"there are no problems; all has been
discussed and we know what people
want. It's just a matter of administra
tive housekeeping.
"The decision," he continued, "will
be widely welcomed as a further ex
pression of religious cooperation at
Stanford. It is along the lines which
we have all been discussing. Recog
nizing the central place of worship
for all religious groups will ultimate
ly promote a deeper sense of unity
and enrich the total religious life of
our community.
Long-Standing Inequity
"A true ecumenical atmosphere is
our aim," he concluded, "and a more
lively sense of cooperation should be
produced by these new opportunities."
Father John Duryea, Catholic chap
lain to Stanford, stated he was "very
happy that the Trustees have spoken
and that this long-standing inequity
has been corrected. I hope that before
long a satisfactory schedule can be
worked out among the interested cler
gy and students."
He said he was "not greatly con
cerned about where I say mass; I
would prefer intimacy to formality."
Permission for him to say mass out
side of St. Ann's Chapel in Palo Alto
must be granted by the Archbishop
of San Francisco. "I wrote the Arch
bishop Friday and hope for an answer
by the end of the week," he said.
Praise For Cooperation
ASSU Vice President Clark Rrown
praised the Trustee decision. "I am
sure that the different groups will
take advantage of the trial period
and demonstrate that there is indeed
a genuine desire for sectarian worship
at Stanford."
"Certainly the President must be
congratulated in recognizing the
need for freedom of worship at Stan
ford and for forcefully taking it to
the Trustees," he said.
Successful resolution of the worship
question "is an example of what can
be done when varied elements of the
community work together on an area

of common concern to meet the needs
of the times," Corson stated.
"We welcome it as a progressive
action, complementing other actions
taken this year: the decision to give
the denominational ministers official
status by naming them chaplain's as
sociates and the intention of providing
office space for the ministers," he
said.
New Building Next
"The ultimate solution of the of
fice space problem will probably be
the construction of a building which
would include a small chapel to be
used by all faiths, an expanded vestry
library, offices for the ministers, and
related facilities," Corson stated.
"It is my opinion that many de
nominations would be willing to con
tribute to such a project in preference
to building separate denominational
facilities," he concluded.
"Since the future of the women's
clubhouse seems to be in doubt for
meeting places," added Father Du
ryea, "a church house would have
great advantage in the long run by
providing office space for all the min
isters together."
"No minister desires an on-campus
facility for just his own group," he
said.
