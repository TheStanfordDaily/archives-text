# Petition Seeks To Repeal LASSU's Recall Power
## 
### BARBARA SHAW 
A fight is shaping up over the Leg
islature's power to recall the student
members of the Committee of Fif
teen as petitions are being circulated
which would give LASSU "a vote of
no confidence" and repeal its action
of last Thursday.
LASSU recalled three of the five
student members of the Committee
Thursday evening because "a regret
table lack of communication between
the members of the Committee of
Five and the Legislature has caused
the Committee of Five to carry out
its duties ineffectively."
550 Signatures Needed
Feeling that the student body
would not support LASSU's action,
senior Tom Galbraith—freshman co
ordinator at Stern—invited a small
group of students to Stern Hall yes
terday to obtain the petitions to be
circulated in living groups.
If 550 signatures can be collected,
the issue could be put before the stu
dent body in a general election. About
300 signatures were obtained as The
Daily went to press. But Galbraith
hopes LASSU will reconsider its re
call of the three students and make
a general referendum unnecessary.
LASSU Rescind Its Action?
Attempting to insure that LASSU
rescind its recall resolution, the ad
hoc group is asking all representa
tives who were not at last Thursday's
meeting to be in attendance this week.
Those absent were mostly fraternity
members and freshmen involved in
rush activities who are expected to fa
vor the position outlined in the peti
tion.
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane said
yesterday that he thought the mem
bers were recalled because LASSU
thought of the Committee of Fifteen
as a negotiation group, and he im
plied that LASSU did not think the
student members were sufficiently
forceful negotiators.
Philosophies of Student Action
Disagreeing with Kadane's philoso
phy that students have to push the
administration to get any reform,
Galbraith said that there used to be
no cooperation at all between the ad
ministration and the students. "But
now," he said, "it's different — we
can and shoul get something done by
compromise."
"Putting the student members of
the Committee at the mercy of
LASSU," Galbraith said, "destroyed
the effectiveness of the Committee.
Furthermore, the new student mem
bers are not familiar with the work
the Committee has done so far. They
will have to start discussion of the
issues all over again."
"A very inflexible system would

evolve," Kadane said, "if LASSU were
prohibited from ever recalling any
student representative on a commit
tee.
