# The 						Committee Of 15— A Question Of Identity
## NEWS ANALYSIS 
### JIM SELMA Associate Editor 
"The members of the Committee
must be free to discuss items without
firm directives from their constitu
encies. The constituency may make
suggestions for recommendations,
but these are not binding on the in
dividual members of the Committee
of Fifteen." — Committee of Fifteen
Minutes, November 1, 1965.
The action of the Legislature last
Thursday evening reopened the de
bate on the role of the Committee of

Fifteen at time when it appeared that
group was at last gaining a sense of
its own identity.
The Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished last September by a joint
resolution of the Legislature, the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Academic
Council, and the President of the Uni
versity as an advisory body which
might make recommendations on
various issues referred to it by any
of the three groups. Composed of five
faculty members appointed by the
Executive Committee of the Academ
ic Council, five members of the Ad
ministration appointed by the Presi
dent, and five students appointed by
the Speaker of the Legislature, the
Committee began meeting November
1, 1965.
No Power, But Influence
Under its procedures, Committee
discussions and individual members'
voting records are confidential mate
rial and not open to the public. How
ever, minutes of each meeting are
available to the press. The secrecy is
designed to provide the members
maximum freedom in expressing their
views without incurring outside dis
approval. Committee Chairman Philip
Rhinelander says he "would seriously
question the value of the existing com
mittee" if the privilege of confidence
were removed.
As an advisory body, the Commit
tee has "no power, but a lot of influ
ence," in the words of Committee sec
retary Sanford Dornbuseh. That in
fluence has yet to manifest itself.
However, the committee is on the
verge of releasing in recommenda
tions of judicial procedures and will
soon take up the liquor issue once the
Presidential Committee on Student
Affairs and Services has completed
its work.
Advise or Negotiate?
The committee does possess what
one student member has called "pre
sumptive ability." By the nature of its
membership a Committee recommen
dation is likely to carry a good deal
of weight with the administration.
Faculty representative Ralph Smith
told The Daily "the Committee was a
response to the lack of adequate ave
nues of communication between stu
dents, faculty, and administration"
which has been underlined by the
wave of campus activism last year.
Yet the Legislature's recall of two
of the student representatives indi
cates certain doubts about the nature
of these "avenues." One prominent
student legislator recently suggested
that LASSU had been viewing the
Committee as a negotiating body for
campus disputes rather than as an
advisory body.
Rhinelander has repeated on several
occasions that the Committee is not
a super-committee designed to usurp
the function of existing groups. "Our
function is not to negotiate but to en
courage others to negotiate." The
Committee's statement of the Union
Housing dispute reflected this atti
tude:
Individualism Necessary
"We are impressed by the case made
(by the Union Residents) and hopeful
that every effort will be made to al
leviate such inconvenience. We un
derstand that the Dean of Undergrad
uate Education is eager to meet an au
thorized delegation of Union resi
dents."
Rhinelander admits that "some peo
ple have been impatient with the Com
mittee," but he points out that the
body has neither executive nor legis
lative authority nor was intended to
have such powers.

In theory, committee members are
free to act as individuals without ref
erence to their constituency. Some
members believe they can serve both
their own views and those of their
constituency at the same time with
no conflict. However, all agree indi
vidual freedom is essential.
Problem of Contact
Mike Couzens, who was removed
from the Committee by Legislative
action, believes the Committee is
able to resolve differences between
the law-making bodies of the Univer
sity—LASSU, the Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council and the
President's Office," Couzens com
mented yesterday. Accordingly, each
of the three groups must be in close
contact with its representatives to the
Committee.
But in Couzens view, "the closer the
contact, the wider the breach will be
come among the deliberating bodies,"
and hence a decrease in the chances of
resolving problems.
Up until Friday, Rhinelander be
lieved the Committee had come to a
consensus on the role of the body and
of each member. However, the recall
of two students showed that LASSU
was dealing with the committee as an
executive body, which Rhinelander in
sists it is not.
LASSU Gives Orders
Rhinelander and other faculty rep
resentatives recognized the Legisla
ture's right to make changes in stu
dent members of the Committee. How
ever, if those changes were caused by
LASSU's belief that students had
failed to follow the wishes of the Leg
islature in their committee voting,
Rhinelander noted that LASSU either
had a misconception of the Committee
or was trying to change its nature.
At the Legislature meeting Febru
ary 10, Martin Gerry asked Student
Body President Sandy Mackenzie, one
of the five students on the Committee
of Fifteen whether he would "vigor
ously and consistently put forth the
views adopted by this body (LASSU)
when you meet with Committee of
Fifteen." Mackenzie's answer was a
flat "No."
Mackenzie survived last Thursday's
shake-up. He was renamed to the Com
mittee on a resolution that gave Ger
ry one of the five student seats and
specifically made all five accountable
to the Legislature in their action be
fore the Committee of Fifteen.
Report Slowed
The change in committee personnel
has already taken its effect. Much of
last Friday's meeting was spent in
discussing procedural questions
which had been resolved satisfactorily
by the former representatives. The
Committee's report on the revision of
judicial procedures has been stalled
because the two students who were
on the sub-committee , were deposed
by the Legislature. The Committee
had progressed the furthest in this
area, but Rhinelander suggested that
the issue might have to go back to
sub-committee for review by the new
members. By a 7 to 6 vote the Com
mittee decided to maintain the secrecy
of its meetings.

must be free to discuss items without
firm directives from their constitu
encies. The constituency may make
suggestions for recommendations,
but these are not binding on the in
dividual members of the Committee
of Fifteen." — Committee of Fifteen
Minutes, November 1, 1965.
The action of the Legislature last
Thursday evening reopened the de
bate on the role of the Committee of

Fifteen at time when it appeared that
group was at last gaining a sense of
its own identity.
The Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished last September by a joint
resolution of the Legislature, the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Academic
Council, and the President of the Uni
versity as an advisory body which
might make recommendations on
various issues referred to it by any
of the three groups. Composed of five
faculty members appointed by the
Executive Committee of the Academ
ic Council, five members of the Ad
ministration appointed by the Presi
dent, and five students appointed by
the Speaker of the Legislature, the
Committee began meeting November
1, 1965.
No Power, But Influence
Under its procedures, Committee
discussions and individual members'
voting records are confidential mate
rial and not open to the public. How
ever, minutes of each meeting are
available to the press. The secrecy is
designed to provide the members
maximum freedom in expressing their
views without incurring outside dis
approval. Committee Chairman Philip
Rhinelander says he "would seriously
question the value of the existing com
mittee" if the privilege of confidence
were removed.
As an advisory body, the Commit
tee has "no power, but a lot of influ
ence," in the words of Committee sec
retary Sanford Dornbuseh. That in
fluence has yet to manifest itself.
However, the committee is on the
verge of releasing in recommenda
tions of judicial procedures and will
soon take up the liquor issue once the
Presidential Committee on Student
Affairs and Services has completed
its work.
Advise or Negotiate?
The committee does possess what
one student member has called "pre
sumptive ability." By the nature of its
membership a Committee recommen
dation is likely to carry a good deal
of weight with the administration.
Faculty representative Ralph Smith
told The Daily "the Committee was a
response to the lack of adequate ave
nues of communication between stu
dents, faculty, and administration"
which has been underlined by the
wave of campus activism last year.
Yet the Legislature's recall of two
of the student representatives indi
cates certain doubts about the nature
of these "avenues." One prominent
student legislator recently suggested
that LASSU had been viewing the
Committee as a negotiating body for
campus disputes rather than as an
advisory body.
Rhinelander has repeated on several
occasions that the Committee is not
a super-committee designed to usurp
the function of existing groups. "Our
function is not to negotiate but to en
courage others to negotiate." The
Committee's statement of the Union
Housing dispute reflected this atti
tude:
Individualism Necessary
"We are impressed by the case made
(by the Union Residents) and hopeful
that every effort will be made to al
leviate such inconvenience. We un
derstand that the Dean of Undergrad
uate Education is eager to meet an au
thorized delegation of Union resi
dents."
Rhinelander admits that "some peo
ple have been impatient with the Com
mittee," but he points out that the
body has neither executive nor legis
lative authority nor was intended to
have such powers.

In theory, committee members are
free to act as individuals without ref
erence to their constituency. Some
members believe they can serve both
their own views and those of their
constituency at the same time with
no conflict. However, all agree indi
vidual freedom is essential.
Problem of Contact
Mike Couzens, who was removed
from the Committee by Legislative
action, believes the Committee is
able to resolve differences between
the law-making bodies of the Univer
sity—LASSU, the Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council and the
President's Office," Couzens com
mented yesterday. Accordingly, each
of the three groups must be in close
contact with its representatives to the
Committee.
But in Couzens view, "the closer the
contact, the wider the breach will be
come among the deliberating bodies,"
and hence a decrease in the chances of
resolving problems.
Up until Friday, Rhinelander be
lieved the Committee had come to a
consensus on the role of the body and
of each member. However, the recall
of two students showed that LASSU
was dealing with the committee as an
executive body, which Rhinelander in
sists it is not.
LASSU Gives Orders
Rhinelander and other faculty rep
resentatives recognized the Legisla
ture's right to make changes in stu
dent members of the Committee. How
ever, if those changes were caused by
LASSU's belief that students had
failed to follow the wishes of the Leg
islature in their committee voting,
Rhinelander noted that LASSU either
had a misconception of the Committee
or was trying to change its nature.
At the Legislature meeting Febru
ary 10, Martin Gerry asked Student
Body President Sandy Mackenzie, one
of the five students on the Committee
of Fifteen whether he would "vigor
ously and consistently put forth the
views adopted by this body (LASSU)
when you meet with Committee of
Fifteen." Mackenzie's answer was a
flat "No."
Mackenzie survived last Thursday's
shake-up. He was renamed to the Com
mittee on a resolution that gave Ger
ry one of the five student seats and
specifically made all five accountable
to the Legislature in their action be
fore the Committee of Fifteen.
Report Slowed
The change in committee personnel
has already taken its effect. Much of
last Friday's meeting was spent in
discussing procedural questions
which had been resolved satisfactorily
by the former representatives. The
Committee's report on the revision of
judicial procedures has been stalled
because the two students who were
on the sub-committee , were deposed
by the Legislature. The Committee
had progressed the furthest in this
area, but Rhinelander suggested that
the issue might have to go back to
sub-committee for review by the new
members. By a 7 to 6 vote the Com
mittee decided to maintain the secrecy
of its meetings.

but these are not binding on the in
dividual members of the Committee
of Fifteen." — Committee of Fifteen
Minutes, November 1, 1965.
The action of the Legislature last
Thursday evening reopened the de
bate on the role of the Committee of

Fifteen at time when it appeared that
group was at last gaining a sense of
its own identity.
The Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished last September by a joint
resolution of the Legislature, the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Academic
Council, and the President of the Uni
versity as an advisory body which
might make recommendations on
various issues referred to it by any
of the three groups. Composed of five
faculty members appointed by the
Executive Committee of the Academ
ic Council, five members of the Ad
ministration appointed by the Presi
dent, and five students appointed by
the Speaker of the Legislature, the
Committee began meeting November
1, 1965.
No Power, But Influence
Under its procedures, Committee
discussions and individual members'
voting records are confidential mate
rial and not open to the public. How
ever, minutes of each meeting are
available to the press. The secrecy is
designed to provide the members
maximum freedom in expressing their
views without incurring outside dis
approval. Committee Chairman Philip
Rhinelander says he "would seriously
question the value of the existing com
mittee" if the privilege of confidence
were removed.
As an advisory body, the Commit
tee has "no power, but a lot of influ
ence," in the words of Committee sec
retary Sanford Dornbuseh. That in
fluence has yet to manifest itself.
However, the committee is on the
verge of releasing in recommenda
tions of judicial procedures and will
soon take up the liquor issue once the
Presidential Committee on Student
Affairs and Services has completed
its work.
Advise or Negotiate?
The committee does possess what
one student member has called "pre
sumptive ability." By the nature of its
membership a Committee recommen
dation is likely to carry a good deal
of weight with the administration.
Faculty representative Ralph Smith
told The Daily "the Committee was a
response to the lack of adequate ave
nues of communication between stu
dents, faculty, and administration"
which has been underlined by the
wave of campus activism last year.
Yet the Legislature's recall of two
of the student representatives indi
cates certain doubts about the nature
of these "avenues." One prominent
student legislator recently suggested
that LASSU had been viewing the
Committee as a negotiating body for
campus disputes rather than as an
advisory body.
Rhinelander has repeated on several
occasions that the Committee is not
a super-committee designed to usurp
the function of existing groups. "Our
function is not to negotiate but to en
courage others to negotiate." The
Committee's statement of the Union
Housing dispute reflected this atti
tude:
Individualism Necessary
"We are impressed by the case made
(by the Union Residents) and hopeful
that every effort will be made to al
leviate such inconvenience. We un
derstand that the Dean of Undergrad
uate Education is eager to meet an au
thorized delegation of Union resi
dents."
Rhinelander admits that "some peo
ple have been impatient with the Com
mittee," but he points out that the
body has neither executive nor legis
lative authority nor was intended to
have such powers.

In theory, committee members are
free to act as individuals without ref
erence to their constituency. Some
members believe they can serve both
their own views and those of their
constituency at the same time with
no conflict. However, all agree indi
vidual freedom is essential.
Problem of Contact
Mike Couzens, who was removed
from the Committee by Legislative
action, believes the Committee is
able to resolve differences between
the law-making bodies of the Univer
sity—LASSU, the Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council and the
President's Office," Couzens com
mented yesterday. Accordingly, each
of the three groups must be in close
contact with its representatives to the
Committee.
But in Couzens view, "the closer the
contact, the wider the breach will be
come among the deliberating bodies,"
and hence a decrease in the chances of
resolving problems.
Up until Friday, Rhinelander be
lieved the Committee had come to a
consensus on the role of the body and
of each member. However, the recall
of two students showed that LASSU
was dealing with the committee as an
executive body, which Rhinelander in
sists it is not.
LASSU Gives Orders
Rhinelander and other faculty rep
resentatives recognized the Legisla
ture's right to make changes in stu
dent members of the Committee. How
ever, if those changes were caused by
LASSU's belief that students had
failed to follow the wishes of the Leg
islature in their committee voting,
Rhinelander noted that LASSU either
had a misconception of the Committee
or was trying to change its nature.
At the Legislature meeting Febru
ary 10, Martin Gerry asked Student
Body President Sandy Mackenzie, one
of the five students on the Committee
of Fifteen whether he would "vigor
ously and consistently put forth the
views adopted by this body (LASSU)
when you meet with Committee of
Fifteen." Mackenzie's answer was a
flat "No."
Mackenzie survived last Thursday's
shake-up. He was renamed to the Com
mittee on a resolution that gave Ger
ry one of the five student seats and
specifically made all five accountable
to the Legislature in their action be
fore the Committee of Fifteen.
Report Slowed
The change in committee personnel
has already taken its effect. Much of
last Friday's meeting was spent in
discussing procedural questions
which had been resolved satisfactorily
by the former representatives. The
Committee's report on the revision of
judicial procedures has been stalled
because the two students who were
on the sub-committee , were deposed
by the Legislature. The Committee
had progressed the furthest in this
area, but Rhinelander suggested that
the issue might have to go back to
sub-committee for review by the new
members. By a 7 to 6 vote the Com
mittee decided to maintain the secrecy
of its meetings.
"The members of the Committee
must be free to discuss items without
firm directives from their constitu
encies. The constituency may make
suggestions for recommendations,
but these are not binding on the in
dividual members of the Committee
