Peace, Peace, There Is No Peace
The dream of peace is as old as man. The ancient Jewish prophet
Isaiah looked to the golden age when man would war no more, "It shall
come to pass in the latter days," he wrote, "the mountain of the house of
the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall
be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it, and many
people shall come and say: 'Come let us go up to the mountain of the
Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and
that we may walk in his paths.' For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and
the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the na
tions, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords
into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift
up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore" (Isaiah 2).
Seven hundred years later when asked by men when peace would
come, Jesus Christ said, "Take heed that no one leads you astray . . . you
will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for
this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will raise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and
earthquakes in various places; all this is but the beginning of the suffer
ings" Matthew 24).
Jesus Christ, the Messiah of the world, holds the key to peace, ac
cording to the Bible. Predicting the birth and earthly life of Jesus Christ,
Isaiah also wrote, "The people who walked in darkness have seen a great
light, those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light
shined . . . For every boot of the trampling warrior in battle tumult, and
every garment rolled in blood, will be burned as fuel for the fire. For to
us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon
his shoulder, and his name will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty
God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his govern
ment and of peace there will be no end" (Isaiah 9).
Though time rolls by and the centuries mount, God's great plans for
peace on earth await fulfillment, but will take place! Jesus Christ, the
Coming King, will soon be here to bring an end to war. The peace of
God, which starts within, is yours today if you'll only ask. Jesus Christ
is just a prayer away. Why not take His peace today—inside where it
really counts?

us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon
his shoulder, and his name will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty
God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his govern
ment and of peace there will be no end" (Isaiah 9).
Though time rolls by and the centuries mount, God's great plans for
peace on earth await fulfillment, but will take place! Jesus Christ, the
Coming King, will soon be here to bring an end to war. The peace of
God, which starts within, is yours today if you'll only ask. Jesus Christ
is just a prayer away. Why not take His peace today—inside where it
really counts?

Peace, Peace, There Is No Peace
The dream of peace is as old as man. The ancient Jewish prophet
Isaiah looked to the golden age when man would war no more, "It shall
come to pass in the latter days," he wrote, "the mountain of the house of
the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall
be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it, and many
people shall come and say: 'Come let us go up to the mountain of the
Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and
that we may walk in his paths.' For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and
the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the na
tions, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords
into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift
up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore" (Isaiah 2).
Seven hundred years later when asked by men when peace would
come, Jesus Christ said, "Take heed that no one leads you astray . . . you
will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for
this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will raise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and
earthquakes in various places; all this is but the beginning of the suffer
ings" Matthew 24).
Jesus Christ, the Messiah of the world, holds the key to peace, ac
cording to the Bible. Predicting the birth and earthly life of Jesus Christ,
Isaiah also wrote, "The people who walked in darkness have seen a great
light, those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light
shined . . . For every boot of the trampling warrior in battle tumult, and
every garment rolled in blood, will be burned as fuel for the fire. For to
us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon
his shoulder, and his name will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty
God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his govern
ment and of peace there will be no end" (Isaiah 9).
