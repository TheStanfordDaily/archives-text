* SUZUKI!
It's no use. He can't hear you.
Some motorcycles are so noisy
that screaming is demanded.
But not Suzuki. The efficient
2-stroke engine is spirited,
but civilized. To purr, Not roar.
Attention to details help, too.
Like rubber engine mounts to
muffle sound.
So be quiet!
And get a Suzuki. "?
