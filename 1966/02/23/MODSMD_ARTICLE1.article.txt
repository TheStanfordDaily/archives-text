# IBM 7090 Plays Cupid As Match Hatches Love
## 
### KIRK HANEN 
How much have computer scientists helped
the Stanford man in his endless battle against
the "Ratio?"
With the number of unmarried men cur
rently running 2.8 times that of unmarried
women, Ilarvard-based Operation Match, the
only computerized dat'ng scheme of its kind,
has arrived on the Farm none too soon.
Operation Match hopes to give a complete
facelifting to the "old" method of making
Miss into Mrs. Al least Jeff Tarr, a 21-year
old Harvard senior who masterminded the
project, will be doing his best to hasten the
process.
Though boy-meets-girl is older than love
itself, Tarr and his associates at Compatibil
ity Research, Inc. (Operation Match's parent
company) have put the game in "Jet Age"
perspective in little over a year.
The mechanics of Op Match are simple:
male and female students fill out a question
naire specially designed to evaluate there

spondant's dating and basic personality as
well as that of his self-chosen "ideal date."
After mailing the questionnaire along with
$3 to one of 31 regionally-based centers, the
respondent receives a list complete with
names, addresses, and phone numbers of from
5 to 14 potentially compatible blind dates who
reside within his or her area.
These are the matches deemed best by the
IBM 7090 computer based on the respondant's
desirability to the opposite sex as well as their
desirability to the respondant.
Tell-Tale Test
Items included in Op Match's 105-question
multiple choice "Quantitative Personality
Projection Test" range from the sublime ("Do
you consider yourself sexually experienced?",
"How important is it that your date share
your attitudes toward sex?") to the ridicu
lously impertinent ("Do you believe in a God
who answers prayer?")
Whether or not the test really takes the
uncertainty out of dating, it promises to be
amusing. One query, part of a section de

signed to measure one's reaction to specific
situations, reads:
"Your roommate gets you a blind date for
a big dance. Good looking, your roommate
says. When you meet your date, you're sure
it's your roommate who's blind—your date is
friendly, b u t embarrassingly unattractive.
You:
"(1) Suggest going to a movie instead.
"(2) monopolize your roommate's date,
leaving him one noble alternative.
"(3) dance with your date, smiling weakly,
but end the evening as early as possible.
"(4) act very friendly the whole time and
run the risk of getting trapped into a second
date."
Match at Stanford
How has Op Match filled the needs of men
and women on the Farm? Besides providing
a well-received source of dates, it has also
proved to have drawbacks.
For the Stanford man involved in Op Match,
the greatest problem seems to be one of dis
tance. Most found themselves traveling both

north and south to meet their matches. As
one graduate student put it:
"It gives you one helluvalot of dates if
you've got the time to pursue girls in Berke
ley or San Jose."
Both UC, with a 2 to 1 ratio, and SJS, with
a 1.1 to 1 ratio, have provided greener pas
tures than predominantly-male Stanford.
Self-Esteem
The cost of gasoline isn't the only drawback
inherent in driving to Berkeley or San Jose;
there's also the matter of self-esteem:
"It lowers a man's stature when the girl
knows you're so desperate you came 35 miles
to buy her a cup of coffee," said one male
summarizing the problem.
For the Stanford woman, Op Match seems
to provide a means for meeting the type of
male whom she wouldn't encounter in her
everyday circulation on campus. Generally,
women of the Farm used Op Match to supple
ment already busy "routine" dating schedules.
The thrill-seeking woman can manipulate her
questionnaire in any of a hundred ways in

seeking an off beat personality, while remain
ing completely truthful about herself. Several
girls reported that their matches had enlight
ened them on subjects ranging from LSD,
"pot," and "hash" to drum beating.
The Thrill S*vker
Perhaps the best evidence of this technique
in action is the following letter received by
a Stanford male participant two days before
the girl's name came to him in the mail:
"Dear ,
"The computers have matched us! Since I
have little faith in machines and multiple
choice tests, I have two questions. Do you
smoke pot or take LSD? Have you dug Dylan
for at least one year?
"If so, the computer is a groove and please
contact me soon.
"Love,-
Although Op Match is designed to take the
"hit or miss' out of blind dates, both decep
tion on the part of the respondants and errors
on the part of the computer creep in to bug
the system, making common
such complaints as:
"By the time I got to her, she
was married," "Either she lied
or I greatly overestimated my
personality," and"I called up
one girl and 15 other guys had
called her already."
Lost Amateur Status
At least one Stanfordite found
out about this deception the
hard way. After receiving his
"ideal dates" he called the first
one on the list and arranged a
meeting. Not until he picked
her up did he learn that she was
a divorced mother of two with
immediate remarriage on her
mind. He fared no better with
the next one (she was a widow)
and gave up in disgust.
Errors in names, addresses,
and telephone numbers are not
uncommon either. One girl's
name was printed as Taryn, in
stead of Charyn. She later found
out that many of the men who
got her name thought she was
a foreigner and put her on the
end of their lists.
Though Op Match has provid
ed its share of professional crit
icism. Stanford's noted profes
sor of phychology, Dr. Ernest
R. Hilgard, characterized Op
Match as "a commercial gim
mick—not a scientific operation
by any means. It's unable to
deal with the subtle problems
of matching two people."
Arnold S. Feldman, an asso
cite professor of sociology at
Northwestern, remains skepti
cal in a lighter vein:
"Machines don't do anything
1,000 Chinese can't do with aba
cuses, and I wouldn't want 1,000
Chinese picking a date for me."
Popularity Zooming
Whatever the drawbacks, the
national popularity Of Op Match
is unquestionable. Its over
whelming success is a story best
told in figures. This fall, Com
patibility Research's 31 area
centers expedited some 80,000
forms. Expected results from
the run beginning this spring
are 300,000, to be handled by
18 additional centers.
Tarr, whose Compatibility Re

search, Inc., grew out of an idea
from his undergraduate thesis
in social relations, has hopes of
founding a travel service which
will provide European tours for
computer-gathered groups this
summer.
Also in view are an Operation
Match magazfne, and a program
offering students attractive dis
counts on lodging and entertain
ment facilities.
Probably the brightest star on
the computer horizon is what
Tarr and company call "Real-
Time." It will make it possible
for anyone on campus at any
time to fill fn a questionnaire
on a keyboard teletype hooked
up to a central computer. In
seconds, the computer promises
to deliver the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of five
ideal dates located within driv
ing range.
Thus, with the computer revo
lution of the 60's dominating
almost every field of human en
deavor, the age of "instant love"
may not be long in coming.

facelifting to the "old" method of making
Miss into Mrs. Al least Jeff Tarr, a 21-year
old Harvard senior who masterminded the
project, will be doing his best to hasten the
process.
Though boy-meets-girl is older than love
itself, Tarr and his associates at Compatibil
ity Research, Inc. (Operation Match's parent
company) have put the game in "Jet Age"
perspective in little over a year.
The mechanics of Op Match are simple:
male and female students fill out a question
naire specially designed to evaluate there

spondant's dating and basic personality as
well as that of his self-chosen "ideal date."
After mailing the questionnaire along with
$3 to one of 31 regionally-based centers, the
respondent receives a list complete with
names, addresses, and phone numbers of from
5 to 14 potentially compatible blind dates who
reside within his or her area.
These are the matches deemed best by the
IBM 7090 computer based on the respondant's
desirability to the opposite sex as well as their
desirability to the respondant.
Tell-Tale Test
Items included in Op Match's 105-question
multiple choice "Quantitative Personality
Projection Test" range from the sublime ("Do
you consider yourself sexually experienced?",
"How important is it that your date share
your attitudes toward sex?") to the ridicu
lously impertinent ("Do you believe in a God
who answers prayer?")
Whether or not the test really takes the
uncertainty out of dating, it promises to be
amusing. One query, part of a section de

signed to measure one's reaction to specific
situations, reads:
"Your roommate gets you a blind date for
a big dance. Good looking, your roommate
says. When you meet your date, you're sure
it's your roommate who's blind—your date is
friendly, b u t embarrassingly unattractive.
You:
"(1) Suggest going to a movie instead.
"(2) monopolize your roommate's date,
leaving him one noble alternative.
"(3) dance with your date, smiling weakly,
but end the evening as early as possible.
"(4) act very friendly the whole time and
run the risk of getting trapped into a second
date."
Match at Stanford
How has Op Match filled the needs of men
and women on the Farm? Besides providing
a well-received source of dates, it has also
proved to have drawbacks.
For the Stanford man involved in Op Match,
the greatest problem seems to be one of dis
tance. Most found themselves traveling both

north and south to meet their matches. As
one graduate student put it:
"It gives you one helluvalot of dates if
you've got the time to pursue girls in Berke
ley or San Jose."
Both UC, with a 2 to 1 ratio, and SJS, with
a 1.1 to 1 ratio, have provided greener pas
tures than predominantly-male Stanford.
Self-Esteem
The cost of gasoline isn't the only drawback
inherent in driving to Berkeley or San Jose;
there's also the matter of self-esteem:
"It lowers a man's stature when the girl
knows you're so desperate you came 35 miles
to buy her a cup of coffee," said one male
summarizing the problem.
For the Stanford woman, Op Match seems
to provide a means for meeting the type of
male whom she wouldn't encounter in her
everyday circulation on campus. Generally,
women of the Farm used Op Match to supple
ment already busy "routine" dating schedules.
The thrill-seeking woman can manipulate her
questionnaire in any of a hundred ways in

seeking an off beat personality, while remain
ing completely truthful about herself. Several
girls reported that their matches had enlight
ened them on subjects ranging from LSD,
"pot," and "hash" to drum beating.
The Thrill S*vker
Perhaps the best evidence of this technique
in action is the following letter received by
a Stanford male participant two days before
the girl's name came to him in the mail:
"Dear ,
"The computers have matched us! Since I
have little faith in machines and multiple
choice tests, I have two questions. Do you
smoke pot or take LSD? Have you dug Dylan
for at least one year?
"If so, the computer is a groove and please
contact me soon.
"Love,-
Although Op Match is designed to take the
"hit or miss' out of blind dates, both decep
tion on the part of the respondants and errors
on the part of the computer creep in to bug
the system, making common
such complaints as:
"By the time I got to her, she
was married," "Either she lied
or I greatly overestimated my
personality," and"I called up
one girl and 15 other guys had
called her already."
Lost Amateur Status
At least one Stanfordite found
out about this deception the
hard way. After receiving his
"ideal dates" he called the first
one on the list and arranged a
meeting. Not until he picked
her up did he learn that she was
a divorced mother of two with
immediate remarriage on her
mind. He fared no better with
the next one (she was a widow)
and gave up in disgust.
Errors in names, addresses,
and telephone numbers are not
uncommon either. One girl's
name was printed as Taryn, in
stead of Charyn. She later found
out that many of the men who
got her name thought she was
a foreigner and put her on the
end of their lists.
Though Op Match has provid
ed its share of professional crit
icism. Stanford's noted profes
sor of phychology, Dr. Ernest
R. Hilgard, characterized Op
Match as "a commercial gim
mick—not a scientific operation
by any means. It's unable to
deal with the subtle problems
of matching two people."
Arnold S. Feldman, an asso
cite professor of sociology at
Northwestern, remains skepti
cal in a lighter vein:
"Machines don't do anything
1,000 Chinese can't do with aba
cuses, and I wouldn't want 1,000
Chinese picking a date for me."
Popularity Zooming
Whatever the drawbacks, the
national popularity Of Op Match
is unquestionable. Its over
whelming success is a story best
told in figures. This fall, Com
patibility Research's 31 area
centers expedited some 80,000
forms. Expected results from
the run beginning this spring
are 300,000, to be handled by
18 additional centers.
Tarr, whose Compatibility Re

search, Inc., grew out of an idea
from his undergraduate thesis
in social relations, has hopes of
founding a travel service which
will provide European tours for
computer-gathered groups this
summer.
Also in view are an Operation
Match magazfne, and a program
offering students attractive dis
counts on lodging and entertain
ment facilities.
Probably the brightest star on
the computer horizon is what
Tarr and company call "Real-
Time." It will make it possible
for anyone on campus at any
time to fill fn a questionnaire
on a keyboard teletype hooked
up to a central computer. In
seconds, the computer promises
to deliver the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of five
ideal dates located within driv
ing range.
Thus, with the computer revo

almost every field of human en
deavor, the age of "instant love"
may not be long in coming.

company) have put the game in "Jet Age"
perspective in little over a year.
The mechanics of Op Match are simple:
male and female students fill out a question
naire specially designed to evaluate there

spondant's dating and basic personality as
well as that of his self-chosen "ideal date."
After mailing the questionnaire along with
$3 to one of 31 regionally-based centers, the
respondent receives a list complete with
names, addresses, and phone numbers of from
5 to 14 potentially compatible blind dates who
reside within his or her area.
These are the matches deemed best by the
IBM 7090 computer based on the respondant's
desirability to the opposite sex as well as their
desirability to the respondant.
Tell-Tale Test
Items included in Op Match's 105-question
multiple choice "Quantitative Personality
Projection Test" range from the sublime ("Do
you consider yourself sexually experienced?",
"How important is it that your date share
your attitudes toward sex?") to the ridicu
lously impertinent ("Do you believe in a God
who answers prayer?")
Whether or not the test really takes the
uncertainty out of dating, it promises to be
amusing. One query, part of a section de

signed to measure one's reaction to specific
situations, reads:
"Your roommate gets you a blind date for
a big dance. Good looking, your roommate
says. When you meet your date, you're sure
it's your roommate who's blind—your date is
friendly, b u t embarrassingly unattractive.
You:
"(1) Suggest going to a movie instead.
"(2) monopolize your roommate's date,
leaving him one noble alternative.
"(3) dance with your date, smiling weakly,
but end the evening as early as possible.
"(4) act very friendly the whole time and
run the risk of getting trapped into a second
date."
Match at Stanford
How has Op Match filled the needs of men
and women on the Farm? Besides providing
a well-received source of dates, it has also
proved to have drawbacks.
For the Stanford man involved in Op Match,
the greatest problem seems to be one of dis
tance. Most found themselves traveling both

north and south to meet their matches. As
one graduate student put it:
"It gives you one helluvalot of dates if
you've got the time to pursue girls in Berke
ley or San Jose."
Both UC, with a 2 to 1 ratio, and SJS, with
a 1.1 to 1 ratio, have provided greener pas
tures than predominantly-male Stanford.
Self-Esteem
The cost of gasoline isn't the only drawback
inherent in driving to Berkeley or San Jose;
there's also the matter of self-esteem:
"It lowers a man's stature when the girl
knows you're so desperate you came 35 miles
to buy her a cup of coffee," said one male
summarizing the problem.
For the Stanford woman, Op Match seems
to provide a means for meeting the type of
male whom she wouldn't encounter in her
everyday circulation on campus. Generally,
women of the Farm used Op Match to supple
ment already busy "routine" dating schedules.
The thrill-seeking woman can manipulate her
questionnaire in any of a hundred ways in

seeking an off beat personality, while remain
ing completely truthful about herself. Several
girls reported that their matches had enlight
ened them on subjects ranging from LSD,
"pot," and "hash" to drum beating.
The Thrill S*vker
Perhaps the best evidence of this technique
in action is the following letter received by
a Stanford male participant two days before
the girl's name came to him in the mail:
"Dear ,
"The computers have matched us! Since I
have little faith in machines and multiple
choice tests, I have two questions. Do you
smoke pot or take LSD? Have you dug Dylan
for at least one year?
"If so, the computer is a groove and please
contact me soon.

"hit or miss' out of blind dates, both decep

the "Ratio?"
With the number of unmarried men cur
rently running 2.8 times that of unmarried
women, Ilarvard-based Operation Match, the
only computerized dat'ng scheme of its kind,
has arrived on the Farm none too soon.

Lost Amateur Status
At least one Stanfordite found
out about this deception the
hard way. After receiving his
"ideal dates" he called the first
one on the list and arranged a
meeting. Not until he picked
her up did he learn that she was
a divorced mother of two with
immediate remarriage on her
mind. He fared no better with
the next one (she was a widow)
and gave up in disgust.
Errors in names, addresses,
and telephone numbers are not
uncommon either. One girl's
name was printed as Taryn, in
stead of Charyn. She later found
out that many of the men who
got her name thought she was
a foreigner and put her on the
end of their lists.

$3 to one of 31 regionally-based centers, the
respondent receives a list complete with
names, addresses, and phone numbers of from
5 to 14 potentially compatible blind dates who
reside within his or her area.
These are the matches deemed best by the
IBM 7090 computer based on the respondant's
desirability to the opposite sex as well as their
desirability to the respondant.
Tell-Tale Test
Items included in Op Match's 105-question
multiple choice "Quantitative Personality
Projection Test" range from the sublime ("Do
you consider yourself sexually experienced?",
"How important is it that your date share
your attitudes toward sex?") to the ridicu
lously impertinent ("Do you believe in a God
who answers prayer?")
Whether or not the test really takes the
uncertainty out of dating, it promises to be
amusing. One query, part of a section de

signed to measure one's reaction to specific
situations, reads:
"Your roommate gets you a blind date for
a big dance. Good looking, your roommate
says. When you meet your date, you're sure
it's your roommate who's blind—your date is
friendly, b u t embarrassingly unattractive.
You:
"(1) Suggest going to a movie instead.
"(2) monopolize your roommate's date,
leaving him one noble alternative.
"(3) dance with your date, smiling weakly,
but end the evening as early as possible.
"(4) act very friendly the whole time and
run the risk of getting trapped into a second
date."
Match at Stanford
How has Op Match filled the needs of men
and women on the Farm? Besides providing
a well-received source of dates, it has also
proved to have drawbacks.
For the Stanford man involved in Op Match,
the greatest problem seems to be one of dis
tance. Most found themselves traveling both

north and south to meet their matches. As
one graduate student put it:
"It gives you one helluvalot of dates if
you've got the time to pursue girls in Berke
ley or San Jose."
Both UC, with a 2 to 1 ratio, and SJS, with
a 1.1 to 1 ratio, have provided greener pas
tures than predominantly-male Stanford.
Self-Esteem
The cost of gasoline isn't the only drawback
inherent in driving to Berkeley or San Jose;
there's also the matter of self-esteem:
"It lowers a man's stature when the girl
knows you're so desperate you came 35 miles
to buy her a cup of coffee," said one male
summarizing the problem.
For the Stanford woman, Op Match seems
to provide a means for meeting the type of
male whom she wouldn't encounter in her
everyday circulation on campus. Generally,
women of the Farm used Op Match to supple
ment already busy "routine" dating schedules.
The thrill-seeking woman can manipulate her
questionnaire in any of a hundred ways in

seeking an off beat personality, while remain
ing completely truthful about herself. Several
girls reported that their matches had enlight
ened them on subjects ranging from LSD,
"pot," and "hash" to drum beating.
The Thrill S*vker
Perhaps the best evidence of this technique
in action is the following letter received by
a Stanford male participant two days before
the girl's name came to him in the mail:
"Dear ,
"The computers have matched us! Since I
have little faith in machines and multiple
choice tests, I have two questions. Do you
smoke pot or take LSD? Have you dug Dylan
for at least one year?
"If so, the computer is a groove and please
contact me soon.
"Love,-
Although Op Match is designed to take the
"hit or miss' out of blind dates, both decep
tion on the part of the respondants and errors
on the part of the computer creep in to bug
the system, making common
such complaints as:
"By the time I got to her, she
was married," "Either she lied
or I greatly overestimated my
personality," and"I called up
one girl and 15 other guys had
called her already."
Lost Amateur Status
At least one Stanfordite found
out about this deception the
hard way. After receiving his
"ideal dates" he called the first
one on the list and arranged a
meeting. Not until he picked
her up did he learn that she was
a divorced mother of two with
immediate remarriage on her
mind. He fared no better with
the next one (she was a widow)
and gave up in disgust.
Errors in names, addresses,
and telephone numbers are not
uncommon either. One girl's
name was printed as Taryn, in
stead of Charyn. She later found
out that many of the men who
got her name thought she was
a foreigner and put her on the
end of their lists.
Though Op Match has provid
ed its share of professional crit
icism. Stanford's noted profes
sor of phychology, Dr. Ernest
R. Hilgard, characterized Op
Match as "a commercial gim
mick—not a scientific operation
by any means. It's unable to
deal with the subtle problems
of matching two people."
Arnold S. Feldman, an asso
cite professor of sociology at
Northwestern, remains skepti
cal in a lighter vein:
"Machines don't do anything
1,000 Chinese can't do with aba
cuses, and I wouldn't want 1,000
Chinese picking a date for me."
Popularity Zooming
Whatever the drawbacks, the
national popularity Of Op Match
is unquestionable. Its over
whelming success is a story best
told in figures. This fall, Com
patibility Research's 31 area
centers expedited some 80,000
forms. Expected results from
the run beginning this spring
are 300,000, to be handled by
18 additional centers.
Tarr, whose Compatibility Re

search, Inc., grew out of an idea
from his undergraduate thesis
in social relations, has hopes of
founding a travel service which
will provide European tours for
computer-gathered groups this
summer.
Also in view are an Operation
Match magazfne, and a program
offering students attractive dis
counts on lodging and entertain
ment facilities.
Probably the brightest star on
the computer horizon is what
Tarr and company call "Real-
Time." It will make it possible
for anyone on campus at any
time to fill fn a questionnaire
on a keyboard teletype hooked
up to a central computer. In
seconds, the computer promises
to deliver the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of five
ideal dates located within driv
ing range.
Thus, with the computer revo
lution of the 60's dominating
almost every field of human en
deavor, the age of "instant love"
may not be long in coming.
How much have computer scientists helped
the Stanford man in his endless battle against
the "Ratio?"
With the number of unmarried men cur
rently running 2.8 times that of unmarried
women, Ilarvard-based Operation Match, the
only computerized dat'ng scheme of its kind,
has arrived on the Farm none too soon.
Operation Match hopes to give a complete
facelifting to the "old" method of making
Miss into Mrs. Al least Jeff Tarr, a 21-year
old Harvard senior who masterminded the
project, will be doing his best to hasten the
process.
Though boy-meets-girl is older than love
itself, Tarr and his associates at Compatibil
ity Research, Inc. (Operation Match's parent
company) have put the game in "Jet Age"
perspective in little over a year.
The mechanics of Op Match are simple:
male and female students fill out a question
naire specially designed to evaluate there

spondant's dating and basic personality as
well as that of his self-chosen "ideal date."
After mailing the questionnaire along with
