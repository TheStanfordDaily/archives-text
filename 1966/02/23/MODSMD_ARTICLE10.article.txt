# Flu Flashes, Takes Toll
## 
### 
Stanford has finally been hit by the
Type A Virus Asian Flu epidemic
which has been sweeping Northern
California, closing schools and col
leges, and causing grave concern in
both State and local Health Services.
Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Jr., of the
Stanford Health Service told The
Daily yesterday that "the influenza
situation here is not as bad as it is
in Berkeley or in the High Schools on
the peninsula."
Osborne said that a count taken
Feb. 18 revealed that 85 cases had
been reported in campus dormitories,
and urged that students be alert to
the symptoms of the ailment.
Flu .Symptoms
The influenza symptoms are fever,
chills, headache, backache, sore
throat, and a cough. The fever usually
lasts three days, after which the pa
tient can work, although he will prob
ably feel weak for another week and
may suffer from a hacking cough.
Osborne pointed out that influenza
can lead to complications and there
fore that stutdents exhibiting symp
toms should take prompt measures to
prevent the spread of the infection. He
recommended aspirin to relieve fever
and headache, fluids, and plenty of
rest.
Prevention Impossible
Now that the epidemic has struck
there is really nothing which can be
done to halt the spread of this par
ticular type of influenza, according
to Dr. Osborne. He pointed out that
flu shots take eight weeks to take
effect and that isohition is futile be
cause victims are usually infected be
fore they are aware of any symp
toms.
If the number of cases should rise
to a point where the Health Service
is unable to cope with them, patients
will be asked to stay in their dorms
where they will bo visited by trained
nurses. Every effort is being made to
prevent the outbreak of the Type B
Virus, which is considered to be the
more dangerous of the two varieties.
