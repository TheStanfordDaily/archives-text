# Jazz Casual Slates Pianist
## 
### 
Dr. Denny Zeitlin, jazz pianist cur
rently completing his residency at San
Francisco General Hospital, will per
form with his trio at the final Jazz
Casual of the quarter in the Tresidder
large lounge at 4 p. m. Friday.
The two - hour concert â€¢ discussion
program will be hosted by San Fran
cisco Chronicle critic and columnist
Ralph J. Gleason.
Zeitlin, who will begin a psychiatry
practice when he terminates his resi
dency, plays every Monday night at
the Trident in Sausalito. He devotes
the rest of the week to medicine.
"My two main interests have al
ways been medicine and music," says
the bearded 27-year-old. "Deleting ei
ther would leave me feeling so incom
plete that there has never been a
question of not doing both."
Zeitlin studied classical piano for
eight years, then discovered and ex
plored jazz on his own initiative. He
played Dixieland and traditional bop
during his early days in his native
Chicago.
Thunderous Acclaim
Jazz Year director Rick Bale stated,
"Denny's group, along with the John
Handy Quintet, received by far the
most thunderous critical and popular
acclaim of any of the performers at
last year's Monterey Jazz Festival."
And technical director A 1 Heineman
adds, "As far as I'm concerned, Den
ny is the most exciting and inventive
young jazz pianist to emerge within
the last 15 or 20 years."
Zeitlin's trio also features former
Ornette Coleman bassist Charlie Ha
den and drummer Granelli, both Bay
Area residents. Admission to the Jazz
Casual is $1 and is limited to the Stan
ford community.
