# D.C. Study Plans Set
## 
### 
The "Quarter in Washington"
committee will present tentative
plans for the program today at
a 4 p.m. meeting in Room 275.
The projected Stanford branch
campus in Washington D. C.
would provide a combination of
academic study and practical ex
perience in the social sciences.
Initiated by an Institute of In
ternational Relations committee
co-sponsored by Doug Ohmans
and Chick Fitts, the proposed
branch has received indications
of support from the Political
Science department and Admin
istration members.
Tentative plans put the pro
gram under the auspices of the
Political Science Department.
The curriculum would include
individual work-research proj
ects in conjunction with gov
ernment agencies, and guest-lec
ture programs.
An alternative program would
incorporate the "Quarter in
Washington" program with sim
ilar institutes offered by the
American University. It is felt,
however, that a separate pro
gram would be of more value to
Stanford participants, and would
simplify problems of academic
credits.
"The program has already won
the endorsement of Mr. Edwin
Johnson, president of Stanford's
Washington Alumni Associa
tion," comments Ohmans, "and
the main problems facing us at
this point involve formulating
a program that will be financial
ly and academically feasible."
Applicants for the "Stanford
in Washington" program are es
pecially encouraged to attend
today's meeting, as it has been
proposed that housing facilities
be maintained jointly by the two
groups.
