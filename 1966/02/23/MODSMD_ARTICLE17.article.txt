# Seminar To Probe Creativity
## 
### 
If creativity can't be taught,
it can be stimulated by direct
experience, is the conviction of
Professors Willis Harman and
Robert McKim who will offer
an experimental Creativity Sem
inar to graduate students next
quarter. The new seminar, ac
cording to the instructors, will
be more than a theoretical
probe into the mysteries of the
creative process.
In addition to roundtable dis
cussion, students will actively
encounter such factors as the
perceptual, cultural, and emo
tional blocks which hinder crea
tive behavior.
By means of individual and
group exercises, the students
will directly experience how
heightened awareness of self
and environment can stimulate
a fuller utilization of their cre
ative potential.
