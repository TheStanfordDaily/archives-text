## 'Daily' To Undertake New Literary Criticisms 
### HENRY ALLEY Book Review Editor 
"Stanford is a mighty slow
city," Sequoia reports a visitor
as saying. "Slow," however, is
not the right word.
Better, Stanford's academic
and creative fervor has gone
underground; that is, it is ex
pressed secretly: behind frater
nity doors, in the stacks, or dur
ing leisurely readings on Lake
Lagunita. There are few stu
dents who will deny the Stan
ford rage for books, for the kind
of comfort and discipline litera
ture supplies.
It is this belief that has given
rise to The Daily's Book Review
Department: the appointment of
staff reviewers, publisher corre
spondence, and semi - monthly
book review page. While Stan
ford actually has a sharp inter
est in good reading, many of the
students often are not able to
stop at the Bookstore and see
what is excellent or uninspired.
Unleash Interest
The book review section will,
ideally, present the literature
that will unleash and encourage
this interest — books, too, that

would have remained obscure if
a critic had not given them at
tention. By bringing the un
known to the quiet reader, the
editors hope that the calm will
be broken, and the Stanford stu
dent, when folding back the cov
er and seeing what is exciting,
intolerably moving, or damna
ble, will begin to show some
literary enthusiasm that is no
ticeable to his friends—and to
his enemies as well.
This page will appear every
second Wednesday. In weeks to
come, professors as well as stu
dents will offer reviews, and at
best, they should bring both sets
to establish literary forums out
side the newspaper. Books on
the reviewing agenda should
fire people into discussion: Who
Is Man?, Television in the Lives
of Children.
Future
Although many reviews have
been planned for future issues,
the editors welcome suggestions
and proposed articles. The page
will not fulfill its purpose unless
it knows what the students are
reading, unless it changes its
plans to meet Stanford's devel
oping literary tastes.
