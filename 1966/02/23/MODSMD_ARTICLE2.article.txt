# 676 Opposed To Recall; March 2 Vote Forseen
## 
### SUE WICKIZER Assistant Editor 
A petition which could place the
Legislature's recall of the student
members of the Committee of Fifteen
before the student body for a vote
was submitted Monday to the Presi
dent of the ASSU.
But according to Tom Galbraith,
organizer of the petition, "If the Leg
islature passes a resolution on Thurs
day which satisfies the most active
supporters of the petition, it is very
likely that we will withdraw it, and
there will be no referendum.
"At this time, I am not sure yet
what kind of a resolution will satisfy
all the backers," he added, "but there
will be one submitted at the next Leg
islature meeting."

If LASSU fails to pass a satisfac
tory resolution the issue will come
before the student body next Wednes
day.
The petition gives LASSU a vote of
"no confidence" and repeals the Leg
islature's recall of three of the five

student members of the Committee
of Fifteen.
It was signed by 676 students. Only
550 signatures are required to initiate
a referendum.
Galbraith stated he would have pre
ferred not to have filed the petition
until after the LASSU meeting on
Thursday, but Monday was the dead
line for initiating a referendum this
quarter.
"Our main conccrn is to enable the
Committee of Fifteen to get on with
its work and to discuss the issue
while it is still in the minds of the
students," he explained.
Galbraith believes there is "still a
possibility" that the Legislature will
reverse its decision. He estimates that
only a little over one-half the Legis
lature attended last Thursday's meet
ing and"the vote was extremely
close."
Galbraith is encouraging all the leg
islators who weren't present—espe
cially the fraternity members and
freshmen who were involved in rush
activities—to attend this week.
