# Biography Of Japan's 'Kafu' Called Finest Of Its Own Kind
## 
### PATT CRAIG McDERMID 
"It is possible for an author
to be better and more important
than any one of his works," be
gins Professor Edward Seiden
sticker in his prefare to Kafu
the Scribbler. "No single book
(by such an author) may seem
worthy of translation, and yet
the author and his setting may
seem worthy of a book."
Ngai Kafu is such an author.
And Kafu the Scribbler is such
a book. Professor Seidensticker
has produced a very sensitive
and impressive work dealing
with the life and art of the mod
ern Japanese writer Ngai So
kichi, or "Kafu," from Kafu's
childhood to his death, in 1959.
The first half of the work is an
incredible portrait of the artist
(east) presented in eight enter
taining and often delightfully
written chapters each dealing
with a period of Kafu's life. The
second half of the book is com
posed of Kafu's works in trans
lation.
Mind's Country
*T*'t beyond the fine critical
presentation of a writer and his
work, Seidensticker has written
a book about a brilliant, melan
choly artist whose life and writ
ings are, indeed, more than the
sum of their parts. For Kafu
draws upon a fascinating,
Faulknerian "country in the
mind" for practically all of his
themes, plots and images. And
the reader can imagine Kafu, as

he can few authors, inextricably
bound up in his own creation
of decay and change, upheaval
and loneliness.
This is not to suggest, how
ever, that Kafu the Scribbler is
anything short of a delight to
read. The descriptions of Kafu's
hell-raising youth, family exile
to the United States and experi
ences in France are often hilari
ous and quite touching.
Personal Voice
Professor Seidensticker's own
voice can be heard throughout
the first half of the book, as
well. He comments subtly and
perceptively on the action of the
biography with a type of humor

not totally unlike the narrator
in a Fielding novel. Seidenstick
er, himself, is a part of the
work. And an enlightening as
well as highly entertaining one.
The translations of Kafu's
prose have something to please
everyone. He writes sometimes
with the tight control of a Hem
ingway: . . We went into the
beer hall to sit for a moment.
There were no other customers.
A sleepy waitress took an enor
mous amount of time brfnglng
us beer. Finally . . . she ap
peared. We were silent, our el
bows on the dirty gray table
cloth." Sometimes he writes
with a lyric quality calling
Twain, or even Melville, to
mind: . . the hour being late
he could hear a wandering mu
sician, and the wooden clappers
of a Kabuki mimic . . . and . . .
there came a woman's voice
singing a Shinnai ballad on the
night air . . . strains from an
other age . . Kafu the Scrib
bler should be read. It is a book
which highly repays study. Pro
fessor Seidensticker has done a
superb job of presenting the life
and writings of Ngai Kafu as
much more than a biography
and an anthology of translated
prose pieces. I recommend it
highly. Kafu the Scribbler, is
certainly one of the finest books
of its kind I have ever read.
