# Anthology Of Science Fiction Finds Room For Melville, Poe
## 
### MARK KANE 
Future Perfect is a critical
anthology of 19th century Amer
ican science fiction selected and
analyzed by H. Bruce Franklin,
an Associate Professor of Eng
lish at Stanford. Mr. Franklin
believes that "to get at least a
glimpse of science fiction's im
portance in nineteenth-century
American fiction, one has only
to look directly at the works of
the most important writers . . ."
Among those represented are
Edward Bellamy, Ambrose
Bierce, Mark Twain, Herman
Melville, Edgar Allan Poe and
Nathaniel Hawthorne. The aver
age reader, perhaps, does not
associate Melville or Hawthorne
with science fiction, which right
ly suggests, that Mr. Franklin's
definition of science fiction,
is broader than the average
reader's. In his words, "science
fiction seeks to describe present
reality in terms of a credible
hypothetical invention — past,
present, or, most usually, future
—extrapolated from that reali
ty . . . (it) views what is by
projecting what not inconceiva
bly could be . . ."
Unexpected Invention
This definition enables Mr.
Franklin to see stories like
Hawthorne's The Artist of the
Beautiful and Melville's The
Bell-Tower as science fiction al

though, to a modern reader,
both appear as psychological and
symbolic studies of a withdrawn,
reclusive individual's obsessed
attempt to be, in a sense, a
creator. In neither story, does
the "invention" go beyond the
scope of the science of the time.
Both lack, even for their time,
the futuristic science we expect
in science fiction.
With regard to the place of
"science" in science fiction Mr.
Franklin says, "Insofar as any
work of science fiction is a form
of science it partakes of the
temporality and impermanence
of science and surrenders the
timelessness of fiction." But, if
fiction is timeless while science
fiction is, in varying degree, per
ishable, we may justly ask what
its value can be. This question,
unfortunately, Mr. Franklin
leaves unanswered. Many of the
stories in his anthology need
justification on this point. The
"inventions" around which these
stories were written are now
commonplace and the stories,
having lost the excitement and
drama of their inventions, now
seem commonplace too.
This is, for example, apparent
in The Atoms of Chladni by J. D.
Whelpley. Much of the story's
drama depends on our anticipa
tion of learning what it is that
Mohler, the jealous husband, has
invented. It must come as an
anti-climax, after the suspense
of waiting, to learn that what
he has created to eavesdrop on
his wife is no more than a form
of microphone. Later in the
story, Mohler goes insane upon
learning that his lawyer has de
ceived him into believing his
wife unfaithful. Whelpley want
ed to make a valid point—that
the machine, or the obsession,
can victimize its creator—but
the point is weakened for us
when we learn that Mohler was
deceived because he was un
aware that his microphone re
produced sounds originating
from behind it as well as in
front. We can only consider his
ignorance absurd—our more ad
vanced science has taken the
sting from his story.
Excellent Writing
There are several fine stories
in this anthology; Hawthorne
has three, Melville has The Bell-
Tower, and Thomas Wentworth
Higginson The Monarch of
Dreams. All five stories share
an independence of science, real
or projected, for their dramatic
impact. They cannot be robbed
of their vitality by the onrush of
science because they do not de
pend on science for their point.
They are "timeless" depictions
of life as it is.
On the other hand there are

several stories which, at best,
dubiously fill Mr. Franklin's def
inition of science fiction. Christ
mas 200,000 B. C. by S t a n 1 e y
Waterloo is a straightforward
depiction of the savageness of
prehistoric life and bears no re
lation to "present reality." And
at least two of Poe's stories, A
Tale of the Ragged Mountains
and The Facts In the Case of M.
Valdemar, make no attempt to
imitate "present reality" but in
stead, as Mr. Franklin admits,
strive only for an "effect," an
emotional response from the
reader.
Special Interest
It would seem then that the
less emphasis on the "science"
in science fiction, the more rele
vant and enduring the story. For
present-day science fiction,
which still outstrips science and
thus retains the power to drama
tize and intensify the author's
comments on "present reality,"
this is not true. It does seem to
be true for science fiction from
the past if this anthology can
be taken as representative.
Mr. Franklin's comments may
be of interest to those interested
in the various forms of science
fiction, or to scholars eager for a
fresh perspective on well-studied
authors. But to the ordinary
reader they will be of less in
terest than the few fine stories
in this anthology and superflu
ous to their enjoyment.

age reader, perhaps, does not
associate Melville or Hawthorne
with science fiction, which right
ly suggests, that Mr. Franklin's
definition of science fiction,
is broader than the average
reader's. In his words, "science
fiction seeks to describe present
reality in terms of a credible
hypothetical invention — past,
present, or, most usually, future
—extrapolated from that reali
ty . . . (it) views what is by
projecting what not inconceiva
bly could be . . ."
Unexpected Invention
This definition enables Mr.
Franklin to see stories like
Hawthorne's The Artist of the
Beautiful and Melville's The
Bell-Tower as science fiction al

though, to a modern reader,
both appear as psychological and
symbolic studies of a withdrawn,
reclusive individual's obsessed
attempt to be, in a sense, a
creator. In neither story, does
the "invention" go beyond the
scope of the science of the time.
Both lack, even for their time,
the futuristic science we expect
in science fiction.
With regard to the place of
"science" in science fiction Mr.
Franklin says, "Insofar as any
work of science fiction is a form
of science it partakes of the
temporality and impermanence
of science and surrenders the
timelessness of fiction." But, if
fiction is timeless while science
fiction is, in varying degree, per
ishable, we may justly ask what
its value can be. This question,
unfortunately, Mr. Franklin
leaves unanswered. Many of the
stories in his anthology need
justification on this point. The
"inventions" around which these
stories were written are now
commonplace and the stories,
having lost the excitement and
drama of their inventions, now
seem commonplace too.
This is, for example, apparent
in The Atoms of Chladni by J. D.
Whelpley. Much of the story's
drama depends on our anticipa
tion of learning what it is that
Mohler, the jealous husband, has
invented. It must come as an
anti-climax, after the suspense
of waiting, to learn that what
he has created to eavesdrop on
his wife is no more than a form
of microphone. Later in the
story, Mohler goes insane upon
learning that his lawyer has de
ceived him into believing his
wife unfaithful. Whelpley want
ed to make a valid point—that
the machine, or the obsession,
can victimize its creator—but
the point is weakened for us
when we learn that Mohler was
deceived because he was un
aware that his microphone re
produced sounds originating
from behind it as well as in
front. We can only consider his
ignorance absurd—our more ad
vanced science has taken the
sting from his story.
Excellent Writing
There are several fine stories
in this anthology; Hawthorne
has three, Melville has The Bell-
Tower, and Thomas Wentworth
Higginson The Monarch of
Dreams. All five stories share
an independence of science, real
or projected, for their dramatic
impact. They cannot be robbed
of their vitality by the onrush of
science because they do not de
pend on science for their point.
They are "timeless" depictions
of life as it is.
On the other hand there are

several stories which, at best,
dubiously fill Mr. Franklin's def
inition of science fiction. Christ
mas 200,000 B. C. by S t a n 1 e y
Waterloo is a straightforward
depiction of the savageness of
prehistoric life and bears no re
lation to "present reality." And
at least two of Poe's stories, A
Tale of the Ragged Mountains
and The Facts In the Case of M.
Valdemar, make no attempt to
imitate "present reality" but in
stead, as Mr. Franklin admits,
strive only for an "effect," an
emotional response from the
reader.
Special Interest
It would seem then that the
less emphasis on the "science"
in science fiction, the more rele
vant and enduring the story. For
present-day science fiction,
which still outstrips science and
thus retains the power to drama
tize and intensify the author's
comments on "present reality,"
this is not true. It does seem to
be true for science fiction from
the past if this anthology can
be taken as representative.
Mr. Franklin's comments may
be of interest to those interested
in the various forms of science
fiction, or to scholars eager for a
fresh perspective on well-studied
authors. But to the ordinary
reader they will be of less in
terest than the few fine stories
in this anthology and superflu
ous to their enjoyment.

Hawthorne's The Artist of the
Beautiful and Melville's The
Bell-Tower as science fiction al

though, to a modern reader,
both appear as psychological and
symbolic studies of a withdrawn,
reclusive individual's obsessed
attempt to be, in a sense, a
creator. In neither story, does
the "invention" go beyond the
scope of the science of the time.
Both lack, even for their time,
the futuristic science we expect
in science fiction.
With regard to the place of
"science" in science fiction Mr.
Franklin says, "Insofar as any
work of science fiction is a form
of science it partakes of the
temporality and impermanence
of science and surrenders the
timelessness of fiction." But, if
fiction is timeless while science
fiction is, in varying degree, per
ishable, we may justly ask what
its value can be. This question,
unfortunately, Mr. Franklin
leaves unanswered. Many of the
stories in his anthology need
justification on this point. The
"inventions" around which these
stories were written are now
commonplace and the stories,
having lost the excitement and
drama of their inventions, now
seem commonplace too.
This is, for example, apparent
in The Atoms of Chladni by J. D.
Whelpley. Much of the story's
drama depends on our anticipa
tion of learning what it is that
Mohler, the jealous husband, has
invented. It must come as an
anti-climax, after the suspense
of waiting, to learn that what
he has created to eavesdrop on
his wife is no more than a form
of microphone. Later in the
story, Mohler goes insane upon
learning that his lawyer has de
ceived him into believing his
wife unfaithful. Whelpley want
ed to make a valid point—that
the machine, or the obsession,
can victimize its creator—but
the point is weakened for us
when we learn that Mohler was
deceived because he was un
aware that his microphone re
produced sounds originating
from behind it as well as in
front. We can only consider his
ignorance absurd—our more ad
vanced science has taken the
sting from his story.
Excellent Writing
There are several fine stories
in this anthology; Hawthorne
has three, Melville has The Bell-
Tower, and Thomas Wentworth
Higginson The Monarch of
Dreams. All five stories share
an independence of science, real
or projected, for their dramatic
impact. They cannot be robbed
of their vitality by the onrush of
science because they do not de
pend on science for their point.
They are "timeless" depictions
of life as it is.
On the other hand there are

several stories which, at best,
dubiously fill Mr. Franklin's def
inition of science fiction. Christ
mas 200,000 B. C. by S t a n 1 e y
Waterloo is a straightforward
depiction of the savageness of
prehistoric life and bears no re
lation to "present reality." And
at least two of Poe's stories, A
Tale of the Ragged Mountains
and The Facts In the Case of M.
Valdemar, make no attempt to
imitate "present reality" but in
stead, as Mr. Franklin admits,
strive only for an "effect," an
emotional response from the
reader.
Special Interest
It would seem then that the
less emphasis on the "science"
in science fiction, the more rele
vant and enduring the story. For
present-day science fiction,
which still outstrips science and
thus retains the power to drama
tize and intensify the author's
comments on "present reality,"
this is not true. It does seem to
be true for science fiction from
the past if this anthology can
be taken as representative.
Mr. Franklin's comments may
be of interest to those interested
in the various forms of science
fiction, or to scholars eager for a
fresh perspective on well-studied
authors. But to the ordinary
reader they will be of less in
terest than the few fine stories
in this anthology and superflu
ous to their enjoyment.
Future Perfect is a critical
anthology of 19th century Amer
ican science fiction selected and
analyzed by H. Bruce Franklin,
an Associate Professor of Eng
lish at Stanford. Mr. Franklin
believes that "to get at least a
glimpse of science fiction's im
portance in nineteenth-century
American fiction, one has only
to look directly at the works of
the most important writers . . ."
Among those represented are
Edward Bellamy, Ambrose
Bierce, Mark Twain, Herman
Melville, Edgar Allan Poe and
Nathaniel Hawthorne. The aver
age reader, perhaps, does not
associate Melville or Hawthorne
with science fiction, which right
ly suggests, that Mr. Franklin's
definition of science fiction,
is broader than the average
reader's. In his words, "science
fiction seeks to describe present
reality in terms of a credible
hypothetical invention — past,
present, or, most usually, future
—extrapolated from that reali
ty . . . (it) views what is by
projecting what not inconceiva
bly could be . . ."
