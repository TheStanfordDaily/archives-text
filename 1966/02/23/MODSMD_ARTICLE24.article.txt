# A 						Letter On Change
## 'George, See What You Started!' 
### 
(Editor's Note: Thomas Bally, Margaret Byrne Professor of
American History, was asked to write a greeting for the Faculty-
Staff Newsletter to George Washington, on the occasion of his
birthday yesterday. It follows.)
The Honorable George Washington, Esq.
Apartment 1776
"Spaceville"
Dear George:
Happy 234 th birthday, wherever you are.
I'm afraid you wouldn't recognize this old country that you fa
thered. We're now pushing 200 million souls, and we've more people
on the federal payroll than there were in the entire country in your
day. We've got horseless carriages and flying machines, and can
travel to places faster than we can think of reasons for going there.
The women, bless 'em, can now vote, and I suppose Martha would
be a member of the League of Women Voters. The slave problem
that pricked your conscience is gone: the Negro is free, after a
fashion, and can now vote, after a fashion.
Do you remember how Martha was so upset, following a presi-

dential reception, when she
found that some "filthy demo
crat" had got in and had left a
greasy mark on the wall paper?
I've got news for you, George.
The "filthy democrats" can all
vote now. We work on the prin
ciple of one man one vote, and
some rascals take it so seriously
that they vote more than once.
But in many ways you'd feel
quite at home.
We're Broke!
Do you remember how wor
ried you were about the nation
al debt that Alexander Hamilton

so boldly assumed? It was all
of $75 million. Now it's over
$300 billion, and we're still wor
ried about balancing the budget.
Do you remember the outcry
there was against the tax pro
gram that Hamilton cooked up,
with duties on imports and the
taxes on whiskey? We are still
groaning about high taxes, in
cluding one on whiskey and a
clever federal income tax which
would put you and Martha in
the top bracket.
Do you remember how you
had to call out the troops to put
down the Whiskey Rebellion
when the Pennsylvania moon
shiners were tarring and feath
ering the revenuers? We called
it a rebellion then; now we've
got a fancier name for anarchy:
"civil disobedience." This means
picking out the laws you don't
like and disobeying them. We're
still calling out federal troops
to suppress "civil disobedience."
States Rights?
Of course you remember that
amazing Constitution drafted by
the Philadelphia convention over
which you presided. We've still
got it, considerably altered, with
twenty-four amendments, in
cluding the now-repealed anti
booze amendment which you
wouldn't understand. You no
doubt remember that the anti
federalists moaned about the
loss of states' rights. Well, we
are still moaning about the loss
of states' rights, and you'd
think that by now we wouldn't
have any more to lose. A lot of
our conservative brethren think
that the Supreme Court has not
only taken over the states but
the entire Congress as well.
You'd be terribly amused to
know that Tom Jefferson, who
founded the Democratic party
and who favored small govern
ment and the little man, is now
a patron saint of the aristocratic
Republican Goldwaterites. And
Federalist Alex Hamilton, who
plugged for big government and
the bigwigs, is now a patron
saint of the nonaristocratic Dem
ocratic Johnsonites. It's sort of
confusing.
Bureaucrats Breeches
In all seriousness, the federal
government is getting too big
for its breeches, and the bureau
crats are moving in.
Back in your day we had only
one ally, and that was France.
You recall of course all the trou
ble that she caused us by pok
ing her nose into our affairs and

trying to push us around. She is
again our ally, and she's still
trying to push us around under
a long-nosed Frenchman named
De Gaulle.
I keep thinking of your mag
nificent Farewell Address, in
which you warned against un
necessary alliances. You'd be
shocked to learn that we've now
got about forty of the plaguey
things. I suppose that most of
them are necessary for our de
fense, but I can't help longing
for the good old one-horse one
alliance days.
Warmongers
I'm sure you'll never forget
how the warmongers of 1793 put
up an awful clatter for fighting
England after she seized our
ships and aided the Indian "ag
gressors" on our frontier. But
you were not one to wear the
national honor on your sleeve,
and you had the guts to stand
out against the crowd and give
the country the peace it needed
so badly. Well, there are a lot
of people today yelling for a big
and bloody war in Southeast
Asia against the Vietnamese
"aggressors," and I wish you
were here to help calm things
down.
Back in your day the big issue
was national survival. We were
a weak nation facing a hostile
monarchial world. Today we're
still worried about national sur
vival. We've got some fantastic
explosives known as nuclear
bombs. We can blow everybody
else up, but the bad guys can
blow us up, too. It's odd, but
the more powerful we become,
the less safe we are.
Well, George, I guess I've said
enough to cause you a little
concern about the country you
sired. We've had thirty-five pres
idents since your day, and in
my book — and I do mean my
book — you're still tops, even if
the Schlesinger polls put you be
hind a chap named Abe Lincoln.
All he did was to reglue the
Union that you put together.
No Sex Appeal
I hate to say this, George, but
I don't believe you could be
elected today, or even nomi
nated. We've got something
known as television, which I
can't take time to explain. But
just imagine that painting of
you by Peale suddenly beginning
to talk and gesture, and you'll
get the idea. With those deep
pock marks on your face and
those painful false teeth that
used to pop out on occasion, the
politicians would pass you by in
favor of some stuffed shirt who
would look telegenic. Well, I say
character and ability before pro
file and sex appeal. And besides,
I like a certain amount of dig
nity. You never kissed babies
and pulled up your waistcoat
in front, so folks could see how
big a scar you had.
Well, thanks again, George,
for everything. No country ever
had a better father. You gave
us a splendid legacy, and if we
louse things all up it'll be our
fault, not yours.
Gratefully,
Thomas A. Bailey
P.S. Best regards to Martha.
