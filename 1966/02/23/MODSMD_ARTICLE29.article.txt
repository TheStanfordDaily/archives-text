# Phi Delts Maintain Mural Point Lead
## 
### ARLEN R. HOLTER 
With all but one event to be
completed, the Autumn Quarter
intramural standings show that
fraternities hold down seven of
the first ten positions hi the all
university standings. The one
event which has not been com
pleted is the free throw shooting
finals between Fremont and
Theta Delta Chi.
On the strength of their foot
ball championship the Phi Delts
lead in the point derby with 106.
They picked up 80 points alone
in football. In second place with
94 points is Theta Delta Chi.
The Theta Delts will move clos
er to the Phi Delts no matter
what happens in the free throw
finals. High totals in both foot
ball and volleyball accounted for
most of the Theta Delt total.
SAEs Third
The SAEs are holding down
the third spot with 92 points fol
lowed closely by last year's all
university champions, Sigma
Chi. The Chis advanced both of
their football teams further
than any other house in the
tourney before their II team lost
in the quarter finals, and their
I team was beaten in the semis.
A good football team and a
second place finish in volleyball
placed the DUs in fifth with 88
points. The football runnersup
Fremont are next with 80 fol
lowed by El Cuadro with 79%.
Two more fraternities, Kappa
Alpha and Phi Kappa Sigma,
along with the Law school team
round out the Top Ten.

Although Soto House was able
to place third overall in the all
university standings last year,
this years "men of Soto" are
not even on top in Wilbur. Juni
pero leads the Wilbur houses
with 39 points followed by Soto
with 37 and Rinconada with 29.
In Stern both Muir and Don
ner trail Fremont by more than
30 points. On the graduate level
Beta Biz and the Village Idiots
appear to be the Law School's
toughest competition.
Looking ahead, it appears as
if the Phi Deits will have to
make a strong showing in the
wrestling tournament in order
to hang on to their lead. Their
basketball team is last in their
league and it looks as if both
the Theta Delts and Sigma Chis
will pick up valuable points in
the basketball tournament.

Theta Delta Chi.
On the strength of their foot
ball championship the Phi Delts
lead in the point derby with 106.
They picked up 80 points alone
in football. In second place with
94 points is Theta Delta Chi.
The Theta Delts will move clos
er to the Phi Delts no matter
what happens in the free throw
finals. High totals in both foot
ball and volleyball accounted for
most of the Theta Delt total.
SAEs Third
The SAEs are holding down
the third spot with 92 points fol
lowed closely by last year's all
university champions, Sigma
Chi. The Chis advanced both of
their football teams further
than any other house in the
tourney before their II team lost
in the quarter finals, and their
I team was beaten in the semis.
A good football team and a
second place finish in volleyball
placed the DUs in fifth with 88
points. The football runnersup
Fremont are next with 80 fol
lowed by El Cuadro with 79%.
Two more fraternities, Kappa
Alpha and Phi Kappa Sigma,
along with the Law school team
round out the Top Ten.

Although Soto House was able
to place third overall in the all
university standings last year,
this years "men of Soto" are
not even on top in Wilbur. Juni
pero leads the Wilbur houses
with 39 points followed by Soto
with 37 and Rinconada with 29.
In Stern both Muir and Don
ner trail Fremont by more than
30 points. On the graduate level
Beta Biz and the Village Idiots
appear to be the Law School's
toughest competition.
Looking ahead, it appears as
if the Phi Deits will have to
make a strong showing in the
wrestling tournament in order
to hang on to their lead. Their
basketball team is last in their
league and it looks as if both
the Theta Delts and Sigma Chis
will pick up valuable points in
the basketball tournament.
