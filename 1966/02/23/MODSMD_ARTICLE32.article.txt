# THE 						REAL INDIAN SPORT
## Laxmen Open Slate 
### 
Stanford's only real Indian
sport opens play this weekend
as the Lacrosse Club opens its
schedule Saturday afternoon
against the Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club.
The laxmen fell to a group
from the Business School last
Saturday in an unofficial scrim
mage, 7-5, but the tribe ranks
were depleted by the flu, and
they are tightening up their of
fense this week with intensive
drills.
Many of the Biz School play
ers are members of the Palo Alto
team which will meet Stanford
this weekend. The Palo Alto
Club is made up of former colle
giate players and curious ath
letes who still maintain interest
in the sport and boasts some
former ail-Americans.
The laxmen have been work
ing out for a couple of weeks
on a three-day-a-week basis and

will play one other game this
quarter. The bulk of the sched
ule will be played in the spring
when 5-day drills begin, high
lighted by a trip to Arizona for
a tournament at the University.
Standouts in the scrimmage
against the Biz School were at
tackman Doug Ramsey, mid
fielder George Pieters, and de
fenseman Bill Leachman. All
three should be prominent in
this weekend's contest, along
with Captain and midfielder Bob
Murphy, attackman Clay Prim
ose, and goalie Mel Ellis.
Lacrosse had its birth four
years ago as a club sport when
a group of former prep starts
instituted the game on campus.
It's popularity has burgeoned,
and the Club now boasts a large
roster of experienced players.
The game will be played on
the soccer field and will begin
at 2:00 P.M.
