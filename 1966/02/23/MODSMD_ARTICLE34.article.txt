Washington. The State
Department files its plea with
Congress for an increase in trade
with Eastern Europe, citing as
a reason for the desired in
crease, the relaxation of life in
all the Communist countries ex
cepting little Albania. "There is
literally no part," (of Eastern
Europe,) the statement read,
"that does not show evidence of
change."
In Moscow
Moscow, (same day). Two
writers sit in a Soviet Court
room. To the charge that they
have betrayed their country by
writing for foreign periodicals
under assumed names, Andrei
Sinyavsky, known to the west
ern world as Abram Tertz, plead
ed the freedom of expression
guaranteed in the Soviet Consti
tution of 1936.
The presiding judge, Lev Smir
nov, the highest ranking jurist
in Moscow, cut him off: "We do
not have a matter for literary
dispute here," he said, "but a
criminal trial." Asked why he
wrote articles and books under
an assumed name, Sinyavsky
answered: "I wanted to speak
about the spiritual needs of the
people."
Passages from his haunting

essays were read aloud in the
courtroom, and he was asked to
defend himself against the in
ferences a reader would draw
from his book, that Russia was
a nation of "thieves and drunk
ards." Mr. Sinyavsky protested
defensively, "One cannot re
proach me with any passion for
the West. I have even been
called a Slavophile." The de
fendant's "hypocritical asser
tions of love for the Russian
People were met with laugh
ter."
"Open Trial"
That is what we know of the
trial from the only sources in
which we can read about it, the
Moscow press. It was originally
heralded as an "open trial." But
when it began, foreign journal
ists were uniformly turned
away, and the courtroom was
filled with a "handpicked audi
ence." If the defendants made
eloquent pleas for compassion
and understanding, if they were
permitted to observe that some
times Gogol and Dostoievsky
could have been accused of writ
ing passages from which a pros
ecutor could infer that the}
thought of Russia as a nation
of thieves and drunkards — we
are not likely to know. The pros
ecutor will win all the ex
changes, so far as the Russian
reader, or the West, will ever
know: the courtroom will fill
with derisory laughter on cue,
the writers will be convicted,
the hundred flowers will have
had their little bloom.
New York, (same day). A
group of American pathologists
released their findings after
conducting an exhaustive autop
sy on the body of Newcomb
Mott. Mott was 27 years o 1 d
when he was hauled up in se
cret session by a Soviet Court
and sentenced to imprisonment
for allegedly entering the coun
try from Norway. A few days
later, the Russians issued a re
port that, unfortunately, the
prisoner Mott had committed
suicide, and that under the cir
cumstances his mortal remains
would be returned to his par
ents. The doctors reported that
there was no evidence whatso
ever that Newcomb Mott had
committed suicide.
Guffaws
Moscow, (same day). Colonel
Rudolph Abel, a former Soviet
spy-master, permitted himself a
few guffaws at the expense of
the F. 8.1. He gave details of how
he had succeeded in destroying

incriminating evidence when he
was picked up in his Brooklyn
apartment by six agents of the
F. 8.1. For instance, he said, he
managed to clean his artists'
palette with a record which in
fact contained a secret broad
cast from his Moscow superiors,
which record he then dropped
in the toilet. A roll of microfilm
in his stickpin he managed to
pry loose, and let drop on the
floor. The point of the inter
view was to stress that the
F. 8.1, is "dumb."
Colonel Abel was not asked
to explain how come, if the
F. 8.1, is so dumb, there were
all of a sudden six of them in
his room at a moment when it
was full of records and micro
films. Or how come the F. 8.1,
managed to produce enough evi
dence to convict him of spying.
(He had hardly entered the
penitentiary when ZAP all of a
sudden Abel was back in Mos-

cow, and our U-2 pilot Francis
Gary Powers was back in Wash
ington, D. C.)
Boycott
Washington, (continued). The
State Department "deplored" ef
forts by "private groups" in the
United States to "boycott" im
ports of "peaceful goods" from
Eastern Europe. "The Federal
Government cannot be in the
position of permitting private
pressure groups by intimida
tion and threats to frustrate
United States foreign policy,"
which means that the Adminis
tration will presumably ask for
legislation to outlaw private boy
cotts—which for safety's sake
will presumably have to be un
dertaken in the future under as
sumed names.
This courtroom, to be sure
also occupied by a hand-picked
audience, greets this develop
ment with laughter.

In Moscow
Moscow, (same day). Two
writers sit in a Soviet Court
room. To the charge that they
have betrayed their country by
writing for foreign periodicals
under assumed names, Andrei
Sinyavsky, known to the west
ern world as Abram Tertz, plead
ed the freedom of expression
guaranteed in the Soviet Consti
tution of 1936.
The presiding judge, Lev Smir
nov, the highest ranking jurist
in Moscow, cut him off: "We do
not have a matter for literary
dispute here," he said, "but a
criminal trial." Asked why he
wrote articles and books under
an assumed name, Sinyavsky
answered: "I wanted to speak
about the spiritual needs of the
people."
Passages from his haunting

essays were read aloud in the
courtroom, and he was asked to
defend himself against the in
ferences a reader would draw
from his book, that Russia was
a nation of "thieves and drunk
ards." Mr. Sinyavsky protested
defensively, "One cannot re
proach me with any passion for
the West. I have even been
called a Slavophile." The de
fendant's "hypocritical asser
tions of love for the Russian
People were met with laugh
ter."
"Open Trial"
That is what we know of the
trial from the only sources in
which we can read about it, the
Moscow press. It was originally
heralded as an "open trial." But
when it began, foreign journal
ists were uniformly turned
away, and the courtroom was
filled with a "handpicked audi
ence." If the defendants made
eloquent pleas for compassion
and understanding, if they were
permitted to observe that some
times Gogol and Dostoievsky
could have been accused of writ
ing passages from which a pros
ecutor could infer that the}
thought of Russia as a nation
of thieves and drunkards — we
are not likely to know. The pros
ecutor will win all the ex
changes, so far as the Russian
reader, or the West, will ever
know: the courtroom will fill
with derisory laughter on cue,
the writers will be convicted,
the hundred flowers will have
had their little bloom.
New York, (same day). A
group of American pathologists
released their findings after
conducting an exhaustive autop
sy on the body of Newcomb
Mott. Mott was 27 years o 1 d
when he was hauled up in se
cret session by a Soviet Court
and sentenced to imprisonment
for allegedly entering the coun
try from Norway. A few days
later, the Russians issued a re
port that, unfortunately, the
prisoner Mott had committed
suicide, and that under the cir
cumstances his mortal remains
would be returned to his par
ents. The doctors reported that
there was no evidence whatso
ever that Newcomb Mott had
committed suicide.
Guffaws
Moscow, (same day). Colonel
Rudolph Abel, a former Soviet
spy-master, permitted himself a
few guffaws at the expense of
the F. 8.1. He gave details of how
he had succeeded in destroying

incriminating evidence when he
was picked up in his Brooklyn
apartment by six agents of the
F. 8.1. For instance, he said, he
managed to clean his artists'
palette with a record which in
fact contained a secret broad
cast from his Moscow superiors,
which record he then dropped
in the toilet. A roll of microfilm
in his stickpin he managed to
pry loose, and let drop on the
floor. The point of the inter
view was to stress that the
F. 8.1, is "dumb."
Colonel Abel was not asked
to explain how come, if the
F. 8.1, is so dumb, there were
all of a sudden six of them in
his room at a moment when it
was full of records and micro
films. Or how come the F. 8.1,
managed to produce enough evi
dence to convict him of spying.
(He had hardly entered the
penitentiary when ZAP all of a
sudden Abel was back in Mos-

cow, and our U-2 pilot Francis
Gary Powers was back in Wash
ington, D. C.)
Boycott
Washington, (continued). The
State Department "deplored" ef
forts by "private groups" in the
United States to "boycott" im
ports of "peaceful goods" from
Eastern Europe. "The Federal
Government cannot be in the
position of permitting private
pressure groups by intimida
tion and threats to frustrate
United States foreign policy,"
which means that the Adminis
tration will presumably ask for
legislation to outlaw private boy
cotts—which for safety's sake
will presumably have to be un
dertaken in the future under as
sumed names.
This courtroom, to be sure
also occupied by a hand-picked
audience, greets this develop
ment with laughter.

room. To the charge that they
have betrayed their country by
writing for foreign periodicals
under assumed names, Andrei
Sinyavsky, known to the west
ern world as Abram Tertz, plead
ed the freedom of expression
guaranteed in the Soviet Consti
tution of 1936.
The presiding judge, Lev Smir
nov, the highest ranking jurist
in Moscow, cut him off: "We do
not have a matter for literary
dispute here," he said, "but a
criminal trial." Asked why he
wrote articles and books under
an assumed name, Sinyavsky
answered: "I wanted to speak
about the spiritual needs of the
people."
Passages from his haunting

essays were read aloud in the
courtroom, and he was asked to
defend himself against the in
ferences a reader would draw
from his book, that Russia was
a nation of "thieves and drunk
ards." Mr. Sinyavsky protested
defensively, "One cannot re
proach me with any passion for
the West. I have even been
called a Slavophile." The de
fendant's "hypocritical asser
tions of love for the Russian
People were met with laugh
ter."
"Open Trial"
That is what we know of the
trial from the only sources in
which we can read about it, the
Moscow press. It was originally
heralded as an "open trial." But
when it began, foreign journal
ists were uniformly turned
away, and the courtroom was
filled with a "handpicked audi
ence." If the defendants made
eloquent pleas for compassion
and understanding, if they were
permitted to observe that some
times Gogol and Dostoievsky
could have been accused of writ
ing passages from which a pros
ecutor could infer that the}
thought of Russia as a nation
of thieves and drunkards — we
are not likely to know. The pros
ecutor will win all the ex
changes, so far as the Russian
reader, or the West, will ever
know: the courtroom will fill
with derisory laughter on cue,
the writers will be convicted,
the hundred flowers will have
had their little bloom.
New York, (same day). A
group of American pathologists
released their findings after
conducting an exhaustive autop
sy on the body of Newcomb
Mott. Mott was 27 years o 1 d
when he was hauled up in se
cret session by a Soviet Court
and sentenced to imprisonment
for allegedly entering the coun
try from Norway. A few days
later, the Russians issued a re
port that, unfortunately, the
prisoner Mott had committed
suicide, and that under the cir
cumstances his mortal remains
would be returned to his par
ents. The doctors reported that
there was no evidence whatso
ever that Newcomb Mott had
committed suicide.
Guffaws
Moscow, (same day). Colonel
Rudolph Abel, a former Soviet
spy-master, permitted himself a
few guffaws at the expense of
the F. 8.1. He gave details of how
he had succeeded in destroying

incriminating evidence when he
was picked up in his Brooklyn
apartment by six agents of the
F. 8.1. For instance, he said, he
managed to clean his artists'
palette with a record which in
fact contained a secret broad
cast from his Moscow superiors,
which record he then dropped
in the toilet. A roll of microfilm
in his stickpin he managed to
pry loose, and let drop on the
floor. The point of the inter
view was to stress that the
F. 8.1, is "dumb."
Colonel Abel was not asked
to explain how come, if the
F. 8.1, is so dumb, there were
all of a sudden six of them in
his room at a moment when it
was full of records and micro
films. Or how come the F. 8.1,
managed to produce enough evi
dence to convict him of spying.
(He had hardly entered the
penitentiary when ZAP all of a
sudden Abel was back in Mos-

cow, and our U-2 pilot Francis
Gary Powers was back in Wash
ington, D. C.)
Boycott
Washington, (continued). The
State Department "deplored" ef
forts by "private groups" in the
United States to "boycott" im
ports of "peaceful goods" from
Eastern Europe. "The Federal
Government cannot be in the
position of permitting private
pressure groups by intimida
tion and threats to frustrate
United States foreign policy,"
which means that the Adminis
tration will presumably ask for
legislation to outlaw private boy
cotts—which for safety's sake
will presumably have to be un
dertaken in the future under as
sumed names.
This courtroom, to be sure
also occupied by a hand-picked
audience, greets this develop
ment with laughter.
Washington. The State
Department files its plea with
Congress for an increase in trade
with Eastern Europe, citing as
a reason for the desired in
crease, the relaxation of life in
all the Communist countries ex
cepting little Albania. "There is
literally no part," (of Eastern
Europe,) the statement read,
"that does not show evidence of
change."
