# The 						Issue-Grubber
## Sending The Tough Hombres 
### Joe Rosenbloom 
In a show of force last Thurs
day the Legislature recalled its
'marshmallow" representatives
to the Committee of Fifteen—
the label courtesy of a Legisla
ture member —and installed in
their gooey place "effective ad
vocates of the student opinion,"
as another polemicized.
The idea was to send new and
tougher hombres to espouse the
student line, hopefully to pro
duce results.
Brute Force
This attitude, it has been said,
reflects a misconception of the
Committee of Fifteen and signi
fies the triumph of brute force
over good reason. If all this is
so, then the Legislature is to be
congratulated for having acted
consistently.
The Legislature, or at least a
majority present Thursday, har
bored a labor-management con
ception of the Committee. They
saw it as a bargaining table
where negotiators air their
grievances, as in a labor-man
agement dispute, where the
hardest line is often the most
advantageous. Representatives
spoke of the "best negotiators"
and of "the most articulate" stu
dent spokesmen.
Marshmallows
With such a conception the
Legislature acted rationally in
recalling the "marshmallow"
representatives in favor of oth
ers who would stick to their
guns. Marshmallow representa
tives were hardly qualified to
represent the student camp at
the bargaining table.
But if this view of the Com
mittee of Fifteen is myopic, the
fault does not lie entirely with
the Legislature.
It is becoming more and more
apparent that there is a wide
difference of opinion among the
Committee's members about
what it actually is. While all
agree it is technically an "advis
ory board," some acknowledge
that in practice it h a s great
political power beyond an advis
ory function.
Overseer
Further, Chairman Philip
Rhinclander wants the Commit
tee to oversee, if not negotiate,
brush-fire disputes. Other mem
bers disagree. They desire the
Committee to limit itself to
more philosophic, less ephemer
al issues.
Not only does the function of
the Committee remain ambigu
ous, but its precedings, to guar
antee free speech for its mem
bers, are kept secret. The Legis
lature hears results but not pro
cesses. It could not be expected
to understand such matters.
Yet to dismiss the fireworks
Thursday as no more than a
definitional bungle on the part

of the Legislature is to miss
their real significance.
More than that, they were
symptoms of ferment among
the restless generation.
Matters in Hand
This generation, reinforced by
graduate students and some of
the more prominent Legislature
leaders, had matters in hand
Thursday. They are restless be
cause they are committed to re
form of the University, and they
find it hard to tolerate needless
delay. When other means fail,
they do not object to force to
achieve reform.
To this generation the Com
mittee of Fifteen appeared to
represent needless delay.
Channel
They had originally welcomed
it as a channel through which
students could feed grievances
into the University nervous sys

tem. Events of recent months
have tended to dispel this notion
and have turned rising expecta
tions to frustration.
To many in the Legislature
the channel appears to have
never been unclogged. "We are
unwilling to move at the snail's
pace they move at," one Legis
lature member said last week.
A Deaf Ear
On the issue of Union resettle
ment, the committee in refusing
to consider the matter seemed
to many to be turning a deaf
ear to student dissatisfaction.
And in its recognition that other
"constituencies" have a legiti
mate interest in overnight sign
out deadlines, the Committee
seemed to be evading yet anoth
er issue to the detriment of the
reformers.
Some Legislature members
have begun to ask whether in

fact the Committee is genuinely
concerned with the student
viewpoint or whether it is just
an artifice to subcommittee to
death student reforms.
Forceful Tactics
Such questions as these sug
gest to many of the restless gen
eration that they must return
to the forceful tactics which
they claim were responsible for
reforms in social regulations
and freedom of worship.
In other words, the actions of
the Legislature Thursday indi
cate that the restless generation
has moved closer to the senti
ments expressed by Speaker Jay
Kadane to the Legislature in
January "that student power
within the University is based
ultimately on the threat of dis
ruption on the campus and its
attendant bad publicity for the
University."
