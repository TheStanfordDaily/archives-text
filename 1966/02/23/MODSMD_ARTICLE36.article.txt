# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Praising The Doctor's Reply 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I'm sure that I speak for a
sound majority of the Stanford
community when I thank Dr.
Maurice Osborne for his singu
lar response in The Daily, Feb
ruary 16 to the recent activities
of the SSRF. To the perceptive
reader, Dr. Osborne offers some
thing even more valuable than
the"truth" of his arguments:
he offers a rare example of a
rich, balanced, and humane in
telligence at work.
To those who come to my let
ter I would say this: although
we often forget it, the whole

purpose of this great enterprise
in which we are all engaged—
students, faculty, and adminis
trators (believe it or not!) alike
—is to re-embody in each new
generation, not a head full of
interesting information but the
quality of mind which was ex
hibited in Dr. Osborne's letter.
Please don't misunderstand
me: I don't mean that one must,
if he is to be judged sane and
civilized, agree with Dr. Osborne
at every point. (Dr. Osborne
himself begs us to see this.) I
mean that if one is to be so
judged, he must approach seri

ous and delicate human dilem
mas with the same humility,
patience, self-doubt, and deep
concern.
We are indebted to Dr. Os
borne for reminding us of what
it means to be an intelligent
human being in a brutal and
complicated world.

• Complete Care
Editor, The Dally:
While I agree with Dr. Os
borne that the sensationalism of
the SSRF is out of place, I can

not help but feel that there is
a definite need for re-examin
ing the University Health Serv
ice policy on prescribing con
traceptives for unmarried girls.
In an effort to keep from be
coming a "pill machine," the
Health Service has fostered an
even more mechanical approach.
The mere fact that a girl has
to go to Palo Alto for contra
ceptives does not mean that her
decision is any more responsi
ble, but only that she had $15
to pay for an appointment. Re
gardless of where one goes for
a prescription for birth control
pills, there will be an equally
responsible or irresponsible ac
tion; and I do not believe Stan
ford women are so immature
that they would look upon Uni
versity cooperation as any less
ening of the personal nature of
this important decision.
If the University is sincerely
concerned about the health of
its students, it should provide
for complete medical care. The
Health Service is much better
able to provide a lasting doctor
patient relationship, and should
recognize its responsibility to do
so.
In short, all the problems that
Dr. Osborne's statement men
tioned exist under the present
system. A more realistic accept
ance of the Health Service's le
gitimate role in this area could
bring only increased responsibil
ity which seems to be the goal
of all sides on this controversy.
