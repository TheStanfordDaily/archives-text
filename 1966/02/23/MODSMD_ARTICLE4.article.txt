# YR's Blast All GOP Extremists
## 
### 
The Stanford Area Young Repub
licans joined the rising tide of oppo
sition lo extremism in the California
YIl leadership Monday when the local
executive board unanimously en
dorsed recent resolutions of the Col
lege Federation and the San Mateo
County YR's.
Calling on the newly-elected state
chairman Mike Djordjevich to refrain
from stands which "embarrass the
Party and its candidates," one reso
lution listed eight "common sense po
sitions" which it demanded Djordjev
itch accept in order to have the con
tinued support of the College Federa
tion.
The positions included:
• The CYR leadership "must sup
port all Republican candidates who
emerge from the June primary elec
t ions."
• The CYR leaders should be "Re
publicans first and advocates of a par
ticular philosophy second."
• The CYR must "take care not to
give the Democrats ammunition for
charges of extremism."
A second resolution endorsed by the
executive board concluded that in
view of the "damaging" policies advo
cated by the YR leadership, it would
be necessary for the club "to limit our
participation to those constructive ac
tivities which we feel are consistent
with the purposes of the California
Young Republicans."
Since Djordjevich and three mem
bers of the John Birch Society were
elected three weeks ago, three county
organizations- Alameda, San Mateo
and Orange have passed such reso
lutions and six college clubs have
withdrawn from the Young Republi
cans altogether. The Stanford YR's
action, stopping short of actual with
drawal. was similar to that of a num
ber of other college YR units, in
cluding Ihe Berkeley YRs.
