## 
### DAVE CAMPISI 
Boris I. Nicolaevsky died suddenly
yesterday morning at his home in
Menlo Park Micolaevsky was curator
for the Hoover Institute of a collec
tion of documents, reflecting the
growth of international revolutionary
socialism in the past 100 years.
Nicolaevsky was born in Russia 78
years ago, the son of an Orthodox

priest, and developed socialist politi
cal beliefs early in his life. His first
arrest by the Czarist regime came
while he was still in high school and
before the Bolsheviks took power sev
eral years later he had been arrested
nine more times, and sent to Siberia
four times.
Banished
By 1921 Nicolaevsky had become a
leader of the Menseviks and so was
arrested again by the majority party,
who then banished him from Russia
He spent the Twenties and Thirties
in Germany and France, but was
forced to leave each because of Hit
ler's conquests. He came to the
United States in 1940 where he con
tinued to write and edit The Socialist
Herald, the voice of the Russian So
cial Democratic Labor Party.
During his years in Europe he col
lected more than 20,000 volumes, docu
ments, and letters about the Socialist
movement. He sold this collection to
the Hoover Institute in 1963 shortly
before he came here to serve as Its
curator.
Original Manuscript
The Nicolaevsky Collection includes
original manuscript letters of Lenin,
Trotsky, and their chief Bolshevik
colleagues. It is reputed to be the best
privately-held collection of its topic
in the world.
His recent book, Power and the So
viet Elite, has been recognized as one
of the most enlightening studies of the
power structure of the Soviet govern
ment.
In an interview last month, Nicola
evsky commented, "Of course I hope
and believe the dictatorship in Russia
will not last, that little by little it
will be ransformed ino liberalism. If
not, the outlook for the future of the
whole world is dark, indeed."
