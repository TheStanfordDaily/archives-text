Keep Your Eyes on Israel
The most remarkable people on earth are the Jews, the people of Israel.
These unique men have survived as a distinct group for four thousand years
despite terrible persecution, dispersions and oppression. Their history
reads like the Arabian nights: though carried captive again and again into
foreign nations, they have like the fabled Phoenix, risen repeatedly from their
own ashes to reappear and flourish in the annals of history. Assyria has
perished, Babylon is in ruin, Egypt is devoid of her former splendor, Rome and
Greece are only memories; but the four thousand year old nation Israel is
today back in her homeland prospering and growing in direct fulfillment of
ancient Bible prophecies.
"Thus says the Lord God It is not for your sake O house of Israel, that
I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned
among the nations to which you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my
great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have
profaned among them; and the nations will know that I am the Lord . . .
For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the coun
tries, and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water upon you,
and you shall be clean from all your undeannesses, and from all your idols I
will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you and a new spirit I will put within
you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart
of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes be careful to observe all my ordinances. You shall dwell in the land
which I gave your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your
God (Ezekiel 36:22-28).
As the sovereign God of history brings his people, the Hebrews, back to
the land of Iheir fathers, the stage is being set for the return of Messiah, their
absent king, and the restoration of Jewish prominence as first among the na
tions. Those with the secret, inside clues on life (which comes from knowing
personally Jesus Christ, the God of the Jews), look to Israel for things to come.
It is the Jews who have told us there is but one true God. It is the Jews who
have transmitted to a hungry world the sacred Scriptures, the Word of God.
The future lies with Israel. As Isaiah wrote so long ago, For out of Zion
shall go forth the law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall
judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall
beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears info pruning hooks; nation
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.
Keep you eyes on Israel! Get acquainted with their God!
