# Work, Work, Work To Meet Rising Costs
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
University tuition was raised $55 per quar
ter this year and room and board will go up
$25 per quarter next year. These are not iso
lated increases, but reflect the mounting costs
of higher education which are likely to go
still higher.
Although grants and scholarships are usual
ly increased commensurate with an increase
in fees, a growing number of students have
turned to part-time jobs to meet the financial
burdens of higher education.
In the last three years the price tag on an
undergraduate degree has increased from
$9,960 to $10,680 at next year's rates, exclud
ing books and personal expenses, which the
University estimates at $300 per year. In the
course of a student's undergraduate stay he
can expect an increase in fees at least every
other year. Despite the increases, student fees
by themselves meet only forty percent of Uni
versity operating expenses.
An Honored lastitution
Twenty years ago if a student worked his
way through college, he probably spent his
undergraduate days hashing. Modern tech
nology and the post-war population boom have
not eliminated the time-honored student in
stitution.
What the swell in college enrollments has
brought is an increase in the number of stu
dents who earn part of their expenses and

an amazing variety of schemes to accomplish
the task.
One of the new student-entrepreneurs is
Jim Binns, a political science major, who
works as Auto-Europe's campus representa
tive. Binns makes arrangements for European
bound travellers who want to order a foreign
car in the United States and pick them up at
the European factory.
.Jaek-of-AH-Trades
"It's a very challenging job because I'm my
own boss," Binns remarked. Binns is a jack
of-all trades in the one-man operation. He
writes his own advertising, runs mail cam
paigns, contacts customers, and hopefully
wraps up a deal in the process.
Most of Binns' customers are students who
will be attending one of Stanford's five over
seas campuses. Having purchased a car while
he was at Stanford-in-France, Binns sends
each prospective overseas campus student a
brochure outlining the benefits of having a
car during their stay in Europe. He estimates
between 10 and 20 members in each group
purchase a foreign car, and he plans to get a
good slice of this market.
Binns works on a commission basis. He
admits his pay is probably no better than the
average part-time job, but he enjoys the work
and is getting experience from running his
"own little company."
He has sold seven cars so far this year and
is ahead of last year's pace with the spring

quarter boom still to come. Binns should bene
fit from the increased number of overseas
campuses as well as from new marketing
techniques which he has worked out for the
campus market. Ideally, he sees no reason
why he could not expand to the greater Palo
Alto area.
More Glamour
Binns' job is more glamorous than most,
but Barbara Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service estimates more than half the
student body are earning part of their col
lege expenses. Actual employment figures are
hard to obtain since there is no central office
which handles all student employment.
Most of the major airlines have campus
representatives to promote travel-card pro
grams and organize vacation charter service.
Like Binns they are connected with Sequoia
Travel Service, though paid by the airlines.
The University Food Service handles the
hiring of hashers for all residences. Present
ly there are around 500 hashers employed.
The Athletic department as well as the vari
ous academic departments also do their hiring
independently.
For Big-Drawing Games
The athletic department employs students
as ushers, ticket takers, and program sellers
at University athletic contests. Robert M. But
ler, Business Manager of the athletic depart
ment, estimates that more than a thousand
students are hired for the big-drawing football

games. Students are paid between $1.25 and
$2.25 depending upon their responsibility at
the game.
The most intriguing collection of jobs is
handled by Barbara Cochran of the Student
Employment Service. The service is run by
the University on a non-profit basis at no cost
to students. Various on- and off-campus em
ployers place job requests with Mrs. Cochran.
Each request is recorded in a job file for stu
dents to page through. Students select a job
from the listing and contact the prospective
employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such as baby sit
ting, gardening, theses typing, and tutoring.
However there are many jobs which turn out
to be lasting and lucrative.
Strange Requests
Last year 2,390 students registered at the
Student Employment Service. Of the 6,240
request for help, Mrs. Cochran filled over
4,900. Some students were placed more than
one time, others not all. She noted some stu
dents come in each Thursday to pick out a
job for the weekend.
Like any organization, the service gets its
share of strange requests, but it does its best
to fill them all. Some of the more unusual re
quests filled recently have been:
« Dog-sitter. A graduate student earned $30
for petting, feeding and brushing a Palo Alto
family's trust hound for a week during the
Christmas break.

• Human alarm-clock. A student wife has
been hired to make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She rousts him
out of bed, makes a cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One upperclassman
was hired to teach a boys' club how to fly
gas-engine models.
• Stock boy. Freshman A 1 Tammany was
hired by lon-Tech, a local maker of v a c u u m
pumps, as a stock room assistant. He wound
up building the stock room, organizing it, and
arranging the merchandise. Now lon-Tech has
him actually assembling vacuum pumps.
Contacts and Background
There are many jobs which students get
on their own through personal contacts or be
cause of special background training. Bill
Moore, a graduate student in journalism and
former editor of The Daily covers the campus
for The Chronicle when Lisa Hobbs is un
available. Steve Leopold, also a former Daily
editor, is well paid by Newsweek for sending
in reports on subjects ranging from college
cribbing to fraternity problems to campus ac
tivism.
With rising tuition costs the trends of the
working student are sure to progress even
further. A recent national survey showed
two out of three college students earn part of
their own expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever-increasing tuition
costs.

up building the stock room, organizing it, and
arranging the merchandise. Now lon-Tech has
him actually assembling vacuum pumps.
Contacts and Background
There are many jobs which students get
on their own through personal contacts or be
cause of special background training. Bill
Moore, a graduate student in journalism and
former editor of The Daily covers the campus
for The Chronicle when Lisa Hobbs is un
available. Steve Leopold, also a former Daily
editor, is well paid by Newsweek for sending
in reports on subjects ranging from college
cribbing to fraternity problems to campus ac
tivism.
With rising tuition costs the trends of the
working student are sure to progress even
further. A recent national survey showed
two out of three college students earn part of
their own expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever-increasing tuition
costs.
University tuition was raised $55 per quar
ter this year and room and board will go up
$25 per quarter next year. These are not iso
lated increases, but reflect the mounting costs
of higher education which are likely to go
still higher.
Although grants and scholarships are usual
ly increased commensurate with an increase
in fees, a growing number of students have
turned to part-time jobs to meet the financial
burdens of higher education.
In the last three years the price tag on an
undergraduate degree has increased from
$9,960 to $10,680 at next year's rates, exclud
ing books and personal expenses, which the
University estimates at $300 per year. In the
course of a student's undergraduate stay he
can expect an increase in fees at least every
other year. Despite the increases, student fees
by themselves meet only forty percent of Uni
versity operating expenses.
An Honored lastitution
Twenty years ago if a student worked his
way through college, he probably spent his
undergraduate days hashing. Modern tech
nology and the post-war population boom have
not eliminated the time-honored student in
stitution.
What the swell in college enrollments has
brought is an increase in the number of stu
dents who earn part of their expenses and

an amazing variety of schemes to accomplish
the task.
One of the new student-entrepreneurs is
Jim Binns, a political science major, who
works as Auto-Europe's campus representa
tive. Binns makes arrangements for European
bound travellers who want to order a foreign
car in the United States and pick them up at
the European factory.
.Jaek-of-AH-Trades
"It's a very challenging job because I'm my
own boss," Binns remarked. Binns is a jack
of-all trades in the one-man operation. He
writes his own advertising, runs mail cam
paigns, contacts customers, and hopefully
wraps up a deal in the process.
Most of Binns' customers are students who
will be attending one of Stanford's five over
seas campuses. Having purchased a car while
he was at Stanford-in-France, Binns sends
each prospective overseas campus student a
brochure outlining the benefits of having a
car during their stay in Europe. He estimates
between 10 and 20 members in each group
purchase a foreign car, and he plans to get a
good slice of this market.
Binns works on a commission basis. He
admits his pay is probably no better than the
average part-time job, but he enjoys the work
and is getting experience from running his
"own little company."
He has sold seven cars so far this year and
is ahead of last year's pace with the spring

quarter boom still to come. Binns should bene
fit from the increased number of overseas
campuses as well as from new marketing
techniques which he has worked out for the
campus market. Ideally, he sees no reason
why he could not expand to the greater Palo
Alto area.
More Glamour
Binns' job is more glamorous than most,
but Barbara Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service estimates more than half the
student body are earning part of their col
lege expenses. Actual employment figures are
hard to obtain since there is no central office
which handles all student employment.
Most of the major airlines have campus
representatives to promote travel-card pro
grams and organize vacation charter service.
Like Binns they are connected with Sequoia
Travel Service, though paid by the airlines.
The University Food Service handles the
hiring of hashers for all residences. Present
ly there are around 500 hashers employed.
The Athletic department as well as the vari
ous academic departments also do their hiring
independently.
For Big-Drawing Games
The athletic department employs students
as ushers, ticket takers, and program sellers
at University athletic contests. Robert M. But
ler, Business Manager of the athletic depart
ment, estimates that more than a thousand
students are hired for the big-drawing football

games. Students are paid between $1.25 and
$2.25 depending upon their responsibility at
the game.
The most intriguing collection of jobs is
handled by Barbara Cochran of the Student
Employment Service. The service is run by
the University on a non-profit basis at no cost
to students. Various on- and off-campus em
ployers place job requests with Mrs. Cochran.
Each request is recorded in a job file for stu
dents to page through. Students select a job
from the listing and contact the prospective
employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such as baby sit
ting, gardening, theses typing, and tutoring.
However there are many jobs which turn out
to be lasting and lucrative.
Strange Requests
Last year 2,390 students registered at the
Student Employment Service. Of the 6,240
request for help, Mrs. Cochran filled over
4,900. Some students were placed more than
one time, others not all. She noted some stu
dents come in each Thursday to pick out a
job for the weekend.
Like any organization, the service gets its
share of strange requests, but it does its best
to fill them all. Some of the more unusual re
quests filled recently have been:
« Dog-sitter. A graduate student earned $30
for petting, feeding and brushing a Palo Alto
family's trust hound for a week during the
Christmas break.

• Human alarm-clock. A student wife has
been hired to make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She rousts him
out of bed, makes a cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One upperclassman
was hired to teach a boys' club how to fly
gas-engine models.
• Stock boy. Freshman A 1 Tammany was
hired by lon-Tech, a local maker of v a c u u m
pumps, as a stock room assistant. He wound
up building the stock room, organizing it, and
arranging the merchandise. Now lon-Tech has
him actually assembling vacuum pumps.

Like any organization, the service gets its
share of strange requests, but it does its best
to fill them all. Some of the more unusual re
quests filled recently have been:
« Dog-sitter. A graduate student earned $30
for petting, feeding and brushing a Palo Alto
family's trust hound for a week during the
Christmas break.

• Human alarm-clock. A student wife has
been hired to make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She rousts him
out of bed, makes a cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One upperclassman
was hired to teach a boys' club how to fly
gas-engine models.
• Stock boy. Freshman A 1 Tammany was
hired by lon-Tech, a local maker of v a c u u m
pumps, as a stock room assistant. He wound
up building the stock room, organizing it, and
arranging the merchandise. Now lon-Tech has
him actually assembling vacuum pumps.
Contacts and Background
There are many jobs which students get
on their own through personal contacts or be
cause of special background training. Bill
Moore, a graduate student in journalism and
former editor of The Daily covers the campus
for The Chronicle when Lisa Hobbs is un
available. Steve Leopold, also a former Daily
editor, is well paid by Newsweek for sending
in reports on subjects ranging from college
cribbing to fraternity problems to campus ac
tivism.
With rising tuition costs the trends of the
working student are sure to progress even
further. A recent national survey showed
two out of three college students earn part of
their own expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever-increasing tuition
costs.
University tuition was raised $55 per quar
ter this year and room and board will go up
$25 per quarter next year. These are not iso
lated increases, but reflect the mounting costs
of higher education which are likely to go
still higher.
Although grants and scholarships are usual
ly increased commensurate with an increase
in fees, a growing number of students have
turned to part-time jobs to meet the financial
burdens of higher education.
In the last three years the price tag on an
undergraduate degree has increased from
$9,960 to $10,680 at next year's rates, exclud
ing books and personal expenses, which the
University estimates at $300 per year. In the
course of a student's undergraduate stay he
can expect an increase in fees at least every
other year. Despite the increases, student fees
by themselves meet only forty percent of Uni
versity operating expenses.
An Honored lastitution
Twenty years ago if a student worked his
way through college, he probably spent his
undergraduate days hashing. Modern tech
nology and the post-war population boom have
not eliminated the time-honored student in
stitution.
What the swell in college enrollments has
brought is an increase in the number of stu
dents who earn part of their expenses and

an amazing variety of schemes to accomplish
the task.
One of the new student-entrepreneurs is
Jim Binns, a political science major, who
works as Auto-Europe's campus representa
tive. Binns makes arrangements for European
bound travellers who want to order a foreign
car in the United States and pick them up at
the European factory.
.Jaek-of-AH-Trades
"It's a very challenging job because I'm my
own boss," Binns remarked. Binns is a jack
of-all trades in the one-man operation. He
writes his own advertising, runs mail cam
paigns, contacts customers, and hopefully
wraps up a deal in the process.
Most of Binns' customers are students who
will be attending one of Stanford's five over
seas campuses. Having purchased a car while
he was at Stanford-in-France, Binns sends
each prospective overseas campus student a
brochure outlining the benefits of having a
car during their stay in Europe. He estimates
between 10 and 20 members in each group
purchase a foreign car, and he plans to get a
good slice of this market.
Binns works on a commission basis. He
admits his pay is probably no better than the
average part-time job, but he enjoys the work
and is getting experience from running his
"own little company."
He has sold seven cars so far this year and
is ahead of last year's pace with the spring

quarter boom still to come. Binns should bene
fit from the increased number of overseas
campuses as well as from new marketing
techniques which he has worked out for the
campus market. Ideally, he sees no reason
why he could not expand to the greater Palo
Alto area.
More Glamour
Binns' job is more glamorous than most,
but Barbara Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service estimates more than half the
student body are earning part of their col
lege expenses. Actual employment figures are
hard to obtain since there is no central office
which handles all student employment.
Most of the major airlines have campus
representatives to promote travel-card pro
grams and organize vacation charter service.
Like Binns they are connected with Sequoia
Travel Service, though paid by the airlines.
The University Food Service handles the
hiring of hashers for all residences. Present
ly there are around 500 hashers employed.
The Athletic department as well as the vari
ous academic departments also do their hiring
independently.
For Big-Drawing Games
The athletic department employs students
as ushers, ticket takers, and program sellers
at University athletic contests. Robert M. But
ler, Business Manager of the athletic depart
ment, estimates that more than a thousand
students are hired for the big-drawing football

games. Students are paid between $1.25 and
$2.25 depending upon their responsibility at
the game.
The most intriguing collection of jobs is
handled by Barbara Cochran of the Student
Employment Service. The service is run by
the University on a non-profit basis at no cost
to students. Various on- and off-campus em
ployers place job requests with Mrs. Cochran.
Each request is recorded in a job file for stu
dents to page through. Students select a job
from the listing and contact the prospective
employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such as baby sit
ting, gardening, theses typing, and tutoring.
However there are many jobs which turn out
to be lasting and lucrative.
Strange Requests
Last year 2,390 students registered at the
Student Employment Service. Of the 6,240
request for help, Mrs. Cochran filled over
4,900. Some students were placed more than
one time, others not all. She noted some stu
dents come in each Thursday to pick out a
job for the weekend.

to students. Various on- and off-campus em
ployers place job requests with Mrs. Cochran.
Each request is recorded in a job file for stu
dents to page through. Students select a job
from the listing and contact the prospective
employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such as baby sit
ting, gardening, theses typing, and tutoring.
However there are many jobs which turn out
to be lasting and lucrative.
Strange Requests
Last year 2,390 students registered at the
Student Employment Service. Of the 6,240
request for help, Mrs. Cochran filled over
4,900. Some students were placed more than
one time, others not all. She noted some stu
dents come in each Thursday to pick out a
job for the weekend.
Like any organization, the service gets its
share of strange requests, but it does its best
to fill them all. Some of the more unusual re
quests filled recently have been:
« Dog-sitter. A graduate student earned $30
for petting, feeding and brushing a Palo Alto
family's trust hound for a week during the
Christmas break.

• Human alarm-clock. A student wife has
been hired to make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She rousts him
out of bed, makes a cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One upperclassman
was hired to teach a boys' club how to fly
gas-engine models.
• Stock boy. Freshman A 1 Tammany was
hired by lon-Tech, a local maker of v a c u u m
pumps, as a stock room assistant. He wound
up building the stock room, organizing it, and
arranging the merchandise. Now lon-Tech has
him actually assembling vacuum pumps.
Contacts and Background
There are many jobs which students get
on their own through personal contacts or be
cause of special background training. Bill
Moore, a graduate student in journalism and
former editor of The Daily covers the campus
for The Chronicle when Lisa Hobbs is un
available. Steve Leopold, also a former Daily
editor, is well paid by Newsweek for sending
in reports on subjects ranging from college
cribbing to fraternity problems to campus ac
tivism.
With rising tuition costs the trends of the
working student are sure to progress even
further. A recent national survey showed
two out of three college students earn part of
their own expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever-increasing tuition
costs.
