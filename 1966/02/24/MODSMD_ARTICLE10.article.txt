# AT HARVARD
## Slum Students Succeed 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. <AP) -
The boys who learned their first
lesson' in the slums when they
probably never dreamed of col
lege have made their mark at
Harvard.
Harvard's dean said recently
the college has won its gamble
on more than 200 youths it has
admitted since 1957 who never
would have qualified If judged
on their college board test
grades.
The 200, chosen partly for
their courageous response to a
poverty-stricken upbringing, are
no ordinary scholarship holders.
Raised in Slums
Most were raised in city slums.
Many attended unaccredited
high schools. More than 50 per
cent are Negroes. A few are the
sons of maids and migrant
workers.
The results of one of the first
college recruiting efforts of its
kind were termed "amazing" by
Dean of Admissions Fred L.
Glimp in an interview.
Eighty-five per cent of those
selected have graduated, a num
ber with honors and one with a
Rhodes Scholarship.
The students have kept pace
academically with their more
fortunate associates from the
nation's best preparatory
schools and its academically
strong public high schools.
And they've done It, Dean

Glimp says, ''Without overcom
pensating, without burning all
the bridges of their past behind
them."
It began when Harvard's
deans were mulling the question
ol how much weight college
board scores should be given in
the cases of boys raised in pov
erty and educated in substand
ard quality schools.
The result was establishment
of what became known as "the
Gamble Fund."
The drive to ferret out prom
ising students was spearheaded
by alumni interviewers across
the country and organizations
working among the poor of all
race and nationality back
grounds.
Mental Problems Histories
In many cases, their families
had histories of mental prob
lems. A few parents had even
advised their sons "To quit
school and go to work and
amount to something," Glimp
said.
Dean Glimp said Harvard was
looking for "Boys who are
tough, in the psychological
sense, the resilient."
The college board scores of
the disadvantaged students are
generally in the 400s. Most oth
ers who get into Harvard these
days score in the high 600 sand
in the 700s.
