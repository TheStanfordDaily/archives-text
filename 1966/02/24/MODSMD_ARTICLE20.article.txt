# Frosh Diamondmen Figure Unbeatable
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Hidden away past the rugby field next to El Camino Real there
is a diamond and on that diamond there appears daily the best
troupe of baseball players that Stanford has yet assembled.
This may seem slightly premature since they are only freshmen,
but there is already with only three games under their belts no

small amount of evidence.
On I'aper
The Stanford varsity is bet
ter than they were last year
when they won the CIBA and
posted the all-time winningest
record of any Indian baseball
team, 32-13. With two all-con
ference selectees and an all-
American returning plus six all-
Leaguers from last year's Frosh
team to fill the two vacancies
on the varsity, they should be
imposing to say the least.
Alas (for the varsity), the
Frosh paid no heed. These up
starts blatently beat the "big
boys," 5-3, in the first game of
the season.
In their second game, the
Frosh breezed by San Jose
State's frosh, 8-1. Sandy Vance,
who turned down a pro bonus
bigger than most major leaguers
get on salary in two years,
struck out 16 Spartababes in
nine innings. It was actually a
bad day for Vance; San Jose got
four hits.
Repeat Performance
Don Rose befuddled the Stan
ford varsity for five innings,
and he did it for six frames
against the San Francisco State
frosh Monday. The Frosh won
8-0. Rose struck out seven, al
lowed two hits, and blasted a
340-foot homer over the left
field fence. And he had the flu,
too.
Rod Poteete, two-time all-CIF
player of the year, has yet to
pitch. He has had a severe case
of the flu. Four of his mound
mates are also suffering from
the same malady.
And believe it or not the Frosh
have more than just pitchers.
Outfielder Chuck Hoffmeister
went 3 for 5 with three stolen
bases and scored three runs in
one of the two league games, in
the other, he got three more
stolen bases and scored two
more runs.
Homer for Homer
Against S. F. State Bob Par
ker matched Rose's hit with a
340-foot home run over the
right field fence.
Tony Kales and Lou Wolcher
will throw for the Frosh today
when they play the USF frosh
at USF.
The next home game will be
a non leaguer against Santa
Rosa J. C. Saturday at 2:00
p.m. Third baseman Bob Boone
and first baseman Bob Gallagher
will handle the pitching.
The next games in the Bay
Area Freshman League (which
ineidently Stanford originated
and organized) are against San
ta Clara Frosh March 4 and 5.
