						Viable Solution

A resolution and a by-laws change will be
introduced in the Legislature this evening
which, if passed, should effectively remove the
chief complaint LASSU had against the fonner
student representatives on the Committee of
Fifteen, and at the same time would allow that
committee —presently somewhat crippled due
to uncertainty about its future —to resume its
work.
In its resolution of last week which revised
the Committee, the Legislature complained, "a
regrettable lack of communication between the
members of the Committee of Five and the
Legislature has caused the Committee of Five
to carry out its duties ineffectively." This state
ment of LASSU's sentiments was based, we
feel, on an understandable feeling of frustra
tion —a frustration born out of a lack of infor
mation on what was happening behind the
closed doors of the Committee of Fifteen's
meeting room. Reports to the Legislature of the
Committee's progress have been sketchy, part
ly due to the Committee's rule on secrecy,
partly because the representatives had not
taken the initiative with sufficient frequency
to report to LASSU (insofar as permissible) on
their progress. Both the resolution and the by
laws change to be proposed tonight state that
the student representatives "will be expected
to report their activities regularly to Legisla
ture in as full a manner as the rules of the Com
mittee will allow." This seems the best possible
solution to a problem that cannot be fully re
solved under present circumstances—that of
creating Legislative trust in the Committee
through increased understanding of the Com
mit tee's deliberations.
The Legislature removed three students from
the Committee of 15. The ASSU President
would have lost his scat, too, but for a last
ininute deal by which he was allowed to stay
in exchange for a promise not to oppose the
revision resolution. The charges against the
three were various, including "marshmellow

ism" and "soft-lining," but none were justified.
The three have served well, helping to bring
the University very suddenly to the brink of
success in solving some of its major problems.
Tonight's resolution rightfully calls for their
reinstatement.
The resolution further states that student
representatives to the Committee should be re
called only under the same rules that apply to
student body officers, i.e. submission of a re
call petition signed by 15 per cent of the stu
dent body, followed by a special recall election
in which two-thirds of those voting would have
to opt for removal. This would end LASSU's
self-appointed power to remove a representa
tive everytime he became a "marshmellow" un
der the brunt of the complex facts of a situa
tion, eliminating the necessity of the representa
tive voting the "LASSU line" under threat of
removal, even though he were to believe that
the administration might be —just for once —
"right." The faculty and administration mem
bers vote according to their consciences; it
would be a dangerous and destructive prece
dent for the students to do differently.
Tonight's proposals also call for appoint
ment of the Committee of Five members by
the ASSU President, with the consultation and
approval of the Legislature, for one year
terms. This would make it necessary for
LASSU and the President to agree on the Com
mittee appointments, and thus should assure
the continued good quality and representative
ness of the student representatives. Further,
it might add some semblance of check-and
balance to a student power structure that is
definitely weighted in the direction of LASSU.
The one-year term would add a continuity to
the representation which is necessary for any
in-depth study group.
These proposals will serve as a viable solu
tion to the crisis currently rocking the Commit
tee of 15. We urge the Legislature to accept
them, and thereby continue its quest for justice
and quality in the University.
