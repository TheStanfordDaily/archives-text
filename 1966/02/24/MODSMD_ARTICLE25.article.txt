# In Quest Of The Lost Peace
## 
### JAN JACOBI 
The Legislature's decision to
recall the student members of
the Committee of Fifteen was a
tragic mistake. Not only does it
threaten the Committee of Fif
teen's existence, but it bears di
rectly on the future of student
government.
At the Legislature meeting of
February 10 several representa
tives raised the general ques
tion of the responsibility of the
student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen to the Legisla
ture, and the particular ques
tion' of the student vote on the
Committee's resolution on Un
ion Residence last fall.
Michael Couzcns spoke to de
fend the position of the three
student members who had voted
"with" the administration and
faculty representatives on the
Union issue. The administration
had presented the Committee of
Fifteen with a fait accompli; to
risk a serious split within the
Committee over Union might
have endangered its existence
when more important is s u e s
were certain to come before it
later in the year.
Sellout?
In construing this vote as a
sellout to the administration,
the Legislature members who
voted to change the member
ship of the student delegation
to the Committee of Fifteen
have demonstrated their short
sightedness on this issue.
For in order not to imperil the
continued existence of the Com
mittee of Fifteen in its first
sessions, and in a courageous at
tempt to provide an example for
the administration and faculty
representatives of how the
functionings of the Committee
might ideally operate—that stu
dents, faculty, and administra
tion might vote not as blocs but
as individuals within the con
fines of representation, accord
ing to conscience— Mr. Couzens,
Mr. Mackenzie, and Miss Wat
kins cast their votes for the
resolution of the Committee
against the "hard line" approach
advocated by Mr. Kadane and
Mr. Feldman.
Result
It was more the result of this
vote, rather than the failure to
report the deliberations on the

issue to LASSU (which will
hamper the effectiveness of the
Committee if carried to the ex
treme that LASSU now advo
cates) that caused the delega
tion to be recalled last Thursday
night.
But what we witnessed in the
Legislature last Thursday was
far more than a changeover in
membership within our delega
tion to the Committee of Fif
teen. It was a rejection of the
recent progress made in stu
dent-faculty relations, a rejec
tion made by a small, but vocal
group of students who presume
to speak for the student body
as a whole on this issue. It was
an endorsement of a hard line
student policy in dealing with
the administration — a policy
that should apply to those is
sues where our basic interests
and rights are threatened, i.e.,
sponsor selection, but not to all
negotiations between students
and administration.
New Hope
If the Committee of Fifteen
had represented something new,
it was the hope that administra
tors, faculty, and students meet
ing together might abandon
their prejudged notions of each

other, and in compromise reach
settlement on some of those is
sues which polarize the adminis
tration on one hand and stu
dents on the other. When the
student delegation, acting in
conscience and conviction, split
its vote on the Union resolution,
in a remarkable way it was the
students who were leading, set
ting the example for the admin
istration and faculty represent
atives of how the Committee
might ideally function.
But last week the Legisla
ture rejected this new approach
to student government. It has
taken a dangerous step back
ward into the past—when of
necessity students adopted a
hard line approach on all issues.
The Legislature's decision has
rung the death knell of the Com
mittee of Fifteen—at least the
hope that the Committee might
prove effective. Those of us who
sat through the three hours of
debate as observers left with a
sense of bewilderment, with a
sense of loss, with the feeling
that LASSU had rejected the
principles and beliefs which we
believed had made the Commit
tee of Fifteen a light in the dark
ness, albeit a flickering one.

and administration.
New Hope
If the Committee of Fifteen
had represented something new,
it was the hope that administra
tors, faculty, and students meet
ing together might abandon
their prejudged notions of each

other, and in compromise reach
settlement on some of those is
sues which polarize the adminis
tration on one hand and stu
dents on the other. When the
student delegation, acting in
conscience and conviction, split
its vote on the Union resolution,
in a remarkable way it was the
students who were leading, set
ting the example for the admin
istration and faculty represent
atives of how the Committee
might ideally function.
But last week the Legisla
ture rejected this new approach
to student government. It has
taken a dangerous step back
ward into the past—when of
necessity students adopted a
hard line approach on all issues.
The Legislature's decision has
rung the death knell of the Com
mittee of Fifteen—at least the
hope that the Committee might
prove effective. Those of us who
sat through the three hours of
debate as observers left with a
sense of bewilderment, with a
sense of loss, with the feeling
that LASSU had rejected the
principles and beliefs which we
believed had made the Commit
tee of Fifteen a light in the dark
ness, albeit a flickering one.
The Legislature's decision to
recall the student members of
the Committee of Fifteen was a
tragic mistake. Not only does it
threaten the Committee of Fif
teen's existence, but it bears di
rectly on the future of student
government.
At the Legislature meeting of
February 10 several representa
tives raised the general ques
tion of the responsibility of the
student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen to the Legisla
ture, and the particular ques
tion' of the student vote on the
Committee's resolution on Un
ion Residence last fall.
Michael Couzcns spoke to de
fend the position of the three
student members who had voted
"with" the administration and
faculty representatives on the
Union issue. The administration
had presented the Committee of
Fifteen with a fait accompli; to
risk a serious split within the
Committee over Union might
have endangered its existence
when more important is s u e s
were certain to come before it
later in the year.
Sellout?
In construing this vote as a
sellout to the administration,
the Legislature members who
voted to change the member
ship of the student delegation
to the Committee of Fifteen
have demonstrated their short
sightedness on this issue.
For in order not to imperil the
continued existence of the Com
mittee of Fifteen in its first
sessions, and in a courageous at
tempt to provide an example for
the administration and faculty
representatives of how the
functionings of the Committee
might ideally operate—that stu
dents, faculty, and administra
tion might vote not as blocs but
as individuals within the con
fines of representation, accord
ing to conscience— Mr. Couzens,
Mr. Mackenzie, and Miss Wat
kins cast their votes for the
resolution of the Committee
against the "hard line" approach
advocated by Mr. Kadane and
Mr. Feldman.
Result
It was more the result of this
vote, rather than the failure to
report the deliberations on the

issue to LASSU (which will
hamper the effectiveness of the
Committee if carried to the ex
treme that LASSU now advo
cates) that caused the delega
tion to be recalled last Thursday
night.
But what we witnessed in the
Legislature last Thursday was
far more than a changeover in
membership within our delega
tion to the Committee of Fif
teen. It was a rejection of the
recent progress made in stu
dent-faculty relations, a rejec
tion made by a small, but vocal
group of students who presume
to speak for the student body
as a whole on this issue. It was
an endorsement of a hard line
student policy in dealing with
the administration — a policy
that should apply to those is
sues where our basic interests
and rights are threatened, i.e.,
sponsor selection, but not to all
negotiations between students
and administration.
