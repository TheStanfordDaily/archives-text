# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						Legislature—Action Or Reaction? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The recent actions of the Leg
islature relative to the Commit
tee of Fifteen requires neither
castigation of the body nor indi
vidual members, but, rather, an
understanding of why the Legis
lature may have felt such actions
were needed. This attempt at un
derstanding is demanded of fac
ulty members and administra
tors as well as students for the
Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished to serve the best in
terests of the University com
munity and not a particular sec
tion.
One serious drawback was
clearly recognized when the
Committee idea was first ad
vanced: the possibility that such
a committee would become a
"super" government with the
student representatives becom
ing "super" student leaders. To
avoid this situation it was in
tended that there be several
committees operating at the
same time on separate issues
so that a maximum number of
student leaders could become in
volved in high level discussion.
This concept was never formal
ly agreed upon by the faculty
and administrative representa
tives; in fact, last year closed
without the mechanics of the
committee determined.
For reasons which I do not
know but which were undoubt
edly sound, when the structure
was finally operational this year
there was only one committee
to handle all matters which
might be sent to it. Although it
divided into sub-committees,
there was no staff support and
the resultant bottleneck is un
derstandable.
Another concept, which seems
to have been lost and which was
inherent in the original Commit
tee, that the Committee serves
as a channel of communications
between governing bodies of the
three sub-societies within the
community to avoid the conflicts
which raged last year. The com
mittee was not intended to be
a communication link between
individual student, faculty and
administrators. Yet the commit
tee voted to maintain secrecy
with regard to its deliberations.
(Whether the committee can do
this based upon its creating doc
ument seems doubtful.) Such
secrecy precludes the student
representatives from reporting
to their governing body, the
Legislature; blocking the com
munication channel; and, effec
tively destroying a basic motive
for the very existence of the
committee.
Where does this leave the stu
dent governing body? Para
lyzed! It can not act due to its
commitment to the original con
cept of the Committee and it
cannot be informed of the Com
mittee's progress nor even
whether the students are fairly
representing the views of the
majority. The resulting frustra
tion seems reasonable.
The need for secrecy is clear
to any student leader who has
had access to the subtleties in
volved in many of the problems
which are brought before such
a committee. But surely, one can
see the impossibility of sixty
student legislators being forced
to accept no report as a reason
for not acting.
Is the Committee to be an all-
University governing body (if
not in legal terms then in fact)
and, if so, what changes are
needed in the present governing
structures? Is the Committee to
be a communications link sole
ly? If so, is it fulfilling this
role? Communicating between
whom or what?
While speaking from a purely
organizational viewpoint rather
than personal knowledge of the
present student government, I,
for one, hope that the present
student leaders, whether in
agreement or not with recent
legislative actions, as well as
faculty officers and administra
tors, will not allow what all
signs indicate is a potentially
viable alternative to strife be
discarded because they reacted
rather than acted.

• The Glory That Was
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you, Stanford, oh thank
you. For two quarters of gradu
ate study I have labored and
saddened under the notion that
Stanford students were truly
apathetic. That they were un
committed to and disinterested
in any transcedent values or
concerns for our society had be
come a fact of life for me. But
recently the miasma of my per
ceptions passed away as I hap
pened upon a spontaneous stu
dent demonstration of im
mense and unimaginable propor
tions.
For in White Plaza had ga
thered hundreds of Palo Alto's
finest to vent their emotive re
sponse to a pressing issue with
such clamoring as to gladden all
our hearts. And, hark, oh ye
Winds of Freedom, this was
mainstream Stanford. No long
haired Leftniks, no pinko grad
uate students, no radical profes
sors or teaching assistants, and,
better yet, no non-student, out
side, well trained agitators were
in attendance. Rather, it was a
happy and healthy tumult which
gathered on the Plaza. Pearly
teeth, nylon windbreakers, Clai
rol hair, tenni-pumps, and wait
ing convertibles were the order
of the day.
This was the glorious contri
bution of the IFC to the remem
brance of the grandeur of
Greece and Rome. With great
gusto, brawny chested men
raced down the runway, pulling
chariots laden with fair damsels
of such beauty as to cause even
the most modest Stoic to blush.
Against time and the elements,
these young people displayed
true Grecian courage as they
heaped honor upon themselves
and their Brotherhood.
This was no ordinary specta
cle for it surely compared fa
vorably with Minnesota's Snow
ball Dance or Florida State's
Gator Girl Contest or Ohio
State's Greek God Competition.
Again, Stanford, thank you for
rejuvenating my optimism. And
by the way, Harvard. Watch out
for us next year!

Editor, The Daily:
Today the people of this
country enjoy an unprecedent
edly high standard of living; Job
security, minimum wages, lei
sure time, luxury goods, etc.,
are becoming the way of life.
Particularly with students, this
relatively secure and easy life
is the norm, and as we have
as a group never known any
thing else, we have come to re
gard this way of life as our
birthright.
Unfortunately we were hand
ed this way of life on a platter;
we have never had to earn it.
We have thus come to believe
that privilege can be had with
out responsibility. And so when
something comes along that up
sets our secure little world we
rebel against it and call it names
but lack the courage to face up
to the problem and make what
ever sacrifices are necessary to
solve it.
Now we are faced with a war.
Our 2-S deferments are in dan
ger. Some of us might actually
have to fight, to do something
necessary but difficult, danger
our, and unpleasant for the first
time in our lives. And as the
conflict escalates to higher
levels more of us feel that we
may soon have to give up some
thing for our country for a
change rather merely reap its
benefits; and so our fear and
our rebeling and our name-call
ing grow stronger and louder.
Within each one of us, how
ever, still remain some vestiges
of conscience. Therefore our de
sire to absorb the pleasures of
life into our own little world
without giving anything in re
turn; our unwillingness to make
sacrifices and face up to our re
sponsibilities, must somehow be
rationalized. Our solution has
been to call the war immoral; to
pretend that our side kills only
innocent peace-loving villagers,
while the other side kills only
corrupt officials and bloodthirs
ty Gl's who enjoy their work;
to pretend that we as all-know

ing students are but attempting
to prevent our nations leaders
who really don't know what the
situation is from committing a
crime against humanity.
But let's face it. We simply
don't want to go. And we don't
want any of our luxury-produc
ing economic potential diverted
to production for the war. We
want to be left free to enjoy the
pursuit of an education the
costs of which we pay but a
small fraction of, facing such
challenges as stealing from the
bookstore without getting
caught and pursuing such noble
goals as co-ed rooming with
someone who also wants to
"make love, not war."

Today the people of this
country enjoy an unprecedent
edly high standard of living; Job
security, minimum wages, lei
sure time, luxury goods, etc.,
are becoming the way of life.
Particularly with students, this
relatively secure and easy life
is the norm, and as we have
as a group never known any
thing else, we have come to re
gard this way of life as our
birthright.
Unfortunately we were hand
ed this way of life on a platter;
we have never had to earn it.
We have thus come to believe
that privilege can be had with
out responsibility. And so when
something comes along that up
sets our secure little world we
rebel against it and call it names
but lack the courage to face up
to the problem and make what
ever sacrifices are necessary to
solve it.
Now we are faced with a war.
Our 2-S deferments are in dan
ger. Some of us might actually
have to fight, to do something
necessary but difficult, danger
our, and unpleasant for the first
time in our lives. And as the
conflict escalates to higher
levels more of us feel that we
may soon have to give up some
thing for our country for a
change rather merely reap its
benefits; and so our fear and
our rebeling and our name-call
ing grow stronger and louder.
Within each one of us, how
ever, still remain some vestiges
of conscience. Therefore our de
sire to absorb the pleasures of
life into our own little world
without giving anything in re
turn; our unwillingness to make
sacrifices and face up to our re
sponsibilities, must somehow be
rationalized. Our solution has
been to call the war immoral; to
pretend that our side kills only
innocent peace-loving villagers,
while the other side kills only
corrupt officials and bloodthirs
ty Gl's who enjoy their work;
to pretend that we as all-know

ing students are but attempting
to prevent our nations leaders
who really don't know what the
situation is from committing a
crime against humanity.
But let's face it. We simply
don't want to go. And we don't
want any of our luxury-produc
ing economic potential diverted
to production for the war. We
want to be left free to enjoy the
pursuit of an education the
costs of which we pay but a
small fraction of, facing such
challenges as stealing from the
bookstore without getting
caught and pursuing such noble
goals as co-ed rooming with
someone who also wants to
"make love, not war."

The recent actions of the Leg
islature relative to the Commit
tee of Fifteen requires neither
castigation of the body nor indi
vidual members, but, rather, an
understanding of why the Legis
lature may have felt such actions
were needed. This attempt at un
derstanding is demanded of fac
ulty members and administra
tors as well as students for the
Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished to serve the best in
terests of the University com
munity and not a particular sec
tion.
One serious drawback was
clearly recognized when the
Committee idea was first ad
vanced: the possibility that such
a committee would become a
"super" government with the
student representatives becom
ing "super" student leaders. To
avoid this situation it was in
tended that there be several
committees operating at the
same time on separate issues
so that a maximum number of
student leaders could become in
volved in high level discussion.
This concept was never formal
ly agreed upon by the faculty
and administrative representa
tives; in fact, last year closed
without the mechanics of the
committee determined.
For reasons which I do not
know but which were undoubt
edly sound, when the structure
was finally operational this year
there was only one committee
to handle all matters which
might be sent to it. Although it
divided into sub-committees,
there was no staff support and
the resultant bottleneck is un
derstandable.
Another concept, which seems
to have been lost and which was
inherent in the original Commit
tee, that the Committee serves
as a channel of communications
between governing bodies of the
three sub-societies within the
community to avoid the conflicts
which raged last year. The com
mittee was not intended to be
a communication link between
individual student, faculty and
administrators. Yet the commit
tee voted to maintain secrecy
with regard to its deliberations.
(Whether the committee can do
this based upon its creating doc
ument seems doubtful.) Such
secrecy precludes the student
representatives from reporting
to their governing body, the
Legislature; blocking the com
munication channel; and, effec
tively destroying a basic motive
for the very existence of the
committee.
Where does this leave the stu
dent governing body? Para
lyzed! It can not act due to its
commitment to the original con
cept of the Committee and it
cannot be informed of the Com
mittee's progress nor even
whether the students are fairly
representing the views of the
majority. The resulting frustra
tion seems reasonable.
The need for secrecy is clear
to any student leader who has
had access to the subtleties in
volved in many of the problems
which are brought before such
a committee. But surely, one can
see the impossibility of sixty
student legislators being forced
to accept no report as a reason
for not acting.
Is the Committee to be an all-
University governing body (if
not in legal terms then in fact)
and, if so, what changes are
needed in the present governing
structures? Is the Committee to
be a communications link sole
ly? If so, is it fulfilling this
role? Communicating between
whom or what?
While speaking from a purely
organizational viewpoint rather
than personal knowledge of the
present student government, I,
for one, hope that the present
student leaders, whether in
agreement or not with recent
legislative actions, as well as
faculty officers and administra
tors, will not allow what all
signs indicate is a potentially
viable alternative to strife be
discarded because they reacted
rather than acted.

so that a maximum number of
student leaders could become in

This concept was never formal

and administrative representa

without the mechanics of the

For reasons which I do not

was finally operational this year
there was only one committee
to handle all matters which
might be sent to it. Although it
divided into sub-committees,
there was no staff support and
the resultant bottleneck is un
derstandable.
Another concept, which seems
to have been lost and which was
inherent in the original Commit

as a channel of communications
between governing bodies of the
three sub-societies within the
community to avoid the conflicts
which raged last year. The com
mittee was not intended to be
a communication link between
individual student, faculty and
administrators. Yet the commit
tee voted to maintain secrecy
with regard to its deliberations.
(Whether the committee can do
this based upon its creating doc

secrecy precludes the student
representatives from reporting
to their governing body, the
Legislature; blocking the com
munication channel; and, effec
tively destroying a basic motive
for the very existence of the
committee.
Where does this leave the stu
dent governing body? Para
lyzed! It can not act due to its
commitment to the original con
cept of the Committee and it
cannot be informed of the Com
mittee's progress nor even
whether the students are fairly
representing the views of the
majority. The resulting frustra
tion seems reasonable.
The need for secrecy is clear
to any student leader who has
had access to the subtleties in
volved in many of the problems
which are brought before such
a committee. But surely, one can
see the impossibility of sixty
student legislators being forced
to accept no report as a reason
for not acting.
Is the Committee to be an all-
University governing body (if
not in legal terms then in fact)
and, if so, what changes are
needed in the present governing
structures? Is the Committee to
be a communications link sole
ly? If so, is it fulfilling this
role? Communicating between
whom or what?
While speaking from a purely
organizational viewpoint rather
than personal knowledge of the
present student government, I,
for one, hope that the present
student leaders, whether in
agreement or not with recent
legislative actions, as well as
faculty officers and administra
tors, will not allow what all
signs indicate is a potentially
viable alternative to strife be
discarded because they reacted
rather than acted.

Thank you, Stanford, oh thank

Stanford students were truly

come a fact of life for me. But
recently the miasma of my per

pened upon a spontaneous stu

For in White Plaza had ga

mainstream Stanford. No long

better yet, no non-student, out

in attendance. Rather, it was a
happy and healthy tumult which
gathered on the Plaza. Pearly

This was the glorious contri

Against time and the elements,

This was no ordinary specta

Today the people of this
country enjoy an unprecedent
edly high standard of living; Job
security, minimum wages, lei
sure time, luxury goods, etc.,
are becoming the way of life.
Particularly with students, this
relatively secure and easy life
is the norm, and as we have
as a group never known any
thing else, we have come to re
gard this way of life as our
birthright.
Unfortunately we were hand
ed this way of life on a platter;
we have never had to earn it.
We have thus come to believe
that privilege can be had with
out responsibility. And so when
something comes along that up
sets our secure little world we
rebel against it and call it names
but lack the courage to face up
to the problem and make what
ever sacrifices are necessary to
solve it.
Now we are faced with a war.
Our 2-S deferments are in dan
ger. Some of us might actually
have to fight, to do something
necessary but difficult, danger
our, and unpleasant for the first
time in our lives. And as the
conflict escalates to higher
levels more of us feel that we
may soon have to give up some
thing for our country for a
change rather merely reap its
benefits; and so our fear and
our rebeling and our name-call
ing grow stronger and louder.
Within each one of us, how
ever, still remain some vestiges
of conscience. Therefore our de
sire to absorb the pleasures of
life into our own little world
without giving anything in re
turn; our unwillingness to make
sacrifices and face up to our re
sponsibilities, must somehow be
rationalized. Our solution has
been to call the war immoral; to
pretend that our side kills only
innocent peace-loving villagers,
while the other side kills only
corrupt officials and bloodthirs
ty Gl's who enjoy their work;
to pretend that we as all-know

ing students are but attempting
to prevent our nations leaders
who really don't know what the
situation is from committing a
crime against humanity.
But let's face it. We simply
don't want to go. And we don't
want any of our luxury-produc
ing economic potential diverted
to production for the war. We
want to be left free to enjoy the
pursuit of an education the
costs of which we pay but a
small fraction of, facing such
challenges as stealing from the
bookstore without getting
caught and pursuing such noble
goals as co-ed rooming with
someone who also wants to
"make love, not war."

The recent actions of the Leg

sure time, luxury goods, etc.,
are becoming the way of life.
Particularly with students, this
relatively secure and easy life
is the norm, and as we have
as a group never known any
thing else, we have come to re
gard this way of life as our
birthright.
Unfortunately we were hand
ed this way of life on a platter;
we have never had to earn it.
We have thus come to believe
that privilege can be had with

something comes along that up

rebel against it and call it names
but lack the courage to face up
to the problem and make what

solve it.
Now we are faced with a war.
Our 2-S deferments are in dan

have to fight, to do something
necessary but difficult, danger
our, and unpleasant for the first
time in our lives. And as the

may soon have to give up some

our rebeling and our name-call

Within each one of us, how
ever, still remain some vestiges
of conscience. Therefore our de
sire to absorb the pleasures of
life into our own little world
without giving anything in re

sacrifices and face up to our re
sponsibilities, must somehow be
rationalized. Our solution has
been to call the war immoral; to
pretend that our side kills only
innocent peace-loving villagers,
while the other side kills only
corrupt officials and bloodthirs

to pretend that we as all-know

ing students are but attempting
to prevent our nations leaders
who really don't know what the
situation is from committing a
crime against humanity.
But let's face it. We simply
don't want to go. And we don't
want any of our luxury-produc
ing economic potential diverted
to production for the war. We
want to be left free to enjoy the
pursuit of an education the
costs of which we pay but a
small fraction of, facing such
challenges as stealing from the
bookstore without getting
caught and pursuing such noble
goals as co-ed rooming with
someone who also wants to
"make love, not war."

The recent actions of the Leg
islature relative to the Commit
tee of Fifteen requires neither
castigation of the body nor indi
vidual members, but, rather, an
understanding of why the Legis
lature may have felt such actions
were needed. This attempt at un
derstanding is demanded of fac
ulty members and administra
tors as well as students for the
Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished to serve the best in
terests of the University com
munity and not a particular sec
tion.
One serious drawback was
clearly recognized when the
Committee idea was first ad
vanced: the possibility that such
a committee would become a
"super" government with the
student representatives becom
ing "super" student leaders. To
avoid this situation it was in
tended that there be several
committees operating at the
same time on separate issues
so that a maximum number of
student leaders could become in
volved in high level discussion.
This concept was never formal
ly agreed upon by the faculty
and administrative representa
tives; in fact, last year closed
without the mechanics of the
committee determined.
For reasons which I do not
know but which were undoubt
edly sound, when the structure
was finally operational this year
there was only one committee
to handle all matters which
might be sent to it. Although it
divided into sub-committees,
there was no staff support and
the resultant bottleneck is un
derstandable.
Another concept, which seems
to have been lost and which was
inherent in the original Commit
tee, that the Committee serves
as a channel of communications
between governing bodies of the
three sub-societies within the
community to avoid the conflicts
which raged last year. The com
mittee was not intended to be
a communication link between
individual student, faculty and
administrators. Yet the commit
tee voted to maintain secrecy
with regard to its deliberations.
(Whether the committee can do
this based upon its creating doc
ument seems doubtful.) Such
secrecy precludes the student
representatives from reporting
to their governing body, the
Legislature; blocking the com
munication channel; and, effec
tively destroying a basic motive
for the very existence of the
committee.
Where does this leave the stu
dent governing body? Para
lyzed! It can not act due to its
commitment to the original con
cept of the Committee and it
cannot be informed of the Com
mittee's progress nor even
whether the students are fairly
representing the views of the
majority. The resulting frustra
tion seems reasonable.
The need for secrecy is clear
to any student leader who has
had access to the subtleties in
volved in many of the problems
which are brought before such
a committee. But surely, one can
see the impossibility of sixty
student legislators being forced
to accept no report as a reason
for not acting.
Is the Committee to be an all-
University governing body (if
not in legal terms then in fact)
and, if so, what changes are
needed in the present governing
structures? Is the Committee to
be a communications link sole
ly? If so, is it fulfilling this
role? Communicating between
whom or what?
While speaking from a purely
organizational viewpoint rather
than personal knowledge of the
present student government, I,
for one, hope that the present
student leaders, whether in
agreement or not with recent
legislative actions, as well as
faculty officers and administra
tors, will not allow what all
signs indicate is a potentially
viable alternative to strife be
discarded because they reacted
rather than acted.

Editor, The Daily:
Thank you, Stanford, oh thank
you. For two quarters of gradu
ate study I have labored and
saddened under the notion that
Stanford students were truly
apathetic. That they were un
committed to and disinterested
in any transcedent values or
concerns for our society had be
come a fact of life for me. But
recently the miasma of my per
ceptions passed away as I hap
pened upon a spontaneous stu
dent demonstration of im
mense and unimaginable propor
tions.
For in White Plaza had ga
thered hundreds of Palo Alto's
finest to vent their emotive re
sponse to a pressing issue with
such clamoring as to gladden all
our hearts. And, hark, oh ye
Winds of Freedom, this was
mainstream Stanford. No long
haired Leftniks, no pinko grad
uate students, no radical profes
sors or teaching assistants, and,
better yet, no non-student, out
side, well trained agitators were
in attendance. Rather, it was a
happy and healthy tumult which
gathered on the Plaza. Pearly
teeth, nylon windbreakers, Clai
rol hair, tenni-pumps, and wait
ing convertibles were the order
of the day.
This was the glorious contri
bution of the IFC to the remem
brance of the grandeur of
Greece and Rome. With great
gusto, brawny chested men
raced down the runway, pulling
chariots laden with fair damsels
of such beauty as to cause even
the most modest Stoic to blush.
Against time and the elements,
these young people displayed
true Grecian courage as they
heaped honor upon themselves
and their Brotherhood.
This was no ordinary specta
cle for it surely compared fa
vorably with Minnesota's Snow

Gator Girl Contest or Ohio

Again, Stanford, thank you for

mittee was not intended to be
a communication link between
individual student, faculty and
administrators. Yet the commit
tee voted to maintain secrecy
with regard to its deliberations.
(Whether the committee can do
this based upon its creating doc
ument seems doubtful.) Such
secrecy precludes the student
representatives from reporting
to their governing body, the
Legislature; blocking the com
munication channel; and, effec
tively destroying a basic motive
for the very existence of the
committee.
Where does this leave the stu
dent governing body? Para
lyzed! It can not act due to its
commitment to the original con
cept of the Committee and it
cannot be informed of the Com
mittee's progress nor even
whether the students are fairly
representing the views of the
majority. The resulting frustra
tion seems reasonable.
The need for secrecy is clear
to any student leader who has
had access to the subtleties in
volved in many of the problems
which are brought before such
a committee. But surely, one can
see the impossibility of sixty
student legislators being forced
to accept no report as a reason
for not acting.
Is the Committee to be an all-
University governing body (if
not in legal terms then in fact)
and, if so, what changes are
needed in the present governing
structures? Is the Committee to
be a communications link sole
ly? If so, is it fulfilling this
role? Communicating between
whom or what?
While speaking from a purely
organizational viewpoint rather
than personal knowledge of the
present student government, I,
for one, hope that the present
student leaders, whether in
agreement or not with recent
legislative actions, as well as
faculty officers and administra
tors, will not allow what all
signs indicate is a potentially
viable alternative to strife be
discarded because they reacted
rather than acted.

• The Glory That Was
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you, Stanford, oh thank
you. For two quarters of gradu
ate study I have labored and
saddened under the notion that
Stanford students were truly
apathetic. That they were un
committed to and disinterested
in any transcedent values or
concerns for our society had be
come a fact of life for me. But
recently the miasma of my per
ceptions passed away as I hap
pened upon a spontaneous stu
dent demonstration of im
mense and unimaginable propor
tions.
For in White Plaza had ga
thered hundreds of Palo Alto's
finest to vent their emotive re
sponse to a pressing issue with
such clamoring as to gladden all
our hearts. And, hark, oh ye
Winds of Freedom, this was
mainstream Stanford. No long
haired Leftniks, no pinko grad
uate students, no radical profes
sors or teaching assistants, and,
better yet, no non-student, out
side, well trained agitators were
in attendance. Rather, it was a
happy and healthy tumult which
gathered on the Plaza. Pearly
teeth, nylon windbreakers, Clai
rol hair, tenni-pumps, and wait
ing convertibles were the order
of the day.
This was the glorious contri
bution of the IFC to the remem
brance of the grandeur of
Greece and Rome. With great
gusto, brawny chested men
raced down the runway, pulling
chariots laden with fair damsels
of such beauty as to cause even
the most modest Stoic to blush.
Against time and the elements,
these young people displayed
true Grecian courage as they
heaped honor upon themselves
and their Brotherhood.
This was no ordinary specta
cle for it surely compared fa
vorably with Minnesota's Snow
ball Dance or Florida State's
Gator Girl Contest or Ohio
State's Greek God Competition.
Again, Stanford, thank you for
rejuvenating my optimism. And
by the way, Harvard. Watch out
for us next year!

Editor, The Daily:
Today the people of this
country enjoy an unprecedent
edly high standard of living; Job
security, minimum wages, lei
sure time, luxury goods, etc.,
are becoming the way of life.
Particularly with students, this
relatively secure and easy life
is the norm, and as we have
as a group never known any
thing else, we have come to re
gard this way of life as our
birthright.
Unfortunately we were hand
ed this way of life on a platter;
we have never had to earn it.
We have thus come to believe
that privilege can be had with
out responsibility. And so when
something comes along that up
sets our secure little world we
rebel against it and call it names
but lack the courage to face up
to the problem and make what
ever sacrifices are necessary to
solve it.
Now we are faced with a war.
Our 2-S deferments are in dan
ger. Some of us might actually
have to fight, to do something
necessary but difficult, danger
our, and unpleasant for the first
time in our lives. And as the
conflict escalates to higher
levels more of us feel that we
may soon have to give up some
thing for our country for a
change rather merely reap its
benefits; and so our fear and
our rebeling and our name-call
ing grow stronger and louder.
Within each one of us, how
ever, still remain some vestiges
of conscience. Therefore our de
sire to absorb the pleasures of
life into our own little world
without giving anything in re
turn; our unwillingness to make
sacrifices and face up to our re
sponsibilities, must somehow be
rationalized. Our solution has
been to call the war immoral; to
pretend that our side kills only
innocent peace-loving villagers,
while the other side kills only
corrupt officials and bloodthirs
ty Gl's who enjoy their work;
to pretend that we as all-know

ing students are but attempting
to prevent our nations leaders
who really don't know what the
situation is from committing a
crime against humanity.
But let's face it. We simply
don't want to go. And we don't
want any of our luxury-produc
ing economic potential diverted
to production for the war. We
want to be left free to enjoy the
pursuit of an education the
costs of which we pay but a
small fraction of, facing such
challenges as stealing from the
bookstore without getting
caught and pursuing such noble
goals as co-ed rooming with
someone who also wants to
"make love, not war."

Editor, The Daily:
What a joy to hear once again
from the fantasy world of Mr.
James Kolbe in the Tuesday
Daily. Just think, one of the
right-thinking Kolbe brothers
whose amusing epistles were
sueh a regular feature of the
Northwestern University Dally.
It is indeed, if Mr. Knlbe will
pardon the expression, a small
world. But we welcome our fel
low alum to the Harvard of the
West and wish him well. If he
will write here as often as he
did at the Harvard of the Mid
west, we might even give up our
subscriptions to the Reader** Dl
gest.
