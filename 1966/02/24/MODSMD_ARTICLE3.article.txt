## 
### SUE WICKIZER Assistant Editor 
A "tentative agreement" on the
sponsor selection controversy which
is acceptable to all concerned parties
has been reached, according to Dr.
Philip Rhinelander, Chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen.
Both the Committee of Fifteen and
the Committee on Undergraduate Ed
ucation will meet Monday to formally
consider the proposal.
Details of the agreement have not
been released. Rhinelander felt it
would place undesirable pressure on
both committees and hinder them in
making amendments if details were
released before the meetings.
However, the compromise does in
clude an appeals board similar to the
one proposed by the sponsors and ac
cepted by Dr. Eric Hutchinson, Wilbur
Faculty Master, two weeks ago.
"Negotiations have been going on
and I have great hopes that the propo
sal will be accepted," Rhinelander
stated, "but I can't speak for the mem
bers of either committee."
The agreement is the result of in
formal discussions which Rhineland
er held with the sponsors, the Wilbur
Faculty Master, members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, and members of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Education (CUE).
Both Hutchinson and Dean Wert,
Chairman of CUE, have expressed
their support of the agreement.
"The sponsors are very pleased
with the tentative agreement," stated
A 1 Taylor, Head Wilbur Sponsor.
The controversy was referred to
the Committee of Fifteen last week
when CUE and the Wilbur sponsors
arrived at two separate proposals for
selection of next year's sponsors.
