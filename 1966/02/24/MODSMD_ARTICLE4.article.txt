# 'Horizons' Program Asks For Volunteers
## 
### JOHN HODGES 
"Horizons," an outdoor recreation
program for culturally deprived chil
dren in Sunnyvale, is seeking Stan
ford volunteers.
Under the direction of Steve Man
ley, a graduate law student at Stan
ford, Horizons reaches children—
many of Mexican-American descent
or from fatherless homes—with "op
portunities they don't generally have."
In groups of about 15, the children

choose by themselves the activities
they would like to participate in.
Field trips and outdoor excursions are
among the suggestions the program
has already sponsored. Hiking trips
for nature study, educational visits
to airplane manufacturing companies,
or just athletic activities at public
parks are enjoyed by the children,
Manley said.
Many of the Sunnyvale boys sim
ply don't get a chance to get away
from home, to form friendships with
adults, or to do the things that chil
dren from higher economic groups do
as a matter of course.
"Riding an elevator for some of
these kinds," Manley noted, "is some
thing they've never done in their
lives."
Volunteers Needed
Sponsored by the Lakewood Village
Residents' Assn. in cooperation with
the Sunnyvale School District, Hori
zons now reaches boys in the second
through seventh grades. Some assist
ance from the Federal anti-poverty
program is also hoped for, according
to Manley.
Stanford students are needed "to
help the children form personal rela
tionships with adults outside the
classroom," he said. The only qualifi
cation for volunteers is liking to work
with children.
"The program depends entirely up
on volunteers," Manley added. "We
reach a few children now, but we'd
like to get much larger. As of now
we only work with boys in the pro
gram, but if we can get enough help
we'd like to expand it to include
girls."
