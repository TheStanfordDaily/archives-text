# Copland Sounds Computer Music

It was Twilight Zone revisited as
Aaron Copland exposed his audience
to "musiea ex imiehina" last night
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The wierd, whining sounds were
part of the famed American com
poser's lecture, "Recent Trends in
Contemporary Music."
"We are at the end of a line that
began without microphones, record
ers, or amplifiers. Now we can have
music without instruments, without
performers, and without com
posers."
Copland explained that, we are in
the midst of a serious revolution in
the musical world that questions all
previous assumptions about harmony
and intonation. He labeled the trend
"startling and confusing. It is un
precedented, and we cannot forsee
the outcome."
Music lovers seek to preserve the
familiar in a way that isn't always
true for the other art forms, accord
ing to Copland, but new artists are

looking for a challenge. "Music has
always been a great solace—a warm
bath we feel comfortable in.
"Modern composers don't want to
create more hot water, they want to
stir you up," he continued. "Don't get
in the mood to listen for old emo
tions. Prepare for new sensations."
Copland attributed the new musical
forms to the injection of scientific
thought into the realm of melody.
"Tone has become more than a fact
of nature. Music and mathematics
have been combined, and terms like
vibration, deeibells, frequency, and
duration enter the musician's vocabu
lary."
The new musical forms began in
the 1930's when musicians tried to
reproduce the sounds of industry and
traffic. Monophonic electronic instru
ments were developed that could pro
duce sounds artificially. Magnetic
tape recorders enabled technicians to
manipulate natural sounds like drip
ping water or ringing bells.
Today tone generators can produce

an infinite range of synthetic sounds.
Copland played tapes of compositions
constructed by computers and played
by electronic devices.
After playing a tape of "Bicycle
Built for Two;" sung and accompa
nied by a honky-tonk synthesizer,
Copland reassured his listeners that
some traditional music is still being
produced.
"My previous comments have been
made to give you a better under
standing of the abnormal condi
tions under which normal music is
being written."

some traditional music is still being
produced.
"My previous comments have been
made to give you a better under
standing of the abnormal condi
tions under which normal music is
being written."
It was Twilight Zone revisited as
Aaron Copland exposed his audience
to "musiea ex imiehina" last night
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The wierd, whining sounds were
part of the famed American com
poser's lecture, "Recent Trends in
Contemporary Music."
"We are at the end of a line that
began without microphones, record
ers, or amplifiers. Now we can have
music without instruments, without
performers, and without com
posers."
Copland explained that, we are in
the midst of a serious revolution in
the musical world that questions all
previous assumptions about harmony
and intonation. He labeled the trend
"startling and confusing. It is un
precedented, and we cannot forsee
the outcome."
Music lovers seek to preserve the
familiar in a way that isn't always
true for the other art forms, accord
ing to Copland, but new artists are

looking for a challenge. "Music has
always been a great solace—a warm
bath we feel comfortable in.
"Modern composers don't want to
create more hot water, they want to
stir you up," he continued. "Don't get
in the mood to listen for old emo
tions. Prepare for new sensations."
Copland attributed the new musical
forms to the injection of scientific
thought into the realm of melody.
"Tone has become more than a fact
of nature. Music and mathematics
have been combined, and terms like
vibration, deeibells, frequency, and
duration enter the musician's vocabu
lary."
The new musical forms began in
the 1930's when musicians tried to
reproduce the sounds of industry and
traffic. Monophonic electronic instru
ments were developed that could pro
duce sounds artificially. Magnetic
tape recorders enabled technicians to
manipulate natural sounds like drip
ping water or ringing bells.
Today tone generators can produce

an infinite range of synthetic sounds.
Copland played tapes of compositions
constructed by computers and played
by electronic devices.
After playing a tape of "Bicycle
Built for Two;" sung and accompa
nied by a honky-tonk synthesizer,
Copland reassured his listeners that
some traditional music is still being
produced.
"My previous comments have been
made to give you a better under
standing of the abnormal condi
tions under which normal music is
being written."
