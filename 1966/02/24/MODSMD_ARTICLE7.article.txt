# Janis To Perform
## 
### 
Byron Janis, one of the nation's
finest pianists, comes to Stanford
Monday for a concert.
He will be heard at 8:30 p.m in Me
morial Auditorium. The appearance
is one of the winter season's presen
tations of the Associated Students of
Stanford University. Seats are still
available at the Tresidder Union box
office.
Janis, originally from McKeesport,
Penn., was discovered early as a po
tential great in the music field, when
his kindergarten teacher noted the
boy's perfect pitch. His first public
concert was held only five years later.
He received his later training in New
York City, and in the opinion of one
critic, is one of the few who success
fully made a smooth transition into
"deep artistic maturity."
Janis has made eight concert tours
in Western Europe, four in Latin
America, and in 1962, made a series
of appearances in Russia. There he
reportedly received one of the great
est receptions ever given an Ameri
can artist.
During his most recent tour of
Western Europe this summer he made
special triumphs in Paris, where he
was hailed as "one of the great
pianists of our time."
In 1961 he was invited both by the
Boston Symphony and the Orchestra

of the Paris Conservatory as soloist
to mark the 150 th anniversary of
Franz Liszt's birth.
Janis' appearance at Stanford is
part of his current North American
tour under the aegis of S. Hurok. He
will play a series of concerts with the
leading U.S. orchestras including The
Philadelphia and Chicago Philharmon
ic orchestras. He will also appear in
recital in thirty-five U.S. and Cana
dian cities.
