# Recall Will Be Discussed Again
## 
### 
The Legislature will consider to
night a resolution which would nullify
its action last week that replaced
three student representatives to the
Committee of Fifteen.
The resolution, sponsored by Chick
Sullivan, Jon Roise, Bob Klein, Clark
Brown and George Pelling, would re
instate the previous representatives
to the Committee and would specify
that representatives report regularly
to the Legislature "in as full a man
ner as the rules of the Committee of
Fifteen will allow."
Three Recalled
The Legislature last week recalled
Michael Couzens, Jennifer Watkins,
and Gary Feldman from the Commit
tee, appointed Martin Berry, Tom
Forstenzer and John Butler in their
place, and made all student represen
tatives to the Committee subject to
legislative recall at any time.
A petition, signed by 676 students
and sponsored by Tom Galbraith,

which would place the Legislature's
recall of the student members of the
Committee before the student body
for a referendum vote, was submit
ted Monday to the President of the
ASSU. The intent of the resolution to
be introduced tonight, however, was
to make such a referendum unneces
sary.
Referendum Necessary
But it appeared yesterday, that the
referendum would be held anyway un
less the Legislature passed a verbatim
version of the petition. The resolution
to be introduced to the Legislature
tonight is not such a version.
Galbraith, who is partly responsi
ble for the resolution, said last night
that the sponsors might amend the
resolution so as to make the refer
endum contingent on the Legislature
vote.
Appointment Procedure
Also included on the Legislature's
agenda tonight is a bill which would
establish a procedure for the appoint
ment of student representatives to
the Committee of Fifteen.
It would have the speaker propose
to the Legislature candidates to fill
four seats on the Committee. The fifth
seat would be held by the ASSU Presi
dent or his representative "appointed
with the advice and consent of the
Legislature."
Other legislation scheduled for to
night includes a resolution to estab
lish the Convalescent Home Charity
Drive for the week of May 1-8 and a
resolution appropriating funds for a
KZSU program guide.
The meeting, which is to be broad
cast live on KZSU, will be held at
7:30 in Room 320.

7:30 in Room 320.
The Legislature will consider to
night a resolution which would nullify
its action last week that replaced
three student representatives to the
Committee of Fifteen.
The resolution, sponsored by Chick
Sullivan, Jon Roise, Bob Klein, Clark
Brown and George Pelling, would re
instate the previous representatives
to the Committee and would specify
that representatives report regularly
to the Legislature "in as full a man
ner as the rules of the Committee of
Fifteen will allow."
Three Recalled
The Legislature last week recalled
Michael Couzens, Jennifer Watkins,
and Gary Feldman from the Commit
tee, appointed Martin Berry, Tom
Forstenzer and John Butler in their
place, and made all student represen
tatives to the Committee subject to
legislative recall at any time.
A petition, signed by 676 students
and sponsored by Tom Galbraith,

which would place the Legislature's
recall of the student members of the
Committee before the student body
for a referendum vote, was submit
ted Monday to the President of the
ASSU. The intent of the resolution to
be introduced tonight, however, was
to make such a referendum unneces
sary.
Referendum Necessary
But it appeared yesterday, that the
referendum would be held anyway un
less the Legislature passed a verbatim
version of the petition. The resolution
to be introduced to the Legislature
tonight is not such a version.
Galbraith, who is partly responsi
ble for the resolution, said last night
that the sponsors might amend the
resolution so as to make the refer
endum contingent on the Legislature
vote.
Appointment Procedure
Also included on the Legislature's
agenda tonight is a bill which would
establish a procedure for the appoint
ment of student representatives to
the Committee of Fifteen.
It would have the speaker propose
to the Legislature candidates to fill
four seats on the Committee. The fifth
seat would be held by the ASSU Presi
dent or his representative "appointed
with the advice and consent of the
Legislature."
Other legislation scheduled for to
night includes a resolution to estab
lish the Convalescent Home Charity
Drive for the week of May 1-8 and a
resolution appropriating funds for a
KZSU program guide.
The meeting, which is to be broad
cast live on KZSU, will be held at
7:30 in Room 320.
