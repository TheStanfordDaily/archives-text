# Petition Removal Impossible; Students Must Vote On Recall
## 
### 
The petition for a referendum con
cerning the question of recall of the
student members of the Committee of
Fifteen cannot be withdrawn, accord
ing to LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane.
Organizer by Tom Galbraith and
backed by 676 signers, the petition
will bring the LASSU resolution
allowing immediate recall of three
members of the Committee before the
student body for a vote.
Under the ASSU constitution, the
petition cannot be withdrawn now.
Galbraith had wanted to withdraw it
if a "satisfactory" resolution is passed
by LASSU this Thursday.
"If some of the leaders in the peti
tion drive no longer favor it, they will
have to persuade their following to
vote against it when it comes to a stu
dent body vote," wrote Kadane in a
letter to The Daily.
"Neither Galbraith nor all 676 peti
tioners can withdraw it now," he said.
Galbraith said he filed the petition
Monday, the deadline for initiating
a referendum this quarter. He would
have preferred to wait until after
LASSU meeting tonight.
The resolution in question replaces
three of the five student members of
the Committee and gives LASSU a
vote of "no confidence" in future
members.
The petition opposes the immediate
recall on the ground that it would
handicap the Committee in working
on important current issues. Other
wise, it favors LASSU recall.
Galbraith stated, "The exact word
ing on the petition happens to be the
course of action we all favor." He had
planned to "compromise points we did
not feel were absolutely essential in

order to get quick redress of the situ
ation in LASSU," in the form of an
alternate resolution. However, only
the passage of a bill which agrees,
word for word, with the petition can
stop the referendum.
"We shall be more than delighted to
see the petition go before the student
body," said Galbraith. "We are more
than confident that it will pass thun
derously."
