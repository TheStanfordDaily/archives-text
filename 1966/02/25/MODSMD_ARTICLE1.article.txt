• IFage Dispute Looms
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — AFL-CIO
president George Meany said today
he isn't looking for a fight with Presi
dent Johnson, but will battle the ad
ministration in congress if the White
House won't accept organized labor's
minimum wage demand.
"I'm not looking for a war with
anyone," Meany said at a news con
ference, but "if somebody wants a war
wilh us, that's different."
Asked if he thought Secretary of
Labor W. Willard Wirtz had signaled
such a war in saying the White House
won't bargain with labor over the
amount of a minimum wage increase,
Meany said, "I hope I get better com
petition than that."
The council proposes raising it from
the present $1.25 to $1.40 this year
and $1.60 in 1968. Labor wants the
jump to $1.60 in 1967 and to $1.75 in
1968.
"I've just got a suspicion that Gard
ner Aekley (chairman of the council
of economic advisors) is calling the
shots," Meany said.

ter their quickly won victory that
they acted because Nkrumah abused
individual rights and liberties.

"as if it were his own personal prop
erty."
While firing was still going on be
tween paratroops who spearheaded
the revolt and the presidential guard,
thousands of celcbrators poured into
the streets of Accra in a carnival of
drinking, dancing and merrymaking.

• IFage Dispute Looms
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — AFL-CIO
president George Meany said today
he isn't looking for a fight with Presi
dent Johnson, but will battle the ad
ministration in congress if the White
House won't accept organized labor's
minimum wage demand.
"I'm not looking for a war with
anyone," Meany said at a news con
ference, but "if somebody wants a war
wilh us, that's different."
Asked if he thought Secretary of
Labor W. Willard Wirtz had signaled
such a war in saying the White House
won't bargain with labor over the
amount of a minimum wage increase,
Meany said, "I hope I get better com
petition than that."
The council proposes raising it from
the present $1.25 to $1.40 this year
and $1.60 in 1968. Labor wants the
jump to $1.60 in 1967 and to $1.75 in
1968.
"I've just got a suspicion that Gard
ner Aekley (chairman of the council
of economic advisors) is calling the
shots," Meany said.
