# SSRF REPLIES TO OSBORINE
## Health Service Usurps Private Choice 
### 
We were interested to read
the rather comprehensive state
ment by Dr. Maurice Osborne
on the contraceptive policy of
the University Health Service.
We are pleased that our petition
has led to a public discussion
and reappraisal of Health Ser
vice policy. Although we are in
agreement with some of the
points in Dr. Osborne's article,
we would like to present an al
ternate view on several of the
more important ones.
Any discrimination or differ
entiation by the Health Service
on the basis of marital status
in prescribing contraceptives im
plies a moral judgement on pre
marital intercourse. We do not
believe that the Health Service
should be in the business of
making a judgement on the'
morality of premarital relations.
If the Health Service wishes to
remain truly neutral in this
arena, then their contraceptive
policy should not discriminate
between married and unmarried
students.
Pill Machine
Dr. Osborne seems to feel
that granting the Health Service
the authority to prescribe con
traceptives to any student de
siring them would turn it into
a "pill machine" and thus would
damage the possibility of ef
fective doctor-patient relation
ships. It would seem, however,
that the present policy imply
ing disapproval of premarital
intercourse is what would keep
a woman from feeling free to
discuss her problems and atti
tudes with the doctor. This dis
approval, it would seem, goes
further to making the woman
student reticent about coming
in and discussing any sexual
problems with competent medi
cal authorities.
We think it should be made
clear that the Sexual Rights
Forum is not advocating any
particular sexual ethic. Rather,
we are simply trying to have
the responsibility of choice
placed on the individual. The
Health Service should be per
fectly free to inform and ad
vise students, but it cannot af
ford to make decisions for
them.

We wish to disclaim any re
sponsibility for the "exploitive"
behavior so frequently alluded
to in Dr. Osborne's article. We
advocate individual choice and
individual responsibility for
one's own acts. What consent
ing adults do in private is strict
ly their own business and
should not be the concern of
others. It is misleading (at the
very least) to refer to the SSRF
in one sentence and in the very
next refer to "irresponsible, ex
ploitive behavior."
It is fine for Dr. Osborne to
enumerate the groups that are
in a position to influence Uni
versity policy. We are quite
aware that parents, alumni,
Trustees (and the little old la
dies of Palo Alto) all have an
important say in policy-making.
This listing of the "powers that
be" does not constitute a valid
argument in favor of present
Health Service policy nor does it
constitute a valid criticism of
those who advocate change. It
would be truly inspiring to see
Stanford University in the fore
front of progressive social
change instead of seeing it cling
ing to the Victorian morality
and hypocrisy of the nineteenth
century!
No Effort
At the present time the Uni
versity Health Service makes no
effort to insure that entering
students know even the basic
"facts of life." This omission
strikes us as a particularly se
rious lack of concern for the
students' personal welfare. This
situation could be greatly im
proved by merely including a
concise booklet on "Methods of
Birth Control," as published by
the Planned Parenthood Asso
ciation, in the information given
to freshmen during pre-registra
tion week. It would be very use
ful to include along with this
booklet, a statement describing
the contraceptive policy of the
Health Service.
In an effort to keep from be
coming a "pill machine," the
Health Service has fostered an
even more mechanical approach.
The mere fact that a girl has to
go to Palo Alto for contracep
tives does not mean that her
decision is any more responsi
ble, but only that she had $15 to
pay for an appointment. Regard
less of where one goes for a
prescription for birth control
pills, there will be an equally
responsible or irresponsible ac
tion; and we do not believe
Stanford women are so imma
ture that they would look upon
University cooperation as any
lessening of the personal nature
of this important decision.
Complete Care
If the University is sincerely
concerned about the Health of
its students, it should provide
for complete medical care. The
Health Service is much better
able to provide a lasting doctor
patient relationship, and should
recognize its responsibility to do
so. In short, all the problems
|hat Dr. Osborne's statement
mentioned exist under the pres
ent system. A more realistic
acceptance of the Health Ser
vice's legitimate role in this area

Doug Bitty, Jim Sayre, and Laurie Wise of the Stanford Sex
ual Rights Forum have prepared this reply to an extensive
statement by Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Executive Director of the
University Health Service, which was published in The Daily
February 16. Dr. Osborne explained that the Health Service's
policy is to prescribe contraceptives only to students who are
married or who have a bona fide intent to marry within a
month or two.

could bring only increased re
sponsibility, which seems to be
the goal of all sides of this con
troversy.
Student Support
The only way the University
Health Service's contraceptive
policy will be liberalized to any
significant degree in the near
future is if there is strong stu
dent support for such a change.
This is why we are circulating
the petition urging that "th e
Health Service be authorized to

prescribe contraceptives to any
student desiring them." We hope
that this petition will have the
support of a majority of the stu
dents who vote in the proposed
campus-wide referendum. This
would give the Administration
the strong support that it needs
to liberalize the present policy.
It is evident to us that Stan
for students are mature enough
to make important personal de
cisions by themselves. We can
see little benefit from a Health
Service contraceptive policy
which contains built-in preju
dices against students making
their own decisions. We reject
the concept of in looa parentis
even-if it is discreetly practiced
by the Health Service. We urge
all students who agree with us
to sign and help circulate our
petition. The SSRF will have a
table in front of the Post Office
next Tuesday where petitions
can be picked up and signed.

table in front of the Post Office
next Tuesday where petitions
can be picked up and signed.
We were interested to read
the rather comprehensive state
ment by Dr. Maurice Osborne
on the contraceptive policy of
the University Health Service.
We are pleased that our petition
has led to a public discussion
and reappraisal of Health Ser
vice policy. Although we are in
agreement with some of the
points in Dr. Osborne's article,
we would like to present an al
ternate view on several of the
more important ones.
Any discrimination or differ
entiation by the Health Service
on the basis of marital status
in prescribing contraceptives im
plies a moral judgement on pre
marital intercourse. We do not
believe that the Health Service
should be in the business of
making a judgement on the'
morality of premarital relations.
If the Health Service wishes to
remain truly neutral in this
arena, then their contraceptive
policy should not discriminate
between married and unmarried
students.
Pill Machine
Dr. Osborne seems to feel
that granting the Health Service
the authority to prescribe con
traceptives to any student de
siring them would turn it into
a "pill machine" and thus would
damage the possibility of ef
fective doctor-patient relation
ships. It would seem, however,
that the present policy imply
ing disapproval of premarital
intercourse is what would keep
a woman from feeling free to
discuss her problems and atti
tudes with the doctor. This dis
approval, it would seem, goes
further to making the woman
student reticent about coming
in and discussing any sexual
problems with competent medi
cal authorities.
We think it should be made
clear that the Sexual Rights
Forum is not advocating any
particular sexual ethic. Rather,
we are simply trying to have
the responsibility of choice
placed on the individual. The
Health Service should be per
fectly free to inform and ad
vise students, but it cannot af
ford to make decisions for
them.

We wish to disclaim any re
sponsibility for the "exploitive"
behavior so frequently alluded
to in Dr. Osborne's article. We
advocate individual choice and
individual responsibility for
one's own acts. What consent
ing adults do in private is strict
ly their own business and
should not be the concern of
others. It is misleading (at the
very least) to refer to the SSRF
in one sentence and in the very
next refer to "irresponsible, ex
ploitive behavior."
It is fine for Dr. Osborne to
enumerate the groups that are
in a position to influence Uni
versity policy. We are quite
aware that parents, alumni,
Trustees (and the little old la
dies of Palo Alto) all have an
important say in policy-making.
This listing of the "powers that
be" does not constitute a valid
argument in favor of present
Health Service policy nor does it
constitute a valid criticism of
those who advocate change. It
would be truly inspiring to see
Stanford University in the fore
front of progressive social
change instead of seeing it cling
ing to the Victorian morality
and hypocrisy of the nineteenth
century!
No Effort
At the present time the Uni
versity Health Service makes no
effort to insure that entering
students know even the basic
"facts of life." This omission
strikes us as a particularly se
rious lack of concern for the
students' personal welfare. This
situation could be greatly im
proved by merely including a
concise booklet on "Methods of
Birth Control," as published by
the Planned Parenthood Asso
ciation, in the information given
to freshmen during pre-registra
tion week. It would be very use
ful to include along with this
booklet, a statement describing
the contraceptive policy of the
Health Service.
In an effort to keep from be
coming a "pill machine," the
Health Service has fostered an
even more mechanical approach.
The mere fact that a girl has to
go to Palo Alto for contracep
tives does not mean that her
decision is any more responsi
ble, but only that she had $15 to
pay for an appointment. Regard
less of where one goes for a
prescription for birth control
pills, there will be an equally
responsible or irresponsible ac
tion; and we do not believe
Stanford women are so imma
ture that they would look upon
University cooperation as any
lessening of the personal nature
of this important decision.
Complete Care
If the University is sincerely
concerned about the Health of
its students, it should provide
for complete medical care. The
Health Service is much better
able to provide a lasting doctor
patient relationship, and should
recognize its responsibility to do
so. In short, all the problems
|hat Dr. Osborne's statement
mentioned exist under the pres
ent system. A more realistic
acceptance of the Health Ser
vice's legitimate role in this area

Doug Bitty, Jim Sayre, and Laurie Wise of the Stanford Sex
ual Rights Forum have prepared this reply to an extensive
statement by Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Executive Director of the
University Health Service, which was published in The Daily
February 16. Dr. Osborne explained that the Health Service's
policy is to prescribe contraceptives only to students who are
married or who have a bona fide intent to marry within a
month or two.

the goal of all sides of this con

Student Support
The only way the University
Health Service's contraceptive
policy will be liberalized to any
significant degree in the near
future is if there is strong stu
dent support for such a change.
This is why we are circulating
the petition urging that "th e
Health Service be authorized to

prescribe contraceptives to any
student desiring them." We hope
that this petition will have the
support of a majority of the stu
dents who vote in the proposed
campus-wide referendum. This
would give the Administration
the strong support that it needs
to liberalize the present policy.
It is evident to us that Stan
for students are mature enough
to make important personal de
cisions by themselves. We can
see little benefit from a Health
Service contraceptive policy
which contains built-in preju
dices against students making
their own decisions. We reject
the concept of in looa parentis
even-if it is discreetly practiced
by the Health Service. We urge
all students who agree with us
to sign and help circulate our
petition. The SSRF will have a
table in front of the Post Office

to sign and help circulate our
petition. The SSRF will have a
table in front of the Post Office
next Tuesday where petitions
can be picked up and signed.
We were interested to read
the rather comprehensive state
ment by Dr. Maurice Osborne
on the contraceptive policy of
the University Health Service.
We are pleased that our petition
has led to a public discussion
and reappraisal of Health Ser
vice policy. Although we are in
agreement with some of the
points in Dr. Osborne's article,
we would like to present an al
ternate view on several of the
more important ones.
Any discrimination or differ
entiation by the Health Service
on the basis of marital status
in prescribing contraceptives im
plies a moral judgement on pre
marital intercourse. We do not
believe that the Health Service
should be in the business of
making a judgement on the'
morality of premarital relations.
If the Health Service wishes to
remain truly neutral in this
arena, then their contraceptive
policy should not discriminate
between married and unmarried
students.
Pill Machine
Dr. Osborne seems to feel
that granting the Health Service
the authority to prescribe con
traceptives to any student de
siring them would turn it into
a "pill machine" and thus would
damage the possibility of ef
fective doctor-patient relation
ships. It would seem, however,
that the present policy imply
ing disapproval of premarital
intercourse is what would keep
a woman from feeling free to
discuss her problems and atti
tudes with the doctor. This dis
approval, it would seem, goes
further to making the woman
student reticent about coming
in and discussing any sexual
problems with competent medi
cal authorities.
We think it should be made
clear that the Sexual Rights
Forum is not advocating any
particular sexual ethic. Rather,
we are simply trying to have
the responsibility of choice
placed on the individual. The
Health Service should be per
fectly free to inform and ad
vise students, but it cannot af
ford to make decisions for
them.

We wish to disclaim any re
sponsibility for the "exploitive"
behavior so frequently alluded
to in Dr. Osborne's article. We
advocate individual choice and
individual responsibility for
one's own acts. What consent
ing adults do in private is strict
ly their own business and
should not be the concern of
others. It is misleading (at the
very least) to refer to the SSRF
in one sentence and in the very
next refer to "irresponsible, ex
ploitive behavior."
It is fine for Dr. Osborne to
enumerate the groups that are
in a position to influence Uni
versity policy. We are quite
aware that parents, alumni,
Trustees (and the little old la
dies of Palo Alto) all have an
important say in policy-making.
This listing of the "powers that
be" does not constitute a valid
argument in favor of present
Health Service policy nor does it
constitute a valid criticism of
those who advocate change. It
would be truly inspiring to see
Stanford University in the fore
front of progressive social
change instead of seeing it cling
ing to the Victorian morality
and hypocrisy of the nineteenth
century!
No Effort
At the present time the Uni
versity Health Service makes no
effort to insure that entering
students know even the basic
"facts of life." This omission
strikes us as a particularly se
rious lack of concern for the
students' personal welfare. This
situation could be greatly im
proved by merely including a
concise booklet on "Methods of
Birth Control," as published by
the Planned Parenthood Asso
ciation, in the information given
to freshmen during pre-registra
tion week. It would be very use
ful to include along with this
booklet, a statement describing
the contraceptive policy of the
Health Service.
In an effort to keep from be
coming a "pill machine," the
Health Service has fostered an
even more mechanical approach.
The mere fact that a girl has to
go to Palo Alto for contracep
tives does not mean that her
decision is any more responsi
ble, but only that she had $15 to
pay for an appointment. Regard
less of where one goes for a
prescription for birth control
pills, there will be an equally
responsible or irresponsible ac
tion; and we do not believe
Stanford women are so imma
ture that they would look upon
University cooperation as any
lessening of the personal nature
of this important decision.
Complete Care
If the University is sincerely
concerned about the Health of
its students, it should provide
for complete medical care. The
Health Service is much better
able to provide a lasting doctor
patient relationship, and should
recognize its responsibility to do
so. In short, all the problems
|hat Dr. Osborne's statement
mentioned exist under the pres
ent system. A more realistic
acceptance of the Health Ser
vice's legitimate role in this area

Doug Bitty, Jim Sayre, and Laurie Wise of the Stanford Sex
ual Rights Forum have prepared this reply to an extensive
statement by Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Executive Director of the
University Health Service, which was published in The Daily
February 16. Dr. Osborne explained that the Health Service's
policy is to prescribe contraceptives only to students who are
married or who have a bona fide intent to marry within a
month or two.

Student Support
The only way the University
Health Service's contraceptive
policy will be liberalized to any
significant degree in the near
future is if there is strong stu
dent support for such a change.
This is why we are circulating
the petition urging that "th e
Health Service be authorized to

prescribe contraceptives to any
student desiring them." We hope
that this petition will have the
support of a majority of the stu
dents who vote in the proposed
campus-wide referendum. This
would give the Administration
the strong support that it needs
to liberalize the present policy.
It is evident to us that Stan
for students are mature enough
to make important personal de
cisions by themselves. We can
see little benefit from a Health
Service contraceptive policy
which contains built-in preju
dices against students making
their own decisions. We reject
the concept of in looa parentis
even-if it is discreetly practiced
by the Health Service. We urge
all students who agree with us
to sign and help circulate our
petition. The SSRF will have a
