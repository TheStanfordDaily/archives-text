# LSD Causes Brain Damage, Cures

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (CPS)
—LSD, an hallucinogenic drug
responsible for the dismissal of
two Harvard psychologists, is
currently being used by a Uni
versity of Minnesota medical
doctor to restore normal and ab
normal performance in the ner
vous system.
Although small doses of the
drug can do severe brain dam
age if improperly used, it is be
ing administered here in medi
cally supervised conditions with
screen subjects and can cause
no harm, according to Amedo S.
Marrazzi, pharmacology profes

sor in charge of the experiment.
Marrazzi said the danger is in
the misuse of LSD as in the case
of the two Harvard professors,
Timothy Leary and Richard Al
pert.
The pair's unapproved experi
ments with the drug sent two
student volunteers to mental
hospitals. Mentally unbalanced
persons can sometimes go com
pletely insane under the drug.
All volunteers are subject to
a variety of medical checks, in
order to find those with "poten
tially alarming disturbances of
mental performance."
Volunteers are given a person
ality inventory test and are
screened by the Clinical Psychol
ogy as well as by Marrazzi's test
team. The volunteers also may
be checked out with the Psychia
try Department when there is
any doubt about using them as
subjects.
Small Do«e
Then, when the volunteer has
been cleared, he is ready to re
ceive a very small dose of LSD.
LSD, short for d-lysergic acid
diethlamide, is derived from a
fungus which grows on the
grain of wheat and rye.

If taken in excessive doses, it
produces weird effects: vision
and perception are altered dras
tically. One sees the world, as
Time magazine described it, in
"wide-screen three • dimensional
vision, sometimes in Technicol
or. Thought processes are re
leased from their usual re
straints so greater insights may
develop, including deep spiritual
feelings.
'God'
One Harvard student, after a
session with the expelled profes
sor, was almost killed as he
walked in front of Boston rush
hour traffic. He said he thought
he was God and that nothing
could touch him.
Dr. Marrazzi said the aim of
his experiment is to find out
how the nervous system handles
the impulses of mentally ill per
sons. By impending the flow of
impulses with LSD, he can imi
tate the situation in a mentally
ill person's brain, he said.
Marrazzi said LSD first inter
feres with normal perception,
which operates through the
memory part of the brain. Here,
stored information is compared
to new information received

through the five senses and the
brain interprets this.
Hallucination
LSD "closes the door" of trans
mission between memory and
new information, he said. The
results are a misinterpretation
of the new information, com
monly called an hallucination.
Thus, a pencil will no longer
be seen as a pencil; it may be
"misinterpreted as a dangerous
weapon," Dr. Marrazzi said. This
reflects the abnormal perform
ance in an ill person's mind.
