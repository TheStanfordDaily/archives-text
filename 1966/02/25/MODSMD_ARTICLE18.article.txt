# 'Twelfth Night' Shines Bright

The Speech and Drama De
partment's production of
"Twelfth Night, or What You
Will" is more than a competent
ly enacted performance of a
play that one William Shake
speare once wrote. It is a self
style combination of fine acting,
color, comedy, and music that
all fold together in what is noth
ing short of delightful entertain
ment.
Often regarded as Shake
speaker's most popular roman
tic comedy, "Twelfth Night"
does not contain a central theme
that can be capsulized briefly.
The play involves a menagerie
of characters taking part in a
host of side-plots and each char
acter and plot is motivated by
love. The climax comes in the
recognition and reunion of Se
bastian and Viola, twin brother
and sister, which resolves all en
tanglements of the love affairs.
Stage Consumes Theater
The play is well suited for the
stage and is kept viable by the
continual change-over of char
acters, each of whom is fully de
veloped and vital to the plot.
And, as Director Gerald Hiken
demonstrates so uniquely, when
the stage consumes the whole
of the theater and the players
and plot wander through the au
dience, identification with the
characters and the action is far
more forceful than in the con
ventional presentation of the
play.
The acting was generally good
on Wednesday evening and
there were no bad performances.
Gretchen Diebenkorn and Mike
Gillespie both gave excellent
performances and stood out as
polished actors.
Miss Diebenkorn was eminent
ly successful in her role as Vi
ola, a girl disguished as her twin
brother and in love with the
Duke of Illyria (Chris Wilson).
Miss Diebenkorn not only han
dled her lines with finesse but
also, and with no slight to her
feminine attributes, was con
vincing as a boy.

Mike Gillespie was superb,
even professional, in his portray
al of Malvolio, the victimized
steward to Olivia. Tricked into
believing that he is the posses
sor of his ladyship's heart, Gil
lespite was riotously funny
when he appeared on stage wear
ing yellow stockings with black
velvet bows and proclaimed to
Olivia the declaration of love
that he so mistankely thought
that she longed for.
Freeman and Freedman Funny
James Freeman, who had an
unconvincing start as Sir An
thony Aguescheek, and especial
ly Manuel Freedman as Sir
Toby Belch turned in good per
formances as well. There was
one uproariously comic scene
when the two, spying on Mal
volio, crawled around the floor
through the audience and hid be
hind sundry chairs, sofas, girls'
legs, or anything that was
handy.
Barbara Epmeier and Chris
Wilson also deserve credit for
fine performances. Unfortunate
ly, many of Wayne Mooney's
lines were not distinctly enunci
ated; what was intelligible,
though, was good and often well
presented.
Aside from some excellent act
ing, the success of "Twelfth
Night," which even when well
acted is often dull, is correspon
dent to Director Gerald Hiken's
experimental treatment of the
stage. The stage is everywhere
and yet nowhere. The audience
is in the midst of everything—
the love scenes, sword fights,
the dancing. This unique prox
imity to the actors and action
gives a vitality to the produc
tion that would otherwise be
lacking.
Rick Sterns' "music to sing
Shakespeare by" was rewarding
as were the voices of Wayne
Mooney and the chorus. The
score and the song ending the
play—"With a hey, ho, the wind
and the rain"—were altogether
terrific and in themselves worth
the price of admission.
Several of the costumes were

appropriately lavish but never
overdone. That many of the
players wore blue jeans or cord
uroys lent a hang-loose, modern
contrast to otherwise Elizabeth
an dress. Costume coordinator
Dale Hopkins, showed what
would seem amazing control in
not supplying each of the cast
with his own 17th century ward
robe. The swords and daggers
lent by the Leland Stanford Jr.
Museum were impressive and,

were as a couple of the audience
almost found out, authentic.
Few flaws detract from the
excellence of the production
and, if any, would be the occa
sional line that was garbled and
the monotony of the constant
brightness of the lighting.
Though not the fault of the per
formance but a fault nonethe
less, many lines were lost due
to the poor acoustics of Tresid
der large lounge.
