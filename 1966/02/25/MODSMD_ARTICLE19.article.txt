# 'Slender Thread' Spools Its Fools
## 
### ANDREW WILSON 
Sidney Poiter and Ann Ban
croft are featured in "The Slen
der Thread," a heavy melodrama
that is light on substance. Both
actors are academy award win
ners: Poitier for "Lilies of the
Field," and Bancroft for "The
Miracleworker." With such sen
sitive actors one naturally ex
pects much of the movie—which
only makes it that much more
disappointing. Acting alone can
not salvage this movie from its
mawkish script.
The focal point of the film and
the latest innovation to sweeten
our Great Society since Aid to
Indigent Alcoholics is the Crisis
Clinic. If you've got problems,
the really sticky kind where
messy cover-ups just won't do,
then all you have to do is phone
the Crisis Clinic. Dial collect if
you like. A warm, sympathetic
ear with a masters degree in
psychiatry is there at your dis
posal. What have you got to
lose?
Melodramatic Finale
Ann Bancroft tries it and look
who she gets — Sidney Poitier.
She has taken an overdose of
sleeping pills, see, and what with
no friends in the world and
nothing to do on a Saturday
night, elects for a melodramatic
finale.
So the audience is faced with
a ninety minute telephone con
versation between a self - con
scious medical student and a
painfully self • pitying, average
American housewife. Poitier
tries desperately to keep her
talking so as to place a tracer
on her, while the audience, for
somewhat different but no less
desperate reasons is also begin
ning to wonder if she will ever
hang up.
It seems she is all in a pickle
because her devoted husband
has suddenly discovered after
twelve happy years of marriage
that he is not really the father

of his twelve year old son.
While Bancroft rambles on
about her husband's spiteful re
jection of her and how tough
life is in the suburbs generally,
scant comic relief is provided
by AT&T which in a singular
display of ineptitude takes more
than an hour to trace her num
ber.
Poitier Sensitive
In spite of all that is gushy,
Poitier does occasionally shine
as a powerful and convincing
character. He is at his best to
ward the beginning when he
must delicately and unobtrusive
ly coax the woman into staying
on the line. He accomplishes
this with a sensitive deftness,
sometimes pushing her gently
along with her story, sometimes
lashing out against her self-pity,
but never poisoning her trust
with clumsy good-intentions.
Even in the worst scenes Pol
tier is carried along by the hu
man goodness which he so nat
urally exudes. But any sustained
impression of his character is
too often punctured by prepos
terous speeches and emotional
outbreaks which stem solely
from the overall sentimentality
of the movie.
Trampled Daisie
Ann Bancroft suffers from a
role which lacks any real dimen
sion. She is a steadfastly pitiable
character and lacks none of the
dramatic impact of a trampled
daisie.
Meanwhile, back at the Crisis
Clinic, there are some classic
lines. For instance, she, patheti
cally — "I need love. Nobody
wants to love me;" he, magnifi
cently—"No. No. It's not love
that you want, lady. If it were
only love, I could reach right
through this phone and pull you
out."
Help arrives in time to save
the girl but, c'est la guerre, the
movie and a good portion of the
audience are already far gone.
