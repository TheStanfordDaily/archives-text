Grace came back to spark the
Indians with 5 points, though
Stanford did not have the use

ry. Coach Pete Kmetovic hopes
to have all his players ready for
this week's tilt.
Kmetovic feels that this squad
is in tough with the experienced
Cal ruggers. The Bears have the
nucleus of a team that toured
Australia last year left this year
and are hoping to take the
Scrum Axe for a third straight
year.
Not pleased with his teams

formance last week against
USC, Kmotevic said, "We will
have to play considerably better
this week if we hope to get a
good start towards regaining
the axe. And, of course, the sec
ond game has to be played at
Berkeley next weekend, and we

would like to go up there with
a decisive lead."
The game starts at 1:30 on the
Stanford rugby field, which is
located to the east of the sunken
baseball diamond. Always a hot
ly contested event, this year's
series will match two condi
tioned and experienced teams
and should provide a lively aft
