# 'Do Or Die' For Indians In LA
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Needless to say this is the
big weekend for Stanford's bas
ketball team. If any hope is left
in salvaging the season, let
alone in winning the conference
championship, the Indians must
win tonight's game with USC
and Saturday's with UCLA.
Stanford performed this al
most unheard of miracle earlier
this year, but the stakes are
considerably higher now for all
concerned. All three squads are
tied for second place two games

behind leader Oregon State.
The Bruins will be out to save
face this weekend also. Picked
as pre-season favorites to repeat
as conference champs, they took
two defeats on the hind end last
week, falling to Oregon State,
64-51, while being surprised by
Oregon, 79-72. Roth wore humili
ating losses and they would like
nothing better than to clobber
Stanford or anyone else that has

plans of impeding their climb to
the championship.
Presents Big Block
Although Stanford defeated
USC the first time they met, 73-
64, the Trojans have suddenly
got hot and will not only pre
sent a big stumbling block for
Stanford but will also employ a
fabulous Block in their attack,
6-9 center John Block.
Last weekend Block performed

magnificiently scoring 44 points
against Oregon and 30 against
Oregon State in winning 82-67
and 70-60. Block leads the league
in scoring with a 29-point aver
age and in free throw percent
age.
Last week things looked
shaky as Stanford just got by
last-place Washington, Friday
75-73. However, Saturday the In
dians made a more impressive

showing, defeating Washington
State, 80-61.

in the Northland. WSU has beat

already this season.

chore will be to knock over Cal,

and place the Indians in cham
pionship contention.
Also aiding the Indians in
their bid for the crown is the
fact that Oregon State will be
playing both Washington schools
in the Northland. WSU has beat
en UCLA on their home court
already this season.
Then next week Stanford's
chore will be to knock over Cal,
who with a 2-8 record stands to
offer little competition. But,
again, this is the big weekend
for Indian basketball.
Needless to say this is the
big weekend for Stanford's bas
ketball team. If any hope is left
in salvaging the season, let
alone in winning the conference
championship, the Indians must
win tonight's game with USC
and Saturday's with UCLA.
Stanford performed this al
most unheard of miracle earlier
this year, but the stakes are
considerably higher now for all
concerned. All three squads are
tied for second place two games

behind leader Oregon State.
The Bruins will be out to save
face this weekend also. Picked
as pre-season favorites to repeat
as conference champs, they took
two defeats on the hind end last
week, falling to Oregon State,
64-51, while being surprised by
Oregon, 79-72. Roth wore humili
ating losses and they would like
nothing better than to clobber
Stanford or anyone else that has

plans of impeding their climb to
the championship.
Presents Big Block
Although Stanford defeated
USC the first time they met, 73-
64, the Trojans have suddenly
got hot and will not only pre
sent a big stumbling block for
Stanford but will also employ a
fabulous Block in their attack,
6-9 center John Block.
Last weekend Block performed

magnificiently scoring 44 points
against Oregon and 30 against
Oregon State in winning 82-67
and 70-60. Block leads the league
in scoring with a 29-point aver
age and in free throw percent
age.
Last week things looked
shaky as Stanford just got by
last-place Washington, Friday
75-73. However, Saturday the In
dians made a more impressive

showing, defeating Washington
State, 80-61.

Art Harris again produced
the scoring consistency that has
kept the Indians in the cham
pionship race. He tallied 17
