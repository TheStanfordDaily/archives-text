## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity swimmers,
8-2 after losing two meets in the
final relays against NCAA
champ USC and UCLA last
week, make their final home
appearance of the season this
afternoon at 3:30 against Foot
hill College in the Encina Pool.

try to lower his NCAA 200 IM
standard.
Owls Strong in Spots
Foothill College does not have
the powerhouse national JC
champion team it had last sea
son, but the Owls will be strong
in places. Foothill's medley re
lay should be especially tough,

and the Owl backstrokers will
be hard to handle. Foothill's Fal
zone will be a man to watch in
the breaststroke.
Although Stanford humbled
the Foothill squad in the Re
lays, Stanford coach Jim Gaugh
ran anticipates a tight struggle
with the Owls. Foothill is
peaked for the Stanford meet
and should turn in a number

swam the 200 yard distance in
2:04.0 in the cold last week. The
NCAA frosh record is 2:00.2.
The Stanford varsity will load
up its medley relay against Cal,
aiming for the 4:43.3 NCAA

Owls Strong in Spots
Foothill College does not have
the powerhouse national JC
champion team it had last sea
son, but the Owls will be strong
in places. Foothill's medley re
lay should be especially tough,

and the Owl backstrokers will
be hard to handle. Foothill's Fal
zone will be a man to watch in
the breaststroke.
Although Stanford humbled
the Foothill squad in the Re
lays, Stanford coach Jim Gaugh
ran anticipates a tight struggle
with the Owls. Foothill is
peaked for the Stanford meet
and should turn in a number
of season's best performances.

records on the way to their six
inch win in the last relay.
