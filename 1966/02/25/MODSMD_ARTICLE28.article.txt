# Freshman, Varsity Golfers Debut Against Santa Clara
## 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
The gentleman's sport returns
to Stanford this weekend as the
varsity and frosh golfers take
to the links to host Santa Clara
today and the Peninsula Golf
Club on Saturday.
Stanford's varsity linksmen
are younger than usual this year
—no seniors on the squad—but
what they lack in age and var
sity experience they make up
for iti raw talent and determi
nation.
Coach Bud Finger believes
that's enough to do the job.
"We'll win both," he said, look
ing forward to this weekend's
tour. The coach sees a season
of continual improvement and
development of the golfers' po
tential.
Probable Line-up
The line up for today's match
isn't official yet, but it looks like
it will be sophomore Dick Har
ris in the first position, junior
John Bottomley in the second
spot, junior Loy Martin, num
ber three, junior Walt Driver,
fourth, junior Bob Bouchier
fifth, and sophomore Bob Alex
ander, sixth.
Also on the varsity are junior
Greg Pickard and sophomores
Terry Curran and Dan Ander
son. This is Anderson's first
year out.
Meanwhile the freshman

squad, which also begins play
this weekend, lacks nothing.
Says Coach Finger: "We haven't
had a team this good for about
six years. If we get three more
good frosh teams to play with
these boys, we'll have the best
squad in the country."
Adelman, Pitzer Highlight
Highlighting this team are
Sandy Adelman and Greg Pit
zer. Adelman captured the Tex
as Junior Golf Tournament in
1965.
Pitzer finished second to pro
Marty Fleckman in the Medal
Play portion of the Western
Amateur last summer, and run
ner-up in the 1964 Western Jun
ior. He also played in the Buick
Open and qualified for the Na
tional Amateur.
The frosh will meet Menlo Jr.
College on Friday and San Ma
teo Jr. College on Saturday.
This time Coach Finger is posi
tive that "we'll win both."
Stanford boasts one of the
best golf courses in the hemis
phere. The Stanford links will
thus be the scene of both the
AAWU and the NCAA cham
pionships.
This year's slate will last
through the end of April.
Although spectators usually
must have a Stanford spring
sports card, anyone may come
and watch the squad open the
new season this weekend.

ior. He also played in the Buick
Open and qualified for the Na
tional Amateur.
The frosh will meet Menlo Jr.
College on Friday and San Ma
teo Jr. College on Saturday.
This time Coach Finger is posi
tive that "we'll win both."
Stanford boasts one of the
best golf courses in the hemis
phere. The Stanford links will
thus be the scene of both the
AAWU and the NCAA cham
pionships.
This year's slate will last
through the end of April.
Although spectators usually
must have a Stanford spring
sports card, anyone may come
and watch the squad open the
new season this weekend.
The gentleman's sport returns
to Stanford this weekend as the
varsity and frosh golfers take
to the links to host Santa Clara
today and the Peninsula Golf
Club on Saturday.
Stanford's varsity linksmen
are younger than usual this year
—no seniors on the squad—but
what they lack in age and var
sity experience they make up
for iti raw talent and determi
nation.
Coach Bud Finger believes
that's enough to do the job.
"We'll win both," he said, look
ing forward to this weekend's
tour. The coach sees a season
of continual improvement and
development of the golfers' po
tential.
Probable Line-up
The line up for today's match
isn't official yet, but it looks like
it will be sophomore Dick Har
ris in the first position, junior
John Bottomley in the second
spot, junior Loy Martin, num
ber three, junior Walt Driver,
fourth, junior Bob Bouchier
fifth, and sophomore Bob Alex
ander, sixth.
Also on the varsity are junior
Greg Pickard and sophomores
Terry Curran and Dan Ander
son. This is Anderson's first
year out.
Meanwhile the freshman

squad, which also begins play
this weekend, lacks nothing.
Says Coach Finger: "We haven't
had a team this good for about
six years. If we get three more
good frosh teams to play with
these boys, we'll have the best
squad in the country."
Adelman, Pitzer Highlight
Highlighting this team are
Sandy Adelman and Greg Pit
zer. Adelman captured the Tex
as Junior Golf Tournament in
1965.
Pitzer finished second to pro
Marty Fleckman in the Medal
Play portion of the Western
Amateur last summer, and run
ner-up in the 1964 Western Jun
ior. He also played in the Buick
Open and qualified for the Na
tional Amateur.
