# Why the Jews Have Suffered
## 
### 
No single people have suffered like the Jews. None have been so hor
ribly murdered, gassed, butchered, tortured and slaughtered as the ancient
people of Israel. While historians puzzle over the enigma of the Jews, theolo
gians wrestle with the problems of their guilt, and humanitarians lament man's
cruelty to man, the eternal Bible speaks with clarity about God's special
people, Israel.
Promised great blessings for careful obedience and faithful walk with
the living, holy God who made them, the Jews were also warned in strong
and vivid terms:
But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord your God or be careful
to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day,
then all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you. Cursed shall you
be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field. Cursed shall be your basket
and your kneading trough. Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the
fruit of your ground, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock.
The Lord will send upon you curses, confusion, and frustration, in all
that you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly, on account
of the evil of your doings, because you have forsaken me. The Lord will make
the pestilence cleave to you . . . will smite you with consumption, and with
fever, inflammation, and fiery heat, and with drought and with blasting, and
with mildew they shall pursue you until you perish. And the heavens over you
shall be brass, and the earth under you shall be iron. The Lord will make the
rain of your land powder and dust; from heaven it shall come down upon you
until you are destroyed.
"The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies,- you shall
go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them; and you
shall be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. And your dead body shall
be food for all the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth; and there
shall be no one to frighten them away."
"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have
set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that
you and your descendants may live, loving the Lord your God, obeying his
voice, and cleaving to him; for that means life to you and length of days . . .
(Deuteronomy 28-30.)
The changeless and eternal God of Israel deals with all men today, not
just the Jews Life and death, he says is our choice, too. In the words of His
servant the Apostle Paul, God says:"The wages of sin is death, but the free
gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord". Why not meet the
God of Israel, Jesus Christ, and accept his gift of everlasting life and release
from death so kindly offered in that infinite Love that died for you?
