# Today And Tomorrow
## Negotiation, Or Unlimited War 
### Walter Lippmann 
The key question in the Sen
ate hearings has been whether
the administration, which says
that it wants a negotiated set
tlement, has in fact committed
itself to a policy which requires
the unconditional surrender of
the enemy. This is the question
which is at the root of the pro
found concern of the senators.
It is also, most certainly, the
question which is worrying the
country.
The question was not an
swered definitively in the hear
ings. Gen. Maxwell Taylor and
Secretary Dean Rusk kept in
sisting that the administration
was fighting a limited war, that
its objectives and its targets
were limited and that it is ear
nestly seeking to engage Hanoi
in discussions and negotiations.
Decisive Question
It has remained for Sen. Rob
ert Kennedy to raise the decisive
question about a negotiated set
tlement, which is whether the
administration is prepared to ne
gotiate with its adversaries in
the field.
We have learned promptly
from the immediate reactions of
Messrs. Bundy, Ball and Humph
rey that the administration is
not prepared to negotiate with
its adversaries in the field. It
does want to negotiate with Ha
noi, but not with the Veit Cong
unless the Vict Cong is acknowl
edged to be nothing more than
the instrument of the Hanoi
government.
This position is in fact a de
mand for the unconditional sur
render of the Viet Cong, which
constitutes at least three-quar
ters of the military forces ar
rayed against us in the field—
and it is a demand for the un
conditional recognition of Gen.
Nguyen Can Ky's government
as the only political power in
South Vietnam.
No one is entitled to claim
that he is in favor of a negotiat
ed settlement of the war unless
he is prepared to negotiate with
all his important adversaries
who are engaged in the fighting.
Sen. Kennedy has gone to the
heart of the matter in fixing
public attention on the simple
truth that if the administration
wants to negotiate, it will have
to "negotiate with the enemy
who is in fact arrayed against
us.
Refrain from Veto
This does not mean, it seems
to me, that the United States
itself should negotiate with the
Viet Cong for the purpose of
forming a coalition government
in South Vietnam. A negotiated
settlement of the war in South
Vietnam will have to be negoti
ated by the South Vietnamese,
and our policy should be to re
frain from vetoing it.
We shall have to cease putting
our whole influence and support
behind Gen. Ky who refuses to
negotiate. The makings of a
South Vietnamese negotiated
settlement have long been pres
ent just under the surface in
South Vietnam.
The outcome would probably
be some kind of coalition gov
ernment formed for the purpose
of organizing a general election.
Such a government would, of
course, be vulnerable to the
machinations of the hard-line
Communists in Hanoi and Pe
king.
Difficult and unattractive as
this may be, it would be a great
deal better than an unlimited
war to achieve unconditional
surrender. Moreover, there
would still be open to us what
in my view is the only live op
tion we have ever had in South
east Asia. It is to help provide
the material means by which a
united Vietnam — probably un
der the rule of Ho Chi Minh,
who is the one national leader
of that country—could be neu
tral and militarily independent
as regards China.
Vietnam Hawk
The partisans of our present
course will do well to study
carefully Hanson Baldwin's ar
ticle in Monday's New York
Times. It deals with the present
condition of our combat forces.
Baldwin is not only the leading
military correspondent in con
temporary journalism, but he
has always been, and probably
still is, a hawk in the Vietna
mese debate.
He tells us that "The nation's

armed services have almost ex
hausted their trained and ready
military units, with all available
forces spread dangerously thin
in Vietnam and elsewhere....
The commitment of more than
200 thousand men to Vietnam,
supported by strong air and na
val forces, and the maintenance
of two divisions in Korea, more
than five in Europe and of
smaller units elsewhere, includ
ing the Dominican Republic,
have reduced the forces in the
United States to a training es
tablishment."
This report poses for the Pres
ident the enormously difficult
question of how much longer he
can overrule the Joint Chiefs of
Staff on a limited mobilization
of reserve forces. It also poses
the question of whether Secre
tary Rusk realizes what he is
saying when he tells us we have
some 40 unilateral military com
mitments and that we must be
prepared to fulfill them all.

How can the American people
have confidence in an adminis
tration which expands its com
mitments to the extent that Sec
retary Rusk expands them in
the face of the condition of the
military forces?
Baldwin's article raises the
question, too, whether Secretary
Rusk realizes what he is saying
when he keeps telling us that
the credibility of all our alli
ances all over the world is at
stake in South Vietnam. Can he
really believe that our value as
an ally in Europe rises when we
have to draw more and more
trained men out of our armed
forces in Europe and to replace
them with untrained men?
Rusk has entangled himself
in the error failing to realize
that it is not what the United
States is willing to do, but what
it is willing and able to do which
determines the credibility of any
one of its alliances.

Times. It deals with the present
condition of our combat forces.
Baldwin is not only the leading
military correspondent in con
temporary journalism, but he
has always been, and probably
still is, a hawk in the Vietna
mese debate.
He tells us that "The nation's

armed services have almost ex
hausted their trained and ready
military units, with all available
forces spread dangerously thin
in Vietnam and elsewhere....
The commitment of more than
200 thousand men to Vietnam,
supported by strong air and na
val forces, and the maintenance
of two divisions in Korea, more
than five in Europe and of
smaller units elsewhere, includ
ing the Dominican Republic,
have reduced the forces in the
United States to a training es
tablishment."
This report poses for the Pres
ident the enormously difficult
question of how much longer he
can overrule the Joint Chiefs of
Staff on a limited mobilization
of reserve forces. It also poses
the question of whether Secre
tary Rusk realizes what he is
saying when he tells us we have
some 40 unilateral military com
mitments and that we must be
prepared to fulfill them all.

How can the American people
have confidence in an adminis
tration which expands its com
mitments to the extent that Sec
retary Rusk expands them in
the face of the condition of the
military forces?
Baldwin's article raises the
question, too, whether Secretary
Rusk realizes what he is saying
when he keeps telling us that
the credibility of all our alli
ances all over the world is at
stake in South Vietnam. Can he
really believe that our value as
an ally in Europe rises when we
have to draw more and more
trained men out of our armed
forces in Europe and to replace
them with untrained men?
Rusk has entangled himself
in the error failing to realize
that it is not what the United
States is willing to do, but what
it is willing and able to do which
determines the credibility of any
one of its alliances.

The key question in the Sen
ate hearings has been whether
the administration, which says
that it wants a negotiated set
tlement, has in fact committed
itself to a policy which requires
the unconditional surrender of
the enemy. This is the question
which is at the root of the pro
found concern of the senators.
It is also, most certainly, the
question which is worrying the
country.
The question was not an
swered definitively in the hear
ings. Gen. Maxwell Taylor and
Secretary Dean Rusk kept in
sisting that the administration
was fighting a limited war, that
its objectives and its targets
were limited and that it is ear
nestly seeking to engage Hanoi
in discussions and negotiations.
Decisive Question
It has remained for Sen. Rob
ert Kennedy to raise the decisive
question about a negotiated set
tlement, which is whether the
administration is prepared to ne
gotiate with its adversaries in
the field.
We have learned promptly
from the immediate reactions of
Messrs. Bundy, Ball and Humph
rey that the administration is
not prepared to negotiate with
its adversaries in the field. It
does want to negotiate with Ha
noi, but not with the Veit Cong
unless the Vict Cong is acknowl
edged to be nothing more than
the instrument of the Hanoi
government.
This position is in fact a de
mand for the unconditional sur
render of the Viet Cong, which
constitutes at least three-quar
ters of the military forces ar
rayed against us in the field—
and it is a demand for the un
conditional recognition of Gen.
Nguyen Can Ky's government
as the only political power in
South Vietnam.
No one is entitled to claim
that he is in favor of a negotiat
ed settlement of the war unless
he is prepared to negotiate with
all his important adversaries
who are engaged in the fighting.
Sen. Kennedy has gone to the
heart of the matter in fixing
public attention on the simple
truth that if the administration
wants to negotiate, it will have
to "negotiate with the enemy
who is in fact arrayed against
us.
Refrain from Veto
This does not mean, it seems
to me, that the United States
itself should negotiate with the
Viet Cong for the purpose of
forming a coalition government
in South Vietnam. A negotiated
settlement of the war in South
Vietnam will have to be negoti
ated by the South Vietnamese,
and our policy should be to re
frain from vetoing it.
We shall have to cease putting
our whole influence and support
behind Gen. Ky who refuses to
negotiate. The makings of a
South Vietnamese negotiated
settlement have long been pres
ent just under the surface in
South Vietnam.
The outcome would probably
be some kind of coalition gov
ernment formed for the purpose
of organizing a general election.
Such a government would, of
course, be vulnerable to the
machinations of the hard-line
Communists in Hanoi and Pe
king.
Difficult and unattractive as
this may be, it would be a great
deal better than an unlimited
war to achieve unconditional
surrender. Moreover, there
would still be open to us what
in my view is the only live op
tion we have ever had in South
east Asia. It is to help provide
the material means by which a
united Vietnam — probably un
der the rule of Ho Chi Minh,
who is the one national leader
of that country—could be neu
tral and militarily independent
as regards China.

Nguyen Can Ky's government
as the only political power in
South Vietnam.
No one is entitled to claim
that he is in favor of a negotiat
ed settlement of the war unless
he is prepared to negotiate with
all his important adversaries
who are engaged in the fighting.
Sen. Kennedy has gone to the
heart of the matter in fixing
public attention on the simple
truth that if the administration
wants to negotiate, it will have
to "negotiate with the enemy
who is in fact arrayed against
us.
Refrain from Veto
This does not mean, it seems
to me, that the United States
itself should negotiate with the
Viet Cong for the purpose of
forming a coalition government
in South Vietnam. A negotiated
settlement of the war in South
Vietnam will have to be negoti
ated by the South Vietnamese,
and our policy should be to re
frain from vetoing it.
We shall have to cease putting
our whole influence and support
behind Gen. Ky who refuses to
negotiate. The makings of a
South Vietnamese negotiated
settlement have long been pres
ent just under the surface in
South Vietnam.
The outcome would probably
be some kind of coalition gov
ernment formed for the purpose
of organizing a general election.
Such a government would, of
course, be vulnerable to the
machinations of the hard-line
Communists in Hanoi and Pe
king.
Difficult and unattractive as
this may be, it would be a great
deal better than an unlimited
war to achieve unconditional
surrender. Moreover, there
would still be open to us what
in my view is the only live op
tion we have ever had in South
east Asia. It is to help provide
the material means by which a
united Vietnam — probably un
der the rule of Ho Chi Minh,
who is the one national leader
of that country—could be neu
tral and militarily independent
as regards China.
Vietnam Hawk
The partisans of our present
course will do well to study
carefully Hanson Baldwin's ar
ticle in Monday's New York
Times. It deals with the present
condition of our combat forces.
Baldwin is not only the leading
military correspondent in con
temporary journalism, but he
has always been, and probably
still is, a hawk in the Vietna
mese debate.
He tells us that "The nation's

armed services have almost ex
hausted their trained and ready
military units, with all available
forces spread dangerously thin
in Vietnam and elsewhere....
The commitment of more than
200 thousand men to Vietnam,
supported by strong air and na
val forces, and the maintenance
of two divisions in Korea, more
than five in Europe and of
smaller units elsewhere, includ
ing the Dominican Republic,
have reduced the forces in the
United States to a training es
tablishment."
This report poses for the Pres
ident the enormously difficult
question of how much longer he
can overrule the Joint Chiefs of
Staff on a limited mobilization
of reserve forces. It also poses
the question of whether Secre
tary Rusk realizes what he is
saying when he tells us we have
some 40 unilateral military com
mitments and that we must be
prepared to fulfill them all.

How can the American people
have confidence in an adminis
tration which expands its com
mitments to the extent that Sec
retary Rusk expands them in
the face of the condition of the
military forces?
Baldwin's article raises the
question, too, whether Secretary
Rusk realizes what he is saying
when he keeps telling us that
the credibility of all our alli
ances all over the world is at
stake in South Vietnam. Can he
really believe that our value as
an ally in Europe rises when we
have to draw more and more
trained men out of our armed
forces in Europe and to replace
them with untrained men?
Rusk has entangled himself
in the error failing to realize
that it is not what the United
States is willing to do, but what
it is willing and able to do which
determines the credibility of any
one of its alliances.

The key question in the Sen
ate hearings has been whether
the administration, which says
that it wants a negotiated set
tlement, has in fact committed
itself to a policy which requires
the unconditional surrender of
the enemy. This is the question
which is at the root of the pro
found concern of the senators.
It is also, most certainly, the
question which is worrying the
country.
The question was not an
swered definitively in the hear
ings. Gen. Maxwell Taylor and
Secretary Dean Rusk kept in
sisting that the administration
was fighting a limited war, that
its objectives and its targets
were limited and that it is ear
nestly seeking to engage Hanoi
in discussions and negotiations.
Decisive Question
It has remained for Sen. Rob
ert Kennedy to raise the decisive
question about a negotiated set
tlement, which is whether the
administration is prepared to ne
gotiate with its adversaries in
the field.
We have learned promptly
from the immediate reactions of
Messrs. Bundy, Ball and Humph
rey that the administration is
not prepared to negotiate with
its adversaries in the field. It
does want to negotiate with Ha
noi, but not with the Veit Cong
unless the Vict Cong is acknowl
edged to be nothing more than
the instrument of the Hanoi
government.
This position is in fact a de
mand for the unconditional sur
render of the Viet Cong, which
constitutes at least three-quar
ters of the military forces ar
rayed against us in the field—
and it is a demand for the un
conditional recognition of Gen.
Nguyen Can Ky's government
as the only political power in
South Vietnam.
