## Senatorii Apathetici Exposed 
### Pell Fender 
A controversy raging in con
temporary experimental psy
chology concerns this question:
can people learn? A clarifica
tion of the problem is evident in
two conflicting sets of data in
volving the Senatorius Apatheti
cus strain of people, and the
dominance of a genetic mutation
of Senatorius Apathetieus, Pres
identius Megalomanius.
Malpense and Beteman (1965)
conclude that indeed Senatorius
Apathetieus is incapable of
learning. In their Washington
laboratory, 100 Senatorii Apa
thetici were randomly assigned
into two groups of fifty each.
One group was run on the nor
mal Senate maze, and the other
on the Santus Domingus maze.
Criterion for learning was sat
isfied if the "debate" section of
the maze was reached (by turn
ing left). The authors report
that there was no significant dif
ference in the performance of
the two groups on respective
mazes.
Viet mi mus Maze
Peutctre and Mcllopeful (1966)
report, however, that a sub
strain of Senatorius Apatheti
eus, the Senateforeignrelationis,
reached the "debate" section of
the Vietnamus maze, a structure

similar to the Santus Domingus
maze. The data reach signifi
gance at the international level.
Two phenomena must now be
examined to explain Senatorius
Apatheticus' inability to learn,
and to explain the apparent
change in behavior.
First of all, experimentalists
have succeeded in conditioning
Senatorius Apatheticus in only
one category of behavior; this
special conditioning is called
"politics" conditioning.
Altruism starts out as the
unconditional stimulus, and get
ting elected as the unconditioned
response. Reelection becomes
the conditioned stimulus and
apathy the conditioned re
sponse.
The peculiarity of this type
of learning is inherent in an in
ability to extinguish "politics"
conditioning; re-election appears
to be a self-perpetuating condi
tional stimulus.
Secondly, it must be remem
bered that Malpense and Bete
man's data do not take into ac
count the inhibiting effect of
Presidentius Megalo manius,
which, at the time of their study,
seems to have been not as sali
ent as it was during Peutetre
and McHopeful's experiment.

A previous study (McCarthy,
1955) has shown that another
of the Megalomania substrain
provoked a "debate" response in
Seriatorius Apatheticus.
Apparently Peutetre and Mc-
Hopeful have shown that Sen
atorius Apatheticus can be ex
tinguished in "politics" condi
tioning, or at least that a sub
strain of it may be susceptible
to extinction. Dominance by
P res id en tius Megalomanius
seems to be the dependent varia
ble.
Whether or not people can
learn is still an undecided ques
tion. By no means should the
data herein be utilized to gen
eralize to all people, and it must
be remembered that research in
this area is still progressing.
Certainly more work needs to
be done, with special attention
given to the "debate" exploring
tendencies of Senatorius Apa
theticus.
