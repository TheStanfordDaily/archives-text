# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Mourning The Dying Farm 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
How terribly disappointed I
was to hear on the radio that
Vietnam sign carrying has
spread to Stanford.
My argument is not with our
policies in Vietnam, nor is it
with the right of dissent. I be
lieve that I was graduated from
a great University where the
freedom of thought flourishes,
But is it not also a school with
a tradition of ignoring the com
monplace? Ours is a school of
Doodles Weaver and Bill Kar
tozian as well as Herbert
Hoover. But it seems now we
are to be dragged down to the
level of Berkeley, San Francisco
State, and San Mateo J.C.
Most anyone is capable of car
rying a sign and uttering a few
simple slogans. It takes no mas
ter of public oratory to gather
a crowd of curious onlookers. A
high school dropout, when prop
erly dressed, and with the help
of a few "leaks to the press" to
assure him of advance publicity
can succeed at such antics.
Today's leaders remember
well World War II and Korea
and their buddies who did not
return, and our troops in Viet
nam now know why they are
there. Sourly dressed demon
strators, armed with butcher
paper and flow pens, who are
dedicated to disrupting the nor
mal processes of the University
are not going to impress intelli
gent Americans with sympath
ies for the Viet Cong.
The "oppressed" people of
Vietnam need far more than the
American War Machine to lead
respectable lives. Aside from the
military, the opportunities for
those really dedicated to help
are unlimited. It is action that
is needed, not sign waving. Con
sider the UCLA student, a prev
ious game hunter in Vietnam
who at the request of a village
returned to hunt down and kill
a man-eating tiger which was
terrorizing the village. Consider

the Army Lt. Colonel, who after
spending two years in the cen
tral highlands vaccinating
against disease, and teaching
better ways of health and diet,
will spend his days after re
tirement next fall working
again for the People of Vietnam.
Consider the many American
Gl's and others who have
adopted Vietnamese orphans.
Here are the real champions of
free speech and the American
way of life as well as of service
to "oppressed people."
When the Berkeley mess was
at its worst, I listened to what
the adult community had to say
about Cal's college youth. It was
not free speech, but the lack
of respect for law and order
and constitutional government
that they associated with Cal.
Americans are blessed with
obligations as well as rights,
and the mature American can
only observe with disbelief the
immaturity of those who ignore
their responsibilities in favor of
"Free Speech."
To build the reputation of a
great University is no easy task.
It takes the efforts of outstand
ing educators and administrat
ors working tirelessly over
many decades. It is easy to
spoil and rot that reputation
which, incidentally, is built
around freedom of thought. All
it takes is a handful of self
righteous "dissenters" who nev
er learned that with every right
there is an equal obligation. This
was so boldly proved at Berk
eley. Is this now the fate of
Stanford?

• Philosophy Dispute
Editor, The Dally:
The reporter who cited criti
cisms of the Stanford Philoso
phy department in the February
11 Daily encountered two prob
lems. The first is unfamiliarity
with the subject-matter of the
department. The second is un
familiarity with remembering
what a fact given as an example
exemplifies.
The fact is that the four dis
agreements between myself and
the Stanford Philosophy depart
ment were part of a description
of a meeting between myself and
Jeff Wattles, and Prof. Donald
Davidson, executive head of the
Philosophy Department. Al
though the meeting was de
scribed in detail, it was a fact
given as an example. The fact
was given as an example of the
difficulty in raising with facul
ty members of the department
the topic of the meeting which
Pam Lang, the Daily's reporter,
attended. The topic was Philoso
phy and Dogmatism at Stanford
University.
With this example in mind of
the second problem which the re
porter encountered, attention
can be turned to realizing the
reporter's intention, namely, set
ting forth for the readers of this

paper the meaning of the Febru
ary 10 meeting.
There are three corrections
of Miss Lang's article from
which our realization can pro
ceed. First, there was no clue
given by myself at the meeting
that I had demonstrated the fal
sity of a presupposition held by
one of the department's faculty,
and, in fact, I haven't. Second,
there was no successful presen
tation of criticisms of the de
partment to Mr. Davidson, be
cause, in fact, the presentation
was a failure. Third, the subordi
nation and reformulation of past
philosophy according to present
understanding in the Stanford
department was not the most im
portant problem in the article,
two of which are the confusion
in my thought suggested by his
reported relating of Nominalism
and Pluralism, and the implica
tion of Pluralism for the His
tory of Philosophy as a science.
These and other problems in
ternal to, and suggested by, Miss
Lang's article are set aside now
to come to the meaning of the
meeting.
Philosophy and dogmatism at
Stanford University is a uni
versity problem because the
conclusion reached in the Feb
ruary 10 meeting has been
reached by people in other
Stanford departments about
those departments. What fol
lows, then, may be applicable
to Stanford as a whole, to each
of its departments, faculty mem
bers, and students, including
me.
The conclusion of the Thurs
day evening meeting was that
the Stanford Philosophy depart
ment is absolutistic. Absolutism
is standing on the lowered draw
bridge of a castle examining the
credentials of those seeking en
trance. The examiner is stand
ing because everyone stands like
a judge on the law in assessing
the views of another. The draw
bridge is down because the ex
aminer expects no war from
the seekers. The credential
which the examiner approves is
major agreement and minor dis
agreement with whatever is be
neath his feet.
For example, the Stanford
Psychology department stands
on American Behaviorism when
it decides who is to teach and
what is to be taught there.
Neither Neo-Platonic, nor Me
diaeval nor Phenomeno-logical
nor Existential Psychology is
taught there; and neither are
they shown true or false by and
for the undergraduates in the
department.
For another example, the
Stanford Philosophy depart
ment stands on some form of
conceptual, or logical, analysis
of concepts when it decides who
is to teach and what is to be
taught there. There are neither
Realists nor Idealists nor Pheno
menologists nor Existentialists
teaching either courses in the
History of Philosophy or in such
topics of Philosophy as Ethics,
Logic and Epistemology. The de

partments of Psychology and
Philosophy at Stanford are ex
amples of absolutism which re
fuses permanent place within
its walls for views in major and
articulate disagreement with it
self.
If absolutism, as it has been
characterized, looks to you like
dogmatism, then call it dogma
tism. It is far more important
that you and I understand one
another than that we waste our
selves in a contest for names.
This letter is to thank Miss
Lang for her effort and to aug
ment her conception of the
Thursday evening meeting. Yet
a new thought has arisen with
which we shall part. An histo
rian of Psychology or Philoso
phy can suggest that the his
tory of either discipline is a
history of castles, each one
claiming to be what the disci
pline really is, while the his
torian judges each castle to be
a solidified moment in the course
of the discipline's understand
ing its own subject matter. A
historian can go on to suggest
that the walls of the castles are
not Psychology or Philosophy
but conceptions of Psychology
or conceptions of Philosophy.
Either we can defend the pres
ent walls, having glimpsed the
other castles from a turret of
our own, or we can shatter the
present walls in an effort to un
cover that which every castle
claims to be.

• Piece Of Mind
Editor, The Daily:
As a respectable member of
the Stanford staff I was ap
palled to learn from your front
page article recently that the
restaurant to which I have often
taken my three innocent young
sons is a den of iniquity such
as would boggle the imagina
tion. I must confess that I have
never noticed any recognizable
perverts, or sex peddlers, and so
far no one has tried to push
dope at me. In fact the only rea
son I have taken my children
there to eat is that the Stanford
View Restaurant serves the best
food at the most moderate
prices in the area, and the big
gest, coldest and driest martini
on the Peninsula for only 60
cents—to anyone over twenty
one.
In future, when I take my
children there, I shall certainly
be on the qui vlve for these
dregs of society who are said
to inhabit the place and if one
of them should approach my
table I will give him a piece of
my mind in no uncertain terms.

• Sentimental View
Editor, The Daily:
Because "The View" has long
been my place of peaceful re
pose and because I broke the
seal on their first bottle of Cut
ty Sark when the bar opened, I
feel a definite involvement in
the attacks that this marvelous
establishment is undergoing.
In the first place, Parents
have long approved and patron
ized such "decent" bars as Rick
ey's and, since 1963, Stickney's,
which both attract more "char
acters" than the Stanford View
whose clientele is almost entire
ly Stanford students. George
Jalkson had an "Intention to
Serve Hard Liquor" sign out
long before and long after
Christmas so Palo Alto had time
to act.
In the second place, these an
onymous parents and the Civic
Affairs Committee of the Palo
Alto Women's Club should real
ize the law exists to protect
Jalkson as well as them. They
neglected their right apathecial
ly and so lost it.(The Pa'io Alto
Times would not advertise
"drinks" at "The View" so also
helped keep the city ignorant.)
Now the law should protect
"The View" from a financial
loss which would occur if the
citizens actually managed to
ruin his investment merely be
cause of their own laziness.
They should keep quiet and
find other crosses to bum. No
one thinks of the View as a bar
per He but as a place to eat,
watch T.V., talk and have a
drink — even studying is done
there.
It is not a place when one
goes only to drink . . . although
that's not a bad idea. Excuse me
. . I'll be at "The View."

• Widening The Gap
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Charles Beye
widens the gap between the two
cultures in his letter criticizing
the SLAC display at Stanford
Museum (The Daily, Feb. 21).
The engineer's "prosaic" solu
tion can be art when it honest
ly and skillfully extends and
works with nature. Thus it is
not "luck" that some of the
SLAC objects are artful. Many
engineers and scientists enrich
their lives with the classics and
bring art into their work. Its a
pity that a public display of
their contribution to merging
science and humanity is op
posed by Professor Beye.
