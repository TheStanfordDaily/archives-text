## Project X Malcomb Proposes Ultimate Weapon For Vietnam 
### Art Bucbwald 
A few months ago Gen. Lewis Hershey was strongly criticized
for punishing students by drafting them into the Army. Now
since it was announced that he is drafting heavyweight champion
Cassius Clay, everyone wants to know why Gen. Hershey is pun-

ishing the army.
"I think no matter how
strongly Gen. Hershey feels
against the Army there is no
justification for him to draft
Cassius Clay," an American
Civil Liberties Union official
said. "The U. S. Army has
rights too."
ProJ(*'t X Maloomb
An entire section of the Pen
tagon has been set aside to han
dle the training of Cassius Clay.
Known as Project X Malcolm
(in deference to Mr. Clay's
Black Muslim affiliations) a
team of officers and enlisted
men are working day and night
to see that the heavyweight
champion enjoys his stay in the
service.
The C.O. in charge of Project
X, a three-star General, told me
that things were moving along
well.
"Mr. Clay has indicated that
he has reservations about going
into the Army and its our job
to dispel his doubts and to make
his Army career the happiest
days of his life." The General
said.
"How do you plan to do this?"
"By making him a Special
Force."
"A Special Force?"
"That's correct. We're going
to make Cassius Clay a unit
unto himself.
Ilts Own C.O.
"Clay, will be his own C.O.
He will not have to train with
the other men, he will not have
to obey orders, he will not have
to wear a uniform if he doesn't
want to. He doesn't even have
to bear arms."
"That sounds strange," I said.
"It will seem so to the public,
but we've got our reasons. Once

Clay will have completed his
training in this country he will
be flown on a special plane to
Vietnam and dropped over
enemy territory."
"To do what?"
"To bore the Viet Cong to
death."
"You mean, once he starts
talking, he'll drive the Viet Cong
nuts?"
"Exactly. Those he doesn't
bore to death will probably
shoot themselves."
"But," I said, "Wouldn't you
be violating the Geneva Conven
tion by dropping Clay in enemy
territory?"
The General bristled. "This
is war and we've got to use
everything we've got. Boring the
Viet Cong to death is still more
humane than dropping napalm
on them."
Fantastic Idea
"It's a fantastic idea," I ad
mitted. "But the Viet Cong are
in many parts of Vietnam."
"What we plan to do is drop
Clay in Viet Cong territory and
leave him there for a week. By
this time he will have bored
everyone in the area to death,
and we'll send in our regular
troops to occupy the country
side. We'll then pick up Clay
and drop him in another area.
In a short time South Vietnam
will be secured."
"It seems foolproof," I said.
"And no one could be better
suited for the job."
"The beauty of it,"the Gen
eral said, "is that the other side
has no answer to Clay. The U.S.
has the biggest bore in the whole
wide world, and though we may
be criticized, he's our bore and
we must use him as we see fit."
