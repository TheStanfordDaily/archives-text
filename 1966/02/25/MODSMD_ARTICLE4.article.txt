# Keio Students Welcomed
## 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK 
An informal reception was held yes
terday at the Bechtel International
Center to welcome the ten Japanese
students who arrived Saturday as a
part of the Keio exchange program.
The six men and four women from
Tokyo's Keio University will spent
three months here as guests of the
Stanford community. The exchange
is essentially cultural and many ac
tivities have been scheduled which
will provide the students with a broad
picture of American life.
Besides a trip to Los Angeles and
Disneyland which has been planned
for Winter Quarter break, the stu
dents will be kept busy with trips
through factories and schools. And,
of course, there will be outings to San
Francisco.
Many of the Keio students were ac
companied by their adopted families.
The students will live with these fam
ilies in the surrounding community
for the remainder of Winter Quarter
and will not officially arrive on cam
pus until next quarter.
When asked how they feel about
their new families they were most
enthusiastic. Many have already be
come quite attached to their adopted
parents, and especially, to their Amer
ican brothers and sisters.
On hand to welcome the students
and their American families were
members of the Keio Committee who
have each spent a summer in Japan
as Stanford's representatives in the
program.
According to Jan Sharpless, who is

involved in coordinating many of the
activities of the program, the purpose
of the reception was to allow those
who were not able to make it to the
airport at 6 a.m. Saturday a chance
to greet and students and to get to
know them.
Also attending were the ten stu
dents who will spend this summer in
Japan. These students will act as
Stanford brothers and sisters to the
ten Keio students when they come to
live on campus after winter break.
After a brief introduction by Keio
Committee chairman Marty Kuehnert,
Kenneth Cooper, director of the I-
Center, extended the official Univer
sity welcome. After warning the Japa
nese students about American in
formality and "sloppiness," Cooper
went on to praise the Keio program
as providing the ideal link or bridge of
understanding to which all peoples
of the world should strive. Dean Win
bigler also stopped by to welcome
the students to Stanford.
One of the Keio students is Toshi
fuma Mori, a sophomore majoring in
business. He started learning English
at the junior high level, but, he says
he had an added advantage because
his mother teaches English. The main
problem, Toshi emphasized, is that
few Japanese are taught to speak the
language.
When asked how the Japanese stu
dents were selected to participate in
the Keio program Toshi replied that
the process was quite detailed. Exam
inations are given in both Japanese
and English. There is also an inter

view in English. Toshi said that
about seventy students originally ap
plied.
The Keio committee's selection of
Stanford students is much less for
malized. The main criterea are per
sonality and interest and grades are
de-emphasized.
