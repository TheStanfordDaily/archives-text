# New Admissions Policy: Begin Now, Decide Later

It's not unusual to hear of a stu
dent refused admission to a college
because of his past record. But Fran
conia College in New Hampshire is
experimenting with a new admission
system that's designed to let a stu
dent start "clean."
The basis for the system is that the
student makes the decision for admis
sion himself.
Franconia, a small liberal arts col
lege, has invited every third person
inquiring about admission to partici
pate in the experiment. If he agrees
to do so, the student sends his admis
sions application to a neutral con
sultant from Boston or Brandeis Uni
versity.
The consultant keeps the applica
tion completely confidential and noti
fies Franconia officials only if there
is an extreme academic or medical
problem.

The student is then invited to visit
the school and to, in a small way, be
come involved in the student life. He
lives in the dormitories, is given am
ple opportunity to talk to students,
and attends classes that interest him.
After this visit, if the student feels
Franconia is where he wants to go to
college all he does is inform the
school of his decision. He will auto
matically be "accepted" on the basis
of his decision alone if there is room
in the student body.
During the entire process, the col
lege does not ask the student to give
them any information about his back
ground, academic or otherwise, that
he does not want to reveal himself.
Dr. Greenway said he hopes that
these students will feel a higher obli
gation to learn and a more candid re
lationship with the school than if they
had been admitted in the conventional
way.
