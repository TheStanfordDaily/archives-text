# Improved Medical Center Planned
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
The University Health Service will
move into its new home on Campus
Drive, behind Wilbur Hall, on March
28. The announcement was made by
Health Service Executive Director
Maurice M. Osborne in an interview
yesterday.
Stanford's million dollar center will
house Health Service doctors' offices
and an infirmary. Thus, present of
fices in the west wing of Women's
Gym will be vacated, and the half
century old Alpine House will be
closed.
"The Health Service will be open 7
days a week, 24 hours a day," said
Dr. Osborne. The expanded time
schedule is expected to relieve the
Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital from mi
nor emergency treatments. The
Health Center will continue to send
persons with serious illnesses to the
Stanford hospital.
PACE Funds
The new center is being built with
PACE funds donated by the S. H.
Cowell Foundation. The Cowell Foun
dation has given funds to build hos
pitals at other California universities,
and recently donated a site for the
new University of California campus
at Santa Cruz.
Prior to 1946, health services were
segregated by sex, operating under
the Physical Education departments.
In that year, student health service
offices were consolidated in the pres
ent location.
Osborne commented, "This wing of
the Women's Gym was designed as
a health service for 500 women stu
dents." The wing now serves a total
university population of over 10,000.
Despite renovation in 1962, facili
ties have remained so crowded that
two doctors must mesh part time
schedules so they can use the same
office at different times. Not only has
the student body grown, but Dr. Os
borne believes students "expect to use
more medicine today."
"More medications and treatments
are available today, and students are
more sophisticated about using medi

cal services for minor treatments,"
he added.
Dr. Osborne emphasizes that the
present building was not "crumbling,"
but that it had not been built to han
dle the volume or the kind of treat
ments that the service was now pro
viding.
Mental health services have in
creased rapidly. Dr. Osborne said that
a large number of those who drop out
of school for medical reasons do so
not because of physical problems, but
because of "emotional reactions to
life."
In the 1950'5, the health service util
ized an off-campus consultant and the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic. But by 1963,
the Service employed two psychia
trists. In the new building there will
be enough space for three psychia
trists, a social worker, and a psychol
ogist.

In the present offices, one often
finds a large number of students fill
a corridor while waiting. It is crowd
ed, and not very personal. Dr. Os
borne hopes the new facility will have
a more relaxed atmosphere. An effort
will be made to avoid the stereotype
of the health service as the place
where "they give you a pill and send
you home to bed."
14 Physicians
Space will be available for the
equivalent of 14 full-time doctors.
Now, there are seven and a half
"full-time equivalents" jammed into
Women's Gym. The American Colle
giate Health Association has recom
mended 1 doctor per 1000 students,
but has not said whether this includes
specialists or not.
The building has 3 floors, with spe
cial rooms in the basement, doctors'

offices on the main level, and the in
firmary on the second level.
New facilities include a basement
X-ray room, and a "dental reserve"
room, which is being equipped with
fixtures so that it might be converted
into a dentist's office sometime in the
future.
A separate area for immunization
will enable students to receive shots
without mingling with sick students.
With the expansion of the overseas
campuses and the increased populari
ty of foreign travel, the number of
shots given have increased greatly.
There will be a waiting area be
tween every two doctors' offices.
Waiting areas and lounges will be car
peted and furnished by an $8000
grant from the Stanford Mothers
Club. The Mothers Club sought to
avoid depersonalization with "home
like" surroundings.
40-Bed Capacity
The second floor contains a nursing
station, a kitchen with an "electronic
oven" for reheating food prepared at
the Stanford Hospital, a study room,
two lounge areas, and 20 rooms, each
equipped with two beds and a lava
tory. The 40 bed capacity compares
with a maximum of 35 at Alpine.
There are also two bathtubs on the
second floor. These were put in not
only for the convenience of the pa
tients who might prefer baths to
showers, but also because certain ill
nesses require bath treatments, and
there are virtually no bathtubs in stu
dent residences.
The 27,000 square foot building has
an elevator, a dumbwaiter, a drug
storage area which could be convert
ed into a pharmacy, soundproof doc
tors' offices, and an ice machine that
makes crushed iceâ€”for icepacks, says
Dr. Osborne.
Other facilities include a whirlpool
bath, and a specialized treatment
room with "fancy table and lights"
for minor surgery.
The building was built on Campus
Drive so that it would be convenient
for ambulance service. The site is
close to Wilbur and Stern Halls, not
far from most other campus resi
dences, and adjacent to a proposed
third fraternity cluster.
