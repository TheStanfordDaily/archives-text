# Legislature Retains '5' Changes Recall, Adds Proposition To Ballot
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
The Legislature last night retained
the student representatives to the
Committee of Fifteen appointed to
the Legislature last week, but
changed recall procedure to require
a two-thirds, rather than a majority,
vote of the Legislature for removal.
The final resolution, a greatly
amended version of the resolution
originally introduced to the Legisla
ture, resulted from a number of com
promises.
On Ballot
After passage of the resolution,
the Legislature voted to include it
on the ballot with a petition which
will come before the student body in
a referendum next week. This peti
tion calls for the reinstatement of the
student representatives recalled last
week.
The resolution originally introduced
last night would have had the same
effect.
A break in an apparent deadlock
over the replacement of the previous
representatives came when Michael
Couzens, one of these representatives,
announced his willingness to accept
the new appointments "to keep from
juggling the Committee around
again."
Intention
Tom Galbraith, one of the sponsors
of the original resolution, introduced
a motion to place the final amended
resolution on the ballot with the up
coming initiative.

In passing his proposal, LASSU in
dicated its intention to enact as law
the one proposal of the two which
receives the greatest number of votes
in the election.
If the student body votes to ac
cept the final resolution passed last
night, it will go into effect immedi
ately. If the vote is in favor of the
original initiative, LASSU will take
the matter under consideration again
next week.
"If that happens," commented
Speaker Jay Kadane, "Legislature
will just have to decide then what it's
going to do about the whole thing."
Galbraith, who is also one of the
sponsors of the initiative, stated the
LASSU vote indicated student agree
ment on the function of the Commit
tee of Fifteen.
The final vote on the issue was
66-6.
Referral
In a related issue, LASSU referred
to the By-Laws Committee a bill in
troduced by ASSU President Sandy
MacKenzie that would establish pro
cedures for the selection of student
representatives to the Committee of
Fifteen.
