Pleasant Environment
As a booklet describing the school
notes, the Bing Nursery School "is a
place where students, teachers and
researchers move easily among chil
dren, instructing and observing; it is
a center that embodies an approach
to teaching and research based upon
many years of experience, planning
and investigation.
"As a pleasant environment for chil
dren, as a convenient classroom for
students, and as an ideal laboratory
for those who seek a better under
standing of personality growth and
human potential, the Bing Nursery
School stands as an impressive addi
tion to Stanford University and to the
society the University serves."
Milestone
Formal dedication of the nursery
school, Director Edith Dowley notes,
marks a milestone in the history of
nursery school education at Stanford.
Dr. Dowley, associate professor of
psychology and director of the nurs
ery school since 1949, has brought to
gether under one roof a facility which
previously has been divided between
the campus and Stanford Village in
Menlo Park.
Up to 250 children, drawn from the
Palo Alto area and the University
community, attend two or three morn
ings per week in groups of 25. Three
groups occupy the three large nursery
school rooms during the class hours.
Each room has its own half-acre play
yard.
