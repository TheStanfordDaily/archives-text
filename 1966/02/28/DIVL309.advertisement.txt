What Is a Jew?
Who are these people who call themselves Jews? Are they a race or
religion, a cultural group or a In our world today there are dark
skinned Jews, light skinned Jews, Russian Jews and Chinese Jews,- There are
orthodox Jews who follow their Torah and Talmud faithfully, conservative
Jews who have found a happy medium, and liberal Jews who believe they
have brought their faith up to date.
The history of these unique and greatly gifted people, the Hebrews, can
be traced back four thousand years to a man named Abraham whose life
story occupies a good portion of the Old Testament book Genesis. The Bible
says that the Jews are descendants of Abrahom through his son Isaac, and
his son Jacob:
"O you seed of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen
ones" (I Chronicles 16:13).
Jacob, a man of crafty and rebellious nature, came to deep faith in God
only offer wrestling and searching which brought him to the end of his own
natural resources. "And God said, Your name shall no more be called Jacob,
but Israel (Hebrew for "God strives"), for you have striven with God and with
men and have prevailed" (Genesis 32:28).
God's unconditional promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have been
fulfilled with remarkable accuracy and consistency. God said to Abraham, "I
will make your name great and you shall be a blessing. And I will bless those
who bless you and curse those who curse you". The history of the nations shows
clearly that those who have welcomed and sheltered the Jews have prospered
(the United States, for example, and those who have persecuted and destroyed
the Jews have come to violent and terrible ends (Nazi Germany, Babylon,
Rome).
Although many call themselves Jews in the world today, the Bible says
that the true Jew is one who knows God personally (Romans 2:28, 29). The
Holy Bible, written by devout and holy Jewish men of God tells us: "What
then, are we Jews any better off (than you Gentiles)? No, not at all, for I
have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power
of sin. As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. No one who under
stands, no one who seeks for God. All have turned aside, together they have
gone wrong; no one does good not even one (Romans 3).
The same Bible, words to all men from the living and eternal God of
Israel, the God of all the world, tells all men everywhere how to come to
God for everlasting life: "For there is no difference between the Jew and the
Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon him. For who
ever calls upon the name of the lord Jesus Christ shall be saved" (Romans
10:12-13).

Jacob, a man of crafty and rebellious nature, came to deep faith in God
only offer wrestling and searching which brought him to the end of his own
natural resources. "And God said, Your name shall no more be called Jacob,
but Israel (Hebrew for "God strives"), for you have striven with God and with
men and have prevailed" (Genesis 32:28).
God's unconditional promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have been
fulfilled with remarkable accuracy and consistency. God said to Abraham, "I
will make your name great and you shall be a blessing. And I will bless those
who bless you and curse those who curse you". The history of the nations shows
clearly that those who have welcomed and sheltered the Jews have prospered
(the United States, for example, and those who have persecuted and destroyed
the Jews have come to violent and terrible ends (Nazi Germany, Babylon,
Rome).
Although many call themselves Jews in the world today, the Bible says
that the true Jew is one who knows God personally (Romans 2:28, 29). The
Holy Bible, written by devout and holy Jewish men of God tells us: "What
then, are we Jews any better off (than you Gentiles)? No, not at all, for I
have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power
of sin. As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. No one who under
stands, no one who seeks for God. All have turned aside, together they have
gone wrong; no one does good not even one (Romans 3).
The same Bible, words to all men from the living and eternal God of
Israel, the God of all the world, tells all men everywhere how to come to
God for everlasting life: "For there is no difference between the Jew and the
Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon him. For who
ever calls upon the name of the lord Jesus Christ shall be saved" (Romans
10:12-13).

Who are these people who call themselves Jews? Are they a race or
religion, a cultural group or a In our world today there are dark
skinned Jews, light skinned Jews, Russian Jews and Chinese Jews,- There are
orthodox Jews who follow their Torah and Talmud faithfully, conservative
Jews who have found a happy medium, and liberal Jews who believe they
have brought their faith up to date.
The history of these unique and greatly gifted people, the Hebrews, can
be traced back four thousand years to a man named Abraham whose life
story occupies a good portion of the Old Testament book Genesis. The Bible
says that the Jews are descendants of Abrahom through his son Isaac, and
his son Jacob:
"O you seed of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen
ones" (I Chronicles 16:13).
