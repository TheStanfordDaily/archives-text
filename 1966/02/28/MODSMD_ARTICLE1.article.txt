# To Viet Or Not To Viet: Test, Grades Determine All
##

Compiled from the Associated Press
Reaction to the Selective Service's decision
to administer qualification tests to more than
a million draft-eligible students remained
mixed across the nation today.
At Stanford, National Service Director Wal
ter J. Findeisen reported having received no
official notice of a policy change. He declined
to speculate on the consequences pending no
tification from Washington.
At Brandeis University seven professors
said they might quit grading students if de
ferments are to.be ended because of low class
rankings.
Dean John U. Monro of Harvard University
said that, if any of his students asked him to
withhold academic data from their draft
boards he would comply.
Confusion Predicted
College administrators who regarded the
system as basically fair nevertheless predict

widespread confusion.
Gen. Lewis Hershey, National Selective Ser
vice Director, has announced that these de
ferments will be re-examined in the light of
class standing, and scores on new College
Qualification Tests.
Students need not submit to the tests, but
students who flunk or refuse to take it, or who
do not stand high in their classes, may lose
their deferments.
'X' Over 'Z'
Commented Dr. Buell Gallagher, president
of New York's City College:
"A 'C' student at Institution 'X' may be a
better bet for college and university work
than an 'A' student from Institution 'Z.'
"The overriding interest of the nation is bet
ter served by encouraging the best talent to
continue in higher education as long as it is
possible under the manpower demands of the
armed services."

Dr. John Weaver, Vice President for Instruc
tion at Ohio State University, took a similar
view. He called the use of class ranking "a
dangerous way to go about it" because a stu
dent low-ranked at a top school might stand
far higher at one where the standards are less
demanding.
"Students already are under great pressure
for grades, and this certainly is going to in
tensify that," said Dr. Weaver. "I feel there al
ready are too many situations where the stress
is on grades rather than learning."
'Fair'
Charles E. Liesenfelt of Minneapolis, who
is both an educator and a draft board member,
felt that the system would be "about as fair
as you can possibly get."
Liesenfelt, Assistant to the Recorder of the
University of Minnesota and chairman of his
county draft board, said:
"A student has two chances—on the basis

of class rank and on the basis of a test. Say
there was a class of geniuses. Some, of course,
would have to be in the bottom portion of the
class. But they still have a chance for defer
ment if they can pass the test."
George Watson, Dean of Students at Chi
cago's Roosevelt University, protested that the
rules would make the universities "a part of
the Selective Service System." He said he did
not object to the draft itself.
Administrative Confusion
Dr. Elbert Ockerman, Dean of Admissions
at the University of Kentucky, foresaw a good
deal of administrative confusion.
He pointed out that one system might be to
lump the grades of all members of a class, re
gardless of courses taken, and rank them ac
cordingly. An alternate system would be to
rank law students, or college of commerce
students, against each other instead of against
all members of their class.

James Dull, Dean of Men at Georgia Tech,
said "I am not happy with the possible com
parisons, but if we don't keep class rankings
a good student may be drafted because the
draft board doesn't have any basis to work
from."
Col. William P. David, a retired Army offi
cer who is Georgia State's dean of men, said
he felt that "it's equitable to draft those at the
bottom of the academic totem pole."
Special Problem
Goddard College, an experimenal liberal
arts collcge in Plainfield, Vt., reported a spe
cial problem: it does not give its students
grades. Instead the are "evaluated" on the
quality of their work.
Forest K. Davis, Dean of Administration,
said Goddard students may now ask for grades
so that they will know where they stand—in
class and with their draft boards.
