BOSTON (AP) â€” Sen. Ed
ward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Sat
urday called lor an informal
home front corps of high school
and college age volunteers to
aid 740,000 South Vietnamese
refugees.
Kennedy, chairman of the
U. S. Subcommittee on Prob
lems of Refugees and escapees,
introduced about 700 students to
10 volunteer agencies and chal
lenged the young people to par
ticipate in agency efforts.
Speaking at Faneuil Hall, the
brother of the last president
John F. Kennedy, said there
were 740,000 refugees from
"communist tyranny" living in
camps.
After the 1954 Geneva Con
ference, he said, some refugees
moved south from North Viet
nam but that most of them
were displaced because of to
day's war.
No Longer 'Burdens'
For a lpng time, Kennedy
said, both the South Vietnamese
government and the United
States looked upon the refugees
as "burdens," adding, "these
people in refugee camps should
be provided with proper educa
tional and health facilities so
they will be able to go back and
be productive and constructive
citizens again."
The Senator called the orien
tation session an "extremely im
portant and worthwhile under
taking."
"If it works in Massachusetts
we will try it in high schools
and colleges across the coun
try," he said.
Kennedy's audience consisted
mainly of high school student
council presidents and school
newspaper editors from 400 high
schools and 75 colleges in Mas
sachusetts.
