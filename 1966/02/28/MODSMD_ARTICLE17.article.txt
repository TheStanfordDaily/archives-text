## HER 'BROWN BUSTS' REMAIN Jane's Legacy: Inspiration 
### CECILE REED 
"The Will' is not Jane Stan
ford's only legacy. Her mark is
also evident, but not always
prominent, in niches and on
pedestals around Quad.
The keen observer, as well as
the idle daydreamer, might have
noticed the "white men" fram
ing Jordan Hall or the "brown
busts" of the math and history
corners. But few know who they
are—which defeats Jane's rea
son for putting them there.
Desiring to add an inspira
tional as well as decorative
touch to the school, Mrs. Stan
ford ordered about fifty statues
and busts in 1902 from the Itali
an sculptor Antonio Frilli. Also

in 1891 she bought six boxes of
statuary in Athens for the uni
versity. Such classis heroes as
Apollo, Galileo, and Washing
ton, she probably reasoned,
would create the proper inspira
tion and atmosphere for the pur
suit of academic excellence.
"The early university was
weighed down by statues,"
claims Ralph Hansen, Curator
of the Stanford Collection. Not

only did statuary adorn the
quad, but several busts guarded
the library and the twelve apos
tles had their niches in Memo
rial Church.
Death In The Earthquake
Unfortunately many of these
stone and marble men met an
other death in the 1906 earth
quake. However, some remained
remarkably intact. A well-known
survivor was the statue of the
biologist Professor Louis Agas
siz which dove from a pedestal
above a quad arch to the side
walk below. Although the head
of the upside down statue went
several feet into the ground,
the sculpture was righted and
appeared amazingly unscathed.
The earthquake, however, ac
counts for only part of the pres
ent low statuary population. In
1915 the large statue of the
Stanford family was lifted from
its dominant position in the
center of Memorial Court. The
official reason claimed "disin
tegrating in weather," but unof
ficially student pranks prob
ably hastened the decision. Also
Benjamin Franklin and Johann
Gutenberg were taken down
from the outer quad in 1948 be
cause they were judged inappro
priate for the School of Law.
Memories of Jane
The few remaining statues
stand as vestiges of a past era
and a bygone mistress. New
sources of inspiration have re
placed Jane's noble efforts.
If one's curiosity is over
whelming, however, the "white
men" on Jordan Hall are the
German scientist Wilhelm von
Humboldt and the earthquake
hero Louis Agassiz. The latter,
who taught Leland Stanford Sr.
biology in summer sessions on
an island, will be featured on
the cover of the March issue of
American Heritage.


Universities are well-known centers of intel
lectual retreat, but Louis Agassiz seems to have
gone overboard —literally and otherwise. Such
scenes were common on Quad in the wake of
the 1906 "Firequake."
