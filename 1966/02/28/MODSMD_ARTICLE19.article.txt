# Indian Ruggers Drop 17-9 Contest To Bears
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Plagued by a severe case of
"bad hands" the Stanford rugby
team dropped the first game of
the Big Game Crum Axe series
to California Saturday, 17-9.
The game, played before a
large crowd that overflowed the
grandstands and circled the
field, started out looking like it
would be the first victory for
Stanford in two years.
Cal was lacking their star Eng
lishman, Peter Boyce, and the
opening minutes of play found
the ball constantly on the Cal
side of the field.
Bears Off Balance
With long kicks to touch, Mike
Grace kept the Bears off bal
ance for the early minutes of
play. However each Stanford of
fensive rush was stopped by a
fumble or knock on, giving a
sad hint of things to come.

Stanford got the first chance
to score, but Mike Grace's pen
alty kick attempt was wide of
the mark.
On their first real offensive
rush of the day, Cal was able
to push over a score. Bear foot
baller Tom Relies passed off to
Jerry Bradley after a short run
and Bradley outraced the Card
wing, Dave Mac Queen, for the
score.
The conversion try was missed
and the Indians got two quick
attempts to score on successive
penalties by Cal. However both
kicks were from bad angles and
were wide.
Grace Scores
The play was largely near mid
field until Mike Grace got off a
long kick for the Cards. Grace
chased his own kick and was on
his way to score when he lost
control of the ball.

However Cal was called for
a penalty on the ensuing scrum
and Grace got his three points
anyway on the penalty kick.
This knotted the score at 3-3.
The score might have re
mained tied at half, had not the
Indians been stung once again
by the speedy Cal backfield. Jer
ry Walter took the ball out of a
loose ruck and passed off to
Tom Relies.
Cal Bounces Back
Relies broke lour tackles on
his way to the end zone and
simply ran away from the last
tackier to score. The conversion
was no good, but the half ended
with Cal holding a 6-3 lead.
The second half started out
all-Cal. The Bears won every
line-out in the opening minutes
of play and a good many of the
scrums. Tom Relies increased
the Bear lead when he ran 10
yards off of a loose ruck for a
try.
This time the conversion kick
by Dan Sinclair was good and
the Indians were behind, 11-3.
Stanford bounced right back
with Grace scoring on a penalty
kick, only to have Cal score im
mediately afterward, as Lloyd
Reist put the ball across after a
nice backfi e 1 d rush by the
speedy Bears.
Final Comeback Try
With score 14-6, the Indians
attempted to make a comeback.
Mike Grace booted a perfect. 35
yard penalty kick to start things.
From this point on the Indian
ruggers actually carried the
game to the Bears.
But, stymied by constant poor
ball handling, the Cards were
never able to put the ball over
for a try, despite fine runs deep
into Cal territory by Dave Evans
and Tim Abena.
As the game ended Cal scored
one final time. The try by Jerry
Bradley had no effect on the
game outcome, but makes Stan
ford's task for next week that
much harder.
The second game of the home
and-home series for the Scrum
Axe will be played at Berkeley
Stanford will have to beat Cal
by 9 points to regain the axe.
Berkeley's Thin Field
The rugby field at Berkeley
should complicate the Indians
efforts as it is less wide than
the normal rugby playing field,
and the Bears are undoubtedly
used to the smaller size. How
ever the field should also cut
down a little on the plays of the
speedy Bear backfield.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
expressed hope for next week's
crucial encounter, "I was really
pleased with the way our scrum
handled the Bears. But for our
'bad hands,' I think we would
have won the game."
Others singled out for their
game play for Stanford were
Randy Vahan and Frank Pat
tiucci.
Next week the Indians will be
trying to erase the eight point
deficit and regain the Scrum
Axe lost two years ago. Game
time at Berkeley is 2:00.
