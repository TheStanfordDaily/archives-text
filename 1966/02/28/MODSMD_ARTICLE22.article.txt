# Indians' Hopes Die In LA
## Barred 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
A gallant effort made by Stan
ford's basketball team for that
much coveted conference cham
pionship fell short Saturday as
the Indians fell to UCLA, 70-58.
That single loss all but extin
guished any hope of the Tribe
winning the conference title.
Friday night Indian basketball
hopes were heightened with an
impressive 82-71 victory over
USC in what Coach Howie Dall
mar called "Stanford's best
game of the year."
Friday's victory then set the
stage for a dramatic climax to
Stanford's basketball season
with next weekend's series with
Cal a truly anticlimactic finish
to this year's basketball season.

With two victories last week
end the Indians chances of fin
ishing in the top spot would
have been greatly increased.
Oregon State with only two loss
es but with three games left to
play is the conference leader.
UCLA is the only team with an
outside chance of challenging
them for this lead. The Bruins
are 8-4 in conference play with
two games left with USC.
Forgets How to Play
The first half of both con
tests this weekend were tightly
played. But the outcome of both
were contrasted. Stanford liter
ally forgot how to play basket
ball for about five minutes
against UCLA and subsequent
ly lost to last season's confer
ence champs.

Against USC the Tribe's big
break came when the Trojans'
John Block committed his
fourth foul in the second half.
Block put on an amazing dis
play of his basketball abilities
in the first half scoring 25
points. He finished the contest
with 28 points which reveals
the limitation that his four fouls
put on his scoring punch. He
played only about 10 minutes
of the final half.
The Trojans made a last sec
ond shot to lead at the half
time break, 39-38.
The lead continued to change
back and forth throughout the
initial stages of the second half.
However, after the score was
knotted at 58-58, Ray Kosanke
and Bob Bedell put on a spurt

that the Trojans were never able
to catch.
Employ Stall
With about three minutes left
to play the Indians then em
ployed a slight stall into their
attack which of course only con
tributed to the Trojans' frus
tration.
Block led all scorers with 28
points with Bedell netting a re
spectable 25 while also leading
a potent rebound force which
was the key to Stanford's vic
tory.
The Indians outrebounded the
Trojans 50-32. Stanford also out
shot USC percentage-wise 55.7
to 43.5.
UCLA's balanced scoring at
tack was too much for the spir
ited Indians, Saturday. The
famed Bruin press also ironed
out several first-half Bruin mis
cues and turned a closely knot
ted score into a 10-point advan
tage for UCLA. From then on
it was a uphill climb for Stan
ford that the Indians never
quite mastered.
Cut Lead to One
The Indians built a 12-point
advantage in the first half but
the Bruins cut this lead to one
just before the half. This sud
den surge by the Bruins was a
definite indication of what their
plans were for the second half.
The Bruins either patched up
a weakness in their own attack
or found one in the Indians in
the second half as they quickly
sprinted to their 10-point lead.
UCLA, of course, then resort
ed to a control game which in
precise terms means a stall with
a 64-58 lead. The final score, 70-
58, resulted from mostly give
away shots and foolish fouling
by Stanford.
OSU Almost Champs
Oregon State's big hurdle in
their race to the conference will
be their cross-state rivalsâ€”the
University of Oregon next week
end. They play Washington to
night. However, as Coach Dall
mar put it, "OSU certainly de
serves the title. They have the
personnel for their style of ball
and they just keep right on win
ning. They are a fine team."


Stanford's gymnastics team is
shown in action against USC
this past weekend. Stanford's
performance was considerably
improved over previous compe
tition. They will be meeting: the
famed Cal gymnasts this Friday
at Stanford.
