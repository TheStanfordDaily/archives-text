# Baseball Team Breaks Loose; Beats SFS 11-0
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford varsity baseball
team playing opportunistic ball
took advantage to San Francis
co State, 11-0, and Cal Poly of
San Luis Obispo, 7-1, in games
Friday and Saturday here.
It was a satisfying victory for
the Indians as they finally broke
out of the calm which had kept
them from scoring more than
three runs or getting more than
three hits in any game until last
weekend.
Although they only got five
hits, the Tribe showed some of
their big guns Saturday against
Cal Poly. Yett hit a 340 foot
two run homer over the right
field fence which landed five
feet inside the foul line in the
third inning to cap a five run
rally.
Long Blast
Jim Hi b b s blasted the first
pitch of the eighth over the
fence in left center at the 375
foot mark to give Stanford their
seventh run.
John Mason, who threw the
first seven frames, and Terry
Docken kept the San Francisco
State batters wondering what
to do next as the duo held them
to one hitâ€”a ground single to
right in the second inning.
Meanwhile, the Indians were
scoring at least one run in each
of the first six innings to give
the Coach, Fehring, a little re
laxation cushion to rest on.
Stanford wasted little time in
displaying some offensive abil
ity to the States as number two
hitter Steve Hovley walked,
stole second, and scored on a
single by Yett.
Extra Base Hit
Yett doubled Pete Middlekauff
home after Middlekauff singled
with one out in the third. Yett
looped the ball over the left
fielder's head.
Dick Swan ripped a single to
left, but a strong throw kept
Yett at third. He scored on

Frank Duffy's ground out, how
ever.
Leading 4-0, the Tribe staged
a three run rally in the fourth
inning. Schomaker walked, and
Hovley moved him over to third
with a perfect hit and run single
into the hole between first and
second.
Hibbs followed with a tower
ing triple to right field which
hit at the base of the fence.
Middlekauff got a free pass
when he was hit by the pitch. He
stole second to put men on sec
ond and third. Yett walked.
Swan grounded to the pitcher
who threw home to force Hibbs,
but the throw to first for the
double play was dropped by the
first baseman and Middlekauff
scored.
Mason Starts It
Pitcher Mason started a three
run rally in the fifth with a hard
hit single to left. Schomaker
walked, and Hovley singled to
right scoring Mason. With Sho
maker on third, Hovley took off
as if to steal second and stopped
in his tracks about two-thirds of
the way down. The staters got
him in a rundown. Shomaker
took off for home and dove un
der the tag to score. Hovley
wound up at second.
Hovley scored when the first
baseman let the throw from the
shortstop get past him after the
shortstop had scooped up Mid
dlekauff's bouncer.
Swan scored the eleventh and
last run of the day in the sixth
when he led off with a single,
went to second on an error, to
third on a single by Tom Melzer,
and to ho me on a fielder's
choice.
A five run third inning and
strong pitching doomed Cal
Poly on Saturday.
Good Pitching
Daro Quiring started on the
mound and threw five good in
nings, tired in the sixth to give
up a run. Hi Lewis took over

in the seventh and kept the Mus
tangs at bay the rest way. Mike
Shomacker drew a walk as Stan
ford's lead off hitter in the first.
He stole second, went to third
on a wild pitch and scored on a
sacrifice fly by Steve Hovley.
All was quiet on Sunken Dia
mond until the third inning.
Tom Melzer started it with a
walk. Quiring walked. Schoma
ker cut some grass with a
grounder to third which was
bobbled leaving the bases loaded.
Hovley blooped a single into
short right scoring one run.
Jim Hibbs brought Quiring
across the plate with a sacrifice
fly to right. Schomaker, who
had gone to third on Hibbs' fly,
scored when Pete Middlekauff
grounded out to second. Then
Ron Yett hit his home run to
make the score 6-0.
Home Run
Hibbs bit his home run in the
eighth to give Stanford their
seven runs.
Cal Poly scored their run in
the sixth on a walk, a double,
and a sacrifice fly.
The fielding gem of the week
end prevented them from scor
ing in the eighth. With men on
first and second a Cal Poly bat
ter slapped what appeared to be
a sure single and rbi up the mid
dle. Shortstop Frank Duffy
raced behind second, dove for
the ball and caught it, and
flipped it while on his back to
Dick Swan to force the man at
second. The man who had been
on second had to hold at third.
The next man grounded out to
Duffy for the third out.
The next game is this after
noon at 3:00 in Sunken Dia
mond. The varsity will face the
Minor League All Stars.
