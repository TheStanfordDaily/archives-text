# Philistines In Encina?
## 
### 
Like many other members of the Stanford
community, we are extremely disappointed at
the disappearance of the paintings from the
walls of Encina Hall.
The paintings, including several nudes,
were removed recently in response to pressure
from several Encina employees and adminis
tration officials. The move reveals, we feel, a
narrow-minded attitude toward both art and
education.
Associate Registrar Robert Houghton, who
found most of the art "morose," explained that
he thought the paintings were not "the kind
that students having to go to the Cashier's
Office and employees working in the office
should be forced to view." We would like to
think that his views are motivated only by a
hope that a less-attractive Encina would en
courage students to register at the proper time
in the Pavilion, and thereby avoid the late-fee
lines in the Cashier's Office. But such, we fear,
is not the case. Mr. Houghton's views seem to
indicate, rather, a belief that art and education
are separate entities unto themselves.
Like education, art finds its roots in experi
mentation. Both consist in attempts at dabbling
with life and coming to grips with reality. An
adventuresome and experimental attitude is
essential to both. And art, as a reflection of a
changing reality, is an integral part of the edu
cational process. If one is to believe that stu
dents—for whom, in theory, the university exists
—should not be exposed to "ungainly nudes,"
as Houghton calls them, because one might
find them "offensive," then would it not also

stand to reason that students should not be
"forced" to read Voltaire because his ideas
might be disagreeable?
In a university community, such a self-pro
tective attitude —especially when it takes the
form of a judgment of the few being foisted
on the many —should be dismissed, rather than
satisfied.
We hope to see the paintings returned.
