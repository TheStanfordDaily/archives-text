# New Social What?
## 
### 
In order to "avoid confusion and clarify pol
icy," the Social Regulations Committee and
Women's Council have sent a new social regu
lations policy directive to all women's resi
dences.
Under the new regulations, a girl may now
avoid the confusion of having to put an orange
card next to her name if she wishes to take a
6 a.m. late leave by following the much clearer
policy of putting an orange card next to her
name if she wishes to take a 2:30 a.m. late
leave. Thus if an orange card is not visible,
it will be assumed that the girl has taken a
6 a.m. leave (whereas previously it would have
been assumed that she was taking a 2:30 a.m.
leave), unless the girl is a freshman or sopho
more in which case absence of an orange card
indicates that the girl has taken a 2:30 a.m.
late leave; however, regardless of the girl's
year, if a blue card is visible, it will be assumed
that she has taken an overnight.
Now we understand why it is that Stanford
women need to be educated.
