# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Sorry, God Is Not At Home 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It is rather interesting to note
that amidst the furor of the
recently abated religious contro
versy (the results of which I
heartily applaud), our former
grounds of religious expression
are slowly being infringed upon.
While previously the Memorial
Church Sanctuary was kept
open most of the time, now "of
fice hours" of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. have been instituted as the
proper period to visit the House
of God. The reason for the new
policy: "Things have been stolen
from the Sanctuary."
It seems to me that a remedy
other than "lock the church"
could be contrived for this prob
lem if the policy-makers of
Memorial Church were more
concerned about saving souls
than saving property. For al
though the ornamental cloth up
on the Sanctuary altar is intact
today, we shall never know the
condition of the soul who stuck
this note on the locked doors of
the Church: "Dear God: I came

to see you last night, but you
weren't home."

• My Own Way
Editor, The Daily:
The Trustees' decision to al
low sectarian worship on cam
pus is to be applauded warmly
in its recognition of religious
pluralism: as a Catholic I shall
appreciate the opportunity to
worship "my own way" on cam
pus, though the "non-sectarian"
services are completely enjoy
able. As a devoted ecumenist,
however (and as an ex-Prot
estant), I sincerely hope that
the various Protestant sects on
campus won't view this liberali
zation as a vehicle to renew the
old differences between them
selves! Christianity in this day
needs all the unity it can mus
ter, so let us all remember that
"pluralism" can be overdone
with tremendous facility.

• Discrimination
Editor, The Dally:
I congratulate Professor Wil
fred Stone on his decision to con
gratulate Breakers on their deci
sion to abolish rush (The Daily,
Feb. 16). In his condemnation
of "other eating clubs and fra
ternities," however, he missed
the opportunity to criticize other
forms of discrimination. I'm
sure the professor realizes that
the University itself is a per
petrator of this most heinous
of crimes—there are people ap
plying for application to this
University and being turned
down! In addition, the Univers
ity condones job Interviews for
graduate and graduating stu
dents. The time has come for
sweeping changes: anyone who
wants a job should be able to
get it, regardless of his qualifi
cations, and applicants to uni
versities should be accepted, as
the name implies, "universally."
If this doesn't work because of
the limited number of positions
available, maybe some form of

lottery or drawihg-from-a-hat
can be arranged.
I wonder if the professor is
true to his conscience. Does he
perhaps deliberately invite peo
ple he either doesn't know or
doesn't like to festivities at his
home (if he finds time for
them)? Does he join groups in
which he is unwelcome? The fra
ternity and eating club bid sys
tem is based on. the conception
that mutual trust, respect, or
just plain preference (for one
reason or another) is essential
to the development of that
rather nebulous term "Char
acter." Whether the system falls
or not is open to debate, to be
sure—nonetheless, if one wishes
to confront others with con
flicting views or opinions all he
has to do is open the door of his
fraternity house or eating club
and walk over to the Union (or
read The Daily). Let the profes
sor live with whom he wishes,
and with those who wish to live
with him—but let him allow
others the same right.
