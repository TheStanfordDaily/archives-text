# Concepts, Like Jam, Are Sweeter Than The Label
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG 
(Editor's note: The author, a

graduate student in political
science.)

I always find John Bonine's
political analyses thought-pro
voking. His latest effort on the
liberal-conservative imbalance in
our universities (The Daily, Feb
ruary 16) is no exception.
I am not particularly bothered
by his specific criticisms: if one
accepts his major premise, that
there is a self-propagating lib
eral hegemony in academia, they
are more or less reasonable de
ductions. Nor am I disturbed
by the premise itself: it has
been around for a long time now
and I have grown accustomed
to its face.
I suggest, however, that un
derlying both the specific criti
cisms and the premise on which
they appear to be based is a way
of viewing the political world
that militates against clear
thinking— not only in relation to
the question of academic free
dom but to other troublesome
ethical and political issues.
Empty Value
Mr. Bonine, it appears, per
ceives the political world or at
least large chunks of it in terms
of concepts that have lost any
denotative and connotative value
they once might have possessed.
Is it not evident by now that
concepts such as "conservatism"
and "liberalism" when applied
to present modes of political
thought and types of political ac
tivity tend to obfuscate rather
than illuminate?
As an excellent student in the
social sciences, Mr. Bonine must
be aware that in the last two
hundred years of Western po
litical history there have been
three major types of liberalism.
Which if any of these three does
he have in mind when he refers
to today's average professor as
"liberal"? I would submit that
a contemporary variation of the
type normally called utilitarian
ism is what Mr. Bonine prob
ably considers to be modern
"conservatism."
Folly
Whether Mr. Bonine would
agree with this last statement —
given the perspective I am try
ing to establish —is not relevant.
In fact, any substantial dis
agreement on this point could
be construed as evidence of the
folly of attempting to under
stand twentieth century political

thought and action in terms of
eighteenth and nineteenth cen
tury concepts. Mr. Bonine—and
he is far, far from being alone
—is walking through the mod
ern world wearing a bygone
era's ideological armor.
What might explain Mr. Bo
nine's and many other individ
uals' seemingly unreasonable
adherence to anachronistic con
cepts such as liberalism and con
servatism? Why, more general
ly, do so many well-intentioned
persons such as Mr. Bonine in
sist upon employing simplistic,
outmoded categories in at
tempting to understand today's
multi • faceted, protean exist
ence? Why, in fact, has there
been an overall tendency in the
Western world to reduce com
plex people and their complex
activities to distilled essences
which can be bottled, capped
and labeled?
There are, of course, no sim
ple, neat answers to these ques
tions, but I would like to sug
gest briefly how we might begin
to answer them.
Flux
Confronting both himself and
the world about him, the pre-
Socratic Greek philosopher, He
raclitus, is reported to have
cried in anguish: "Everything is
in flux; give me a place where
I can stand." Some two thou
sand years later, the American
philosopher John Dewey ana
lyzed the Western tradition of
thought as the "quest for cer
tainty," as the effort to tran
scend the contingencies, vagaries
and opacities of the world of
becoming and to dwell in a
world of immutable, certain and
transparent being.
Antediluvian
Dewey's insight, I feel, can
serve as the beginning of an ef
fort to understand why Mr. Bo
nine and so many others—and
if it is not yet absolutely clear,
"others" include so-called "lib
erals"—are unable, in trying to
understand and cope with the
present, to relinquish or at least
modify antidiluvian and ineffi
cacious concepts such as liberal
ism and conservatism.
In their anxiousness to find
a place where they can stand
they simplify and thus tend to
distort modern existence in all
its glorious if bewildering com
plexity. Such simplification and
distortion may be easier on the
psyche but they make authentic
communication on ethical and
political matters, among others,
nearly impossible.
Unproductive
In summary and conclusion, I
wish to suggest that debates on
such issues as academic freedom
will continue to seem unreal
and unproductive until our
thoughts and concepts are made
more consonant and compatible
with our own and others' pres
ent actions. One fairly painless
way of beginning to close the
"thought-action gap" is to stop
labeling and categorizing pro
fessors as "liberal" and "con
servative."
If this demands too much ef
fort, perhaps we at least can re
main aware that a label and
that which is labeled are not
the same things. If anyone
doubts this, let him eat the label
rather than the contents of a
jar of strawberry jam.

our universities (The Daily, Feb
ruary 16) is no exception.
I am not particularly bothered
by his specific criticisms: if one
accepts his major premise, that
there is a self-propagating lib
eral hegemony in academia, they
are more or less reasonable de
ductions. Nor am I disturbed
by the premise itself: it has
been around for a long time now
and I have grown accustomed
to its face.
I suggest, however, that un
derlying both the specific criti
cisms and the premise on which
they appear to be based is a way
of viewing the political world
that militates against clear
thinking— not only in relation to
the question of academic free
dom but to other troublesome
ethical and political issues.
Empty Value
Mr. Bonine, it appears, per
ceives the political world or at
least large chunks of it in terms
of concepts that have lost any
denotative and connotative value
they once might have possessed.
Is it not evident by now that
concepts such as "conservatism"
and "liberalism" when applied
to present modes of political
thought and types of political ac
tivity tend to obfuscate rather
than illuminate?
As an excellent student in the
social sciences, Mr. Bonine must
be aware that in the last two
hundred years of Western po
litical history there have been
three major types of liberalism.
Which if any of these three does
he have in mind when he refers
to today's average professor as
"liberal"? I would submit that
a contemporary variation of the
type normally called utilitarian
ism is what Mr. Bonine prob
ably considers to be modern
"conservatism."
Folly
Whether Mr. Bonine would
agree with this last statement —
given the perspective I am try
ing to establish —is not relevant.
In fact, any substantial dis
agreement on this point could
be construed as evidence of the
folly of attempting to under
stand twentieth century political

thought and action in terms of
eighteenth and nineteenth cen
tury concepts. Mr. Bonine—and
he is far, far from being alone
—is walking through the mod
ern world wearing a bygone
era's ideological armor.
What might explain Mr. Bo
nine's and many other individ
uals' seemingly unreasonable
adherence to anachronistic con
cepts such as liberalism and con
servatism? Why, more general
ly, do so many well-intentioned
persons such as Mr. Bonine in
sist upon employing simplistic,
outmoded categories in at
tempting to understand today's
multi • faceted, protean exist
ence? Why, in fact, has there
been an overall tendency in the
Western world to reduce com
plex people and their complex
activities to distilled essences
which can be bottled, capped
and labeled?
There are, of course, no sim
ple, neat answers to these ques
tions, but I would like to sug
gest briefly how we might begin
to answer them.
Flux
Confronting both himself and
the world about him, the pre-
Socratic Greek philosopher, He
raclitus, is reported to have
cried in anguish: "Everything is
in flux; give me a place where
I can stand." Some two thou
sand years later, the American
philosopher John Dewey ana
lyzed the Western tradition of
thought as the "quest for cer
tainty," as the effort to tran
scend the contingencies, vagaries
and opacities of the world of
becoming and to dwell in a
world of immutable, certain and
transparent being.
Antediluvian
Dewey's insight, I feel, can
serve as the beginning of an ef
fort to understand why Mr. Bo
nine and so many others—and
if it is not yet absolutely clear,
"others" include so-called "lib
erals"—are unable, in trying to
understand and cope with the
present, to relinquish or at least
modify antidiluvian and ineffi
cacious concepts such as liberal
ism and conservatism.
In their anxiousness to find
a place where they can stand
they simplify and thus tend to
distort modern existence in all
its glorious if bewildering com
plexity. Such simplification and
distortion may be easier on the
psyche but they make authentic
communication on ethical and
political matters, among others,
nearly impossible.
Unproductive
In summary and conclusion, I
wish to suggest that debates on
such issues as academic freedom
will continue to seem unreal
and unproductive until our
thoughts and concepts are made
more consonant and compatible
with our own and others' pres
ent actions. One fairly painless
way of beginning to close the
"thought-action gap" is to stop
labeling and categorizing pro
fessors as "liberal" and "con
servative."
If this demands too much ef
fort, perhaps we at least can re
main aware that a label and
that which is labeled are not
the same things. If anyone
doubts this, let him eat the label
rather than the contents of a
jar of strawberry jam.

ductions. Nor am I disturbed
by the premise itself: it has
been around for a long time now
and I have grown accustomed
to its face.
I suggest, however, that un
derlying both the specific criti
cisms and the premise on which
they appear to be based is a way
of viewing the political world
that militates against clear
thinking— not only in relation to
the question of academic free
dom but to other troublesome
ethical and political issues.
Empty Value
Mr. Bonine, it appears, per
ceives the political world or at
least large chunks of it in terms
of concepts that have lost any
denotative and connotative value
they once might have possessed.
Is it not evident by now that
concepts such as "conservatism"
and "liberalism" when applied
to present modes of political
thought and types of political ac
tivity tend to obfuscate rather
than illuminate?
As an excellent student in the
social sciences, Mr. Bonine must
be aware that in the last two
hundred years of Western po
litical history there have been
three major types of liberalism.
Which if any of these three does
he have in mind when he refers
to today's average professor as
"liberal"? I would submit that
a contemporary variation of the
type normally called utilitarian
ism is what Mr. Bonine prob
ably considers to be modern
"conservatism."
Folly
Whether Mr. Bonine would
agree with this last statement —
given the perspective I am try
ing to establish —is not relevant.
In fact, any substantial dis
agreement on this point could
be construed as evidence of the
folly of attempting to under
stand twentieth century political

thought and action in terms of
eighteenth and nineteenth cen
tury concepts. Mr. Bonine—and
he is far, far from being alone
—is walking through the mod
ern world wearing a bygone
era's ideological armor.
What might explain Mr. Bo
nine's and many other individ
uals' seemingly unreasonable
adherence to anachronistic con
cepts such as liberalism and con
servatism? Why, more general
ly, do so many well-intentioned
persons such as Mr. Bonine in
sist upon employing simplistic,
outmoded categories in at
tempting to understand today's
multi • faceted, protean exist
ence? Why, in fact, has there
been an overall tendency in the
Western world to reduce com
plex people and their complex
activities to distilled essences
which can be bottled, capped
and labeled?
There are, of course, no sim
ple, neat answers to these ques
tions, but I would like to sug
gest briefly how we might begin
to answer them.
Flux
Confronting both himself and
the world about him, the pre-
Socratic Greek philosopher, He
raclitus, is reported to have
cried in anguish: "Everything is
in flux; give me a place where
I can stand." Some two thou
sand years later, the American
philosopher John Dewey ana
lyzed the Western tradition of
thought as the "quest for cer
tainty," as the effort to tran
scend the contingencies, vagaries
and opacities of the world of
becoming and to dwell in a
world of immutable, certain and
transparent being.
Antediluvian
Dewey's insight, I feel, can
serve as the beginning of an ef
fort to understand why Mr. Bo
nine and so many others—and
if it is not yet absolutely clear,
"others" include so-called "lib
erals"—are unable, in trying to
understand and cope with the
present, to relinquish or at least
modify antidiluvian and ineffi
cacious concepts such as liberal
ism and conservatism.
In their anxiousness to find
a place where they can stand
they simplify and thus tend to
distort modern existence in all
its glorious if bewildering com
plexity. Such simplification and
distortion may be easier on the
psyche but they make authentic
communication on ethical and
political matters, among others,
nearly impossible.
Unproductive
In summary and conclusion, I
wish to suggest that debates on
such issues as academic freedom
will continue to seem unreal
and unproductive until our
thoughts and concepts are made
more consonant and compatible
with our own and others' pres
ent actions. One fairly painless
way of beginning to close the
"thought-action gap" is to stop
labeling and categorizing pro
fessors as "liberal" and "con
servative."
If this demands too much ef
fort, perhaps we at least can re
main aware that a label and
that which is labeled are not
the same things. If anyone
doubts this, let him eat the label
rather than the contents of a
jar of strawberry jam.

I always find John Bonine's
political analyses thought-pro
voking. His latest effort on the
liberal-conservative imbalance in
our universities (The Daily, Feb
ruary 16) is no exception.
I am not particularly bothered
by his specific criticisms: if one
accepts his major premise, that
there is a self-propagating lib
eral hegemony in academia, they
are more or less reasonable de
ductions. Nor am I disturbed
