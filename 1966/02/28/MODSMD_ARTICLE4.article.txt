# 'Deliver Us From Evil...'
## North Viet Defectors Will Speak On Red China's Influence Tonight 
### 
Four North Vietnamese students
who fled from East Germany to West
Germany will hold a press conference
this morning at 10 a.m. in Tresidder
Small Lounge. An open discussion
will also be held at 4:15 p.m. in Tresid
der Large Lounge.
The students are currently on a
tour of the United States, sponsored
and paid for by the U. S. State De
partment and the South Vietnamese
government. The students have em
phasized in their appearances the in
fluence of the Red Chinese upon
North Vietnam.
The students are Pham Phu Oanh,
Phan Phuc Vinh, Nguyen Thanh
Hung, and Nguyen Khe. They are all
students in West Germany, and mem
bers of the "Association of Vietna
mese Students in West Germany," of
which Vinh is President.
Support Bombing
In New York, earlier this month,
they supported U. S. bombing of
North Vietnam and advocated bomb
ing of Hanoi and Haiphong, but
warned indiscriminate bombing would
only strengthen the North Vietnamese
will to resist.
The families of all four were in

volved in the anti-French Viet Minh
movement. The families moved from
South Vietnam to the North after the
cease-fire. Nguyen Than Khe attacked
the Viet Cong as fighting for com
munism rather than nationalism.
At a Washington press conference,
Phan Phuc Vinh said, "The influence
of China in North Vietnam is wide
spread and deep."
"It is rooted in the moral and ethical
life of the people and so there can
be almost no conflict between Chi
nese technicians and Vietnamese
workers," he added.
More Communism, Worse Life
Phan gave the nature of commu
nism as his reason for defection. "The
more communism, the worse the
life," he said, referring to his experi
ences in Russia, China, North Viet
nam and West Germany.
Although all four have just recent
ly defected from communist Eastern
Europe, none have been in North
Vietnam since 1961. Three members
of the group noted the North Vietna
mese fought hard for communism.
Phan suggested that Chinese influ
ence in the North was greater than
U. S. influence in the South. He sug

gested that while American techni
cians in South Vietnamese were re
spected for their aid and skill, a Viet
namese could still get angry if an
American stole his girl friend.
Pham Phu Oanh, born near Saigon
in 1938, had lived in Hungary for
eight years, before fleeing to West
Germany in 1964. He is presently
studying fine arts at the University
of Ulm.
Escaped East
Phan Phuc Vinh was born in North
Vietnam, where his parents still live.
He escaped to West Germany through
East Germany, and is presently a po
litical science student at Cologne.
Nguyen Thanh Hung, born in 1940
at Danang, moved to the North with
the resistance movement against the
French at the age of 14. In 1961 he
was sent to East Germany, but soon
came West, and is now studying mu
sic at the University of Bonn.
Nguyen Khe also moved north in
the 1954 resistance to the French.
After study at the Hanoi School of
Fine Arts, Khe went to East Germany
to study television in 1960. In 1964
he was ordered to return to Viet
nam, but went to Hungary instead,
and escaped to West Germany.

Four North Vietnamese students
who fled from East Germany to West
Germany will hold a press conference
this morning at 10 a.m. in Tresidder
Small Lounge. An open discussion
will also be held at 4:15 p.m. in Tresid
der Large Lounge.
The students are currently on a
tour of the United States, sponsored
and paid for by the U. S. State De
partment and the South Vietnamese
government. The students have em
phasized in their appearances the in
fluence of the Red Chinese upon
North Vietnam.
The students are Pham Phu Oanh,
Phan Phuc Vinh, Nguyen Thanh
Hung, and Nguyen Khe. They are all
students in West Germany, and mem
bers of the "Association of Vietna
mese Students in West Germany," of
which Vinh is President.
Support Bombing
In New York, earlier this month,
they supported U. S. bombing of
North Vietnam and advocated bomb
ing of Hanoi and Haiphong, but
warned indiscriminate bombing would
only strengthen the North Vietnamese
will to resist.
The families of all four were in

volved in the anti-French Viet Minh
movement. The families moved from
South Vietnam to the North after the
cease-fire. Nguyen Than Khe attacked
the Viet Cong as fighting for com
munism rather than nationalism.
At a Washington press conference,
Phan Phuc Vinh said, "The influence
of China in North Vietnam is wide
spread and deep."
"It is rooted in the moral and ethical
life of the people and so there can
be almost no conflict between Chi
nese technicians and Vietnamese
workers," he added.
More Communism, Worse Life
Phan gave the nature of commu
nism as his reason for defection. "The
more communism, the worse the
life," he said, referring to his experi
ences in Russia, China, North Viet
nam and West Germany.
Although all four have just recent
ly defected from communist Eastern
Europe, none have been in North
Vietnam since 1961. Three members
of the group noted the North Vietna
mese fought hard for communism.
Phan suggested that Chinese influ
ence in the North was greater than
U. S. influence in the South. He sug

gested that while American techni
cians in South Vietnamese were re
spected for their aid and skill, a Viet
namese could still get angry if an
American stole his girl friend.
