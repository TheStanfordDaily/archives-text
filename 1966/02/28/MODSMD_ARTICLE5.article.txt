# RAMSEY DEFINES "MORAL BOND"
## No Sex Without Marital Love 
### ROBERT FRIES 
Dr. Paul Ramsey, Professor of Re
ligion at Princeton University,
stressed the role of marriage as a
moral bond in his Tresidder Contem
porary Sexual Ethics Series talk,
"The Marriage of Adam and Eve."

Dr. Ramsey's thesis stated that the
"crux" of a Christian notion of sexual
ethics is the "moral bond" of a com
munication of spirit and a bodily un
ion for the purpose of procreation.
Ramsey first dicsussed the idea of
procreation as "creation for God" on

the part of the participants. He em
phasized that the act of procreation
was beyond the determination of man
and thereby in constant association
with the love of the parties. Christian
ethic, asserted Ramsey, denies the an
cient dualism of spirit and body by
affirming the moral connection be
tween love and procreation.
Modern 'Adam and Eve'
Ramsey stated that the partners in
every modern marriage are proto
types of Adam and Eve in that each
woman "makes a man Adam and each
man makes a woman Eve." Thus did
Ramsey metaphorically define the
idea of the "communicative good"
which accompanies the desire for pro
creation in every marriage.
The marriage partners are "in a
garden" in which each seeks to be
alone with the other, not shamefully
but out of a desire for communica
tion. It was this need for communica
tion on equal terms which determined
the creation of Eve in the garden. So,
declared Ramsey, was woman an "im
provement even paradise needed."
In seeking to define the "moral
bond" of the Christian marriage, Ram
sey emphasized that "manhood and
womanhood," not minds, were fash
ioned in the "image of God." The
moral bond of marriage is a union of
body and spirit so exclusive that, as
God created "in the midst of love al
ways," so too must human procrea
tion be always in the midst of human
love.
