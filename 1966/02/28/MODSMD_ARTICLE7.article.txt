Science Research Associates of Chi

verbal and linguistic skills and the
other 50 per cent to quantitative rea
soning.
The three-hour test will cover four

WASHINGTON (AP)— One million
draft-eligible students are expected to
take the Selective Service College
Qualification Tests this spring. The
exams will help draft boards deter
mine whether the students may stay
in school or be drafted.
Selective Service announced Friday
that the test would be given May 14,
May 21, and June 3 at 1,200 locations
throughout the continental United
States, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico
and the Canal Zone.
Draft deferment tests were last used
during the Korean War.
Optional
College students and high school
students graduating this year will be
eligible—but they must apply to take
the test by April 23. The test is op
tional.
Science Research Associates of Chi
cago will administer the exams, which
will be similar to general aptitude
tests. About 50 per cent will relate to
verbal and linguistic skills and the
other 50 per cent to quantitative rea
soning.
The three-hour test will cover four
areas: reading comprehension; verbal
relations; arithmetic reasoning; and
data interpretation. It will consist of
150 different items.
•Major' No Help
A Selective Service spokesman said
the test has been son constructed that
no special advantage will be given to

any type of major course students are
pursuing.
The formal announcement by Se
lective Service will be made available
before April 1 to be distributed and
posted in colleges and universities,
post offices and other public buildings
and local draft boards throughout the
country.
A registrant considering taking the
test will be able to get from the local
draft board an explanation bulletin
and a form to mail to Science Re
aearch Associates.
Science Research, in turn, will tell
the registrant when and where to re
port to take the test.
A student will take the test only
once.
Undetermined Scale
The spokesman said there has been
no determination yet as to what will
be regarded as a satisfactory test
score.
The criteria in use previously in
cluded a score of 70 or better on a
College Qualification Test for a reg
ular student and 80 for a graduate
student, except that 70 was accepta
ble for graduate students in the heal
ing arts. The class standing require
ments were that a freshman had to
be in the upper one-half of his class
at the end of the school year, a sopho
more in the upper two-thirds and a
junior in the upper three-fourths.
