The Christian and the Jew
Great confusion exists today in religious circles concerning the relation
ships between the people of Israel, God's chosen and favored nation; and the
present-age people of God, the church of Jesus Christ—those called "Chris
tians." In spite of human ignorance or disbelief, the one true God continues
to be who he is, and to do what he has said he would do, whether men are
with him or not. Proclaiming the Good News of God's love the Apostle Paul
writes, "I am not ashamed of the Gospel; it is the power of God for salvation
to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in the
Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written.
The just shall live by faith' " (Romans 1:1 6-171.
What the living God of Israel seeks is the trust, faith and personal com
mitment of the individual heart above all else. The book of Hebrews records,
Without faith it is impossible to please God. He who comes to God must
believe that he exists and that he rewords those who diligently seek hem."
The New Testament reminds the non-Jew thot his faith and access to
God springs from the roots of a Jewish tree into which the non-Jew is a grafted
branch:
". . . But if some of the branches were broken off, and you Gentiles, a
wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive
tree, do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that is not you
that support the root, but the root that supports you. You will say, Branches
were broken off that I might be grafted in,' That is true. They were broken off
because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through faith , . .
And even the Jews, if they do not persist in their unbelief will be
grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you have
been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, how much more will these
na'ural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree . . .
"Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy
because of their disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order
that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy. For God has con
signed all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all (Romans 1 1)-
Are you interested in knowing the God of all nations, races and peoples?
The Jewish Bible says of Jesus Christ, "There is salvation in no one else, for
there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be
saved." To call on Jesus Christ is to discover the truth, in personal experience,
to your complete satisfaction.

to be who he is, and to do what he has said he would do, whether men are
with him or not. Proclaiming the Good News of God's love the Apostle Paul
writes, "I am not ashamed of the Gospel; it is the power of God for salvation
to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in the
Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written.
The just shall live by faith' " (Romans 1:1 6-171.
What the living God of Israel seeks is the trust, faith and personal com
mitment of the individual heart above all else. The book of Hebrews records,
Without faith it is impossible to please God. He who comes to God must
believe that he exists and that he rewords those who diligently seek hem."
The New Testament reminds the non-Jew thot his faith and access to
God springs from the roots of a Jewish tree into which the non-Jew is a grafted
branch:
". . . But if some of the branches were broken off, and you Gentiles, a
wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive
tree, do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that is not you
that support the root, but the root that supports you. You will say, Branches
were broken off that I might be grafted in,' That is true. They were broken off
because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through faith , . .
And even the Jews, if they do not persist in their unbelief will be
grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you have
been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, how much more will these
na'ural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree . . .
"Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy
because of their disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order
that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy. For God has con
signed all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all (Romans 1 1)-

The Jewish Bible says of Jesus Christ, "There is salvation in no one else, for
there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be
saved." To call on Jesus Christ is to discover the truth, in personal experience,
to your complete satisfaction.

Great confusion exists today in religious circles concerning the relation
ships between the people of Israel, God's chosen and favored nation; and the
present-age people of God, the church of Jesus Christ—those called "Chris
tians." In spite of human ignorance or disbelief, the one true God continues
to be who he is, and to do what he has said he would do, whether men are
with him or not. Proclaiming the Good News of God's love the Apostle Paul
