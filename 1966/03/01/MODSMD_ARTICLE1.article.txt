• Vietnam Funding Vote Today
WASHINGTON—The House votes today on
President Johnson's $4.8 billion Vietnam mon
ey bill, with Speaker John W. McCormaek
predicting approval.
Final action on the authorization measure
in the senate will come by the end of the
week, says Democratic leader Mike Mans
field. And he adds that he looks for passage
by a wide margin.
Mansfield and McCormaek issued their
predictions after a White House meeting.
The Montana senator said, "Our soldiers
in Vietnam are turning in one of the greatest
performances in our nation's history, and we
are not going to let them down.
"We hope to bring the military defense sup
plement authorization to a vote this week,"
Mansfield said, "and I anticipate we will pass
it by a very wide margin."
McCormack said once the money authoriza
tion bill is passed he is confident the House
Appropriations Committee will act rapidly
on the actual appropriation bills for military
and economic purposes in Vietnam,
• 4 Viet Debate Helps Enemy'
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Senator Stuart Sy
mington, D-Mo., said yesterday the Sen

ate's debate about U. S. policy in Southeast
Asia has become a filibuster that "can only
increase casualties" in Vietnam.
"It can't help anything on earth except our
enemies," said Senator Russell of Georgia,
who has captained southern senators in word
wars aimed at civil rights legislation.
Sen. Ross Bass, D-Tenn., suggested the sen
ate vote to shut off the debate on a $4.8-billion
war spending bill, now in its ninth day. And
Russell, arch foe of the cloture route in civil
rights battles, said he might support such a
move.
But senate Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field of Montana, calling for passage of the
Emergency Authorization Bill, ruled out any
move to halt debate with a cloture petition.
The money would go for weapons and other
military needs during the remainder of this
fiscal year.
"Don't leave young men . . . without the
resources to defend themselves," said Rus
sell.
• Wilson Calls For Election
LONDON—The Prime Minister disclosed
tonight that he had written the Queen two
weeks ago requesting a dissolution of Par
liament.
Asked why he had called an election now,

Wilson replied "I think the country wants a
government able to do the job of governing.
I don't think anyone thought we could have
lasted as long as we have. Now this is our
make-or-break year, and we cannot be put in
the position of holding up essential legisla
tion."
Asked what margin of victory he wanted,
he said "It ought to be bigger than three —
whichever party is elected—in order to have
decisive government."
• CORE To Change Focus
NEW YORK (AP) — James Farmer, the
tall, beefy symbol of nonviolent civil rights
protest, steps down from his job as National
Director of the Congress of Racial Equality
tomorrow, marking the end of an era for
CORE.
Both Farmer and his successor, a wily

North Carolina lawyer named Floyd McKis
sick, say that the "old" CORE of picket lines,
protest parades and fiery speeches about
"Freedom Now" is being de-emphasized.
"We are now in phase two," says McKissick,
"The dramatic action we used before is not
as dramatic today . . . our sights have got to
be set on the economic structure ... it will
take a much more sophisticated approach."
As Farmer himself notes in his new book,
"Freedom—When?" CORE must turn "in
ward toward the heart of the Ghetto, where
ultimately the strength of our people must
lie."
CORE would move, Farmer said, from di
rect action into the political arena by en
dorsing candidates and running Negroes for
office; into the economic area by setting up
cooperatives; into the urban slums of the
north with community centers, voter educa
tion programs and sophisticated political
tactics.
• Astronauts Killed In Jet Crash
ST. LOUIS, Mo.—U. S. astronauts Elliott
See Jr. and Charles A. Bassettii, the primary
crew for the planned Gemini 9 space flight
were killed yesterday when their jet plane

crashed into the building housing their space
capsule.
The backup crew for the flight scheduled
this summer, Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas P.
Stafford and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Eugene A. Cer
nan, were named last night to replace See and
Bassett.
The accident will have no impact on the
Gemini 8 flight and "hopefuhy it will have no
effect on the Gemini 9 flight," said Paul Ha
ney, the Manned Space Center's public rela
tions director who arrived here this after
noon from Houston.
Haney said it was not known if the plane,
also a T3B, developed engine trouble before
the crash. He said it would be six to eight
weeks before the cause of the crash would
be learned.
"We don't know yet if See, the pilot, ra
dioed a mayday call," Haney said, adding that
there apparently was no attempt by See or
Bassett to eject themselves from the plane.
He said the crash occurred after See ad
vised Stafford, piloting the other plane, that
he was going to try an instrument landing.
Haney said that was the last Stafford heard
from See before swerving away to permit
See's landing.

• 4 Viet Debate Helps Enemy'
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Senator Stuart Sy
mington, D-Mo., said yesterday the Sen

ate's debate about U. S. policy in Southeast
Asia has become a filibuster that "can only
increase casualties" in Vietnam.
"It can't help anything on earth except our
enemies," said Senator Russell of Georgia,
who has captained southern senators in word
wars aimed at civil rights legislation.
Sen. Ross Bass, D-Tenn., suggested the sen
ate vote to shut off the debate on a $4.8-billion
war spending bill, now in its ninth day. And
Russell, arch foe of the cloture route in civil
rights battles, said he might support such a
move.
But senate Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field of Montana, calling for passage of the
Emergency Authorization Bill, ruled out any
move to halt debate with a cloture petition.
The money would go for weapons and other
military needs during the remainder of this
fiscal year.
"Don't leave young men . . . without the
resources to defend themselves," said Rus

• Wilson Calls For Election
LONDON—The Prime Minister disclosed
tonight that he had written the Queen two
weeks ago requesting a dissolution of Par
liament.
Asked why he had called an election now,

Wilson replied "I think the country wants a
government able to do the job of governing.
I don't think anyone thought we could have
lasted as long as we have. Now this is our
make-or-break year, and we cannot be put in
the position of holding up essential legisla
tion."
Asked what margin of victory he wanted,
he said "It ought to be bigger than three —
whichever party is elected—in order to have
decisive government."
• CORE To Change Focus
NEW YORK (AP) — James Farmer, the
tall, beefy symbol of nonviolent civil rights
protest, steps down from his job as National
Director of the Congress of Racial Equality
tomorrow, marking the end of an era for
CORE.
Both Farmer and his successor, a wily

North Carolina lawyer named Floyd McKis
sick, say that the "old" CORE of picket lines,
protest parades and fiery speeches about
"Freedom Now" is being de-emphasized.
"We are now in phase two," says McKissick,
"The dramatic action we used before is not
as dramatic today . . . our sights have got to
be set on the economic structure ... it will
take a much more sophisticated approach."
As Farmer himself notes in his new book,
"Freedom—When?" CORE must turn "in
ward toward the heart of the Ghetto, where
ultimately the strength of our people must
lie."
CORE would move, Farmer said, from di
rect action into the political arena by en
dorsing candidates and running Negroes for
office; into the economic area by setting up
cooperatives; into the urban slums of the
north with community centers, voter educa
tion programs and sophisticated political
tactics.
• Astronauts Killed In Jet Crash
ST. LOUIS, Mo.—U. S. astronauts Elliott
See Jr. and Charles A. Bassettii, the primary
crew for the planned Gemini 9 space flight
were killed yesterday when their jet plane

crashed into the building housing their space
capsule.
The backup crew for the flight scheduled
this summer, Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas P.
Stafford and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Eugene A. Cer
nan, were named last night to replace See and
Bassett.
The accident will have no impact on the
Gemini 8 flight and "hopefuhy it will have no
effect on the Gemini 9 flight," said Paul Ha
ney, the Manned Space Center's public rela
tions director who arrived here this after
noon from Houston.
Haney said it was not known if the plane,
also a T3B, developed engine trouble before
the crash. He said it would be six to eight
weeks before the cause of the crash would
be learned.
"We don't know yet if See, the pilot, ra
dioed a mayday call," Haney said, adding that
there apparently was no attempt by See or
Bassett to eject themselves from the plane.
He said the crash occurred after See ad
vised Stafford, piloting the other plane, that
he was going to try an instrument landing.
Haney said that was the last Stafford heard
from See before swerving away to permit
See's landing.

mington, D-Mo., said yesterday the Sen

ate's debate about U. S. policy in Southeast
Asia has become a filibuster that "can only
increase casualties" in Vietnam.
"It can't help anything on earth except our
enemies," said Senator Russell of Georgia,
who has captained southern senators in word
wars aimed at civil rights legislation.
Sen. Ross Bass, D-Tenn., suggested the sen
ate vote to shut off the debate on a $4.8-billion
war spending bill, now in its ninth day. And
Russell, arch foe of the cloture route in civil
rights battles, said he might support such a
move.
But senate Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field of Montana, calling for passage of the
Emergency Authorization Bill, ruled out any
move to halt debate with a cloture petition.
The money would go for weapons and other
military needs during the remainder of this
fiscal year.
"Don't leave young men . . . without the
resources to defend themselves," said Rus
sell.
• Wilson Calls For Election
LONDON—The Prime Minister disclosed
tonight that he had written the Queen two
weeks ago requesting a dissolution of Par
liament.
Asked why he had called an election now,

Wilson replied "I think the country wants a
government able to do the job of governing.
I don't think anyone thought we could have
lasted as long as we have. Now this is our
make-or-break year, and we cannot be put in
the position of holding up essential legisla
tion."
Asked what margin of victory he wanted,
he said "It ought to be bigger than three —
whichever party is elected—in order to have
decisive government."
• CORE To Change Focus
NEW YORK (AP) — James Farmer, the
tall, beefy symbol of nonviolent civil rights
protest, steps down from his job as National
Director of the Congress of Racial Equality
tomorrow, marking the end of an era for
CORE.
Both Farmer and his successor, a wily

North Carolina lawyer named Floyd McKis
sick, say that the "old" CORE of picket lines,
protest parades and fiery speeches about
"Freedom Now" is being de-emphasized.
"We are now in phase two," says McKissick,
"The dramatic action we used before is not
as dramatic today . . . our sights have got to
be set on the economic structure ... it will
take a much more sophisticated approach."
As Farmer himself notes in his new book,
"Freedom—When?" CORE must turn "in
ward toward the heart of the Ghetto, where
ultimately the strength of our people must
lie."
CORE would move, Farmer said, from di
rect action into the political arena by en
dorsing candidates and running Negroes for
office; into the economic area by setting up
cooperatives; into the urban slums of the
north with community centers, voter educa
tion programs and sophisticated political
tactics.
• Astronauts Killed In Jet Crash
ST. LOUIS, Mo.—U. S. astronauts Elliott
See Jr. and Charles A. Bassettii, the primary
crew for the planned Gemini 9 space flight
were killed yesterday when their jet plane

crashed into the building housing their space
capsule.
The backup crew for the flight scheduled
this summer, Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas P.
Stafford and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Eugene A. Cer
nan, were named last night to replace See and
Bassett.
The accident will have no impact on the
Gemini 8 flight and "hopefuhy it will have no
effect on the Gemini 9 flight," said Paul Ha
ney, the Manned Space Center's public rela
tions director who arrived here this after
noon from Houston.
Haney said it was not known if the plane,
also a T3B, developed engine trouble before
the crash. He said it would be six to eight
weeks before the cause of the crash would
be learned.
"We don't know yet if See, the pilot, ra
dioed a mayday call," Haney said, adding that
there apparently was no attempt by See or
Bassett to eject themselves from the plane.
He said the crash occurred after See ad
vised Stafford, piloting the other plane, that
he was going to try an instrument landing.
Haney said that was the last Stafford heard
from See before swerving away to permit
See's landing.
• Vietnam Funding Vote Today
WASHINGTON—The House votes today on
President Johnson's $4.8 billion Vietnam mon
ey bill, with Speaker John W. McCormaek
predicting approval.
Final action on the authorization measure
in the senate will come by the end of the
week, says Democratic leader Mike Mans
field. And he adds that he looks for passage
by a wide margin.
Mansfield and McCormaek issued their
predictions after a White House meeting.
The Montana senator said, "Our soldiers
in Vietnam are turning in one of the greatest
performances in our nation's history, and we
are not going to let them down.
"We hope to bring the military defense sup
plement authorization to a vote this week,"
Mansfield said, "and I anticipate we will pass
it by a very wide margin."
McCormack said once the money authoriza
tion bill is passed he is confident the House
Appropriations Committee will act rapidly
on the actual appropriation bills for military
and economic purposes in Vietnam,
