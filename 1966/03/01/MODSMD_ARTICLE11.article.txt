# New Per/Se Magazine Features Drink Rules
## 
### 
Per/Se, a new magazine at
tempting to fill the gap between
the scholarly journal and the
mass magazine, is making its
debut today at the Stanford Uni
versity Press.
Featured article in the first
issue of the new magazine is a
study of the effects of restric
tive drinking rules on college
campuses. The author of the
article, Dr. Robert Russell,
Assoc. Prof, of Health Educa
tion at Southern Illinois Univer
sity, concludes that restrictive
drinking rules tend to encourage
much of the intemperance and
drunken driving observed among
students today.
Dr. Russell stated that most
students hold drinking rules in
contempt because they "symbo
lize the motherish protection of
juveniles." Such rules should
be abolished to create a climate
of individual responsibility, he
said.
In his appeal for new rules he
cited the Free Speech Move
ment at Berkeley as an example
of typical administrative and
parental response: "Students are
not entitled to do anything but
learn quietly, and if they think
otherwise 'Get rid of them.' "
"In America today," Dr. Rus
sell said, "we see a dynamic,
vacillating amalgam of the rev
olutionary spirit that created
this nation and the stable spirit
of 'Those in power know best.'
This conflict finds a focus in
the college drinking issue. The
power to change the rules lies
with adults, who for various
reasons see no need to change
them. And students who want
rule changes have no direct
power to act."

zoneri, science writer Samuel
Moffat, linguistics director Gor
don Lish, columnist Bill Shands
