# Heffner Cites Need For Information

America needs "an informed
citizenry who are not beguiled
by every engineering triumph
announced in the press and who
will not unquestionably accept
each one as an unmixed bless
ing," said Prof. Hubert Heffner,
associate provost for research.
Dr. Heffner, speaking before
the 1966 Stanford Conference in
Los Angeles on Sunday, said
familiarity has worn away the
people's sense of wonder, and
created a disregard for the side
effects of technical innovation.
Heffner cited detergents, high
ways, and proposed dome-cov
ered cities as examples, but
warned that computers probably
represent the greatest challenge.
"The computer's eventual effect
on society will be no less than
the last two major changes, the
invention on the printing press
arising from invention of power
driven machinery.
