# Newsmen Form Advisory Board
## 
### 
A 16-member board of inter
nationally known editors, pub
lishers, and communications
executives has been established
to serve as an advisory commit
tee to Stanford's new graduate
fellowship program for journal
ists, according to Prof. Clifford
Weigle, executive head of the
Department of Communications.
Included in the list of jour
nalists are Otis Chandler, pub
lisher of the Los Angeles Times,
William F. Knowland, editor and
publisher of the Oakland Trib
une, and Turner Catledge, exec
utive editor of the New York
Times.
Herbert Brucker, noted Amer
ican author and former editor of
the Hartford CÂ»urant, has been
appointed director of the fellow
ship, which is supported by
more than $900,000 from the
Ford Foundation.
The graduate program serves
a two-fold purpose: to give
working newsmen in press, ra
dio and television an opportuni
ty to enhance their knowledge
in special fields during a four
to six-week campus sojourn, and
to encourage recent college
graduates to proceed toward a
master's degree in communica
tion.
