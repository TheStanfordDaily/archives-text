# Green Beret Hero Calls Viet War 'A Lie'
## 
### 
An American hero of the war
in Vietnam, the first enlisted
man to be nominated for the Le
gion of Merit and the soldier
selected last July to brief Secre
tary of Defense McNamara on
the operations of our Special
Forces, charges our men are
dying for "a lie" in an article
in the February issue of Ram
parts.
Master Sergeant Donald
Duncan, who turned down a
commission and captaincy and
left the army after 10 years of
service, tells in an article "The
Whole Thing Was A Lie" of his
evolution from "militant anti
communist" to the discovery
that "it's not democracy we

brought to Vietnam—it's anti
communism."
Found Truths
"It had taken a long time and
a mountain of evidence but I had
finally found some truths," Dun
can writes. "The world is not
just good guys and bad guys.
Anti-communism is a lousy sub
stitute for democracy. I know
now that there are many types
of communism but there are
none that appeal to me. In the
long run, I don't think Vietnam
will be better off under Ho's
brand of communism. But it's
not for me or my government to
decide. That decision is for the
Vietnamese."
In a final memorial to his

fallen comrades, written while
still in service for an army pub
lication, Duncan declares: "We
can best immortalize our fallen
members by striving for an en
lightened future where Man has
found another solution to his
problems than resorting to the
futility and stupidity of war."
Letter of Commendation
The magazine reproduces the
letter of commendation sent
Duncan on 22 July 1965 by his
commanding officer, Col. Wil
liam A. McKean, following his
briefing of McNamara: "The
salient points which you so apt
ly presented to the Secretary of
Defense may have significant
results on future support of Spe
cial Forces in the Republic of
Vietnam. You are to be con
gratulated on a job well done."
Some of the highlights of Dun
can's revelations include:
American Special Forces are
taught techniques of torture.
("When we asked directly if we
were being told to use these
methods the answer was, "We
can't tell you that. The Mothers
of America wouldn't approve.'
This sarcastic hypocrisy was
greeted with laughs.") "I was
later to witness first hand the
practice of turning prisoners
over to ARVN (Army of the Re
public of Vietnam) for 'interro
gation' and the atrocities which
ensued."
In North Vietnam
Special Operations Group,
composed of CIA, Air Force,
Navy, Army and Special Forces

personnel, is operating inside of
North Vietnam.
"The real question was,
whether communism is spread
ing in spite of our involvement
or because of it."
A good percentage of Special
Forces men were Lodge Act peo
ple—men who came out of the
Iron Curtain countries. Their
anti-communism bordered on
fanaticism. When "things" did
not happen fast enough to satis
fy them, many resigned and
showed up later in Africa or La
tin America "in the employ of
others or as independent agents
for the CIA."
Special Forces trainees were
told, about prisoners: "You don't
have to kill them yourself—let
your indigenous counterpart do
that."
Racial Discrimination
Racial discrimination was ram
pant in the Special Forces, from
the former Latvian who was not
interested in Vietnam ("I
wouldn't blend. There are not
many blue-eyed gooks"), to the
captain who instructed Duncan:
"Don't send me any niggers. Be
careful, however, not to give the
impression that we are preju
diced in Special Forces . . ." In
the larger Vietnam towns, "Ne
groes do not go into white bars
except at the risk of being
ejected."
Resentment of Americans by
South Vietnamese "runs all the
way from stiff politeness to ob
vious hatred. It is so common
that if a Vietnamese working

with or for Americans is found
to be sincerely cooperative, en
ergetic, conscientious, and hon
est, it automatically makes him
suspect as a Viet Cong agent."
Vietnamese soldiers were sent
into Laos on a secret mission,
without the Americans who had
trained them and trained with
them, because "it was an elec
tion year and it would cause
great embarrassment if Ameri
cans were captured in Laos."
("This," says Duncan, "was the
one thing, if I had to single one
out, that made me really start
questioning our role in Viet
nam.")
Cong Primarily Southern
This mission into Laos, from
which only 6 out of 40 men re
turned, confirmed "that the Viet
Cong were getting the bulk of
their weapons from ARVN and
by sea. It was also one more
piece of evidence that the Viet
Cong were primarily South
Vietnamese, not imported troops
from the North. One more thing
was added to my growing lists
of doubts of the 'official'
stories . . .
"When teaching Special Forces
how to set up guerrilla warfare
in an enemy country, killing un
popular officials is pointed out
as one method of gaining friends
among the populace. It is rec
ommended that special assassi
nation teams to be set up for
this purpose. I know of a couple
of cases where it was suggested

by Special Forces officers that
Viet Cong prisoners be killed.
"Communist or not, the vast
majority of the people were pro-
Viet Cong and anti-Saigon. I had
to accept aliso that the position,
'We are in Vietnam because we
are in sympathy with the aspi
rations and desires of the Viet
namese people,' was a lie."
Viet Cong Dedicated
While we view the Vietnamese
on our side as "cowardly" and
unable to accept discipline, our
officers describe the Viet Cong
as "dedicated," "tough," "dis
ciplined," "well-trained" and
"brave."
In conclusion the much-deco
rated Duncan says that he has
no criticism of young American
anti-war demonstrators: "On the
contrary. I am relieved. I think
they should be commended . . .
They are opposed to people, our
own and others, dying for a lie,
thereby corrupting the very
word democracy."
