# Vintage Editions Draw Dust, Scents
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER News Editor 
It was a curious collection of
books assembled in the main li
brary lobby yesterday in the pe
riodic sale of "no longer usable"
items.
For a quarter the alert buyer
could pick up a copy of Buddy
in Dragon Swamp or Thorne
Smith's l-aze Bear Lane — Illus
trated. A hardbound edition of
Sky Fighters of France sold for
$2.00, and the complete set of
the Book of Knowledge of 1911
also was available.
Retardation Research
Paperbacks and pamphlets
sold for a dime, and included
such titles as Natural School
Fallout Shelter Design and
Role of the Residential Institu
tion in Mental Retardation Re
search.
Up to a hundred students and
professors gathered at a time,
hovering over carts of dusty,
mildew-scented relics. Most pur
chases totaled under a dollar.
"You mean these things have
been in the stacks?" one stu
dent asked the check-out clerk.
Some of the items, according
to Charles Gorhan of the Gift
Division, actually were in the
stacks. Most came as "gifts"
from families in the Palo Alto
area.
"Often a householder will tell
us to pick up a box-load of
books to be used to the library's
advantage," Gorhan explained.
"Some items we can use; others
are put on sale."
Gorhan said other books do,
indeed, come from the stacks.
These include materials no long
er in demand or which have suf
ficient duplicates.
Augment Purchases
Money earned on the sale is
covert ed to new book pur
chases, Gorhan said. He noted
that considerable care is taken
that rare books and special gifts
are not mistakenly discarded.
Faculty advisers from various
departments are called in to ap
praise subject-matter of old
editions.
While most of the books sold
are of strange and bizzare titles,
many arc used by students and
professors for historical back
ground on various projects. A

student in Communication
quickly grabbed a publication on
television copyrighted 1939.
"Half my research paper is right
here," he said.
Gorhan told of a book on Ni
nevah which some student
proudly purchased. "The boy
said he had been looking for
that particular title for over five
years," said Gorhan. "Actually,
the book was so beat up I had
originally hesitated even putting
it out on the stands."
No particular date is set for
the sales, and Gorhan explains
one is called "whenever the
stock room gets filled up." As
one student described the sale:
"It sure beats browsing at the
bookstore!"

For a quarter the alert buyer
could pick up a copy of Buddy

trated. A hardbound edition of
Sky Fighters of France sold for
$2.00, and the complete set of
the Book of Knowledge of 1911
also was available.
Retardation Research
Paperbacks and pamphlets
sold for a dime, and included
such titles as Natural School
Fallout Shelter Design and
Role of the Residential Institu
tion in Mental Retardation Re
search.
Up to a hundred students and
professors gathered at a time,
hovering over carts of dusty,
mildew-scented relics. Most pur
chases totaled under a dollar.
"You mean these things have
been in the stacks?" one stu
dent asked the check-out clerk.
Some of the items, according
to Charles Gorhan of the Gift
Division, actually were in the
stacks. Most came as "gifts"
from families in the Palo Alto
area.
"Often a householder will tell
us to pick up a box-load of
books to be used to the library's
advantage," Gorhan explained.
"Some items we can use; others
are put on sale."
Gorhan said other books do,
indeed, come from the stacks.
These include materials no long
er in demand or which have suf
ficient duplicates.
Augment Purchases
Money earned on the sale is
covert ed to new book pur
chases, Gorhan said. He noted
that considerable care is taken
that rare books and special gifts
are not mistakenly discarded.
Faculty advisers from various
departments are called in to ap
praise subject-matter of old
editions.
While most of the books sold
are of strange and bizzare titles,
many arc used by students and
professors for historical back
ground on various projects. A

student in Communication
quickly grabbed a publication on
television copyrighted 1939.
"Half my research paper is right
here," he said.
Gorhan told of a book on Ni
nevah which some student
proudly purchased. "The boy
said he had been looking for
that particular title for over five
years," said Gorhan. "Actually,
the book was so beat up I had
originally hesitated even putting
it out on the stands."
No particular date is set for
the sales, and Gorhan explains
one is called "whenever the
stock room gets filled up." As
one student described the sale:
"It sure beats browsing at the
bookstore!"
It was a curious collection of
books assembled in the main li
brary lobby yesterday in the pe
riodic sale of "no longer usable"
items.
