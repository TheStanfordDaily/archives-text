The best way to meet the
people of a country and learn
their language fluently, as all
students know, is to live and
work in that country.

to ASSU Travel director Row
Hollitz, has now made this pos
sible in Switzerland and Ger

program upon arrival which in
cludes lectures, briefings, and an
introductory tour of the area.

ognized college, and must be
