# SHARP COMMUNICATION
## Drama Director Analyzes Art 
### 
"Art is by far the most satis
fying way of realizing you are
not alone, that someone else
sees what you see in the same
way, because art can't talk
back," a Stanford drama direc
tor said Sunday in Los Angeles.
In remarks prepared for the
1966 Stanford Conference in Los
Angeles, Visiting Prof. William
Sharp of the Department of
Speech and Drama said:
"Plays, poems, pictures and
symphonies share this unique
quality: they speak to us . , .
make their point—or perhaps
miss it, and then they shut up.
They don't go on to destroy
whatever communication has
taken place."
Personal Communication
A director in the Stanford
Repertory Theater, Sharp add
ed: "My own communication
with other people has convinced
me that any kind of real com
munication is extremely diffi
cult. One of the joys of art is
that if it speaks to you, it speaks
to you finally, surely, and with
out further explanation ....
"Our life is a pastiche of sen
timental comedies, farces, trag
edies, and third-rate melo
dramas. One remembers the
times that a friend in all inno
cence says just the wrong thing
at just the wrong time with
just the wrong inflection, and as
a consequence the most innocent
of remarks becomes a barb, a
slap in the face, a betrayal.
"Though we may see immedi
ately the foolishness of our re

action, it is nevertheless a real
one. Examined rationally, it is
pure melodrama, but that makes
it no less real. We are after all
surprisingly irrational people. . .
Alienation
"Inside of ourselves, we are a
lonely, unsure little bundle of
worries and desires—many of
which we are ashamed, many of
which we deny or hide, for fear
they will only alienate us from
the rest of society and from
our (we hope) friends . . .
"We can't stand much of our
individuality, our real independ
ence, because there is always
the possibility that we might
really have to stand alone, un
buoyed by friends, cars, or
houses. This kind of loneliness
terrifies us.
Tacit Agreement
"And so we nod our heads in

agreement to ideas we haven't
even considered closely enough
to know whether or not we
really agree, in hopes that agree
ment will cover our ignorance,
will suggest a connection with
the person we agree with that
seems at least to take us out of
our single lonely state.
In good drama or other art
forms, Sharp continued, "In a
very personal and immediate
way I become connected not to
a set of words or a class, but to
a human attitude I recognize
not only as someone else's but
as my own.
"I become at least momentar
ily convinced that I am not
alone, that certain of my deepest
feelings need not be cut out be
cause they are diseased unlike
anyone else's. Happily, they ex
ist in others."
