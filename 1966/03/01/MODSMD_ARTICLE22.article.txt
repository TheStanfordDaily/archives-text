# Gelber Gives Concerts
## 
### 
Bruno Leonardo Gelber, 24-
year-old Argentinian pianist now
on his third triumphant tour of
Europe, will perform his first
American concerts this July dur
ing the 1966 Stanford Summer
Festival of the Arts.
The announcement of the en
gagement was made at Stanford
and at Paris, France, recently
by Festival Director Virgil K.
Whitaker and Mme M. A. Corre
de Valmalet, Gelber's interna
tional manager.
Gelber will appear first as
and the Suisse Romande Orches
tra in one of its 10 festival con
certs (June 22-July 5).
He will also present a solo re
cital at 8 p.m. July 9 in Memor
ial Auditorium on the campus.
The famous Swiss orchestra
will initiate the seven-week arts
festival. The 1966 theme is "20th
Century Innovations." Music
drama, art and architecture dis
plays and films of that era wiil
be coordinated with special sum
mer classes in the University's
humanities departments.

Following his American debut
at Stanford, Gelber may embark
on a brief "first tour" of Ameri
ca. Details are under discussion
now. Special arrangements to
import the young artist were
completed by Stephen Baffrey,
the Stanford festival's produc
ing manager, in Europe last fall.
"We are pleased at the chance
to bring Mr. Gelber here at a
time when other American man
agements are just beginning to
clamor for him," Baffrey said.
"In Europe his name evokes
sighs of wonder and amazement
and cheers of praise."
At Stanford Gelber will per
form works of the classical rep
ertory as well as that of the fes
tival theme period. According to
Baffrey, "as a rising young
artist, Mr. Gelber has not yet
been associated with any partic
ular musical movement. We
have suggested that he play
selections from his varied reper
tory both within and beyond our
operating theme."
