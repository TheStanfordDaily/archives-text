## Stanford Skiers Go Informal Last Bout 
### Art Rosenzweig 
"We're not a team in the
formal sense of the word—we're
kind of hangloose and informal,"
admitted George Peters, captain
and unofficial manager-coach of
Stanford's ski team. "It's a small
group—ten men, five women. We
compete because we like the
sport.
"Most of the other schools we
meet are dead serious about ski
ing. They're generally smaller
schools from the north. Skiing
to them is as football to us.
"The competition is really

tough. The other skiers are
usually intent on going into na
tional or even Olympic competi
tion. They train once or twice a
week all winter long.
"We don't have the money or
time to train as often as we'd
like. Stanford's so damn far
from snow, it takes a lot of time
just getting there and back.
When we train, we've got to take
the whole weekend. A Stanford
student just can't do that too
often. We'd like to, but studies
come first.

"Most of the other teams are
supported by their respective ath
letic departments. They've got
good coaches, lodging, transpor
tation and whatever else they
need It's hard to compete with
that.
"Stanford's squad is sponsored
by the Stanford Ski Club and
the squad's own members. We
use Stanford's newly rented
lodge, but everything else we
provide.
No Coach
"We don't even have a coach.
That hurts. The other schools
kind of frown on us because it's
harder for us to get organized
properly. We can't always get
the list of entries in on time, and
there are always some events we
can't participate in.
"We'd like to get some help
from the Athletic Department. If
we can show them what we've
been doing and that there is
enough interest in it, we might
be able to put skiing on a par
with sports like cross country
and soccer at Stanford."
Peters, now a graduate student
in German, finished undergrad
work last quarter and is no long
er eligible to compete. He has
stayed on in an advisory and
'administrative capacity and is
trying to stimulate interest in
his squad.
"When we do train it's not
strenuous. It's mainly a change
for the skiers to get an idea of
what they're in for. Training ses
sions have fair attendance, again
because of lack of time."
There are ten men and five
women who have been on the
team this year. "The girls are
good," said Peters. "Most of the
other schools don't emphasize
their female skiers."
Most of the meets are in north
ern California — Squaw Valley,
Sugar bowl, the lodge, etc. This
year the skiers traveled to Bend,
Oregon to open their season.
"That's the farthest away a Stan
ford ski team has ever gone."
Fair Success
The team has done well this
year, considering the unavoid
able organizational and transpor
tational difficulties. In the first
meet at Oregon they placed fifth
out of twelve schools competing.
At the Northern California
Collegiate Invitational they beat
Cal and San Jose. The University
of Nevada Winter Carnival saw
Stanford's women take third out
of seven schools.
The meets include both Nordic
and Alpine events. The Nordics
consist of jumping and a gruel
ing cross-country race, which re
quires a great deal of training.
Alpine events are the down
hill, a long, fast race which tests
speed as opposed to skill, and the
slalom, which requires weaving
around bamboo gates and poles.
"We've got a good Alpine team,"
Peters boasted.
Forming the nucleus of Stan
ford's squad this year are Dana
More, Steve Anderson, Dick
Drace, Allen Rubenstein, John
Kleeman, Collen Matthews, and
Carl Aune.
The female skiers include Lee
Kimball, Judy Fischer and Char
lotte Farber.
Skiing is a rugged sport, but
Stanford's ski team remains a
relaxed and informal group.
Meets and training sessions are
followed by socializing, includ
ing beer.
"Just to show you how hang
loose we are," Peters said, "at
the last meet, the Nevada Winter
Carnival, the competition was
followed by a formal banquet
and dance. Stanford's skiers
showed up in jeans and jerseys."

season tonight in the Navy Col

meet will be held at Mare Island

More, Steve Anderson, Dick
Drace, Allen Rubenstein, John
Kleeman, Collen Matthews, and
Carl Aune.
The female skiers include Lee
Kimball, Judy Fischer and Char
lotte Farber.
Skiing is a rugged sport, but
Stanford's ski team remains a
relaxed and informal group.
Meets and training sessions are
followed by socializing, includ
ing beer.
"Just to show you how hang
loose we are," Peters said, "at
the last meet, the Nevada Winter
Carnival, the competition was
followed by a formal banquet
and dance. Stanford's skiers
showed up in jeans and jerseys."


STANFORD'S VARSITY BOX
ING Team will wind up its 1966
season tonight in the Navy Col
legiate Boxing: Festival. The
meet will be held at Mare Island
N aval Base at 7:30 this evening.
"We're not a team in the
formal sense of the word—we're
kind of hangloose and informal,"
admitted George Peters, captain
and unofficial manager-coach of
Stanford's ski team. "It's a small
group—ten men, five women. We
compete because we like the
sport.
"Most of the other schools we
meet are dead serious about ski
ing. They're generally smaller
schools from the north. Skiing
to them is as football to us.
"The competition is really

tough. The other skiers are
usually intent on going into na
tional or even Olympic competi
tion. They train once or twice a
week all winter long.
"We don't have the money or
time to train as often as we'd
like. Stanford's so damn far
from snow, it takes a lot of time
just getting there and back.
When we train, we've got to take
the whole weekend. A Stanford
student just can't do that too
often. We'd like to, but studies
come first.

"Most of the other teams are
supported by their respective ath
letic departments. They've got
good coaches, lodging, transpor
tation and whatever else they
need It's hard to compete with
that.
"Stanford's squad is sponsored
by the Stanford Ski Club and
the squad's own members. We
use Stanford's newly rented
lodge, but everything else we
provide.
No Coach
"We don't even have a coach.
That hurts. The other schools
kind of frown on us because it's
harder for us to get organized
properly. We can't always get
the list of entries in on time, and
there are always some events we
can't participate in.
"We'd like to get some help
from the Athletic Department. If
we can show them what we've
been doing and that there is
enough interest in it, we might
be able to put skiing on a par
with sports like cross country
and soccer at Stanford."
Peters, now a graduate student
in German, finished undergrad
work last quarter and is no long
er eligible to compete. He has
stayed on in an advisory and
'administrative capacity and is
trying to stimulate interest in
his squad.
"When we do train it's not
strenuous. It's mainly a change
for the skiers to get an idea of
what they're in for. Training ses
sions have fair attendance, again
because of lack of time."
There are ten men and five
women who have been on the
team this year. "The girls are
good," said Peters. "Most of the
other schools don't emphasize
their female skiers."
Most of the meets are in north
ern California — Squaw Valley,
Sugar bowl, the lodge, etc. This
year the skiers traveled to Bend,
Oregon to open their season.
"That's the farthest away a Stan
ford ski team has ever gone."
Fair Success
The team has done well this
year, considering the unavoid
able organizational and transpor
tational difficulties. In the first
meet at Oregon they placed fifth
out of twelve schools competing.
At the Northern California
Collegiate Invitational they beat
Cal and San Jose. The University
of Nevada Winter Carnival saw
Stanford's women take third out
of seven schools.
The meets include both Nordic
and Alpine events. The Nordics
consist of jumping and a gruel
ing cross-country race, which re
quires a great deal of training.
Alpine events are the down
hill, a long, fast race which tests
speed as opposed to skill, and the
slalom, which requires weaving
around bamboo gates and poles.
"We've got a good Alpine team,"
Peters boasted.

Fair Success
The team has done well this
year, considering the unavoid
able organizational and transpor
tational difficulties. In the first
meet at Oregon they placed fifth
out of twelve schools competing.
At the Northern California
Collegiate Invitational they beat
Cal and San Jose. The University
of Nevada Winter Carnival saw
Stanford's women take third out
of seven schools.
The meets include both Nordic
and Alpine events. The Nordics
consist of jumping and a gruel
ing cross-country race, which re
quires a great deal of training.
Alpine events are the down
hill, a long, fast race which tests
speed as opposed to skill, and the
slalom, which requires weaving
around bamboo gates and poles.
"We've got a good Alpine team,"
Peters boasted.
Forming the nucleus of Stan
ford's squad this year are Dana
More, Steve Anderson, Dick
Drace, Allen Rubenstein, John
Kleeman, Collen Matthews, and
Carl Aune.
The female skiers include Lee
Kimball, Judy Fischer and Char
lotte Farber.
Skiing is a rugged sport, but
Stanford's ski team remains a
relaxed and informal group.
Meets and training sessions are
followed by socializing, includ
ing beer.
"Just to show you how hang
loose we are," Peters said, "at
the last meet, the Nevada Winter
Carnival, the competition was
followed by a formal banquet
and dance. Stanford's skiers
showed up in jeans and jerseys."

"We're not a team in the
formal sense of the word—we're
kind of hangloose and informal,"
admitted George Peters, captain
and unofficial manager-coach of
Stanford's ski team. "It's a small
group—ten men, five women. We
compete because we like the
sport.
"Most of the other schools we
meet are dead serious about ski
ing. They're generally smaller
schools from the north. Skiing
to them is as football to us.
"The competition is really

tough. The other skiers are
usually intent on going into na
tional or even Olympic competi
tion. They train once or twice a
week all winter long.
"We don't have the money or
time to train as often as we'd
like. Stanford's so damn far
from snow, it takes a lot of time
just getting there and back.
When we train, we've got to take
the whole weekend. A Stanford
student just can't do that too
often. We'd like to, but studies
come first.

"Most of the other teams are
supported by their respective ath
letic departments. They've got
good coaches, lodging, transpor
tation and whatever else they
need It's hard to compete with
that.
"Stanford's squad is sponsored
by the Stanford Ski Club and
the squad's own members. We
use Stanford's newly rented
lodge, but everything else we
provide.
No Coach
"We don't even have a coach.
That hurts. The other schools
kind of frown on us because it's
harder for us to get organized
properly. We can't always get
the list of entries in on time, and
there are always some events we
can't participate in.
"We'd like to get some help
from the Athletic Department. If
we can show them what we've
been doing and that there is
enough interest in it, we might
be able to put skiing on a par
with sports like cross country
and soccer at Stanford."
Peters, now a graduate student
in German, finished undergrad
work last quarter and is no long
er eligible to compete. He has
stayed on in an advisory and
'administrative capacity and is
trying to stimulate interest in
his squad.
"When we do train it's not
strenuous. It's mainly a change
for the skiers to get an idea of
what they're in for. Training ses
sions have fair attendance, again
because of lack of time."
There are ten men and five
women who have been on the
team this year. "The girls are
good," said Peters. "Most of the
other schools don't emphasize
their female skiers."
Most of the meets are in north
ern California — Squaw Valley,
Sugar bowl, the lodge, etc. This
year the skiers traveled to Bend,
Oregon to open their season.
"That's the farthest away a Stan
ford ski team has ever gone."
