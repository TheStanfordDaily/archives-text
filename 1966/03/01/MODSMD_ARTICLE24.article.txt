Ocean Checkout
Following the segment of the
course on skin diving, the class
takes a field trip (usually on a
Sunday morning) to the Pacific.
There basic skills are tested and
the class introduced to the many
facets of ocean diving.
After the first ocean check
out, the class embarks on the
SCUBA — self contained under
water breathing apparatus —
portion of the course. Class
members undergo intensive
drills in the Encina Pools twice
a week under close supervision
of Aquatics Director Jim Gaugh
ran and several certified student
diving instructors.
Stanford owns some 15 tanks
and regulators. Students inter
ested in purchasing their own
SCUBA gear have access to spe
cial discounts ranging up to 40
per cent on wet suits, weights,
etc.
The course is supplemented
with lessons on diving physics,
oceanography, underwater biolo
gy, and diving maladies.
Guest Lecturers
Guest lecturers from the Cali
fornia Wildlife Service, the
Stanford Medical Center, a local
diving shop, and representatives
of several diving interests speak

with the group. In addition, the
class tours the Hopkins Marine
Research Laboratory.
At the end of the quarter, the
students have a second diving
checkout—this time with SCU
BA gear. There is a final exami
nation that treats all aspects of
the course, including application
of the Navy repeated dives
charts.
State of California SCUBA
certification is awarded upon
successful completion of the
course. This certificate is neces
sary in California to purchase
compressed air.
A $15 course fee covers use
of Stanford's tanks and the cost
of compressed air. In addition,
students must purchase snorkel,
fins, and mask.
A special physical examina
tion is given by the Health Serv
ice for students taking in the
course. The course requires that
the student pass several swim
ming tests, such as a 400 yard
swim under 8 minutes, 50 yard
swim carrying 10 pounds of
weight, and an underwater
