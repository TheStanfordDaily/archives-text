# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## In A Cashier's Office, No Nude Is A Good Nude 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have just finished reading
your editorial (Daily, Feb. 28)
condemning Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton and his ilk for
removing the nudes from the
Cashier's Office at Encina. As
an art student and a friend of
the artist, I felt not a little
guilty at not having voiced my
objection at the time of this
injustice. I feel, however, that
something must be said to pro
test, even if it is somewhat be
lated.
Reactionary actions such as
this of Mr. Houghton et al have
no place at a university, espe
cially one whose byword is sup
posedly "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." It would seem that the
nude in art is to be tolerated as
long as it is time tested—where
upon it can be spoon-fed to the
students in art history classes.
But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

gainly," if indeed they are. This
is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur
thermore, I do not find this
consistent with "Academic
Freedom" a term which has
been widely touted lately. I have
little hope that we can betake
our stodgy selves to return Mrs.
Raymond's paintings to the
Cashier's Office. But unless we
do the "Winds of Freedom" will
continue to reek with hypo
cracy.
RANDOLPH N. BONNER
. . . Cashing checks at Encina
is frankly not one of the high
points of my life, but I have
found, and I think I speak for
others, that the exhibits there
have made the long walk worth
while. Moreover, Mr. Jedd's at
tempts have been rather in keep
ing with an atmosphere that
purports to be educational and
appreciative of human en
deavors on many levels. Rather
than criticize, I would much pre
fer to hand him and Mr. Ken
neth D. Creighton my thanks
for taking the initiative.
MIKE PHILLIPS
. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.
KEITH BOYLE
Assistant Professor
of Painting
. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.
Associate Professor of Music
LELAND SMITH
... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer
sity services. Should any who
enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub
lic's attention!

• New Society
Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political
Science Department. Thank you.

Re: Mr. McGlothlin's letter
(The Daily, Feb. 28).
If one wants a good football
team, he normally picks the best
players available. Or if he should
want a great university, he
would supposedly select the
most highly skilled and crea
tive students who apply. And
perhaps if he should want a
prosperous business, he would
choose the people best qualified
to do the necessary jobs. But
Breakers Club imagines, at
least, that everyone can eat
equally well, and therefore any
one who wants to try his hand
at eating there, may.
DAVID I. BROWN
• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „
JACK MARIETTA

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.
MARC SAPIR
... Of course I'm sure Mr.
Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.

guilty at not having voiced my
objection at the time of this
injustice. I feel, however, that
something must be said to pro
test, even if it is somewhat be
lated.
Reactionary actions such as
this of Mr. Houghton et al have
no place at a university, espe
cially one whose byword is sup
posedly "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." It would seem that the
nude in art is to be tolerated as
long as it is time tested—where
upon it can be spoon-fed to the
students in art history classes.
But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

gainly," if indeed they are. This
is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur
thermore, I do not find this
consistent with "Academic
Freedom" a term which has
been widely touted lately. I have
little hope that we can betake
our stodgy selves to return Mrs.
Raymond's paintings to the
Cashier's Office. But unless we
do the "Winds of Freedom" will
continue to reek with hypo
cracy.

. . . Cashing checks at Encina
is frankly not one of the high
points of my life, but I have
found, and I think I speak for
others, that the exhibits there
have made the long walk worth
while. Moreover, Mr. Jedd's at
tempts have been rather in keep

purports to be educational and
appreciative of human en
deavors on many levels. Rather
than criticize, I would much pre
fer to hand him and Mr. Ken
neth D. Creighton my thanks
for taking the initiative.
MIKE PHILLIPS
. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.
KEITH BOYLE
Assistant Professor

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.

... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer

enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub

Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political

If one wants a good football

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.

Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.

But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur
thermore, I do not find this
consistent with "Academic
Freedom" a term which has
been widely touted lately. I have
little hope that we can betake

. . . Cashing checks at Encina
is frankly not one of the high
points of my life, but I have
found, and I think I speak for
others, that the exhibits there
have made the long walk worth
while. Moreover, Mr. Jedd's at
tempts have been rather in keep
ing with an atmosphere that
purports to be educational and
appreciative of human en
deavors on many levels. Rather
than criticize, I would much pre
fer to hand him and Mr. Ken
neth D. Creighton my thanks
for taking the initiative.
MIKE PHILLIPS
. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.
KEITH BOYLE
Assistant Professor

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.

... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer

enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub

Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political

If one wants a good football

perhaps if he should want a

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.

Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.

. . . Cashing checks at Encina
is frankly not one of the high
points of my life, but I have
found, and I think I speak for
others, that the exhibits there
have made the long walk worth
while. Moreover, Mr. Jedd's at

purports to be educational and
appreciative of human en
deavors on many levels. Rather
than criticize, I would much pre
fer to hand him and Mr. Ken

for taking the initiative.
MIKE PHILLIPS
. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.
KEITH BOYLE

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.

... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer

enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub

Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political

If one wants a good football

perhaps if he should want a

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.

Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.

Editor, The Daily:
I have just finished reading
your editorial (Daily, Feb. 28)
condemning Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton and his ilk for
removing the nudes from the
Cashier's Office at Encina. As
an art student and a friend of
the artist, I felt not a little
guilty at not having voiced my
objection at the time of this
injustice. I feel, however, that
something must be said to pro
test, even if it is somewhat be
lated.
Reactionary actions such as
this of Mr. Houghton et al have
no place at a university, espe
cially one whose byword is sup
posedly "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." It would seem that the
nude in art is to be tolerated as
long as it is time tested—where
upon it can be spoon-fed to the
students in art history classes.
But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

gainly," if indeed they are. This
is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur

. . . Cashing checks at Encina
is frankly not one of the high
points of my life, but I have

have made the long walk worth

purports to be educational and
appreciative of human en

for taking the initiative.
MIKE PHILLIPS
. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.

... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer

enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub

Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political

If one wants a good football

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.

... Of course I'm sure Mr.
Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.
GARY A. PATTON
Law School, '68
Editor, The Daily:
I have just finished reading
your editorial (Daily, Feb. 28)
condemning Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton and his ilk for
removing the nudes from the
Cashier's Office at Encina. As
an art student and a friend of
the artist, I felt not a little
guilty at not having voiced my
objection at the time of this
injustice. I feel, however, that
something must be said to pro
test, even if it is somewhat be
lated.
Reactionary actions such as
this of Mr. Houghton et al have
no place at a university, espe
cially one whose byword is sup
posedly "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." It would seem that the
nude in art is to be tolerated as
long as it is time tested—where
upon it can be spoon-fed to the
students in art history classes.
But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

gainly," if indeed they are. This
is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur
thermore, I do not find this
consistent with "Academic
Freedom" a term which has
been widely touted lately. I have

our stodgy selves to return Mrs.

. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.
KEITH BOYLE

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.
Associate Professor of Music
LELAND SMITH
... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer

enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub

Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political
Science Department. Thank you.

If one wants a good football

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.

... Of course I'm sure Mr.
Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.
GARY A. PATTON
Law School, '68
Editor, The Daily:
I have just finished reading
your editorial (Daily, Feb. 28)
condemning Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton and his ilk for
removing the nudes from the
Cashier's Office at Encina. As
an art student and a friend of
the artist, I felt not a little
guilty at not having voiced my
objection at the time of this
injustice. I feel, however, that
something must be said to pro
test, even if it is somewhat be
lated.
Reactionary actions such as
this of Mr. Houghton et al have
no place at a university, espe
cially one whose byword is sup
posedly "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." It would seem that the
nude in art is to be tolerated as
long as it is time tested—where
upon it can be spoon-fed to the
students in art history classes.
But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

gainly," if indeed they are. This
is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur
thermore, I do not find this
consistent with "Academic
Freedom" a term which has
been widely touted lately. I have
little hope that we can betake
our stodgy selves to return Mrs.
Raymond's paintings to the
Cashier's Office. But unless we
do the "Winds of Freedom" will
continue to reek with hypo

. . . The conclusions one draws
from reading the article in The
Daily, (February 18) concerning
the controversy around Encina
art are:
• Art should not be near the
"business front of the school"
since art has nothing to do with
business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.
Associate Professor of Music

... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer

enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub

Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political
Science Department. Thank you.

If one wants a good football

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.

... Of course I'm sure Mr.
Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.
GARY A. PATTON
Law School, '68
Editor, The Daily:
I have just finished reading
your editorial (Daily, Feb. 28)
condemning Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton and his ilk for
removing the nudes from the
Cashier's Office at Encina. As
an art student and a friend of
the artist, I felt not a little
guilty at not having voiced my
objection at the time of this
injustice. I feel, however, that
something must be said to pro
test, even if it is somewhat be
lated.
Reactionary actions such as
this of Mr. Houghton et al have
no place at a university, espe
cially one whose byword is sup
posedly "The Winds of Freedom
Blow." It would seem that the
nude in art is to be tolerated as
long as it is time tested—where
upon it can be spoon-fed to the
students in art history classes.
But beware the contemporary
nude.
I do not find it pertinent that
Ann Raymond's nudes are "un

gainly," if indeed they are. This
is up to the public to decide, not
for Mr. Hougton to dictate. Fur
thermore, I do not find this
consistent with "Academic
Freedom" a term which has
been widely touted lately. I have
little hope that we can betake
our stodgy selves to return Mrs.
Raymond's paintings to the
Cashier's Office. But unless we
do the "Winds of Freedom" will
continue to reek with hypo

business and business after all
is Stanford,
• Stanford takes no second
place when it comes to amateur
art authorities,
• Painters should have week
end hobbies: psychology, brain
surgery and being an associate
registrar,
• Certain people have diffi
culty (?) discerning a nude fig
ure from a naked figure,
• Mr. Jedd and Mr. Creigh
ton should remove the art from
Encina walls replacing it with
happy pictures: robin red breast
(nude not naked), kittens (four
weeks old or less), Sir Herbert
Read, Madame Chiang Kai-shek,
and Andre Malraux.

. . . Controversy over aesthetic
matters should always be wel
come on campus, but censor
ship of the highly conventional
subject matter of some of Ann
Raymond's paintings at Encina
Hall can only be viewed as ri
diculously lamentable. Those
who hate and fear that part of
the world that exists beyond
their own blue noses deserve
nothing more than the bare
walls they had in years past.
Associate Professor of Music
LELAND SMITH
... I think all the displays
have been so very interesting,
and I have been particularly
impressed with Ann Raymond's
work. Her paintings are excel
lent and her nudes seem to me
to be very well done and in the
best possible taste.
JOYCE SANDERS
. . . You cannot be serious.
Does it really stand to reason
that forcing unwilling witness
es to view controversial art that
offends them is the same as
"forcing" students to read Vol
taire? The Cashier's Office is a
public place where the entire
University community may go,
or must go, for certain Univer
sity services. Should any who
enter or are stationed there be
forced to be offended?

• Tuition Change
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Whitaker's clarification
of the proposed tuition change
was a kind gesture. It make
clear the real dangers in the
proposal. While other people
have spoken to the heart of the
matter—the philosophy of edu
cation involved—l wish to com
ment on one of the practical as
pects.
The seemingly harmless con
sideration about those students
who quit school to teach while
writing their dissertation is a
threat to many graduate stu
dents who want to start teach
ing for any number of valid rea
sons (like participation in the
Woodrow Wilson Teaching Pro
gram in underprivileged South
ern colleges).
This is obvious, but I wish to
point out another large class of
graduate students who would
suffer—the married women. In
a typical situation, man and
wife leave Stanford with per
haps both their dissertations un
finished: he to teach, she to
raise children. This may not be
the University - approved way,
but neither should it be pun
ished by the University. (After
all, the graduate school accepts
married women, surely it must
realize that families are not in
compatible with education.)
Numerous women pursue
their in-residence studies while
married, and then take a break
to start a family before return
ing to a c a d e m i a, meanwhile
nursing their dissertation along
with the babies. While this
means their years of actual
teaching may be slightly fewer
(though many start teaching
within one to five years of their
first child), they are no less val
uable to the profession. A teach
er is not appraised in years or
dollars.
But $600 yearly tuition is a
lot to pay out of a housewife's
allowance, especially during the
first years. The alternative is
for women to finish their disser
tation first, then to start having
children. But they won't be able
to teach more, unless they give
up family life altogether; fur
ther, many prefer to have chil
dren pushing thirty. Such a pro
gram as the new tuition propo
sal would eventually eliminate
the married woman from the
University scene.
Can we allow this? The pro
posal must be opposed.

• A Fine State
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford, an advanced institu
tion in many ways, is quite out
moded in its parking laws. There
is an obscure law that makes it
illegal to back into any space on
campus to prevent damage
to flowers that may be located
near the parking space. It is
clear that this is an outlandish
restriction of motorists' rights;
yet, a prominent member of the
English department is having
his Ph.D. withheld because he
refuses to pay the fine. This is
truly an abortion of justice and
should be brought to the pub
lic's attention!

• New Society
Editor, The Dally:
I received the following letter
February 9 and I feel that it is
of interest to the community at
large. It reads in part:
Dear Mr. Adams,
I am an alumnus of Stan
ford University ('36) and my
father was also an alumnus
('O3) and taught at Stanford
for many years. As you may
or may not know, my father
was a distinguished ornitholo
gist. In 1918 when he was do

ing field work in northeastern
Mexico on the habits of the
the Mexican roadrunner and
other desert birds, he was
caught in a crossfire between
Pancho Villa and a gang of
Mexican Federales and
was tragically killed. His will
empowered me to establish a
research center to complete
his work on desert bird life
and that project has to a great
extent Iwen accomplished.
I was fifteen years old when
my father died and that ex
perience, combined with a
fairly long observation of the
human race, has convinced me
that war and all the instru
ments of war have got to be
abolished. I am interested,
therefore, in endowing society
on the campus at which my
father was both a student and
a teacher which will fight for
the abolition of militarism
and, more particularly, of the
ROTC program. ... I would
like that society to bear my
father's name.
I am writing to you because
your mother (who, as you
know, is the mainstay of the
secretarial staff down here at
the sanctuary) has told me
that you are a promising
young man . . . and that you
share my convictions. If the
Society can be organized,
please let me know and I will
make whatever financial ar
rangements are necessary ...
RALPH ARMY, JR.
The letter speaks for itself.
There are many I am sure who
feel that the ROTC program
should no longer be allowed to
preach militarism on the cam
pus. With this financial help we
may be able to do something
obtu it. Any one interested in
joining the Ralph Army Society
can contact me in the Political
Science Department. Thank you.

• Jaw, Breakers
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Mr. McGlothlin's letter
(The Daily, Feb. 28).
If one wants a good football
team, he normally picks the best
players available. Or if he should
want a great university, he
would supposedly select the
most highly skilled and crea
tive students who apply. And
perhaps if he should want a
prosperous business, he would
choose the people best qualified
to do the necessary jobs. But
Breakers Club imagines, at
least, that everyone can eat
equally well, and therefore any
one who wants to try his hand
at eating there, may.

• Fighting The War
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mason's letter (Daily,
February 24) suggests that the
reason students are opposed to
the war in Vietnam is that they
are afraid to fight in that war.
One's first reaction to such a
statement would be to invite
Mr. Mason to demonstrate his
own lack of cowardice and love
of country by going himself.
But we have learned that Mr.
Mason has already gone. One
might, on learning this, suppose
that Mr. Mason's cogent and ar
ticulate thesis is a literary cast
ing of the gauntlet at the feet
of the uneasy American colleg
ian; a challenge to follow in the
same self-sacrificing footsteps
that Mr. Mason left in the steam
ing mud and blood of Southeast
Asia. But surely a man who has
so nobly served his country
would not so deviously seek a
forum for his own breast-beat
ing.
What, then, was the reason
for his envenomed appraisal of
dissenting students' motives?
Certainly as a veteran of the
fight for the American Way of
Life Mr. Mason does not mean
to suggest that there can be no

such thing as honest and in
formed dissent. Nor can he, as
a student of the legal process,
be oblivious to history's lesson
that frequently the dissenter is
exposed to greater personal
peril from those who would
stifle dissent than is his brother
on the battlefield.
Perhaps his bitter indictment
is the result of limited contact
with, or understanding of. those
who question or disagree with
the reasons given for our policy
in Viet Nam. A similar lack of
exposure would explain his
thesis that modern college stu
dents are ivory tower dumpl
ings, isolated from the bubbling
cauldron of the "real world" be
low. He has obviously ignored
the commitment of this genera
tion of students to furthering
the American Ideal by working
for civil rights, by helping un
derprivileged people around the
world, and by dedicating them
selves, in unprecedented num
bers, to a life of public service.
If Mr. Mason believes that by
serving for a year of so in Viet
nam he has expiated his guilt
for having been born into the
Privileged Society, then perhaps
we should leave him complac
ently satisfied. But there are
others who see in their birth
right a continuing obligation to
question and criticize in an ef
fort to find a proper course for
themselves and their country.

... In their inception, appeals
to idealism may have been
praiseworthy and altruistic, but
because of the magnitude they
achieved and the "sacrifices"
they exhorted, they proved no
boon to mankind. I include alike
mass religious movements, na
tionalism, communism, fascism,
and capitalism, when it becomes
rarefied and perverted into "the
American way" and the defense
thereof. Idealism is fine in small
doses, but when it demands too
many devotees and deaths, it be
comes worse than the ailment.
An antidote for an overdose
of idealism is Mr. Mason's af
fluent capitalist — a near un
palitable compound of Adam
Smith, Hobbes, and Machiavelli.
He'll not leave the pursuit of
affluence for "pursuit of peace."
No virtue here, and probably
some sin. But if there are bigger
sins and lesser sins, I maintain
that it is far better to "do in" a

competitor than to sacrifice a
thousand men.
It is recorded that Cromwell's
Ironsides were exhorted in bat
tle by the singing of Psalms. I
hope Mr. Mason will not be lifted
away from a custom, stereo,
high fidelity system by the melo
dies of "The Green Beret." „
JACK MARIETTA
Grad Student

. . . Mr. Mason may be correct
in assuming that some people,
along with himself, rationalize
their unwillingness to make sac
rifices and their unwillingness
too face responsibilities. How
ever, Mr. Mason is quite incor
rect in generalizing from his
own case, or from those irre
sponsible persons his letter indi
cates he knows, to all of those
who oppose this war. What
might be stated as true for Mr.
Mason and his friends is calumn
ious to those who oppose the
war in good conscience and not
as a rationalization for the pro
tection of their own personal se
curity and comfort.
ARTHUR M. EISENSON
. . . Mr. Mason, I feel sorry
for the nation that lets people
like you interpret and formulate
its laws. I wonder if your letter
is satirical; or are you just an
other Stanford clod? I challenge
you to stand behind your beliefs.
Since you know why people are
opposed to the War in Vietnam,
(the reasons you give are, in
fact, reasons why people sup
port the war) I wonder if you
would do me the honor of pay
ing for a trip to Vietnam? Since
I am a typical protester you
must assume that I am joking,
that I cherish my 2-S and so
forth. Please send me about
$800 so that I can prove to you
that protesters aren't cowards
. . . oh, let me warn you that
you may find yourself accused
of giving aid and comfort to the
enemy if word gets out. They
might even take away your 2-S.
If you are really a brilliant sat
irist in disguise, please accept
my apoligies in advance; I am
very gullible.
MARC SAPIR
... Of course I'm sure Mr.
Mason is only speaking for him
self. Personally, I'm just against
killing people.
