# Out Of The Wilburness!

### 
The Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion finally caught up with the other parties
concerned with the sponsor-selection question
yesterday.
Its approval of a five-man appeals board to
settle disagreements between the Wilbur Fac
ulty Master and the sponsors over the choice
of new sponsors came about, however, only
after a little backstage arm-twisting.
Two weeks ago, Faculty Master Eric Hutch
inson and the sponsors agreed to an appeals
committee substantially the same as the one
approved yesterday. CUE Chairman Robert J.
Wert, however, turned down the appeals com
mittee; CUE, he said, was insistent that it
should have the final say over who could and
who could not be a sponsor.
When this split between the Wilbur forces
and the administration-faculty troops came
into the open, Hutchinson equivocated, and
the whole dispute was thrown into the hands
of the Committee of 15. The Committee, how
ever, was going through a crisis of its own,
and was not able to discuss the problem. In
stead, Committee Chairman Philip Rhineland
er talked informally with a few of die spon
sors (including one on the Committee of 15),

and, with a few comparatively minor revisions,
agreed to the Hutchinson-sponsor compromise
of two weeks before.
Faced with this unanimity of opposing opin
ion, Wert and his committee relented. Alone
in the wilderness, they had little choice.
And what has been learned from the dis
pute? The lessons are at least two.
First, it is abundantly clear that the whole
situation would never have come about were
there students on the Committee on Under
graduate Education. Had the committee at
least had the chance to hear and consider the
student viewpoint before foisting various uni
lateral decisions upon the Wilbur complex, it
is doubtful that its actions would have been
met with such dissatisfaction.
Second, and perhaps more important, the
autonomy myth surrounding the faculty-mas
ter plan is dead. An autopsy shows that Eric
Hutchinson has no more control over Wilbur
than does the Sailing Club over the weeds in
Lake Lag. CUE, although now discredited, is
the power to be reckoned with. And if Lord
Acton's thesis on power is still relevant, this
first flexing of CUE's muscles is an ominous
sign.

And what has been learned from the dis
pute? The lessons are at least two.
First, it is abundantly clear that the whole
situation would never have come about were
there students on the Committee on Under
graduate Education. Had the committee at
least had the chance to hear and consider the
student viewpoint before foisting various uni
lateral decisions upon the Wilbur complex, it
is doubtful that its actions would have been
met with such dissatisfaction.
Second, and perhaps more important, the
autonomy myth surrounding the faculty-mas
ter plan is dead. An autopsy shows that Eric
Hutchinson has no more control over Wilbur
than does the Sailing Club over the weeds in
Lake Lag. CUE, although now discredited, is
the power to be reckoned with. And if Lord
Acton's thesis on power is still relevant, this
first flexing of CUE's muscles is an ominous
sign.
