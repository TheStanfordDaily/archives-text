# Today And Tomorrow
## The Message From Europe
### Walter Lippmann 
Last week Gen. Charles de
Gaulle held a press conference
on Monday, and on Tuesday the
British government published
its defense review. The two
documents give us a glimpse of

how our two leading Allies now
see our role in the world.
Gen. De Gaulle's view is that
the postwar mission of the
United States as the protector
of Western Europe has been

successfully accomplished. The
threat of war with the Soviet
Union has subsided to a degree
where under the cover of our
nuclear deterrent—but without
our guidance, control or com
mand of European forces—Eu
ropean diplomacy can deal suc
cessfully with East-West rela
tions.
If I understood correctly Gen.
De Gaulle's present position, it
is that as the integrated mili
tary establishment is no longer
necessary it has become a dan
ger to Europe. For as the
United States is increasingly
involved in extra-European con
flicts it will be tempted to draw
on its military forces and utilize
its facilities in Europe. If these
are integrated forces and facili
ties, Europeans will be involved
in wars in which the Europeans
have no voice.
Facts of Life
The defense review is an at
tempt to reconcile all of Brit
ain's remaining commitments in
Europe, Africa and Asia with
the economic facts of British
life. The Wilson government
has decided that the condition of
the British balance of payments
does not permit Britain to
spend more than about 6 per
cent of the gross national prod
uct for defense. This amounts
to 2 billion pounds ($5.6 bil
lion) per year at 1964 prices.
This basic conclusion as
sumes, of course, that the stan
dard of living of the people of
the United Kingdom cannot be
reduced any further in order to
pay for a larger military force.
And, in turn, this assumption
rests on another: that not only
the security and freedom of
Great Britain itself, but her far
flung external commitments as
well can be maintained — the
world situation being what it is
—by the reduced defense budget.
The world situation which
makes this possible is that the
U. S. government seems willing
to have passed along to it the
onus and the burden in the non-
European world which Britain
no longer feels she can afford.
Left Alone
The net result is that we are
left alone among the global re
sponsibilities which we have
taken upon ourselves. That is
the stark meaning of what has
been decided and declared in
Paris and in London. Secretary
Dean .Rusk's interpretation of
our many treaties is that they
are not just collective security
pacts which operate collectively,
but also direct and single com
mitments of the United States.
From Paris and London we
have now been told that if the
Rusk doctrine is indeed U. S.
policy we shall have to pay the
whole cost of trying to make it
work.
The Rusk doctrine, as ex
pounded to the Senate in the
recent hearings, is the reductio
ad ahfturdum of the loose gen-

eralities of the Truman doc
trine and the pactomania of
Secretary John Foster Dulles.
Though they differ in form
and style, there is an underly
ing assumption about the state
of the world which Paris and
London share. It is that patience
and firmness have paid off in
our dealings with the Soviet
Union and that they will pay
off with Red China. Neither
Paris nor London is prepared or
intends to resist China on the
Asian mainland, and insofar as
we choose to do that they are
leaving us alone.
Thus, our problem is how,
honorably and humanely, to dis
engage ourselves militarily, not
from the Pacific and Asia, but
from the Asian mainland.
If and when this can be done,
the risk of an intolerable war
with China will have been ob
viated, and the prestige, the
power and the influence of the
United States in the world will
be increased. For it will then
rest not on the quagmire of
Vietnam, but on the islands and
the sea which our fleet com
mands.
