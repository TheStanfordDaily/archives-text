## Unrepresentative LASSU An Old Stirred-Up Myth 
### Tim Haight 
The recont controversy over
the recall of student members of
the Committee of Fifteen has
stirred up some old myths. The
most oft-repeated of these is
t li a t LASSU is unrepresenta
tive, graduate-dominated, radi
cal, and the like.
The myths are simply not
truo. A look at the LASSU mem
bership roll and a few trips to
the University statistician and
the Dean of Students office dis
prove these ideas. In fact, they
prove that if the legislature is
unrepresentative, it is the grad
uates who arc coming out short.
Statistics
Here are some of the statis
tics: At Stanford there are 11,-
•110 students enrolled. Excluding
terminal graduate students,
there are 5129 graduates and
5808 undergraduates. Using the
LASSU formula of one repre
sentative for each seventy-five
students, the graduates should
have 68 representatives and the
undergrads 77. In fact, however,
94 scats are allotod for possible
undergraduate occupancy and
65 for graduate students.
The discrepency occures be
cause the undergraduate seats
are apportioned by living group,
while the graduate representa
tives are chosen by the numeri
cal formula. Certain areas of
the campus are greatly over-rep
resented by the living-group sys
tem. The fraternities have 1029
members, on and off-campus. By
the 75-system this would mean
14 reps, but the fraternities have
23.
The largest women's row
houses, Gutherie and Hurbut,
have 37 girls. Roth, the small
est, has 26. Yet each row house
gets a rep. Taken as a whole the
Row houses have 264 girls and
should have 3.52 reps, but they
are permitted eight.
lar - and Floro
Lagunita and Florence Moore
are also over-represented. The
capacity of a house in Moore is
50, and the largest house in Lag,
Magnolia, has 58.
Stern, Branner, Roble, and
Off-Campus are about where

they should be, but Wilbur is
underreprescntcd. With 712 men,
Wilbur should have 9.5 (round
ed off to ten) representatives.
They have eight.
Taken altogether, the under
graduates have a 1.4-to-one pos
sible edge over the grads. In
reality, the undergrads have oc
cupied 70 of their seats and the
grads only 42. The real edge
therefore goes up to almost 1.9
to one.
Attendance
Attendance figures maintain
the same ratios, if not ones more
unfavorable to the graduate stu
dents. On February 17, when the
"unrepresentative" legislature
met and passed the first bill
changing the membership of the
Committee of Fifteen, under
graduates and 28 grads signed
in. The final vote on the bill,
after some representatives had
left and with some abstentions,
was 45-15.
On February 24, after much
publicity in The Daily and a real
effort by some of the circula
tors of the petition, 61 under
grads and 32 grads came to the
meeting. This time the vote was
66-6 in favor of the final reso
lution.
In percentages, the grads had
49 per cent of their possible rep
resentation present of Feb. 24.
The undergrads had 65 per cent.
The figures for the 17th were 53
per cent for the undergrads and
43 per cent of the grads.
Myth IHsapprars
In the face of these statistics,
which prove that undergrads are
allowed more votes, have seated
more delegates, and attend more
often, the idea of the graduate
dominated legislature seems to
disappear.
One wonders how the myth de
veloped. Is it because the grads
are more vocal, or because living
groups don't care who their
LASSU representatives are, or
because the ciy if "unrepresent
ative" was an easy excuse for
simultaneous criticism and apa
thy. Whichever of the three it
may be, it seems the problem
lies more with the constituen
cies, and less with LASSU.

65 for graduate students.
The discrepency occures be
cause the undergraduate seats
are apportioned by living group,
while the graduate representa
tives are chosen by the numeri
cal formula. Certain areas of
the campus are greatly over-rep
resented by the living-group sys
tem. The fraternities have 1029
members, on and off-campus. By
the 75-system this would mean
14 reps, but the fraternities have
23.
The largest women's row
houses, Gutherie and Hurbut,
have 37 girls. Roth, the small
est, has 26. Yet each row house
gets a rep. Taken as a whole the
Row houses have 264 girls and
should have 3.52 reps, but they
are permitted eight.
lar - and Floro
Lagunita and Florence Moore
are also over-represented. The
capacity of a house in Moore is
50, and the largest house in Lag,
Magnolia, has 58.
Stern, Branner, Roble, and
Off-Campus are about where

they should be, but Wilbur is
underreprescntcd. With 712 men,
Wilbur should have 9.5 (round
ed off to ten) representatives.
They have eight.
Taken altogether, the under
graduates have a 1.4-to-one pos
sible edge over the grads. In
reality, the undergrads have oc
cupied 70 of their seats and the
grads only 42. The real edge
therefore goes up to almost 1.9
to one.
Attendance
Attendance figures maintain
the same ratios, if not ones more
unfavorable to the graduate stu
dents. On February 17, when the
"unrepresentative" legislature
met and passed the first bill
changing the membership of the
Committee of Fifteen, under
graduates and 28 grads signed
in. The final vote on the bill,
after some representatives had
left and with some abstentions,
was 45-15.
On February 24, after much
publicity in The Daily and a real
effort by some of the circula
tors of the petition, 61 under
grads and 32 grads came to the
meeting. This time the vote was
66-6 in favor of the final reso
lution.
In percentages, the grads had
49 per cent of their possible rep
resentation present of Feb. 24.
The undergrads had 65 per cent.
The figures for the 17th were 53
per cent for the undergrads and
43 per cent of the grads.
Myth IHsapprars
In the face of these statistics,
which prove that undergrads are
allowed more votes, have seated
more delegates, and attend more
often, the idea of the graduate
dominated legislature seems to
disappear.
One wonders how the myth de
veloped. Is it because the grads
are more vocal, or because living
groups don't care who their
LASSU representatives are, or
because the ciy if "unrepresent
ative" was an easy excuse for
simultaneous criticism and apa
thy. Whichever of the three it
may be, it seems the problem
lies more with the constituen
cies, and less with LASSU.
The recont controversy over
the recall of student members of
the Committee of Fifteen has
stirred up some old myths. The
most oft-repeated of these is
t li a t LASSU is unrepresenta
tive, graduate-dominated, radi
cal, and the like.
The myths are simply not
truo. A look at the LASSU mem
bership roll and a few trips to
the University statistician and
the Dean of Students office dis
prove these ideas. In fact, they
prove that if the legislature is
unrepresentative, it is the grad
uates who arc coming out short.
Statistics
Here are some of the statis
tics: At Stanford there are 11,-
•110 students enrolled. Excluding
terminal graduate students,
there are 5129 graduates and
5808 undergraduates. Using the
LASSU formula of one repre
sentative for each seventy-five
students, the graduates should
have 68 representatives and the
undergrads 77. In fact, however,
94 scats are allotod for possible
undergraduate occupancy and
65 for graduate students.

Wilbur should have 9.5 (round
ed off to ten) representatives.
They have eight.
Taken altogether, the under
graduates have a 1.4-to-one pos
sible edge over the grads. In
reality, the undergrads have oc
cupied 70 of their seats and the
grads only 42. The real edge
therefore goes up to almost 1.9
to one.
Attendance
Attendance figures maintain
the same ratios, if not ones more
unfavorable to the graduate stu
dents. On February 17, when the
"unrepresentative" legislature
met and passed the first bill
changing the membership of the
Committee of Fifteen, under
graduates and 28 grads signed
in. The final vote on the bill,
after some representatives had
left and with some abstentions,
was 45-15.
On February 24, after much
publicity in The Daily and a real
effort by some of the circula
tors of the petition, 61 under
grads and 32 grads came to the
meeting. This time the vote was
66-6 in favor of the final reso
lution.
In percentages, the grads had
49 per cent of their possible rep
resentation present of Feb. 24.
The undergrads had 65 per cent.
The figures for the 17th were 53
per cent for the undergrads and
43 per cent of the grads.
Myth IHsapprars
In the face of these statistics,
which prove that undergrads are
allowed more votes, have seated
more delegates, and attend more
often, the idea of the graduate
dominated legislature seems to
disappear.
One wonders how the myth de
veloped. Is it because the grads
are more vocal, or because living
groups don't care who their
LASSU representatives are, or
because the ciy if "unrepresent
ative" was an easy excuse for
simultaneous criticism and apa
thy. Whichever of the three it
may be, it seems the problem
lies more with the constituen
cies, and less with LASSU.
