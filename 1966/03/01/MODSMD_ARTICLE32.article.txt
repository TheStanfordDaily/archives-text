## Kennedy Carries The Torch 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Senator Robert Kennedy's pro
posal to invite the Communist
Viet Cong to participate in the
government of South Vietnam
is not in any serious sense a pro
posal. It is, rather, in the order
of an idealistic emanation, like
impeaching Earl Warren. To
support the one idea, as to sup
port the other, requires above
all an ignorance of history, hut
besides that, a certain flair for
plopping a wrench across the in
tricate circuitry of a situation
so as to get a quick and bright
flash.
Mind Boggles
There are so many things
wrong with the pseudo-proposal
that one's mind boggles at how
to approach the subject analyti
cally. It is as though someone
had proposed after Potsdam
that the cold war be terminat

ed by marrying off Eleanor
Roosevelt to Joseph Stalin, and
you were given a minute to ex
plain your objections to that
proposal. Where would you be
gin?
Well, for those who came in
late, the reasons against a pop
ular front are roughly these:
• The South Vietnam govern
ment would not consent to share
power with the Communists;
• If it were the kind of gov
ernment that would consent, the
United States should never have
sacrificed a life or a dollar to
protect it;
• The Viet Cong, which is a
division of the Communist move
ment of Vietnam, and under the
direct control of the North Viet
namese, would not accept coali
tion government unless it was
satisfied that the fiction of

share power would evolve as it
did in Laos, merely as an inter
lude between their present con
dition, and an improved position
of power.
• It is not desirable to share
power with Communists be
cause they don't believe in shar
ing power; because they act like
barbarians; and because, in this
instance, to give them power
within the government is to
break faith with those people
of South Vietnam who put their
trust in you to defend them pre
cisely against the acquisition of
power by the types who have
been butchering them for ten
years.
It is hard to believe that Sen
ator Kennedy isn't aware of all
this, which is why in the strict
est sense of the word this was
a pseudo-proposal, i.e., a propos-

al not intended to be accepted as
that, but the making of which
is intended to accomplish other
purposes. What other purposes?
Come on.
The movement of Bobby to
wards the left is now so plain
that it is likely to be noted in
the next issue of the World Al
manac, under "Left, move to
wards. 1. Robert F. Kennedy."
Insamuch (a) as Bobby Kenne
dy's tradition is conservative,
and (b) he is now given, as Wil
liam S. White has observed, to
taking positions along with the
doctrinaire left which his own
brother always disdained, there
is (c) one reason more probable
than any other for his abrupt
left-mindedness.
After Rejection
It seemed clear from the mo
ment that Johnson rejected Bob
by for Vice President that he
would, by the internal laws of
political dynamics, emerge at
another pole from Mr. John
son's, the only question being in
which direction, right or left.
The coalition government pro
posal, timed to occur the day
after Senator Fulbright conclud
ed his hearings, removed the
spotlight from Fulbright as ef
fectively as if the fuse feeding
that beam had suddenly popped.
Kennedy became, in an instant,
the popular leader of the ap
peasement wing of the Demo
cratic Party.
Appeasement Cau*e
Insamuch as Senator Kennedy
has an aversion to unpopular
causes (when last did he es
pouse one?), and inasmuch as
he is a superb politician, as an
act of respect one must, if not
exactly deduce, at least concede
the possibility that the appease
ment cause will be very popular
in the foreseeable future.
Bobby Kennedy believes that
he is carrying on the torch his
brother left him. He is making
it difficult for the South Vietna
mese to carry on the torch left
to them by their brothers, whose
assassins Robert Kennedy now
desires to elevate to official
positions of power.

Senator Robert Kennedy's pro
posal to invite the Communist
Viet Cong to participate in the
government of South Vietnam
is not in any serious sense a pro
posal. It is, rather, in the order
of an idealistic emanation, like
impeaching Earl Warren. To
support the one idea, as to sup
port the other, requires above
all an ignorance of history, hut
besides that, a certain flair for
plopping a wrench across the in
tricate circuitry of a situation
so as to get a quick and bright
flash.
Mind Boggles
There are so many things
wrong with the pseudo-proposal
that one's mind boggles at how
to approach the subject analyti
cally. It is as though someone
had proposed after Potsdam
that the cold war be terminat

ed by marrying off Eleanor
Roosevelt to Joseph Stalin, and
you were given a minute to ex
plain your objections to that
proposal. Where would you be
gin?
Well, for those who came in
late, the reasons against a pop
ular front are roughly these:
• The South Vietnam govern
ment would not consent to share
power with the Communists;
• If it were the kind of gov
ernment that would consent, the
United States should never have
sacrificed a life or a dollar to
protect it;
• The Viet Cong, which is a
division of the Communist move
ment of Vietnam, and under the
direct control of the North Viet
namese, would not accept coali
tion government unless it was
satisfied that the fiction of

share power would evolve as it
did in Laos, merely as an inter
lude between their present con
dition, and an improved position
of power.

After Rejection
It seemed clear from the mo
ment that Johnson rejected Bob
by for Vice President that he
would, by the internal laws of
political dynamics, emerge at
another pole from Mr. John
son's, the only question being in
which direction, right or left.
The coalition government pro
posal, timed to occur the day
after Senator Fulbright conclud
ed his hearings, removed the
spotlight from Fulbright as ef
fectively as if the fuse feeding
that beam had suddenly popped.
Kennedy became, in an instant,
the popular leader of the ap
peasement wing of the Demo
cratic Party.
Appeasement Cau*e
Insamuch as Senator Kennedy
has an aversion to unpopular
causes (when last did he es
pouse one?), and inasmuch as
he is a superb politician, as an
act of respect one must, if not
exactly deduce, at least concede
the possibility that the appease
ment cause will be very popular
in the foreseeable future.
Bobby Kennedy believes that
he is carrying on the torch his
brother left him. He is making
it difficult for the South Vietna
mese to carry on the torch left
to them by their brothers, whose
assassins Robert Kennedy now
desires to elevate to official
positions of power.
