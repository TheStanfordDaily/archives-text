Should foreign students involve
themselves in U.S. politics?)
By KENNETH COOPER
Politics today is something in
which everyone should play a
role. Scholars of yesterday could
get away with ignoring the
world around them. I don't
think we can any longer.
When American politics
touches the lives of people in
other countries, scholars from
those countries not only have a
right, but an obligation to ex
press their views, enter into a
discussion of the issues, suggest
solutions and offer constructive
criticism. I have confidence that
the student—American or for
eign—can devote himself both
to academic scholarship and to

concern for the world around
him.
Rule By The Few
Civilization wil no longer tol
erate societies in which large
numbers of people hedonistic
ally and selfishly devote them
selves solely to the pursuit of
their own narrow self-interests.
During the development of past
civilizations the great majority
of people played no role in for
mulating the policies and effect
ing the actions of their govern
ments. Rule has almost always
been—by the few.
It has also been true that in
almost every society where the
government has been adminis
tered by a self-chosen few, the
great majority of the people
have been left out of the beau
tiful world that the politicians
and the scholars have discussed,
contemplated, and constructed
for themselves.
It is only where and when the
large majorities of people have
asserted themselves and demand
ed a place in the sun, where they
have felt a common concern for
the community of people with
whom they live and have accept
ed the burden of personal respon
sibility for others, that progress
and a better life have come to
the many and not just to the few.
Hard Work
It takes hard work, it takes
concern —and it takes "involve
ment" in politics. What it means
is that today's student and to
day's professor must have at
least two parts to his being.
To be creative, to discover new
solutions, to obtain knowledge
and to be able to impart it to
others —he must be a serious
scholar. He must give dedicated
attention to the central core of
his academic field of interest.
But he must also develop the
other part of his being—the sense
of responsibility, concern and
deep interest in the "big picture".
The student should consider edu
cation during his college years
as a time when he asks himself
and others, "What is the meaning
of all this?", "What is the best
of all possible worlds?", "I am
a part of humanity, how do my
own selfish desires fit in with
those of others?"
Come And Gone
In past centuries generations
have come and gone, societies
have come and gone, great civili
zations have come and gone.
They have gone because the lead
ers did not have the answers.
They did not know how to avoid
disaster, and the people had
neither the answers nor the con

cern nor the power to do any
thing about it.
We need to develop a con
cerned world citizenry. We need
to develop a science of human
relations. Man has a marvelously
strong motivation to survive and
to create. It is time we became
as skilled in human relations as
we are in controlling the atom.
Doing Both
For the student this does not
mean, however, that it should de
tract in any way from the solid
pursuit of his academic program.
Today's student simply must, at
times, be able to do both. And
from what I have seen, most of
thes tudents who show serious
concern for human affairs are
also serious, hard-working, and
far above average students in
their own special academic
fields.
The student today must be a
whole person, and the university
should provide the stimulation
and the environment that will
allow him to excel in his scholar
ly pursuits and, at thes ame time,
to relate himself and his aca
demic program to the real world
around him.

The student should consider edu

those of others?"
Come And Gone
In past centuries generations
have come and gone, societies
have come and gone, great civili
zations have come and gone.
They have gone because the lead
ers did not have the answers.
They did not know how to avoid
disaster, and the people had
neither the answers nor the con

cern nor the power to do any
thing about it.
We need to develop a con
cerned world citizenry. We need
to develop a science of human
relations. Man has a marvelously
strong motivation to survive and
to create. It is time we became
as skilled in human relations as
we are in controlling the atom.
Doing Both
For the student this does not
mean, however, that it should de
tract in any way from the solid
pursuit of his academic program.
Today's student simply must, at
times, be able to do both. And
from what I have seen, most of
thes tudents who show serious
concern for human affairs are
also serious, hard-working, and
far above average students in
their own special academic
fields.
The student today must be a
whole person, and the university
should provide the stimulation
and the environment that will
allow him to excel in his scholar
ly pursuits and, at thes ame time,
to relate himself and his aca
demic program to the real world
around him.

Should foreign students involve
themselves in U.S. politics?)
By KENNETH COOPER
Politics today is something in
which everyone should play a
role. Scholars of yesterday could
get away with ignoring the
world around them. I don't
think we can any longer.
When American politics
touches the lives of people in
other countries, scholars from
those countries not only have a
right, but an obligation to ex
press their views, enter into a
discussion of the issues, suggest
solutions and offer constructive
criticism. I have confidence that
the student—American or for
eign—can devote himself both
to academic scholarship and to

concern for the world around
him.
Rule By The Few
Civilization wil no longer tol
erate societies in which large
numbers of people hedonistic
ally and selfishly devote them
selves solely to the pursuit of
their own narrow self-interests.
During the development of past
civilizations the great majority
of people played no role in for
mulating the policies and effect
ing the actions of their govern
ments. Rule has almost always
been—by the few.
It has also been true that in
almost every society where the
government has been adminis
tered by a self-chosen few, the
great majority of the people
have been left out of the beau
tiful world that the politicians
and the scholars have discussed,
contemplated, and constructed
for themselves.
It is only where and when the
large majorities of people have
asserted themselves and demand
ed a place in the sun, where they
have felt a common concern for
the community of people with
whom they live and have accept
ed the burden of personal respon
sibility for others, that progress
and a better life have come to
the many and not just to the few.
Hard Work
It takes hard work, it takes
concern —and it takes "involve
ment" in politics. What it means
is that today's student and to
day's professor must have at
least two parts to his being.
To be creative, to discover new
solutions, to obtain knowledge
and to be able to impart it to
others —he must be a serious
scholar. He must give dedicated
attention to the central core of
his academic field of interest.
But he must also develop the
other part of his being—the sense
of responsibility, concern and
deep interest in the "big picture".
The student should consider edu
cation during his college years
as a time when he asks himself
and others, "What is the meaning
of all this?", "What is the best
of all possible worlds?", "I am
