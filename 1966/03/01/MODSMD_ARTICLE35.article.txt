# The 						Capitol Scenes
## H-bomb, G-bomb, F-bomb; Oh The Beauty Of Science! 
### Art Buchwald 
It was recently reported to a
group of American physicists
that a new "gravity bomb" equal
to one million H-bombs could
someday be built. At the moment
it is impractical because of size
and cost as well as a lack of a
triggering device, but they said
the H-bomb was impractical a
few years ago, too.
The important thing is that in
the next ten years many coun
tries will be developing atomic
bombs and H-bombs and the
countries that now possess these
bombs will no longer have the
prestige and position they hold
in world affairs today.
Therefore, the gravity bomb
could be the answer to those who
want to stay ahead in the nuclear
arms race.
Settling Disputes
The big fear in the world to
day is that China, France, Israel,
Egypt, India, and Monaco may

all become nuclear powers. And
the question is how do you settle
disputes when everyone has an
H-bomb.
The answer is the gravity
bomb. No country is going to
start any trouble with us when
they know that if they use the
H-bomb we would use a bomb
one million times more powerful.
The only two nations who have
the capacity to build the gravity
bomb are the United States and
the Soviet Union. But the fear
is that if one country gets its
gravity bomb built first the other
country might feel endangered.
The best way to resolve this is
for the United States, who will
probably get its bomb built first,
to allow the Soviet Union to steal
its secrets.
Balance of Power
This could easily be done by in
viting Dr. Klaus Fuchs back to
the U.S. to work on our bomb.
Dr. Fuchs would pass on the
secret to the Russians who would
then develop their own gravity
bomb and the balance of power
in the world would be saved.
It is possible that some way
would have to be worked out to
dramatize the effectiveness of
the "G" bomb. Since you couldn't
very well test it on the earth, the
best way to show people the
power of the bomb might be to
blow up the moon. Everyone
could see it and we don't really
need the moon much anyway.
Because of its size and power,
the United States and the Soviet
Union would have to reassure
the non-gravity-bomb nations
that they would only use the
"G" bomb as a last resort, if the
other side used it first. We could
still fight small wars with H
bombs, but only a madman
would think of getting into a
war with the "G" bomb.
Pressure
There will be a great deal of
pressure from our allies for their
own stockpile of "G" bombs, but
it would be a mistake for us to
give in to them, just as it would
be a mistake for the Russians
to turn over their "G" bomb to
the Chinese.
France and China might
threaten to build their own "G"
bombs, but scientists believe it
would take them at least 10 years
to develop them. By this time
we will have discovered the "F"
bomb which will be one million
times more powerful that the
"G" bomb.
So, even if the other countries
do eventually find out the secret
of the "G" bomb, they still will
not possess the ultimate weapon.
That is the beauty of science.

gravity bomb built first the other
country might feel endangered.
The best way to resolve this is
for the United States, who will
probably get its bomb built first,
to allow the Soviet Union to steal
its secrets.
Balance of Power
This could easily be done by in
viting Dr. Klaus Fuchs back to
the U.S. to work on our bomb.
Dr. Fuchs would pass on the
secret to the Russians who would
then develop their own gravity
bomb and the balance of power
in the world would be saved.
It is possible that some way
would have to be worked out to
dramatize the effectiveness of
the "G" bomb. Since you couldn't
very well test it on the earth, the
best way to show people the
power of the bomb might be to
blow up the moon. Everyone
could see it and we don't really
need the moon much anyway.
Because of its size and power,
the United States and the Soviet
Union would have to reassure
the non-gravity-bomb nations
that they would only use the
"G" bomb as a last resort, if the
other side used it first. We could
still fight small wars with H
bombs, but only a madman
would think of getting into a
war with the "G" bomb.
Pressure
There will be a great deal of
pressure from our allies for their
own stockpile of "G" bombs, but
it would be a mistake for us to
give in to them, just as it would
be a mistake for the Russians
to turn over their "G" bomb to
the Chinese.
France and China might
threaten to build their own "G"
bombs, but scientists believe it
would take them at least 10 years
to develop them. By this time
we will have discovered the "F"
bomb which will be one million
times more powerful that the
"G" bomb.
So, even if the other countries
do eventually find out the secret
of the "G" bomb, they still will
not possess the ultimate weapon.
That is the beauty of science.

It was recently reported to a
group of American physicists
that a new "gravity bomb" equal
to one million H-bombs could
someday be built. At the moment
it is impractical because of size
and cost as well as a lack of a
triggering device, but they said
the H-bomb was impractical a
few years ago, too.
The important thing is that in
the next ten years many coun
tries will be developing atomic
bombs and H-bombs and the
countries that now possess these
bombs will no longer have the
prestige and position they hold
in world affairs today.
Therefore, the gravity bomb
could be the answer to those who
want to stay ahead in the nuclear
arms race.
Settling Disputes
The big fear in the world to
day is that China, France, Israel,
Egypt, India, and Monaco may

all become nuclear powers. And
the question is how do you settle
disputes when everyone has an
H-bomb.
The answer is the gravity
bomb. No country is going to
start any trouble with us when
they know that if they use the
H-bomb we would use a bomb
one million times more powerful.
The only two nations who have
the capacity to build the gravity
bomb are the United States and
the Soviet Union. But the fear
is that if one country gets its
gravity bomb built first the other
country might feel endangered.
The best way to resolve this is
for the United States, who will
