# Sponsor Controversy Resolved
## 
### SUE WICKIZER Assistant Editor 
The heated sponsor selection contro
versy was resolved yesterday when the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
(CUE) passed a compromise proposal
informally recommended by some
members of the Committee of Fifteen

and supported by the sponsors and the
Wilbur Faculty Master.
The compromise establishes a stu
dent-faculty appeals board which
would make the final decision if Dr.
Eric Hutchinson, Wilbur Faculty
Master, vetoes any choice of the spon
sor selection committee.
The compromise proposal is there

suit of a meeting last week between
Dr. Philip Rhinelander, Chairman of
the Committee of Fifteen, and three
sponsors. Hutchinson was invited, but
was unable to attend.
During the meeting Rhinelander
agreed to support the student-faculty
appeals board, which had been sug
gested a month ago by the sponsors, if

the faculty master was given a vote
on the board.
Appeals Board
It was decided that the appeals
board should consist of the Head Wil
bur Sponsor, the Wilbur Faculty
Master, one other sponsor, a member
of CUE, and a faculty resident to be
chosen unanimously by the other four
members.
"If the Faculty Master has the re
sponsibility for running Wilbur," he
should have an ultimate vote on the
appeals board," Rhinelander said in an
interview with the Daily last night.
Rhinelander informally discussed
the compromise with Hutchinson,
members of the Committee of Fifteen,
and members of CUE last week.
In the meeting yesterday, CUE
voted to substitute the appeals pro
cedure recommended by Rhinelander
for their previous resolution in which
the final veto of sponsor selection
rested with CUE. The previous resolu
tion was unacceptable to thes ponsors.
"The appeals procedure seemed ap
propriate and the committee was will
ing to delegate the selection of spon
sors to the selection committee with
the appeals mechanism," stated Dean
Robert Wert, Chairman of CUE.
"But CUE is still charged by the fac
ulty and President of the University
with the responsibility for operating
policy at Wilbur," he added. "The Com

mittee can revise the system if it fails
to work out."
A 1 Taylor, Head Wilbur Sponsor,
considers the compromise "extremely
satisfactory."
"The essence of our position was,
one, that the selection committee have
the final say, and two, that the spon
sors were willing to compromise on
an appeals committee with strong
sponsor representation," he stated.
According to Taylor, the Head Spon
sor will represent the selection com
mittee in the affirmative and the Fac
ulty Master will represent the nega
tive view on the appeals board. The
other three members would be "un
committed."
Crucial Vote
He sees the faculty resident, selected
unanimously by the other four mem
bers, as the "crucial fifth-man deciding
vote."
In the finalized procedure for spon
sor selection, the selection committee
will narrow the list of applicants to
40 names. These names will be sent to
CUE for recommendations, reserva
tions and comments.
Twenty-five sponsors and some al
ternates will then be chosen by the
selection committee and the names
will be submitted to Hutchinson. If
Hutchinson objects to any of the
choices, the appeals procedure goes
into effect.
According to Taylor, this procedure
differs only in minor ways from the
procedure proposed by the sponsors
a month ago.
In the earlier proposal, the appeals
board consisted of two sponsors, to
be chosen by the Head Sponsor; one
faculty resident, to be chosen by the
faculty residents; one member of
CUE; and a fifth member to be
chosen unanimously by the other four
from the University as a whole.
Committee of 15
"The controversy was never a dis
pute over the vote of the Faculty
Master on the appeals board," Taylor
stated, "but a dispute over the final
vote of CUE and the Faculty Master."
The controversy was referred to
the Committee of Fifteen two weeks
ago when CUE and the Wilbur spon
sors arrived at two separate proposals
for selection of next year's sponsors.
"The Committee of Fifteen made
informal suggestions to the con
cerned parties and helped bring them
together," Rhinelander stated.
Sponsor applications for the stu
dents, leaving for overseas are due
tomorrow at 5 p.m. Interviews will
be held this week for those students.
March 29 deadline is the deadline
for the other applicants. Interviews
will be held in April.

cedure recommended by Rhinelander
for their previous resolution in which
the final veto of sponsor selection
rested with CUE. The previous resolu
tion was unacceptable to thes ponsors.
"The appeals procedure seemed ap
propriate and the committee was will
ing to delegate the selection of spon
sors to the selection committee with
the appeals mechanism," stated Dean
Robert Wert, Chairman of CUE.
"But CUE is still charged by the fac
ulty and President of the University
with the responsibility for operating
policy at Wilbur," he added. "The Com

mittee can revise the system if it fails
to work out."
A 1 Taylor, Head Wilbur Sponsor,
considers the compromise "extremely
satisfactory."
"The essence of our position was,
one, that the selection committee have
the final say, and two, that the spon
sors were willing to compromise on
an appeals committee with strong
sponsor representation," he stated.
According to Taylor, the Head Spon
sor will represent the selection com
mittee in the affirmative and the Fac
ulty Master will represent the nega
tive view on the appeals board. The
other three members would be "un
committed."
Crucial Vote
He sees the faculty resident, selected
unanimously by the other four mem
bers, as the "crucial fifth-man deciding
vote."
In the finalized procedure for spon
sor selection, the selection committee
will narrow the list of applicants to
40 names. These names will be sent to
CUE for recommendations, reserva
tions and comments.
Twenty-five sponsors and some al
ternates will then be chosen by the
selection committee and the names
will be submitted to Hutchinson. If
Hutchinson objects to any of the
choices, the appeals procedure goes
into effect.
According to Taylor, this procedure
differs only in minor ways from the
procedure proposed by the sponsors
a month ago.
In the earlier proposal, the appeals
board consisted of two sponsors, to
be chosen by the Head Sponsor; one
faculty resident, to be chosen by the
faculty residents; one member of
CUE; and a fifth member to be
chosen unanimously by the other four
from the University as a whole.
Committee of 15
"The controversy was never a dis
pute over the vote of the Faculty
Master on the appeals board," Taylor
stated, "but a dispute over the final
vote of CUE and the Faculty Master."
The controversy was referred to
the Committee of Fifteen two weeks
ago when CUE and the Wilbur spon
sors arrived at two separate proposals
for selection of next year's sponsors.
"The Committee of Fifteen made
informal suggestions to the con
cerned parties and helped bring them
together," Rhinelander stated.
Sponsor applications for the stu
dents, leaving for overseas are due
tomorrow at 5 p.m. Interviews will
be held this week for those students.
March 29 deadline is the deadline
for the other applicants. Interviews
will be held in April.
The heated sponsor selection contro
versy was resolved yesterday when the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
(CUE) passed a compromise proposal
informally recommended by some
members of the Committee of Fifteen

and supported by the sponsors and the
Wilbur Faculty Master.
The compromise establishes a stu

would make the final decision if Dr.
Eric Hutchinson, Wilbur Faculty
Master, vetoes any choice of the spon
sor selection committee.
The compromise proposal is there

suit of a meeting last week between
Dr. Philip Rhinelander, Chairman of
the Committee of Fifteen, and three
sponsors. Hutchinson was invited, but
was unable to attend.

agreed to support the student-faculty
appeals board, which had been sug
gested a month ago by the sponsors, if

the faculty master was given a vote
on the board.
Appeals Board
It was decided that the appeals
board should consist of the Head Wil

Master, one other sponsor, a member
of CUE, and a faculty resident to be
chosen unanimously by the other four
members.
"If the Faculty Master has the re
sponsibility for running Wilbur," he
should have an ultimate vote on the
appeals board," Rhinelander said in an
interview with the Daily last night.

Twenty-five sponsors and some al
ternates will then be chosen by the
selection committee and the names
will be submitted to Hutchinson. If
Hutchinson objects to any of the
choices, the appeals procedure goes
into effect.
According to Taylor, this procedure
differs only in minor ways from the
procedure proposed by the sponsors
a month ago.
In the earlier proposal, the appeals
board consisted of two sponsors, to
be chosen by the Head Sponsor; one
faculty resident, to be chosen by the
faculty residents; one member of
CUE; and a fifth member to be
chosen unanimously by the other four
from the University as a whole.
Committee of 15
"The controversy was never a dis
pute over the vote of the Faculty
Master on the appeals board," Taylor
stated, "but a dispute over the final
vote of CUE and the Faculty Master."
The controversy was referred to
the Committee of Fifteen two weeks
ago when CUE and the Wilbur spon
sors arrived at two separate proposals
for selection of next year's sponsors.
"The Committee of Fifteen made
informal suggestions to the con
cerned parties and helped bring them
together," Rhinelander stated.
