# North Vietnamese Students Censure Hanoi
## Vietnamese Students 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
Four North Vietnamese students
who had fled from Eastern Europe to
West Germany were here yesterday
to discuss their views on Vietnam. A
press conference was held at 10 a.m.,
followed by an informal discussion
and lunch, an afternoon rendezvous
with SCPV, and a question and answer
session at 4:15 p.m.
The students, Phem Phu Oanh, Phan
Phuc Vinh, Nguyen Tanh Hung, and
Nguyen Khe, are ending a month-long
tour of American college campuses,
sponsored by the South Vietnamese
government and the U.S. State Depart
ment.

Because none of the four speaks
English, the students have been ac
companied by Nguyen Bich, a South
Vietnamese graduate student from
Columbia University, who is fluent in
eight languages.
Communism 'Unnatural'
Moderator Dick Williams opened the
morning press conference by asking
the students to explain why they de
fected. Oanh explained three reasons:
(1) he wished to live a normal life as
a free student with initiative, (2) com
munism seemed "unnatural" to him,
and (3) although no one in his family
was affected, he objected to the brutal
ity accompanying North Vietnamese
land reforms.
Nguyen Thanh Hung said, "The only
freedom left in North Vietnam is the
freedom to study communism." He also
charged that North Vietnam is being
developed as a bastion of communism,
not to help the Vietnamese people but
to form a base for the spread of com
munism throughout Southeast Asia.
Hung also mentioned that the com
munists had destroyed the wealth of
his relatives.
Oanh dramatically compared the
presence of French troops with Ameri
can soldiers in Vietnam. The colonialist
French had been there for 80 years,
ho explained, while the U.S. has been
only recently invited to intervene by
South Vietnam.
Saigon Briefing
Although none of the four students
has been in North Vietnam since 1961,
all four were recently flown in for a
month's briefing in Saigon. It was the
first trip to the South for Vinh. Dur
ing that month the students talked
with South Vietnamese students and
government officials.
Bich, the interpreter, remarked dur
ing lunch that he was last in Vietnam
in 1962. He has been out of the country
since 1956, with the exception of the
1962 trip and another trip in 1959. Dur

ing each of his visits to Saigon he
noticed many physical changes, and
also changes in attitudes of the people,
he said.
All of the students have expressed a
desire to return to South Vietnam after
their studies, to participate in what
they call the "social revolution." Al
though they are firmly anti-commun
ists, the students have emphasized that
they believe socialism is necessary for
progress and reform in their country.
Medicine, Not Ideas
Vinh said, "South Vietnam needs
American military help and medicine,
but we are not interested in American
ideology or political ideals." If the
United States should attempt to re

main in Vietnam after the Viet Cong
were subdued, the South Vietnamese
would fight the Americans, according
to Vinh.
A newsman cited desertions of over
96,000 per year in the Vietnamese
army as evidence that the populace
opposes the war against the Viet Cong.
Vinh argued that these desertions do
not mean the soldiers favor the Viet
Cong, but that they are returning to
their farms and villages to feed their
families.
The SCPV used students fluent in
both English and German in its dis
cussion session. The discussion opened
with Nguyen Hung emphasizing the
role of the North Vietnamese govern

ment in the Viet Cong. He maintained
that the Viet Cong are solely North
Vietnamese infiltrators.
Nguyen Khe modified this by stating
that relatives of anti-French Vietna
mese who had been forced to flee the
North in 1954 remained in the South
and might be pro-North. "In the last
few years, it has become clear that
there will be war as long as the com
munists are in South Vietnam," said
Khe.
Hanoi Control
An SCPV member argued that the
Vietnamese people would win the war,
identifying the Viet Cong with the
Vietnamese people. Thus, one of the
major disagreements between the stu
dents and the SCPV concerns to what
extent the Viet Cong are controlled by
Hanoi.
Vinh argued that Diem's overthrow
was proof of the demand by the South
Vietnamese for honesty in their gov
ernment. He personally has no enthus
iasm for the Ky government, but pre
fers it to Hanoi.
Under Ky, he continued, there is at
least a chance to criticize or praise,
while Hanoi is totalitarian. Regimes
may come and go, but the Saigon re
gime will always fight communism,
said Vinh.
U.S. Aid Requested
Hung called Castro's takeover of
Cuba an internal revolution, where
the U.S. had no right to interfere. But
in South Vietnam, he reiterated, the
communist North Vietnamese had in
vaded, and the U.S. had been requested
to help.
"At one time everyone in America
saw that America should help the
Vietnamese," claimed Phan Phuc Vinh,
"but now that it's getting hard for
America, Americans say it's too diffi
cult, and a civil war. South Vietnamese
students feel American student dem
onstrators who cry for peace are cry
ing out of fear."


One of the four North Vietnamese
students wlio spoke in Tresidder yes
terday about his decision to leave his
homeland gestures to make his point.
"The only freedom left in North Viet
nam," ono of them said, "is the freedom
to study communism."

role of the North Vietnamese govern

ment in the Viet Cong. He maintained
that the Viet Cong are solely North
Vietnamese infiltrators.
Nguyen Khe modified this by stating
that relatives of anti-French Vietna
mese who had been forced to flee the
North in 1954 remained in the South
and might be pro-North. "In the last
few years, it has become clear that
there will be war as long as the com
munists are in South Vietnam," said
Khe.
Hanoi Control
An SCPV member argued that the
Vietnamese people would win the war,
identifying the Viet Cong with the
Vietnamese people. Thus, one of the
major disagreements between the stu
dents and the SCPV concerns to what
extent the Viet Cong are controlled by
Hanoi.
Vinh argued that Diem's overthrow
was proof of the demand by the South
Vietnamese for honesty in their gov
ernment. He personally has no enthus
iasm for the Ky government, but pre
fers it to Hanoi.
Under Ky, he continued, there is at
least a chance to criticize or praise,
while Hanoi is totalitarian. Regimes
may come and go, but the Saigon re
gime will always fight communism,
said Vinh.
U.S. Aid Requested
Hung called Castro's takeover of
Cuba an internal revolution, where
the U.S. had no right to interfere. But
in South Vietnam, he reiterated, the
communist North Vietnamese had in
vaded, and the U.S. had been requested
to help.
"At one time everyone in America
saw that America should help the
Vietnamese," claimed Phan Phuc Vinh,
"but now that it's getting hard for
America, Americans say it's too diffi
cult, and a civil war. South Vietnamese
students feel American student dem
onstrators who cry for peace are cry
ing out of fear."


One of the four North Vietnamese
students wlio spoke in Tresidder yes
terday about his decision to leave his
homeland gestures to make his point.
"The only freedom left in North Viet
nam," ono of them said, "is the freedom
to study communism."
Four North Vietnamese students
who had fled from Eastern Europe to
West Germany were here yesterday
to discuss their views on Vietnam. A
press conference was held at 10 a.m.,
followed by an informal discussion
and lunch, an afternoon rendezvous
with SCPV, and a question and answer
session at 4:15 p.m.
The students, Phem Phu Oanh, Phan
Phuc Vinh, Nguyen Tanh Hung, and
Nguyen Khe, are ending a month-long
tour of American college campuses,
sponsored by the South Vietnamese
government and the U.S. State Depart
ment.

Because none of the four speaks
English, the students have been ac
companied by Nguyen Bich, a South
Vietnamese graduate student from
Columbia University, who is fluent in
eight languages.
Communism 'Unnatural'
Moderator Dick Williams opened the
morning press conference by asking
the students to explain why they de
fected. Oanh explained three reasons:
(1) he wished to live a normal life as
a free student with initiative, (2) com
munism seemed "unnatural" to him,
and (3) although no one in his family
was affected, he objected to the brutal
ity accompanying North Vietnamese
land reforms.
Nguyen Thanh Hung said, "The only
freedom left in North Vietnam is the
freedom to study communism." He also
charged that North Vietnam is being
developed as a bastion of communism,
not to help the Vietnamese people but
to form a base for the spread of com
munism throughout Southeast Asia.
Hung also mentioned that the com
munists had destroyed the wealth of
his relatives.
Oanh dramatically compared the
presence of French troops with Ameri
can soldiers in Vietnam. The colonialist
French had been there for 80 years,
ho explained, while the U.S. has been
only recently invited to intervene by
South Vietnam.
Saigon Briefing
Although none of the four students
has been in North Vietnam since 1961,
all four were recently flown in for a
month's briefing in Saigon. It was the
first trip to the South for Vinh. Dur
ing that month the students talked
with South Vietnamese students and
government officials.
Bich, the interpreter, remarked dur
ing lunch that he was last in Vietnam
in 1962. He has been out of the country
since 1956, with the exception of the
1962 trip and another trip in 1959. Dur

ing each of his visits to Saigon he
noticed many physical changes, and
also changes in attitudes of the people,
he said.
All of the students have expressed a
desire to return to South Vietnam after
their studies, to participate in what
they call the "social revolution." Al
though they are firmly anti-commun
ists, the students have emphasized that
they believe socialism is necessary for
progress and reform in their country.
Medicine, Not Ideas
Vinh said, "South Vietnam needs
American military help and medicine,
but we are not interested in American
ideology or political ideals." If the
United States should attempt to re

main in Vietnam after the Viet Cong
were subdued, the South Vietnamese
would fight the Americans, according
to Vinh.
A newsman cited desertions of over
96,000 per year in the Vietnamese
army as evidence that the populace
opposes the war against the Viet Cong.
Vinh argued that these desertions do
not mean the soldiers favor the Viet
Cong, but that they are returning to
their farms and villages to feed their
families.
The SCPV used students fluent in

munists had destroyed the wealth of
his relatives.
Oanh dramatically compared the
presence of French troops with Ameri
can soldiers in Vietnam. The colonialist
French had been there for 80 years,
ho explained, while the U.S. has been
only recently invited to intervene by
South Vietnam.
Saigon Briefing
Although none of the four students
has been in North Vietnam since 1961,
all four were recently flown in for a
month's briefing in Saigon. It was the
first trip to the South for Vinh. Dur
ing that month the students talked
with South Vietnamese students and
government officials.
Bich, the interpreter, remarked dur
ing lunch that he was last in Vietnam
in 1962. He has been out of the country
since 1956, with the exception of the
1962 trip and another trip in 1959. Dur

ing each of his visits to Saigon he
noticed many physical changes, and
also changes in attitudes of the people,
he said.
All of the students have expressed a
desire to return to South Vietnam after
their studies, to participate in what
they call the "social revolution." Al
though they are firmly anti-commun
ists, the students have emphasized that
they believe socialism is necessary for
progress and reform in their country.
Medicine, Not Ideas
Vinh said, "South Vietnam needs
American military help and medicine,
but we are not interested in American
ideology or political ideals." If the
United States should attempt to re

main in Vietnam after the Viet Cong
were subdued, the South Vietnamese
would fight the Americans, according
to Vinh.
A newsman cited desertions of over
96,000 per year in the Vietnamese
army as evidence that the populace
opposes the war against the Viet Cong.
Vinh argued that these desertions do
not mean the soldiers favor the Viet
Cong, but that they are returning to
their farms and villages to feed their
families.
The SCPV used students fluent in
both English and German in its dis
cussion session. The discussion opened
with Nguyen Hung emphasizing the
role of the North Vietnamese govern

ment in the Viet Cong. He maintained
that the Viet Cong are solely North
Vietnamese infiltrators.
Nguyen Khe modified this by stating
that relatives of anti-French Vietna
mese who had been forced to flee the
North in 1954 remained in the South
and might be pro-North. "In the last
few years, it has become clear that
there will be war as long as the com
munists are in South Vietnam," said
Khe.
Hanoi Control
An SCPV member argued that the
Vietnamese people would win the war,
identifying the Viet Cong with the
Vietnamese people. Thus, one of the
major disagreements between the stu
dents and the SCPV concerns to what
extent the Viet Cong are controlled by
Hanoi.
Vinh argued that Diem's overthrow
was proof of the demand by the South
Vietnamese for honesty in their gov
ernment. He personally has no enthus
iasm for the Ky government, but pre
fers it to Hanoi.
Under Ky, he continued, there is at
least a chance to criticize or praise,
while Hanoi is totalitarian. Regimes
may come and go, but the Saigon re
gime will always fight communism,
said Vinh.
U.S. Aid Requested
Hung called Castro's takeover of
Cuba an internal revolution, where
the U.S. had no right to interfere. But
in South Vietnam, he reiterated, the
communist North Vietnamese had in
vaded, and the U.S. had been requested
to help.
"At one time everyone in America
saw that America should help the
Vietnamese," claimed Phan Phuc Vinh,
"but now that it's getting hard for
America, Americans say it's too diffi
cult, and a civil war. South Vietnamese
students feel American student dem
onstrators who cry for peace are cry
ing out of fear."


One of the four North Vietnamese
students wlio spoke in Tresidder yes
terday about his decision to leave his
homeland gestures to make his point.
"The only freedom left in North Viet
nam," ono of them said, "is the freedom
to study communism."
Four North Vietnamese students
who had fled from Eastern Europe to
West Germany were here yesterday
to discuss their views on Vietnam. A
press conference was held at 10 a.m.,
followed by an informal discussion
and lunch, an afternoon rendezvous
with SCPV, and a question and answer
session at 4:15 p.m.
The students, Phem Phu Oanh, Phan
Phuc Vinh, Nguyen Tanh Hung, and
Nguyen Khe, are ending a month-long
tour of American college campuses,
sponsored by the South Vietnamese
government and the U.S. State Depart
ment.

Because none of the four speaks
English, the students have been ac
companied by Nguyen Bich, a South
Vietnamese graduate student from
Columbia University, who is fluent in
eight languages.
Communism 'Unnatural'
Moderator Dick Williams opened the
morning press conference by asking
the students to explain why they de
fected. Oanh explained three reasons:
(1) he wished to live a normal life as
a free student with initiative, (2) com
munism seemed "unnatural" to him,
and (3) although no one in his family
was affected, he objected to the brutal
ity accompanying North Vietnamese
land reforms.
Nguyen Thanh Hung said, "The only
freedom left in North Vietnam is the
freedom to study communism." He also
charged that North Vietnam is being
developed as a bastion of communism,
not to help the Vietnamese people but
to form a base for the spread of com
munism throughout Southeast Asia.
Hung also mentioned that the com
munists had destroyed the wealth of
his relatives.
Oanh dramatically compared the
