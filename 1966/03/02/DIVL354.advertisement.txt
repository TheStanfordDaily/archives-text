Jerusalem: Future Capital of the World
Ancient Jerusalem is mentioned in manuscripts dating as far back as
the second millenium before Christ. Called in the Bible, Zion," the city of
David" and"the city of a great king," Jerusalem has been the center of the
bloodiest and most terrible wars known to man. During the siege and desola
tion of 70 A.D., occupants of the city were forced to roast and eat their own
children to ovoid starvation. Only in the light of the future restoration of
Jerusalem does this city merit its name, "city of peace."
Since the time of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who plundered and
looted Jerusalem six centuries before Christ, the city has been under foreign
domination almost continuously. At the present time, in fact, the Jews have
access only to the outskirts of the old city. Jesus Christ said, And they (the
Jews) shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive info
all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the
times of the Gentiles are fulfilled" (Luke 21:24). According to the Bible, as
long as Jerusalem remains in the hands of non-Jews, Gentile nations will
dominate the world. When the Jews again control their city the "times of the
Gentiles" will end and Jerusalem will become the capital of the world.
"Thus says the lord of hosts: People shall yet come, even the inhabitants
of many cities; the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us
go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord, and seek the Lord of hosts,- I am
going.' Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts
in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the Lord. In those days ten men from
the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying Let us
go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.' " (Zechariah 8:20-23).
Exciting days lie ahead for the Holy City. Daniel's Old Testament prophecy
says that the Jews will one day make a treaty with a "foreign prince" regain
ing access to the historic temple site, reestablishing their worship services for
three and a half years. The foreign prince will, however, break his agreement,
plunging Israel into darkest trial, culminating in large scale war involving
Russia, China, Egypt, and the Gentile powers. It Is this terrible last war
over Israel which will be ended by the invasion from space of the Lord of
lords and King of kings, Jesus Christ, Prince of peace, who will commence
his rule over the nations from Jerusalem.
In the light of prophecy, and world history as well, it is vitally important
that you discover that personal relationship with the King, Jesus Christ, which
will qualify you to share in his great kingdom, soon to come to earth. Jesus
Christ is more concerned about your welfare than you are.

Exciting days lie ahead for the Holy City. Daniel's Old Testament prophecy
says that the Jews will one day make a treaty with a "foreign prince" regain
ing access to the historic temple site, reestablishing their worship services for
three and a half years. The foreign prince will, however, break his agreement,
plunging Israel into darkest trial, culminating in large scale war involving
Russia, China, Egypt, and the Gentile powers. It Is this terrible last war
over Israel which will be ended by the invasion from space of the Lord of
lords and King of kings, Jesus Christ, Prince of peace, who will commence
his rule over the nations from Jerusalem.
In the light of prophecy, and world history as well, it is vitally important
that you discover that personal relationship with the King, Jesus Christ, which
will qualify you to share in his great kingdom, soon to come to earth. Jesus
Christ is more concerned about your welfare than you are.

Jerusalem: Future Capital of the World
Ancient Jerusalem is mentioned in manuscripts dating as far back as
the second millenium before Christ. Called in the Bible, Zion," the city of
David" and"the city of a great king," Jerusalem has been the center of the
bloodiest and most terrible wars known to man. During the siege and desola
tion of 70 A.D., occupants of the city were forced to roast and eat their own
children to ovoid starvation. Only in the light of the future restoration of
Jerusalem does this city merit its name, "city of peace."
Since the time of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who plundered and
looted Jerusalem six centuries before Christ, the city has been under foreign
domination almost continuously. At the present time, in fact, the Jews have
access only to the outskirts of the old city. Jesus Christ said, And they (the
Jews) shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive info
all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the
times of the Gentiles are fulfilled" (Luke 21:24). According to the Bible, as
long as Jerusalem remains in the hands of non-Jews, Gentile nations will
dominate the world. When the Jews again control their city the "times of the
Gentiles" will end and Jerusalem will become the capital of the world.
"Thus says the lord of hosts: People shall yet come, even the inhabitants
of many cities; the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us
go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord, and seek the Lord of hosts,- I am
going.' Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts
in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the Lord. In those days ten men from
the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying Let us
go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.' " (Zechariah 8:20-23).
