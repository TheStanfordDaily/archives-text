# 'Pass Or Fair’ Grade System Considered
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER News Editor 
Students long accustomed to the pressure
of Stanford grades may find a pleasant sur
prise in the years to come: partial substitu
tion of letter grades with a simple "pass or
fail" system.
According to Assistant Dean Robert Funk,
the faculty Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation (CUE) is now studying a plan similar
to that in use at Pomona and other colleges.
If the plan is approved, students could take
up to 27 units for which only a "pass" or
"fail" comment would be recorded.
Faculty Survey Conducted
Courses for General Studies and major de
partment requirements would still receive A
through F letter grades.
Funk said a survey of faculty and students
has been made to determine the plan's de
sirability. Most comments have been favora
ble, he said.
According to Dr. James Paulsen, psychia
trist in the student health center, "Stanford
Is presently struggling from a very rigid

policy to one of flexibility. Anything that
would reduce the pressures would help."
. Especially favorable comment comes from
Dr. Fricdrich Strothmann, head of Modern
European Languages Department. Strothmann
says no compromises in excellence for work
in a student's major field should he accepted.
But, he asks, "why should an engineering
student be prohibited from taking a course
on Tolstoy just because his own paper will
probably not be as good as that of an Eng
lish major?
"On the whole, grades measure technical
and professional knowledge. They do not meas
ure intellectual growth." Strothmann says
he would like to liberalize graduation re
quirements "without sacrificing excellence
by encouraging intellectual curiosity."
Others Are Skeptical
Some committee members are skeptical of
the program. Dr. Robert A. Walker, chairman
of General Studies, asserts grades are "in
evitable and unavoidable."
Unfavorable opinion largely comes from
students, too. One senior has pointed out that

"it's not a fear of general courses but pres
sure in one's major to do well" that causes
problems. An embittered philosophy student
added that "there are enough students of lit
tle competence in their own fields. Why en
courage the problem?"
Actually, ungraded courses are not such a
radical innovation at Stanford. During the
first twenty years at the University there
were not grades, or else they were minimized.
Four General Adjectives
The original grading system was based on
four general adjectives: excellent, passed, con
ditional, and failed. The faculty believed stu
dents "should not work for marks." Profes
sors also thought it a burdensome chore to
discriminate among students of comparable
ability.
Yet the original four "basic grades" were
soon expanded to include such terms as un
prepared, indifferent, and lazy.
These comments were the only official rec
ords kept; and grades were not revealed to
students. The registrar, however, found the
system inefficient, and in 1903 the Academic

Council conceded that conventional A, B, C, D
marks might be used on records.
Limited Report Cards
Students still were not permitted to see
these grades but received only pass or fail
comment on report cards.
Five years later —again faced with admin
istrative pressures—the Council agreed that
letter grades could be sent on transcripts to
other universities. And by 1911, student re
port cards were also based on letters.
The adoption of the grade system repre
sented the difficulty of reliable methods of
appraisal. Commented one faculty member at
the time: "Personally, I feel like laying a hand
on anything that will work."
Grade Pressures
Recent reports by various faculty commit
tees have expressed concern with grade pres
sures. The Registrar's Advisory Committee
has noted that despite the rising caliber of
students, the all-University grade-point aver
age has not risen.
"What this indicates," said a report, "is that
our grading system does not and perhaps

cannot measure absolute standards of
achievement; rather, what the grading system
does is to compare students of the present
student body with each other."
Commenting on a trend away from grades,
the Journal of Higher Education noted that
"grades will not soon be abandoned, but their
domain is challenged."
Plans Already Adopted
Many schools have adopted varying methods
to de-emphasize grades. At St. John's in Anna
polis a student attends a conference of all his
instructors and receives oral criticism for his
work.
Cal Tech has abolished grades in the fresh
man year, and Princeton will adopt a modi
fied pass-fail system this spring. Pomona
presently permits students to take a total of
four courses on a pass-fail basis during their
junior and senior years.
Dr. Ernest Strothman, dean of Pomona's
faculty, has remarked that "one of the iron
ies" of the pass-fail system is that those who
use the option are generally students who re
ceive A's and B's anyway.

sented the difficulty of reliable methods of
appraisal. Commented one faculty member at
the time: "Personally, I feel like laying a hand
on anything that will work."
Grade Pressures
Recent reports by various faculty commit
tees have expressed concern with grade pres
sures. The Registrar's Advisory Committee
has noted that despite the rising caliber of
students, the all-University grade-point aver
age has not risen.
"What this indicates," said a report, "is that
our grading system does not and perhaps

cannot measure absolute standards of
achievement; rather, what the grading system
does is to compare students of the present
student body with each other."
Commenting on a trend away from grades,
the Journal of Higher Education noted that
"grades will not soon be abandoned, but their
domain is challenged."
Plans Already Adopted
Many schools have adopted varying methods
to de-emphasize grades. At St. John's in Anna
polis a student attends a conference of all his
instructors and receives oral criticism for his
work.
Cal Tech has abolished grades in the fresh
man year, and Princeton will adopt a modi
fied pass-fail system this spring. Pomona
presently permits students to take a total of
four courses on a pass-fail basis during their
junior and senior years.
Dr. Ernest Strothman, dean of Pomona's
faculty, has remarked that "one of the iron
ies" of the pass-fail system is that those who
use the option are generally students who re
ceive A's and B's anyway.
Students long accustomed to the pressure
of Stanford grades may find a pleasant sur
prise in the years to come: partial substitu
tion of letter grades with a simple "pass or
fail" system.
According to Assistant Dean Robert Funk,
the faculty Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation (CUE) is now studying a plan similar
to that in use at Pomona and other colleges.
If the plan is approved, students could take
up to 27 units for which only a "pass" or
"fail" comment would be recorded.
Faculty Survey Conducted
Courses for General Studies and major de
partment requirements would still receive A
through F letter grades.
Funk said a survey of faculty and students
has been made to determine the plan's de
sirability. Most comments have been favora
ble, he said.
According to Dr. James Paulsen, psychia
trist in the student health center, "Stanford
Is presently struggling from a very rigid

policy to one of flexibility. Anything that
would reduce the pressures would help."
. Especially favorable comment comes from
Dr. Fricdrich Strothmann, head of Modern
European Languages Department. Strothmann
says no compromises in excellence for work
in a student's major field should he accepted.
But, he asks, "why should an engineering
student be prohibited from taking a course
on Tolstoy just because his own paper will
probably not be as good as that of an Eng
lish major?
"On the whole, grades measure technical
and professional knowledge. They do not meas
ure intellectual growth." Strothmann says
he would like to liberalize graduation re
quirements "without sacrificing excellence
by encouraging intellectual curiosity."
Others Are Skeptical
Some committee members are skeptical of
the program. Dr. Robert A. Walker, chairman
of General Studies, asserts grades are "in
evitable and unavoidable."
Unfavorable opinion largely comes from
students, too. One senior has pointed out that

"it's not a fear of general courses but pres
sure in one's major to do well" that causes
problems. An embittered philosophy student
added that "there are enough students of lit
tle competence in their own fields. Why en
courage the problem?"
Actually, ungraded courses are not such a
radical innovation at Stanford. During the
first twenty years at the University there
were not grades, or else they were minimized.
Four General Adjectives
The original grading system was based on
four general adjectives: excellent, passed, con
ditional, and failed. The faculty believed stu
dents "should not work for marks." Profes
sors also thought it a burdensome chore to
discriminate among students of comparable
ability.
Yet the original four "basic grades" were
soon expanded to include such terms as un
prepared, indifferent, and lazy.
These comments were the only official rec
ords kept; and grades were not revealed to
students. The registrar, however, found the
system inefficient, and in 1903 the Academic

Council conceded that conventional A, B, C, D
marks might be used on records.
Limited Report Cards
Students still were not permitted to see
these grades but received only pass or fail
comment on report cards.
Five years later —again faced with admin
istrative pressures—the Council agreed that
letter grades could be sent on transcripts to
other universities. And by 1911, student re
port cards were also based on letters.

"it's not a fear of general courses but pres
sure in one's major to do well" that causes
problems. An embittered philosophy student
added that "there are enough students of lit
tle competence in their own fields. Why en
courage the problem?"
Actually, ungraded courses are not such a
radical innovation at Stanford. During the
first twenty years at the University there
were not grades, or else they were minimized.
Four General Adjectives
The original grading system was based on
four general adjectives: excellent, passed, con
ditional, and failed. The faculty believed stu
dents "should not work for marks." Profes
sors also thought it a burdensome chore to
discriminate among students of comparable
ability.
Yet the original four "basic grades" were
soon expanded to include such terms as un
prepared, indifferent, and lazy.
These comments were the only official rec
ords kept; and grades were not revealed to
students. The registrar, however, found the
system inefficient, and in 1903 the Academic

Council conceded that conventional A, B, C, D
marks might be used on records.
Limited Report Cards
Students still were not permitted to see
these grades but received only pass or fail
comment on report cards.
Five years later —again faced with admin
istrative pressures—the Council agreed that
letter grades could be sent on transcripts to
other universities. And by 1911, student re
port cards were also based on letters.
The adoption of the grade system repre
sented the difficulty of reliable methods of
appraisal. Commented one faculty member at
the time: "Personally, I feel like laying a hand
on anything that will work."
Grade Pressures
Recent reports by various faculty commit
tees have expressed concern with grade pres
sures. The Registrar's Advisory Committee
has noted that despite the rising caliber of
students, the all-University grade-point aver
age has not risen.
"What this indicates," said a report, "is that
our grading system does not and perhaps

cannot measure absolute standards of
achievement; rather, what the grading system
does is to compare students of the present
student body with each other."
Commenting on a trend away from grades,
the Journal of Higher Education noted that
"grades will not soon be abandoned, but their
domain is challenged."
Plans Already Adopted
Many schools have adopted varying methods
to de-emphasize grades. At St. John's in Anna
polis a student attends a conference of all his
instructors and receives oral criticism for his
work.
Cal Tech has abolished grades in the fresh
man year, and Princeton will adopt a modi
fied pass-fail system this spring. Pomona
presently permits students to take a total of
four courses on a pass-fail basis during their
junior and senior years.
Dr. Ernest Strothman, dean of Pomona's
faculty, has remarked that "one of the iron
ies" of the pass-fail system is that those who
use the option are generally students who re
ceive A's and B's anyway.
Students long accustomed to the pressure
of Stanford grades may find a pleasant sur
prise in the years to come: partial substitu
tion of letter grades with a simple "pass or
fail" system.
According to Assistant Dean Robert Funk,
the faculty Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation (CUE) is now studying a plan similar
to that in use at Pomona and other colleges.
If the plan is approved, students could take
up to 27 units for which only a "pass" or
"fail" comment would be recorded.
Faculty Survey Conducted
Courses for General Studies and major de
partment requirements would still receive A
through F letter grades.
Funk said a survey of faculty and students
has been made to determine the plan's de
sirability. Most comments have been favora
ble, he said.
According to Dr. James Paulsen, psychia
trist in the student health center, "Stanford
Is presently struggling from a very rigid

policy to one of flexibility. Anything that
would reduce the pressures would help."
. Especially favorable comment comes from
Dr. Fricdrich Strothmann, head of Modern
European Languages Department. Strothmann
says no compromises in excellence for work
in a student's major field should he accepted.
But, he asks, "why should an engineering
student be prohibited from taking a course
on Tolstoy just because his own paper will
probably not be as good as that of an Eng
lish major?
"On the whole, grades measure technical
and professional knowledge. They do not meas
ure intellectual growth." Strothmann says
he would like to liberalize graduation re
quirements "without sacrificing excellence
by encouraging intellectual curiosity."
Others Are Skeptical
Some committee members are skeptical of
the program. Dr. Robert A. Walker, chairman
of General Studies, asserts grades are "in
evitable and unavoidable."
Unfavorable opinion largely comes from
students, too. One senior has pointed out that

"it's not a fear of general courses but pres
sure in one's major to do well" that causes
problems. An embittered philosophy student
