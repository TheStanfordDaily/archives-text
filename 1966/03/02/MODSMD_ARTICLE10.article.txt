"Send 'cm to Stanford, and
they just don't come home, the
way they used to, Martha," said
one disappointed father to his
wife. He was commenting on a
growing trend at Stanford. Stu
dents are regarding the vaca
tion periods as unique opportu
nities for doing things they can't
seem to find time for during
school sessions.
Spring vacation this year will

be a prime example of a vaca
tion period filled with chances
for new adventures.
For the student afflicted with
wanderlust, several trips have
been planned for various cam
pus groups.
Two of these have been or
ganized by the I-Center. Skiers
and would-be-skiers are invited
to join an I-Center group that
will ski at Yuba Summit, a Na
tional Forest Ski Area which is

reserved exclusively for the
group. Tows are in two sections
and cover a beginners' slope and
an advanced slope.
Ski Instruction
Five instructors will teach
classes in groups of 5 or 6. Eve
ning activities will include ski
movies, dancing, and ice-skating.
The cost of the whole trip is
$78, and reductions are even
available for those owning their
own ski equipment and/or sleep
ing bags. Skiers should sign up
at the I-Center as soon as pos
sible.
The other I-Center trip is an
excursion to Los Angeles being
planned for students from
abroad. The trip will include
visiting families in the Los An
geles area and tours of Disney
land and various motion picture
studios, as well as to places of
particular interest to individual
participating students.
The Los Angeles trip will cost
$42, and students should sign up
at the I-Center this week.

Peter Hayek, United Airline's
student representative is con
ducting a student tour to Ha
waii. This trip is described as
eight days of sunning, swim
ming, and surfing in a brochure
available at the Travel Center.
For the student who prefers
his travels to be more philan
thropic, several work programs
are being planned for spring
break.
The lIR is sponsoring the
Mexicali Project. Pell Fender,
has organized a group of fifty
people to go to Mexacali, where
the Mexicali Rotary will brief
them on projects in which they
will participate. The projects,
requiring work in carpentry,
rennovation, and other manual
labor, will take place in More
los, a community outside of
Mexicali.
Community action work proj
ects are being also organized in
two Bay Area communities for
interested Stanford students.
The projects are being planned
by members of a student semi

nar group which has been meet
ing weekly throughout the quar
ter at the I-Center for luncheon
discussions on aspects of com
munity development, with par
ticular emphasis on student in
volvement in this process.
War In Eden
One group will be working in
the Eden area of southern Ala
meda county, an area which
consists predominantly of Mex
ican American families and
which has begun to be organized
recently as a result of a War
on Poverty program. Student
workers will be under the di
rection of the local leaders of
the neighborhood organizations
which have resulted from this
effort. Activities will include
helping the community in its
current clean-up drive, observ
ing local schools, attending com
munity meetings and possibly
helping in recreation with school
children.
The second group plans to
work under the auspices of the

East Oakland Parish, an "acti
vist" non-sectarian educational
and social action organization
concerned with the resolution
of the city's major social prob
lems. This area as well has been
involved in the War on Poverty
and is currently moving through
a period of adjustment. In Oak
land the students will be partic
ipating in voter registration in
preparation for a coming local
election, attending community
meetings and talking with local
leaders.
Meeting
An information meeting for
all students interested in par
ticipating in either of these two
projects will be held tomorrow
at 4:15 in Room 274 of Tresid
der Union. Applications will be
available at that time.
"Yes, Jeannie," said another

"Once you let 'em become Stan
ford students, the little chicka
dees just don't come home to
roost much." And a tear trickled
out of the corner of his left eye.

For the student afflicted with
wanderlust, several trips have
been planned for various cam
pus groups.
Two of these have been or
ganized by the I-Center. Skiers
and would-be-skiers are invited
to join an I-Center group that
will ski at Yuba Summit, a Na
tional Forest Ski Area which is

reserved exclusively for the
group. Tows are in two sections
and cover a beginners' slope and
an advanced slope.
Ski Instruction
Five instructors will teach
classes in groups of 5 or 6. Eve
ning activities will include ski
movies, dancing, and ice-skating.
The cost of the whole trip is
$78, and reductions are even
available for those owning their
own ski equipment and/or sleep
ing bags. Skiers should sign up
at the I-Center as soon as pos
sible.
The other I-Center trip is an
excursion to Los Angeles being
planned for students from
abroad. The trip will include
visiting families in the Los An
geles area and tours of Disney
land and various motion picture
studios, as well as to places of
particular interest to individual
participating students.
The Los Angeles trip will cost
$42, and students should sign up
at the I-Center this week.

Peter Hayek, United Airline's
student representative is con
ducting a student tour to Ha
waii. This trip is described as
eight days of sunning, swim

available at the Travel Center.
For the student who prefers
his travels to be more philan
thropic, several work programs
are being planned for spring
break.
The lIR is sponsoring the
Mexicali Project. Pell Fender,
has organized a group of fifty
people to go to Mexacali, where
the Mexicali Rotary will brief
them on projects in which they
will participate. The projects,
requiring work in carpentry,
rennovation, and other manual
labor, will take place in More
los, a community outside of
Mexicali.
Community action work proj
ects are being also organized in
two Bay Area communities for
interested Stanford students.
The projects are being planned
by members of a student semi

nar group which has been meet
ing weekly throughout the quar
ter at the I-Center for luncheon
discussions on aspects of com
munity development, with par
ticular emphasis on student in
volvement in this process.
War In Eden
One group will be working in
the Eden area of southern Ala
meda county, an area which
consists predominantly of Mex
ican American families and
which has begun to be organized
recently as a result of a War
on Poverty program. Student
workers will be under the di
rection of the local leaders of
the neighborhood organizations
which have resulted from this
effort. Activities will include
helping the community in its
current clean-up drive, observ
ing local schools, attending com
munity meetings and possibly
helping in recreation with school
children.
The second group plans to
work under the auspices of the

East Oakland Parish, an "acti
vist" non-sectarian educational
and social action organization
concerned with the resolution
of the city's major social prob
lems. This area as well has been
involved in the War on Poverty
and is currently moving through
a period of adjustment. In Oak
land the students will be partic
ipating in voter registration in
preparation for a coming local
election, attending community
meetings and talking with local
leaders.
Meeting
An information meeting for
all students interested in par
ticipating in either of these two
projects will be held tomorrow
at 4:15 in Room 274 of Tresid
der Union. Applications will be
available at that time.
"Yes, Jeannie," said another
disappointed father, to his wife,
"Once you let 'em become Stan

roost much." And a tear trickled
out of the corner of his left eye.
"Send 'cm to Stanford, and
they just don't come home, the
way they used to, Martha," said
one disappointed father to his
wife. He was commenting on a
growing trend at Stanford. Stu

nities for doing things they can't
seem to find time for during
school sessions.

Peter Hayek, United Airline's
student representative is con
ducting a student tour to Ha
waii. This trip is described as
eight days of sunning, swim
ming, and surfing in a brochure
available at the Travel Center.
For the student who prefers
his travels to be more philan
thropic, several work programs
are being planned for spring
break.
The lIR is sponsoring the
Mexicali Project. Pell Fender,
has organized a group of fifty
people to go to Mexacali, where
the Mexicali Rotary will brief
them on projects in which they
will participate. The projects,
requiring work in carpentry,
rennovation, and other manual
labor, will take place in More
los, a community outside of
Mexicali.
Community action work proj
ects are being also organized in
two Bay Area communities for
interested Stanford students.
The projects are being planned
by members of a student semi

nar group which has been meet
ing weekly throughout the quar
ter at the I-Center for luncheon
discussions on aspects of com
munity development, with par
ticular emphasis on student in
volvement in this process.
War In Eden
One group will be working in
the Eden area of southern Ala
meda county, an area which
consists predominantly of Mex
ican American families and
which has begun to be organized
recently as a result of a War
on Poverty program. Student
workers will be under the di
rection of the local leaders of
the neighborhood organizations
which have resulted from this
effort. Activities will include
helping the community in its
current clean-up drive, observ
ing local schools, attending com
munity meetings and possibly
helping in recreation with school
children.
The second group plans to
work under the auspices of the

East Oakland Parish, an "acti
vist" non-sectarian educational
and social action organization
concerned with the resolution
of the city's major social prob
lems. This area as well has been
involved in the War on Poverty
and is currently moving through
a period of adjustment. In Oak
land the students will be partic
ipating in voter registration in
preparation for a coming local
election, attending community
meetings and talking with local
leaders.
Meeting
An information meeting for
all students interested in par
ticipating in either of these two
projects will be held tomorrow
at 4:15 in Room 274 of Tresid
der Union. Applications will be
available at that time.
"Yes, Jeannie," said another
disappointed father, to his wife,
"Once you let 'em become Stan
ford students, the little chicka
dees just don't come home to
roost much." And a tear trickled
out of the corner of his left eye.
