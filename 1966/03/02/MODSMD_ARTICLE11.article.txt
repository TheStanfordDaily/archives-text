# Michigan U. Dissenters Regain 2-SDeferments
## 
### 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (CPS) —
Two of the 14 students at the
University of Michigan who lost
student deferments because of
a sit-in at the local draft board
have had their 2-S status rein
stated.
The students were reclassified
1-A after the Michigan Selective
Service Director, Col. Arthur
Holmes, sent records of their
trial and a suggestion that they
be reclassified to the local
boards of the 14.
They all appealed with the
help of the American Civil Lib
erties Union. Ernest Mazey, di
rector of the Michigan ACLU,
said he was encouragod that the
appeal of two students has been
successful but doubts this indi
cates a pattern for the other 12.
"We do not think the total mat
ter will be resolved until it
reaches the national appeal lev
el or the courts."
Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
the national Selective Service di
rector, has said he would per
sonally handle the appeals if
they reach the national level.

Hershey supported Col.
Holmes' request for the stu
dents to be reclassified and has
been an outspoken advocate of
drafting minor lawbreakers. He
disapproves of a Pentagon rul
ing prohibiting the induction of
men convicted of minor crimes
like stealing hub caps. "What
crimes?" he said last week, "A
joy ride in a stolen car? I'd in
duct them all; it's a lot quicker
than prosecution."
At the request of a Michigan
congressman, the department of
Justice issued an opinion saying
the draft could not be used to
punish lawbreakers and that re
classification of demonstrators
fell in this category. The opinion
has no force and has largely
been ignored by Selective Serv
ice officials.
