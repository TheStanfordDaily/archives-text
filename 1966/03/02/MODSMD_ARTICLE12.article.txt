The field representative of
Scandinavian Seminar, Miss Bar
bara Weiss, will be at the lIR
loft this afternoon to discuss
with faculty and students the
Seminar program for the 1966-
67 academic year in Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
Scandinavian Seminar, now in
its seventeenth year, offers
American students the oppor
tunity to study in Scandinavian
residential schools, and to live
as members of Scandinavian
families.
The student stays with a fam
ily at the outset, speaking the
language daily, and sharing its
activities in the community.
For the major part of the year
he lives and studies at a folke
hojskoie—a residential school
for young adults. Except during
the general Seminar and lan
guage courses, he is entirely
separated from his fellow Amer
ican students.
At the folkehojskole particu
lar attention is given to the
value of the Scandinavian cul
tural heritage in today's chang
ing world. After a student has
acquired a working knowledge
of the language, he is able to
devote considerable time to in
dependent study and research in
the field of his major interest;
this culminates in the presenta
tion of a project paper.
Miss Weiss, an alumna of the
Scandinavian Seminar in Swe
den in 1962-63, will be able to
answer all questions concerning
applications, qualifications, cur
ricula, college credit procedures,
and apprenticeships relating to
the Seminar's program.
