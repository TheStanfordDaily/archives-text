# Next Year's Women Sponsors To Keep Job Three Quarters
## 
### 
Next year's women sponsors
in Branner and Roble will stay
in their positions for three quar
ters, instead of for two, as has
been the case in the past, the
women's sponsor choosing com
mittee announced today.
The change was made with
the unanimous approval of the
present sponsors. Such a move
had been suggested by several
sponsor groups in the pact, ac
cording to Sasha Harmon, chair
man of the committee.
But the suggestion was al
ways made to the incoming
sponsor group for their deci

sion. The incoming sponsors,
without the experience behind
them on which to base a decision
as to whether staying the third
quarter would be desirable,
would not be able to come to
the conclusion until too late to
put it formally into effect, she
said.
'Natural Resident'
The change, according to Jaci
Wotila, another member of the
committee, implies a somewhat
different idea of the sponsor;
she becomes "more a person
who is living on the corridor as
a natural resident than some

one who comes in from the out
side and leaves when the job
is done."
Why have women sponsors
in the past left after the second
quarter, when men sponsors re
main for the third?
The role of the sponsor was
at one time very tied up with
her administrative duties as
house and corridor officer, ac
cording to Valerie Olander, Ro
ble sponsor. It was thought that
if sponsors stayed a third quar
ter, they would tend to impose
on the freedom of the freshman
officers to "run things" them
selves, she said.
'Momism'
If sponsors are seen not in
terms of administration or
"Momism," but in terms of be
ing intellectual catalysts, of of
fering different viewpoints and
pointing out opportunities avail
able in the university communi
ty, then their function does not
come to a natural end with Win
ter Quarter, Miss Wotila said.
"The sponsor groups from
now on will be able to plan
more on a long-term basis," she
explained. "Two quarters are not
enough time to realize all the
possibilities of the sponsor pro
gram."
Accustomed Residence
"Though it may seem to a
sponsor at the beginning of the
year that she will want the
third quarter free, this is often
not the case; the dorm has be
come one's accustomed resi
dence, which it seems unnatural
as well as inconvenient to leave,"
said Miss Wotila. "You are just
beginning to know some people,
or to start on projects; many
new possibilities are just open
ing up."
Sponsors will receive two
quarters of free room instead of
one, as has been done in the
past.
In line with the change to
three quarters, a plan is also
being proposed whereby fresh
man house officers would be
chosen in the middle of the first
quarter, rather than second
quarter, as has been done. Spon
sors would serve as advisers,
but would not be officers, al
lowing freshmen to assume full
responsibility for their own gov
ernment much sooner.
Academic RA's
Another proposed change, ini
tiated by Miss Sally Mahoney,
director of Roble, would alter
the role of the graduate staff in
Roble and Branner, which un
like men's housing do not have
faculty residents. The resident
assistant and graduate associ
ates would represent such aca
demic fields as English, History,
and Biology, which make up
much of the freshman curricu
lum. Recommended by their de
partments, they would provide
further academic stimulus by
such activities as planning and
leading seminars.
Branner sponsor positions for
next year are still available at
the AWS desk in the AASU of
ficd. Completed applications
will be due Friday. Interviews
will be held early next quarter.

Why have women sponsors
in the past left after the second
quarter, when men sponsors re
main for the third?
The role of the sponsor was
at one time very tied up with
her administrative duties as
house and corridor officer, ac
cording to Valerie Olander, Ro
ble sponsor. It was thought that
if sponsors stayed a third quar
ter, they would tend to impose
on the freedom of the freshman
officers to "run things" them
selves, she said.
'Momism'
If sponsors are seen not in
terms of administration or
"Momism," but in terms of be
ing intellectual catalysts, of of
fering different viewpoints and
pointing out opportunities avail
able in the university communi
ty, then their function does not
come to a natural end with Win
ter Quarter, Miss Wotila said.
"The sponsor groups from
now on will be able to plan
more on a long-term basis," she
explained. "Two quarters are not
enough time to realize all the
possibilities of the sponsor pro
gram."
Accustomed Residence
"Though it may seem to a
sponsor at the beginning of the
year that she will want the
third quarter free, this is often
not the case; the dorm has be
come one's accustomed resi
dence, which it seems unnatural
as well as inconvenient to leave,"
said Miss Wotila. "You are just
beginning to know some people,
or to start on projects; many
new possibilities are just open
ing up."
Sponsors will receive two
quarters of free room instead of
one, as has been done in the
past.
In line with the change to
three quarters, a plan is also
being proposed whereby fresh
man house officers would be
chosen in the middle of the first
quarter, rather than second
quarter, as has been done. Spon
sors would serve as advisers,
but would not be officers, al
lowing freshmen to assume full
responsibility for their own gov
ernment much sooner.
Academic RA's
Another proposed change, ini
tiated by Miss Sally Mahoney,
director of Roble, would alter
the role of the graduate staff in
Roble and Branner, which un
like men's housing do not have
faculty residents. The resident
assistant and graduate associ
ates would represent such aca
demic fields as English, History,
and Biology, which make up
much of the freshman curricu
lum. Recommended by their de
partments, they would provide
further academic stimulus by
such activities as planning and
leading seminars.
Branner sponsor positions for
next year are still available at
the AWS desk in the AASU of
ficd. Completed applications
will be due Friday. Interviews
will be held early next quarter.
Next year's women sponsors
in Branner and Roble will stay
in their positions for three quar
ters, instead of for two, as has
been the case in the past, the
women's sponsor choosing com
mittee announced today.
The change was made with
the unanimous approval of the
present sponsors. Such a move
had been suggested by several
sponsor groups in the pact, ac
cording to Sasha Harmon, chair
man of the committee.
But the suggestion was al
ways made to the incoming
sponsor group for their deci

sion. The incoming sponsors,
without the experience behind
them on which to base a decision
as to whether staying the third
quarter would be desirable,
would not be able to come to
the conclusion until too late to
put it formally into effect, she
said.
'Natural Resident'
The change, according to Jaci
Wotila, another member of the
committee, implies a somewhat
different idea of the sponsor;
she becomes "more a person
who is living on the corridor as
a natural resident than some

one who comes in from the out
side and leaves when the job
is done."
