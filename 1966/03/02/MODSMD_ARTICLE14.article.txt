# Easterners Face Problems In College Admissions

High school students in New
York, New Jersey, and Penn
sylvania have become the na
tion's most disadvantaged in
terms of their chances for col
lege admission.
This conclusion was part of
a nationwide study of college
entrance opportunities an
nounced this week by Gene R.
Hawes, former editor of the
College Board Review.
The study showed that for
the first time this three-state
Middle Atlantic area replaced
New England as the most re
strictive part of the country for
college admission.
Not Keeping Pace
The study, which was released
along with the third edition of
"The New American Guide to
Colleges," indicates that al
though the expansion of higher
education in the past five years
has been substantial, it has not
kept pace with the demand.
As a result, today's college
applicants must be better quali
fied to gain the same admission
as did high school graduates in
1960.
Consequently, the study re
ported, an increasing number of
high school graduates in the
Middle Atlantic area must turn
to colleges in other parts of the
country. The trouble, the study
report said, is that it is becom
ing harder to get into college
even where admission standards
are considered "liberal."
In 1960, 39.2 per cent of the
colleges in New York, New Jer
sey, and Pennsylvania were con
sidered as competitive — this
means they rejected some stu
dents with a B average in high
school and even some with an
A average. In the current re
port, 56.1 per cent of the col
leges in those three states fall
in the competitive bracket.
Low Rate
The study said that while
over a third of the colleges in
the Pacific states, including Cal
ifornia, admits virtually any
high school graduate from their
own state, only 6.1 per cent of
the institutions in the Middle
Atlantic area are considered to
be so liberal. Virtually all state

universities now have high ad
mission requirements for out-of
state students.
The study said it is too early
to determine if increased draft
calls will change the pattern. It
did report, however, that the
increased enrollments due to the
post-World War II baby boom
will level off after this year's
freshman class.
But Hawks warned that op
timistic forecasts that the draft
and the end of the so-called
"baby boom" would cause sub
stantial relief in the admission
problem are misleading.
More Selective
The study said that regional
differences in admission stand
ards are marked. While only a
small minority of the institu
tions — 6.1 per cent — in New
York, New Jersey, and Pennsyl
vania practice open admission
for all or most state high school
graduates, more than half of all
the colleges in Louisiana, Texas,
Arkansas, and Oklahoma are in
that category.
But for the country as a
whole, college admission is get
ting more selective.
