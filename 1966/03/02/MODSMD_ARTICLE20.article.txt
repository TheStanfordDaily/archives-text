# Project Peru Now Taking Applications
## 
### 
Last summer 10 Stanford stu
dents joined 35 other collegians
on a seven-week project in
southern Peru sponsored by the
Peruvian American Council for
Educational Exchange. Students
lived with Peruvian families and
worked on a variety of commu
nity development projects in the
city of Arequipa. Upon comple
tion of service, participants
were free to travel on their own.
A n organizational meeting
will be held tomorrow evening
at 7:30 in Fremont Lounge,
Stern Hall, for anyone interest
ed in participating in the pro
gram this summer. Slides will
be shown and several members
of last year's project will be
available for questioning. Par
ticipants in this year's program
will be assigned to Arequipa,
Tacna, Mollendo, and Lima.
The program enables students
to work and travel in South
America at extremely low cost.
It also gives those students con
templating Peace Corps service
an excellent opportunity to ob
tain first hand information
about the problems they will
face. Cost for participation in
the project is less than the cost
for attending Stanford's Sum
mer Session.
Although the program was
lacking in organization last
year, it was by no means a
failure, according to Bill Chan
dler and Ellen Holmes, Stanford
recruiters for the project. They
felt that the experience of living
with a Peruvian family in itself
made the program worthwhile.
Many participants made note
worthy contributions to the pro
gram and Ted Buenger, a
Princeton undergraduate, re
mained in Arequipa until Christ

summer to increase the pro
