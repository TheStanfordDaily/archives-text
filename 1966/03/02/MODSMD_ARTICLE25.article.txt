# Chrysler's Turbine Display On White Plaza Tomorrow
## Chrysler Exec 
### 
The Chrysler Corporation Tur
bine Car will be on display at
Stanford tomorrow and Friday.
The turbine exhibit is on a na
tionwide tour of colleges and
universities.
The turbine car will be
shown in the Tresidder Union
area and near the Engineering
Building.
The appearance of the turbine
car on campus is sponsored by
the student chapter of American
Society of Me c h a n i c a 1 Engi
neers. A film-lecture presenta
tion on the turbine will be given
tomorrow at 12:15 p.m., Room
238, Engineering Building, by
George J. Huebner, Jr., director
research, Chrysler Corporation.
It is open to all faculty and stu
dents. The 20-minute film de
scribes the history and develop
ment of the turbine at Chrysler,
covering the period from 1954
to the present.
The Car
Highlight of the turbine ex
hibit is the car itself. Also fea
tured is a narrated display unit
which explains the principle and
operation of the turbine engine
and compares it with the Chrys
ler HEMI-426 cubic-inch high
performance engine. Included in
the display are artists' render
ings and a one • fourth scale,
three-dimensional model depict
ing far-future styling concepts.
The turbine car being shown
is one of 50 limited production
vehicles that was specially de
signed and hand-built lor a na
tionwide consumer evaluation
program that was recently com
pleted.
Two-Year Research
In the two-year research pro
gram, which began with the de
livery of a turbine to the first
user in October, 1963, 203 select
ed average motorists in 133
cities in 48 states drove the cars
on a rotating basis for three

months each. The program was
completed January 28, with the
return of the last user car. Dur
ing the test period turbine users
drove an accumulated total of
1,000,000 miles in all types of
climate and terrain under nor
mal everyday driving conditions.
All Identical
The turbine cars are identical
in body style, color, and other
features. Each is a distinctively
styled four-passenger, two-door
hardtop. The roof is covered
in black vinyl and the car is col
ored Turbine Bronze with a har
monizing bronze interior trim
combination.
Turbine research and develop
ment at Chrysler goes back to
World War II with the develop
ment. of a turbo-prop engine for
the Navy. Extensive automotive
application studies began in
1949. In 1954 Chrysler road-test
ed the first turbine-powered pas
senger car—a 1954 production
model Plymouth.

Subsequent road - testing of
newly developed engines in later
model cars led to the present
turbine car, which is powered
by the company's "fourth gener
ation" engine. This engine is rat
ed at 130 horsepower, equivalent
in over-all car activity to a 230
horsepower V-8 piston engine.
The turbine engine contains 80
per cent fewer moving parts
than the piston engine and
weighs only two-thirds as much


George J. Huebner, Jr., director
of research for Chrysler Corpor
ation, will give a film-lecture
presentation on Chrysler's Tur
bine Car.
