# Class Too Big--- Teacher Ejects Goldwaterites
## 
### 
NEW YORK (CPS) â€” When
Prof. Mary E. Dillon, Queens
College, discovered her political
science course was overcrowded
by 50, she hit upon a method of
weeding out the excess.
She asked students who had
supported Goldwater and New
York mayoral candidate Wil
liam F. Buckley Jr., to come to
the front of the room. The twen
ty students who responded were
told they were the excess.
Dr. Dillon, in defending her
action, said she ejected the stu
dents because she "might say
things during this class that
would offend the Goldwater peo
ple."
The "excess" students feel Dr.
Dillon "solved the problem in a
very arbitrary and discrimina
tory manner." One of the stu
dents, Allan Zimmerman, said,
"Every student and faculty
member we have talked to agree
that she is totally wrong."
The results of an investigation
by a faculty committee appoint
ed by the co 11 eg e president
found the students had indeed
been ejected in the manner they
claimed.
