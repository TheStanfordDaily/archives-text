# Stanford's Apollo Astronaut Casting Eyes Toward Moon
## 
### 
America's five scientist-astro
nauts now readying themselves
for manned space flights won't
be finished training in time to
make a Gemini flight, according
to the Stanford University mem
ber of the quintet.
"However, we will be involved
in Appolo programs," said Prof.
Owen K. Garriott in an inter
view published by the IEEE
Spectrum, a journal of the Insti
tute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers.
"These will involve not only
earth orbital but lunar orbital
and lunar landing flights," he
said, "and I would be very hap
py to participate in any of
these."
On Leave
Now in jet flight training in
Arizona, Prof. Garriott is on
leave from his teaching and re
search post at Stanford's Radio
science Laboratory. With com
pletion of his jet training in
mid-year he expects to move on
to NASA's Manned Spacecraft
Center in Houston, Texas,
where he will begin astronaut
schooling.
He has been told that addition
al scientist-astronauts will be
selected for the program, he
said, but there has been no word
as to when NASA will call for
applications. As the only electri
cal engineer chosen so far, he
had encouraging words for oth
er aspirants in this field.

"In a general way I don't see
how clectrical engineering could
fail to be a very useful back
ground for an individual who is
interested in the space pro
gram," said Prof. Garriott. "Al
most everything related to
spacecraft and to space commu
nications comes back to elec
tronics; an engineer's under
standing of how things operate
is bound to be of value.
Talent and Experience
"The engineer whose talents
and research experience are in
as broad an area as possible, not
only with electronic equipment
but with other fields as well—
geophysics, astronomy, physics,
medicine, biomedical research —
will be the one most likely to
be of value in the space pro
gram.
"I should imagine that the ef
forts of the scientist-astronauts
in the space program will be
necessarily very much broader
than the research that we have
been doing in the past. For one
thing, there are very few of us,
at least so far, and there are ex
periments to be done over a
very wide range.
"As one example, the intensi
ty of the sun's rays in the ultra
violet spectrum, as they pene
trate more and more deeply into
the earth's atmosphere, might
be studied from earth orbit with
instruments on the spacecraft
observing the intensity of vari
ous spectral lines.

"There are, of course, un
manned instruments doing just
that, but there are many more
things that might be done better
if a man were there to operate
the instruments.
In a lunar orbit, which offers
more intriguing aspects, all
sorts of electromagnetic sensing
would be possible. You could

study radio transmissions from
the earth reflected from the lu
nar surface. You could yourself
transmit and then receive
echoes back from the lunar sur
face and study these as a func
tion of position.
"Any number of new astro
nomical studies could be under
taken because you're beyond the
atmosphere of the earth. In the
ultraviolet and the infrared re
gions you could undertake stu
dies not possible from the
earth's surface. You could study
radiation from stars and from
the rest of the solar system."
Scientist's Role
Asked if the scientist-astro
nuats expect to have a hand in
proposing the experiment, he re
plied:
"Yes, but we'll be on the same
basis as any other experimenter
—university, industry, or other
wise."

Scientist's Role
Asked if the scientist-astro

America's five scientist-astro
nauts now readying themselves
for manned space flights won't
be finished training in time to
make a Gemini flight, according
to the Stanford University mem

"However, we will be involved
in Appolo programs," said Prof.
Owen K. Garriott in an inter
view published by the IEEE
Spectrum, a journal of the Insti
tute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers.
"These will involve not only
earth orbital but lunar orbital
and lunar landing flights," he
said, "and I would be very hap

On Leave
Now in jet flight training in
Arizona, Prof. Garriott is on
leave from his teaching and re
search post at Stanford's Radio
science Laboratory. With com
pletion of his jet training in
mid-year he expects to move on
to NASA's Manned Spacecraft
Center in Houston, Texas,
where he will begin astronaut
schooling.
He has been told that addition
al scientist-astronauts will be
selected for the program, he
said, but there has been no word
as to when NASA will call for
applications. As the only electri
cal engineer chosen so far, he
had encouraging words for oth
er aspirants in this field.

"In a general way I don't see
how clectrical engineering could
fail to be a very useful back
ground for an individual who is
interested in the space pro
gram," said Prof. Garriott. "Al
most everything related to
spacecraft and to space commu
