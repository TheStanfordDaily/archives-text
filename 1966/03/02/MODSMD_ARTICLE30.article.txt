# Gymnasts To Host Agile Bears
## 
### HUGH WEST 
The victorless Stanford gym
nasts have the unenviable task
this weekend of defending their
home ground against possibly
the most powerful team in the
nation. The Indians host awe
some California in the Pavilion
at 7:30 p.m. Friday evening.
The Bears are so strong, Stan
ford Coach John Gilmore points
out, that "they can have a man
miss a meet and they have to
fill in the gaps with men who
score only 8.3."
The Bears' record remains un
blemished this season â€”in fact,
they have only lost three of 70
meets over the past nine years.
The latest victim of the on
slaught was UCLA, who fell last
week by the score of 186-164.
The following night the beat
en Bruins appeared at the Stan
ford Pavilion and summarily
whipped the Indians 170-97. That
meet was an average meet for
the Tribe, the highlight being
Bob Cooke's 8.3 ring routine.
The Bruins were led by Kunati
Allen, who collected 50.5 Ail-
Around points. Allen's 9.65 on
the horizontal bar is the highest
score in the nation in that event
to date. A 9.3 long horse score
also contributed to his total.

Bruin Dave Leuber also starred
in the horizontal bar with a 9.3
score, giving the Uclans, like
vermouth and gin, one of the
best bar combinations in the
nation.
Three nearly equal Ail-
Around men, Sid Freudinstein,

Dave Millman, and Rick Field,
form not only the backbone, but
rib cage and appendages of the
acrobatic Bear. Most teams are
happy to have one good all
around man. Cal has three who
all score well over 50 points.
The wealth of additional talenj

which Coach Harold Jacob Frey
draws from forms just addi
tional muscle. A good bicep or
two comes in the form of Josh
Robison, who scores consistenly
in the 9.5-9.6 range in the rings
and was last year's AAWU
champion in that event.
As well as several freshman,
former national champion Russ
Mills will perform in exhibition
on the side horse for Stanford.
Mills, a Ph.D. candidate in bio
physics at Stanford and a Yale
graduate, has invented several
moves which have now become
official. In winning the national
championship in 1963-64, he gar
nered the following scores from
the judges: 9.8, 9.9, 9.9, and 10.0!
