# Stanford Hopes Golf Able To Make National Swim Champ
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Stanford links will be the
scene of a "Splash-A-Round Golf
Tournament" March 18. The
tournament has been organized
by Stanford swimming coach
Jim Gaughran to sponsor a
Stanford freshman team trip to
the National AAU Swimming
Championships in Tampa, April
3-5.
Gaughran sees a genuine
chance for Stanford freshmen
to win the nationally televised
meet. The freshmen, with world

In a recent promotional
tournament at the University
of California six Stanford ju
doists were promoted to
brown belt. George Bardsley,
Prentice Fish, John Neale,
and Barry Kwok were pre
sented their third degTee
brown l>elts respectively.

record holders Dick Roth and
Luis Nicolao, and high school
All-Americans in some 24 events
will certainly be in contention.
Roth and Nicolao can garner

possibly four first places in the
individual events, and the Pa
poose's 400 medley, 400 free
style, and 800 freestyle relays
will all be in the running for
number one. With these per
formances added to the points
the frosh could pick up on the
side, the freshmen just might
take it away.
In The Nation's Eyes
Winning the national AAU's
would "put Stanford right in
front of the country," in Gaugh
ran's words. The ramifications
of this victory would be wide
indeed, both athletically and
otherwise.
Greg Buckingham, Stanford
student who won three gold
medals at the AAU's last year,
will also go to the meet. The
AAU national committee pays
for transportation of previous
gold medalists. Buckingham will
get a free ride, as will Nicolao
who won the 100 yards butterfly
last year.
Gaughran hopes to be able
to send several members of the
varsity as well, noting Mike
Wall in the distance freestyle
events and Bob Momsen in the
breaststroke, as well as the 800
free relay.
However, the incessant NCAA
AAU bickering has thrown an
alligator into the pool. A college
freshman team can swim toge
ther in the AAU's, but the var
sity cannot swim with the fresh

men unless all the competitors
swim for the same AAU team
in the summer.
Violation of these regulations
causes loss of a year of NCAA
eligibility for each of the fresh
man swimmers. If the Stanford
varsity, Buckingham, and the
freshmen could swim together,
interesting results might come
to pass. Alas.
Gaughran figures the best
chance for a team victory lies
with the freshmen, and there
fore his first goal is to be able
to raise enough money to send
an adequate freshman team.
Fat Prizes
The "Splash-A-Round Tourna
ment" charges an entry fee of
$50 per man. Competition will
be conducted in foursomes, the
winning foursome to receive a
prize of $100 per man.
An awards barbeque featuring
a water show and a record at
tempting relay will be held at
the Ladera Oaks Swimming and
Tennis Club after the tourna
ment.
Gaughran also suggested the
possibility that several of the
Wilbur houses might want to
sponsor a foursome of golfers
in the tournament to help send
enough Stanford freshman
swimmers to take the national
championship.
