# Heavy Hangs The Draft
## 
### 
By announcing plans for testing draft-aged
college males, General Lewis B. Hershey has
once again thrown light on the injustices of the
Selective Service System.
In an effort to give appearances of the great
est possible good to an inherently bad struc
ture, the general has announced that class rank
ings will be supplemented with aptitude tests
in order to give local draft boards another cri
terion on which to make their selections. Such
a move, we feel, is inadequate to deal with the
problems the draft creates.
To begin with, the system is premised almost
entirely upon "the national interest," and there
by denies any possibility that individuals, col
lectively, may be of more worth than collected
individuals.
As Senator Robert Kennedy points out, draft
aged males who might have the brains to at
tend college, but financially are unable to do
so, are discriminated against. This accounts for
the high percentage of Negroes in the armed
services.
Moreover, the system refuses to recognize
individual differences even among those whom
it has allowed to stay in college for purposes of
"national interest." The student who feels he
must take a quarter off to regroup his thoughts,
the student who drops out for a year to travel,
the student who temporarily withdraws in or
der to earn enough money to able him to con
tinue—they are all reclassified 1-A, although

their individual educations usually are pro
gressing in as satisfactory a manner as possible.
For Stanford students, the threat of the draft
may deny an individual the opportunity to at
tend an overseas campus if he is not able to
attend seven consecutive quarters of school.
The system, then, is doing its best to limit the
scope and breadth of a student's education.
As for the aptitude tests, General Hershey
himself has described such examinations as
having "only the appearance of being fair. It
tends," he said recently, "to get cocked over
toward the mathematical, because it's easier to
grade, for one thing." General Hershey, it ap
pears, cares not in the least about the educa
tion of people, but only about the training of
technicians. The humanities and social sciences,
apparently, are not in the national interest.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the
national interest has little or nothing to do with
President Johnson's self-proclaimed goal of al
lowing every citizen the opportunity to develop
himself fully. Some educators, including John
Monro of Harvard and John Seely of Brandeis,
have seen the dangers inherent in Hershey's
thinking, and have been quick to make them
selves heard. But Stanford's administrators,
even in the face of a frontal assault upon the
Inner City, have seen fit to remain silent.
It is time for some serious re-thinking, at
both the national and local levels, on meeting
man-power requirements during a time of war;
it is time to repel General Hershey's charge.

tend an overseas campus if he is not able to
attend seven consecutive quarters of school.
The system, then, is doing its best to limit the
scope and breadth of a student's education.
As for the aptitude tests, General Hershey
himself has described such examinations as
having "only the appearance of being fair. It
tends," he said recently, "to get cocked over
toward the mathematical, because it's easier to
grade, for one thing." General Hershey, it ap
pears, cares not in the least about the educa
tion of people, but only about the training of
technicians. The humanities and social sciences,
apparently, are not in the national interest.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the
national interest has little or nothing to do with
President Johnson's self-proclaimed goal of al
lowing every citizen the opportunity to develop
himself fully. Some educators, including John
Monro of Harvard and John Seely of Brandeis,
have seen the dangers inherent in Hershey's
thinking, and have been quick to make them
selves heard. But Stanford's administrators,
even in the face of a frontal assault upon the
Inner City, have seen fit to remain silent.
It is time for some serious re-thinking, at
both the national and local levels, on meeting
man-power requirements during a time of war;
it is time to repel General Hershey's charge.
By announcing plans for testing draft-aged
college males, General Lewis B. Hershey has
once again thrown light on the injustices of the
Selective Service System.
In an effort to give appearances of the great
est possible good to an inherently bad struc
ture, the general has announced that class rank
ings will be supplemented with aptitude tests
in order to give local draft boards another cri
terion on which to make their selections. Such
a move, we feel, is inadequate to deal with the
problems the draft creates.
To begin with, the system is premised almost
entirely upon "the national interest," and there
by denies any possibility that individuals, col
lectively, may be of more worth than collected
individuals.
As Senator Robert Kennedy points out, draft
aged males who might have the brains to at
tend college, but financially are unable to do
so, are discriminated against. This accounts for
the high percentage of Negroes in the armed
services.
Moreover, the system refuses to recognize
individual differences even among those whom
it has allowed to stay in college for purposes of
"national interest." The student who feels he
must take a quarter off to regroup his thoughts,
the student who drops out for a year to travel,
the student who temporarily withdraws in or
der to earn enough money to able him to con
tinue—they are all reclassified 1-A, although

their individual educations usually are pro
gressing in as satisfactory a manner as possible.
For Stanford students, the threat of the draft
may deny an individual the opportunity to at
tend an overseas campus if he is not able to
attend seven consecutive quarters of school.
