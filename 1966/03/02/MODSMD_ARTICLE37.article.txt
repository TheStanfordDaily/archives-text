# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Jesus, Jews And The CCC 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Contemporary Christians
on Campus, believing them
selves to be God's Finest and
His Own Elect, have once again
seen fit to be magnanamous:
they are proclaiming (Daily,
Feb. 25) their pity not only for
poor erring sinners in general,
but also for the Jews, who, it
must be remembered, bear a spe
cial guilt.
"No other people have suf
fered like the Jews." "... the
ologians wrestle with the prob
lems of their guilt. . . The
deep South certainly has no
monopoly on sanctimonious ra
cist cant, here made all the
worse by its patronizing, quasi
tolerant attitude.
Though it is regrettable that
anyone should be "so horribly
murdered, gassed, butchered .. ."
still, they sorta got what wuz
comin' to 'em: this is the un
deniable tone of the ad. Look
here, O Holy Contemporaries: if
your Jesus works in strange and
wonderful ways by arranging
for millions of people to be mur
dered simply because they be
long to a particular religious
cultural group; if He supports
racist ravings, I don't think I'd
care to make His acquaintance!

• Grain Of Salt
Editor, The Daily:
What has happened to the
treasured landmark of the
Crothers-Toyon-Branner walk—
the "THOU ART PETER" rock?
Either the rock has been stolen
by a discerning petrophile or re
moved by an insensitive mem
ber of the grounds crew. Any in
formation which would expose
the perpetrators of this vile act
would be welcomed since we
wish to see the rock restored to
its hallowed site.

• From The City
Editor, The Daily:
We non-humans who work our
minds and our papers through
the night, truly "took a warm
bath" (as Aaron Copland put
it) with your feature pictorial
article, "The campus at night"
(The Daily, Feb. 24). It is most
unfortunate that The Daily can
not present a feature on the
sounds of the night. The magical
combinations of the purring of
patrol cars, the jangling of

nightwatchman's keys, the ex
plosive rumblings of garbage
machinery, and the crackling of
radiators, would, I am con
vinced, even impress Copland's
musical computer.

• Not On The Chron
Editor, The Daily:
I know that a lot of papers,
including The Chronicle, would
like to hire Lisa Hobbs away
from The Examiner. So far we
have fended them off.
And now you fellows have
stepped in and without a by
your-leave, have given our Lisa
to the Voice of Fifth and Mis
sion Streets (The Daily, Feb. 24).
The only thing that puzzles
me is, just who in the hell does
cover Stanford for the Chroni
cle? Mary Madison does a good
job for us—Lisa Hobbs has only
been on the campus once in her
life—but no regular Chron
stringer has ever come to my no
tice.

• Human Element
Editor, The Daily:
I can only wonder that the
Administration has not yet
taken the trouble to have the
somewhat distasteful "Batman"
slogans removed from their po

sitions of prominent display
about campus. I can remember
equally distasteful slogans in
the past that somehow were
removed within hours of the
deed itself, rather than weeks.
I see one bright aspect about
this whole business, however,
that causes me some cheer. It
is this, that such vulgar actions
as these will never again cloud
the academic atmosphere of our
happy institution as I have it
on good authority that our
brave defender, Batman, and
his little friend, Robin, have re
cently come to the patriotic con
clusion that they would indeed
be better service to our com
munity if they enlisted in the
Marines and went to Vietnam to
"Kill VC."

• Entrepreneurs
Editor, The Daily:
While I read with interest Jim
Selna's article on the front page
of the Feb. 24 Daily, and ap
plaud the initiative of student
entrepreneurs such as Jim
Binns, I do object to such front
page plug for his principals.
As an unhappy Auto Europe
customer, I would recommend
all their prospective customers
to take the claims outlined in
the sales literature with a grain
of salt.
