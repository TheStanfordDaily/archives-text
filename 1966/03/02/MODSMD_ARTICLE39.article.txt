# The

## The
						Unhappy Zemululuian Sets Up A Military Coup 
### Art Buchwald 
The Prime Minister of Zemu
lulu was in Washington last
week, and as the leader of the
only democracy left in Africa,
he has been very much criti
cized in diplomatic circles and
at the United Nations.
I was fortunate to have a few
moments alone with him.
Only Democracy
"Sir, how do you explain the
fact that you are the only
democracy left in Africa?"
"I have a weak army," he said
sadly.
"I'm sorry to hear that," I
said.
"That is one of the reasons I
have come to the United States.
I hope to get military aid so I
can beef up my armed forces.
Once the army is strong
enough, I'm sure they'll want
to overthrow the government.
Then I can retire to Switzer
land. The climate in my country
is abominable."
"Mr. Prime Minister, there
has been much criticism of your
form of government in interna
tional circles. No one can un
derstand how a country of your
size and your potential can still

allow free elections and permit
opposition parties to flourish."
Young Nation
"What people don't realize is
that we're a young nation that
was under colonial rule for a
very long time. We would wel
come military rule in a minute
if we knew how to achieve it.
We haven't chosen freedom be
cause we wanted it. At the time
it seemed the only way out of
our dilemma. Someday, when
we get on our feet, we hope to
have a dictatorship like every
one else in Africa, but it takes
time."
"In your inauguration speech
of 1965 you promised to do
away with free elections and to
exile all the opposition parties.
Why haven't you fulfilled these
promises?"
"Because, if I did that, I would
be playing into the hands of the
opposition. There is nothing the
opposition wants more than to
be exiled. The climate in my
country is something fierce."
"Mr. Prime Minister, one of
the big fears in the West is that,
in a democracy such as yours,
there is always a chance of a
Communist takeover. This is one
of the reasons why the West
feels much more secure with a
military dictatorship. What
guarantees do we have that un
der your system the Commu
nists won't win an election?"
"We've tried to get the Com
munists to take over, but they've
refused. They keep saying, 'Who
wants to rule a country with
such an unhealthy climate?"
"What do you see in the fu
ture for Zemululu?"
Plotting
"We have to produce a strong
officer corps which will become
discontented very easily. It Is
my hope that we can train
enough officers abroad so, as
soon as they return, they will
start plotting against the gov
ernment. This will take time. We
should have started the program
much earlier. I also need tanks,
a few airplanes, and one fully
equipped armored regiment.
Without the equipment the most
militant officers could never
pull off a coup."
"And you hope to arrange all
this while you're in the United
States?"
"They've provided this for
other African countries. I don't
see any reason why they would
turn me down."
"Suppose they refuse to help
you?"
"My people are getting fed up
with democracy. We have a right
to a military government like
everybody else. If we don't get
help from the United States, we
will take the matter to the
United Nations. Even a UN trus
teeship would be better than
what we've got now."
"How long will you stay in
Washington?"
"As long as I can. I hate to
go back to that lousy climate."
