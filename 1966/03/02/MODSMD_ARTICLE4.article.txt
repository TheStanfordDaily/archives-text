# Committee Accepts Proposal; Humanities Major Now Offered
## 
### GORDON STRAUSS 
Last Wednesday, the Committee on
Honors Programs in Humanities ap
proved a student-initiated plan for a
humanities major at Stanford, Pro
fessor Jeffrey Smith of the Humani
ties Special Programs Department
announced.
The proposal was submitted by a
sub-committee composed of three
students and three members of the
faculty. Seniors Sidney Ilillyer and
Kersten Kraft and Junior Jeff Diefen
dorf joined with Professors John
Dodds, Edwin Good, and Jeffrey
Smith in forming the proposal, which
will allow students to approach
Honors in Humanities through a ma
jor in humanities rather than as a
minor in conjunction with some other
departmental major.
The new program will go into ef
fect Spring Quarter. At that time any
Freshman or Sophomore maintaining
a "B" average or better may petition
for a major in humanities. The pro
gram will also be open to Juniors
next fall if they make the decision
within the first two weeks of the
quarter.

As stated in the Committee's final
proposal. "A legitimate field of con
centration must have a definite direc
tion and purpose which is not en
compassed by any departmental ma
jor offered at Stanford." As a result,
it is most likely that the areas of
concentration will tend to overlap in
many departments. For example, a
person interested in American studies
might involve himself in Ameri
can history, literature, or art.
As soon as a student's petition is
accepted, he is assigned a tutor from
the Humanities Honors Program
Committee.
"The only opposition to the idea
stemmed from the fear that the pro
gram might become a haven for dile
tante seeking a smattering of every
thing," explained Miss Hillyer. "To
prevent this, we've made the require
ments as tough as those which al
ready exist for any other honors pro
gram."
"Specifically, all present courses re
quired for the Honors Humanities
program will be required for the ma
jor. In addition, there are an extra
40 units required in the student's field

of concentration, and a four-hour,
written, comprehensive examination
taken at the end of the second week
of the student's last quarter as an
undergraduate."
A student must maintain a "B"
average and pass the exam with at
least a "B" in order to graduate with
honors in humanities.
"This new program will affect a
very few students," Miss Hillyer said,
"about a dozen or so. The various de
partments at Stanford already
offer so many area majors that only
a very small number will find it
necessary to major in humanities."
"The students showed great initi
ative," stated committee member
Jeffery Smith. "The whole procedure
was extremely promising; the pro
posal was submitted, discussed and
approved."
