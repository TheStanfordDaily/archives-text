# 'Prophets' Try To Reform By Encouraging Conflicts
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Prophets are supposed to be
few in the modern world, but
Stanford, it seems, has had
more than its share. The past
two editors of The Daily and the
present speaker of the Legisla
ture have seen themselves as
saviors to the University.
The Prophet
What is a prophet? Is it some
one who has all the answers to
the University's problems? Is
it the one person who can
arouse the masses of apathetic
students to seek reform? Is it
the one person who can stimu
late the whole society through
the instrument of the Univer
sity? For these self-appointed
prophets, it has been all three.
You can recognize them by
their nervous impatience. Their
impatience has led them to feel
every campus reform must be
accomplished while they are in
a position of influence. Impa
tience led Nancy Steffen to pub
lish the Crow-Halverson Report.
Impatience led Jay Kadane to in
clude the meaningless "we as
sert" clause in the LASSU reso
lution on the Crow-Halverson
Report. Impatience and its frus
tration led Steve Leopold's vol
ume to end "with a wimper."
Their impatience made it im
possible to work with the ad
ministration, and even with oth
er interested students.
If impatience is their first
characteristic, then a belief in
conflict as the best vehicle of
change follows from it. With
out sufficient time to work with
the administration, to learn
how to relate to them, the only
answer is conflict. They've
sought resolutions and bills con
tradicting University policy.

They've urged open disobedience
of University regulations.
And yet, it is these same people
that complain that the adminis
tration refuses to work with stu
dents. Maybe the students more
often refuse to work with the
administration. These prophets
have backed themselves into a
very difficult corner. On one
hand they want cooperation, and
on the other they are so impa
tient they make it impossible.
Nevit Sanford, speaking at a
Higher Education Conference
for College Editors in Berkeley
this past weekend, pointed out
that colleges have no built-in in
stitution for reform and critic
ism and that students must
therefore be an educational re
former. However, he pointed out
the reality that the students can
not possibly have all the answers.
Much less can we expect one stu
dent to have them all.
Student's Role
The student's role as educa
tional reformers is, then: to crit
icize, to express his dissatisfac
tion, to try to understand what
he needs and what the University
needs. Then he must work out
solutions, participating with the
administration and faculty,
through cooperation and not con
flict.
The cooperation which result
ed in the Trustees' approval of
freedom of worship two weeks
ago showed that it can be done.
By working with the President's
Advisory Committee on Religion,
the campus ministers, and the
Student Committee on Religion,
the solution was possible.
Stanford has not had more
than its share of prophets. It has
just had more than its share of
pseudo-prophets in high posi
tions.

pseudo-prophets in high posi
tions.
Prophets are supposed to be
few in the modern world, but
Stanford, it seems, has had
more than its share. The past
two editors of The Daily and the
present speaker of the Legisla
ture have seen themselves as
saviors to the University.
The Prophet
What is a prophet? Is it some
one who has all the answers to
the University's problems? Is
it the one person who can
arouse the masses of apathetic
students to seek reform? Is it
the one person who can stimu
late the whole society through
the instrument of the Univer
sity? For these self-appointed
prophets, it has been all three.
You can recognize them by
their nervous impatience. Their
impatience has led them to feel
every campus reform must be
accomplished while they are in
a position of influence. Impa
tience led Nancy Steffen to pub
lish the Crow-Halverson Report.
Impatience led Jay Kadane to in
clude the meaningless "we as
sert" clause in the LASSU reso
lution on the Crow-Halverson
Report. Impatience and its frus
tration led Steve Leopold's vol
ume to end "with a wimper."
Their impatience made it im
possible to work with the ad
ministration, and even with oth
er interested students.
If impatience is their first
characteristic, then a belief in
conflict as the best vehicle of
change follows from it. With
out sufficient time to work with
the administration, to learn
how to relate to them, the only
answer is conflict. They've
sought resolutions and bills con
tradicting University policy.

They've urged open disobedience
of University regulations.
And yet, it is these same people
that complain that the adminis
tration refuses to work with stu
dents. Maybe the students more
often refuse to work with the
administration. These prophets
have backed themselves into a
very difficult corner. On one
hand they want cooperation, and
on the other they are so impa
tient they make it impossible.
Nevit Sanford, speaking at a
Higher Education Conference
for College Editors in Berkeley
this past weekend, pointed out
that colleges have no built-in in
stitution for reform and critic
ism and that students must
therefore be an educational re
former. However, he pointed out
the reality that the students can
not possibly have all the answers.
Much less can we expect one stu
dent to have them all.
Student's Role
The student's role as educa
tional reformers is, then: to crit
icize, to express his dissatisfac
tion, to try to understand what
he needs and what the University
needs. Then he must work out
solutions, participating with the
administration and faculty,
through cooperation and not con
flict.
The cooperation which result
ed in the Trustees' approval of
freedom of worship two weeks
ago showed that it can be done.
By working with the President's
Advisory Committee on Religion,
the campus ministers, and the
Student Committee on Religion,
the solution was possible.
