# Student-Faculty Panel To Clarify Draft Programs
## 
### 
Stu-Fac Board is sponsoring a dis
cussion of the current student draft
deferment situation in Memorial Aud
itorium today at 4:15.
According to National Service Di
rector, Walter J. Findeisen, "The pur
pose of the meeting is to explain
some of the ramifications of the selec
tive service criteria and also to ex
plain the new ROTC two-year plans."
Findeisen noted that he has still
received no official notice concerning
the adoption of a testing system sim
ilar to the one used during the Kor
ean war.
"I can't imagine a Stanford student
not doing well on the test," he added.
"It will be just one more reason for
a board to give a man a deferment."
Findeisen anticipates that the test
will not be very challenging and that
it will be geared to high-school level
material.
Although Stanford has not yet been
invited to participate as a test center
by the Science Research Associates,
national coordinators, the Counseling
and Testing Center is making plans
to administer the test.
Of three announced testing dates,
only the first two, May 14 and 21,
will be convenient for Stanford stu
dents. The third, June 3, is already
scheduled as the first day of Spring
Quarter finals.
The faculties and administrations
of some colleges are opposing the
adoption of a testing system. How
ever, Findeisen does not believe "our
faculty is so ill-advised. It's a simple
matter of complying with the law,
and of supplying the material re
quested," he added. He felt that fail
ure to cooperate may increase a man's
chances of being drafted.
"Our position at Stanford has
always been, and I asume will con
tinue to be, that we will provide any
information required to enhance the
possibility of deferment," Findeisen
affirmed.
Findeisen, Navy Captain Carroll
Brigham, Air Force Major Harry
Matthews, and Army Colonel David

Nanney will comprise the panel. After
discussing general questions, the
panel will answer the specific audi
ence questions.
Leslie Gaillard, Stu-Fac Board mem
ber, stressed that the presentation Is
not intended to present the pros and
cons of the draft. "The speakers will
not attempt to justify the draft, but
will clarify intricacies of the present
system for those who have decided
not to be Conscientious Objectors,"
she commented.

it will be geared to high-school level
material.
Although Stanford has not yet been
invited to participate as a test center
by the Science Research Associates,
national coordinators, the Counseling
and Testing Center is making plans
to administer the test.
Of three announced testing dates,
only the first two, May 14 and 21,
will be convenient for Stanford stu
dents. The third, June 3, is already
scheduled as the first day of Spring
Quarter finals.
The faculties and administrations
of some colleges are opposing the
adoption of a testing system. How
ever, Findeisen does not believe "our
faculty is so ill-advised. It's a simple
matter of complying with the law,
and of supplying the material re
quested," he added. He felt that fail
ure to cooperate may increase a man's
chances of being drafted.
"Our position at Stanford has
always been, and I asume will con
tinue to be, that we will provide any
information required to enhance the
possibility of deferment," Findeisen
affirmed.
Findeisen, Navy Captain Carroll
Brigham, Air Force Major Harry
Matthews, and Army Colonel David

Nanney will comprise the panel. After
discussing general questions, the
panel will answer the specific audi
ence questions.
Leslie Gaillard, Stu-Fac Board mem
ber, stressed that the presentation Is
not intended to present the pros and
cons of the draft. "The speakers will
not attempt to justify the draft, but
will clarify intricacies of the present
system for those who have decided
not to be Conscientious Objectors,"
she commented.
Stu-Fac Board is sponsoring a dis
cussion of the current student draft
deferment situation in Memorial Aud
itorium today at 4:15.
According to National Service Di
rector, Walter J. Findeisen, "The pur
pose of the meeting is to explain
some of the ramifications of the selec
tive service criteria and also to ex
plain the new ROTC two-year plans."
Findeisen noted that he has still
received no official notice concerning
the adoption of a testing system sim
ilar to the one used during the Kor
ean war.
"I can't imagine a Stanford student
not doing well on the test," he added.
"It will be just one more reason for
a board to give a man a deferment."
Findeisen anticipates that the test
will not be very challenging and that
it will be geared to high-school level
material.
