The King of the Jews
"Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers plaited a crown
of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe, and they
came to him saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' and struck him with their hands.
Pilate went out again and said to them, Behold I am bringing him out to you
so that you may know that I find no crime in him.' . . . Pilate sought to re
lease Jesus, but the Jews cried out, If you release this man, you are not
Caesar's friend; everyone who makes himself a king sets himself againist
Caesar' . . . Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king?' The chief priests
answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.' Then they handed him over to them
to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to
the place called the place of the skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus
between them. Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, Jesus
of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.' . . . and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin,
and in Greek" (Gospel of John, Chapter 19).
And thus the record of the Bible describes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ,
the greatest Jew who ever lived, the deepest teacher who ever spoke. Quite a
few people have never looked much further into this unique and remarkable
man of history whose return from the dead three days later is a well-established
fact.
Two thousand years have gone, but the plans of God have not been
altered, nor the return of Jesus Christ delayed. He is due back, from outer
space, in regal power and kingly might:
"I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! He who sat upon it is
called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His
eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has
a name inscribed which no one knows but himself. He is clad in a robe dipped
in blood, and the name by which he is called is the Word of God. And the
armies of heaven arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, followed him on white
horses. From his mouth issues a sharp two-edged sword with which to smite
the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron,- he will tread the wine
press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his
thigh he has a name inscribed, King of kings and Lord of lords" (Revelation 19).
Have you met the King of the Jews—We mean personally, in your own
life as rightful Lord and Master? Have you received God's forgiveness for your
share in his cruicifixion (whether Jew or Gentile)? The coming King of all
mankind will soon return. All that really matters in this world is your own
relationship with him.

Caesar's friend; everyone who makes himself a king sets himself againist
Caesar' . . . Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king?' The chief priests
answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.' Then they handed him over to them
to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to
the place called the place of the skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus
between them. Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, Jesus
of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.' . . . and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin,
and in Greek" (Gospel of John, Chapter 19).
And thus the record of the Bible describes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ,
the greatest Jew who ever lived, the deepest teacher who ever spoke. Quite a
few people have never looked much further into this unique and remarkable
man of history whose return from the dead three days later is a well-established
fact.
Two thousand years have gone, but the plans of God have not been
altered, nor the return of Jesus Christ delayed. He is due back, from outer
space, in regal power and kingly might:
"I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! He who sat upon it is
called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His
eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has
a name inscribed which no one knows but himself. He is clad in a robe dipped
in blood, and the name by which he is called is the Word of God. And the
armies of heaven arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, followed him on white
horses. From his mouth issues a sharp two-edged sword with which to smite
the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron,- he will tread the wine
press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his
thigh he has a name inscribed, King of kings and Lord of lords" (Revelation 19).
Have you met the King of the Jews—We mean personally, in your own
life as rightful Lord and Master? Have you received God's forgiveness for your
share in his cruicifixion (whether Jew or Gentile)? The coming King of all
mankind will soon return. All that really matters in this world is your own
relationship with him.

The King of the Jews
"Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers plaited a crown
of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe, and they
came to him saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' and struck him with their hands.
Pilate went out again and said to them, Behold I am bringing him out to you
so that you may know that I find no crime in him.' . . . Pilate sought to re
lease Jesus, but the Jews cried out, If you release this man, you are not
Caesar's friend; everyone who makes himself a king sets himself againist
Caesar' . . . Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king?' The chief priests
answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.' Then they handed him over to them
to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to
