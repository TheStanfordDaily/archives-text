# Stanford Awaits Hospital Decision
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council Finance
Committee failed to come to a decis
ion Tuesday on Stanford's proposal to
buy the Palo Alto half of the Palo
Alto-Stanford Medical Center. Accord
ing to the Palo Alto Times, the com
mittee reported yesterday that more
information was needed before a de
cision could be made.
Dr. Robert Glaser, Dean of Stan
ford's Medical School, said, "the Stan
ford section isn't providing enough
spaace for the training of medical
students."
Both Dr. Glaser and the members
of the committee agree that if Stan
ford is to take over the hospital, the
committee will require that Palo Alto
build a commtfnity hospital.
An additional question which must
be answered is: If Palo Alto is to
have a community hospital, should it
be for Palo Alto only, or a larger area.
The needs of Palo Alto would require
a 137 bed hospital, but if the service
area were larger, 550 beds would be
necessary.
Dr. Glaser said Hoover Pavilion
would make "an excellent community
hospital." Hoover is the renovated
Palo Alto Hospital, located on Stan
ford land near El Camino Real but
close to the newer medical center.
He said the pavilion already has
150 beds and could be modernized to
include more complete operating and
delivery rooms, and, possibly, better
laboratory and X-ray facilities.
Councilman Beahrs said, "It would
be foolish to put a lot of money into
Hoover."
