# The
						Face Of Mississippi
## 
### 
The Mississippi River winds meth
odically through the rich cotton-grow
ing plains of the South. Once past
Memphis, it forms the western bor
der of Mississippi. Within 50 miles
of the muddy waters exist some of
the richest land and poorest people
of America.
The photographer, Mary King, has
worked for the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
since 1963, part of that time in con
nection with a visual aids project.
She is married to Stanford student
Dennis Sweeney, who also has
worked in Mississippi.
