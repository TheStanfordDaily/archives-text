# IVS Seeks Volunteers For Vietnam Work
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
Not all Americans in Vietnam
today are soldiers. Some are
working in villages, teaching
English in high schools or as
sisting in self-help projects.
These young men and wom
en are part of International Vol
untary Services, a private or
ganization whose recruiting offi
cer is on campus today.
Vietnam is only one of many
countries in which IVS volun

teers are working. According
to Bill Meyers, recruiting offi
ce!', "IVS has projects in Laos,
North Borneo, Malaysia, and Al
geria. We hope to establish oth
ers soon in Kuwait and Libya."
Emphasis on Asia
Main emphasis, however, is
on Laos, where there are now
60 volunteers and on South
Vietnam where there are more
than 50. With increased finan
cial aid from private donors and
the American government, IVS
hopes to double these figures in
the next year.
Most IVS volunteers are col
lege graduates with training
that relates either to education
or to rural development. Once
chosen, they participate in an
intensive orientation program to
learn Vietnamese language and
customs.
Sent to Provinces
IVS volunteers who teach
English are usually sent in
groups of two or three to a high
school or normal school in the
provinces. Mr. Meyers relates
that "the Vietnamese people—
and especially the youth—are
anxious to learn our language.
There is more demand for this
than we can possibly meet."
An important part of IVS
work in Vietnam has been work
ing with youth. Volunteers
helped to establish a summer
service camp in which 5,000
Vietnamese students partici
pated. "The leaders in this ser
vice project," Mr. Meyers re
counted, "are the same ones
who led the riots which felled
the Diem regime. They're still
concerned about political prog
ress in their country, and they
think that, these camps are now
the best way to promote it."
Two Year Contract
Volunteers for IVS sign a con
tract for two years. During that

time they are paid all their ex
penses—round-trip air trans
portation, housing, food, cloth
ing allowance, and medical care.
In addition, they receive $80 per
month, plus a month vacation
each year.
IVS has been in Vietnam since
1957, and has developed many
contacts with local leaders and
officials. "We know what they
want," said Mr. Meyers. "They
know what we can do."
Since IVS is a private organi
zation, its members can operate
where no United States officials
are allowed. Mr. Meyers pointed
to Cambodia, where all Ameri
cans except those working for
IVS were expelled in 1963.
300 Volunteers
One of the features of IVS
that distinguishes it from other
service organizations is its
small size and decentralization.
"We only have 250-300 people.
So we don't send someone out
into the provinces and then for
get about him." He added that
supervision is restricted to vis
its from "team leaders" who are
selected according to their ex
perience in the country.
Mr. Meyers will be interview
ing interested students today.
He can be contacted through the
office of Assistant Dean of Stu
dents, Dwight Clark.
