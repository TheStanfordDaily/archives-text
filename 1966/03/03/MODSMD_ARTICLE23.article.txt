# TIGHT FICHT
## AAWU Swim Meet Today 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford swimmers move to
day into the first roimd of the
three • day AAWU Swimming
Championships at the City of
Commerce Pool in Los Angeles.
The meet should develop into a
tight three - way struggle be- -
tween Stanford, USC and
UCLA.
USC, riding on top of two
NCAA championships and a
consecutive dual meet win
string of 70, will be gunning for
its sixth straight AAWU crown.
The Trojans face stiffer op
position with the AAWU than
ever in its history, however.
USC went down to the final re
lay before beating Stanford 53-
42. UCLA, who edged the Indi
ans by 6 inches in the last relay,
to win 51-44, also will be in top
contention.
Southern Cal beat UCLA 70-
25 early in the season, but had
the Bruins turned in the times
they did against Stanford, the
meet would have been decided
by a matter of two or three
points.
Indian Relays Strong
Stanford should place very
high in all three relays, the 400
medley, 400 freestyle, and 800
free. The Indian depth, coupled
with a number of top perform-

Stanford's boxing: team won
two out of three matches in the
Navy Tournament held Tuesday
at Mare Island. Dan Cabrera ad
ministered a knock-out in the
second round while Dave Os

Dave Hibbits lost a decision to
his Cal foe in the 139-pound di

ers in the individual events will
put the Tribe in the heat of run
ning when the aqueous humors
start this afternoon.
Each team can enter four
men per event. An individual
maw swim in three individual
events and all three relays.
Jim Laney returns as confer
ence individual medley cham
pion for Stanford. Laney is hard
to beat on the end of a relay and
in the butterfly races.
Bill Freeman has accrued the
highest point total of any diver
in the conference and will be
tough to beat at 3 meters, his
major competition coming from
Del Pletcher of Cal.
Aside from Laney and Free
man, the Tribe's biggest threat

in the individual events is in the
sophomore class.
Bob Momsen, fastest 200
breaststroker in the conference
so far (2:15.5), will have to
stretch to beat WSU's Bob
Browning, UCLA's Russ Webb,
and USC's two Olympic breast
strokers, Wayne Anderson and
Bill Craig.
Mike Wall holds the fort for
Stanford in the distance free
style events. Wall will have at
least three races against triple-
NCAA champion Roy Saari of
USC.
Mark Parmely looms large
whenever he swims, in the
sprints, middle distance free
style, butterfly, or individual
medley.
Doug Miller aced all USC's
and UCLA's butterfliers two
weeks ago, but will have to cut
a second or two from his best
of 2:01.1 to beat the pack this
weekend.
Schubach On His Back
Varsity captain Bill Schubach
swims the backstroke leg of the
medley relay, as well as 200
back and 200 IM. Schubach has

a history of surprising perform
ances in the AAWU s.
Gary Sheerer will go with
Wall to provide a potent scor
ing combination in the distance
freestyle events.
Bill Meyer and Bill Derrig
face an impressive field in the
50 freestyle, led by UCLA's Jim
Keller (22.1). Parmely may also
join in the sprints. Meyer has
a berth on the Card 400 free
styler elay team.
Charlie Burbach should score
high in the breaststroke and in
the individual medley.
Sprinters Craig Brown and
Mike Greene, butterflier Bill
Manoogian, and diver Bill Ken
nedy round out the Indian
punch.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
sees the chances of a Stanford
victory as good, considering the
closeness of the d%u a 1 meets
against USC and UCLA.
If the Tribe relays come
through, and if the Indians pull
a few switches in the individual
events, Stanford could come out
on top for the first time in six
years.

leads the varsity cagers in scoring with a 19.2 average as they near

consecutive dual meet win
string of 70, will be gunning for
its sixth straight AAWU crown.
The Trojans face stiffer op

ever in its history, however.
USC went down to the final re
lay before beating Stanford 53-
42. UCLA, who edged the Indi
ans by 6 inches in the last relay,
to win 51-44, also will be in top
contention.
Southern Cal beat UCLA 70-
25 early in the season, but had
the Bruins turned in the times
they did against Stanford, the
meet would have been decided
by a matter of two or three
points.

to beat on the end of a relay and
in the butterfly races.
Bill Freeman has accrued the
highest point total of any diver
in the conference and will be
tough to beat at 3 meters, his
major competition coming from
Del Pletcher of Cal.
Aside from Laney and Free
man, the Tribe's biggest threat

in the individual events is in the
sophomore class.
Bob Momsen, fastest 200

Doug Miller aced all USC's

freestyle events.
Bill Meyer and Bill Derrig

Sprinters Craig Brown and
Mike Greene, butterflier Bill

If the Tribe relays come

a few switches in the individual
events, Stanford could come out
on top for the first time in six
years.


STANFORD'S GUARD ART HARRIS, pictured posting the ball,
leads the varsity cagers in scoring with a 19.2 average as they near
the close of this season's conference play. The Indians' final week
end series is against perennial rival Cal.
Stanford swimmers move to
day into the first roimd of the
three • day AAWU Swimming
Championships at the City of
Commerce Pool in Los Angeles.
The meet should develop into a
tight three - way struggle be- -
tween Stanford, USC and
UCLA.
USC, riding on top of two
NCAA championships and a
consecutive dual meet win
string of 70, will be gunning for
its sixth straight AAWU crown.
The Trojans face stiffer op
position with the AAWU than
ever in its history, however.
USC went down to the final re
lay before beating Stanford 53-
42. UCLA, who edged the Indi
ans by 6 inches in the last relay,
to win 51-44, also will be in top
contention.
Southern Cal beat UCLA 70-
25 early in the season, but had
the Bruins turned in the times
they did against Stanford, the
meet would have been decided
by a matter of two or three
points.
Indian Relays Strong
Stanford should place very
high in all three relays, the 400
medley, 400 freestyle, and 800
free. The Indian depth, coupled
with a number of top perform-

ers in the individual events will
put the Tribe in the heat of run
ning when the aqueous humors
start this afternoon.
Each team can enter four
men per event. An individual
maw swim in three individual
events and all three relays.
Jim Laney returns as confer
ence individual medley cham
pion for Stanford. Laney is hard
to beat on the end of a relay and
in the butterfly races.
Bill Freeman has accrued the
highest point total of any diver
in the conference and will be
tough to beat at 3 meters, his
major competition coming from
Del Pletcher of Cal.
Aside from Laney and Free
man, the Tribe's biggest threat

in the individual events is in the
sophomore class.
Bob Momsen, fastest 200
breaststroker in the conference
so far (2:15.5), will have to
stretch to beat WSU's Bob
Browning, UCLA's Russ Webb,
and USC's two Olympic breast
strokers, Wayne Anderson and
Bill Craig.
Mike Wall holds the fort for
Stanford in the distance free
style events. Wall will have at
least three races against triple-
NCAA champion Roy Saari of
USC.
Mark Parmely looms large
whenever he swims, in the
sprints, middle distance free
style, butterfly, or individual
medley.
Doug Miller aced all USC's
and UCLA's butterfliers two
weeks ago, but will have to cut
a second or two from his best
of 2:01.1 to beat the pack this
weekend.
Schubach On His Back
Varsity captain Bill Schubach
swims the backstroke leg of the
medley relay, as well as 200
back and 200 IM. Schubach has

a history of surprising perform
ances in the AAWU s.
Gary Sheerer will go with
Wall to provide a potent scor
ing combination in the distance
freestyle events.
Bill Meyer and Bill Derrig
face an impressive field in the
50 freestyle, led by UCLA's Jim
Keller (22.1). Parmely may also
join in the sprints. Meyer has
a berth on the Card 400 free
styler elay team.
Charlie Burbach should score
high in the breaststroke and in
the individual medley.
Sprinters Craig Brown and
Mike Greene, butterflier Bill
Manoogian, and diver Bill Ken
nedy round out the Indian
punch.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
sees the chances of a Stanford
victory as good, considering the
closeness of the d%u a 1 meets
against USC and UCLA.
If the Tribe relays come
through, and if the Indians pull
a few switches in the individual
events, Stanford could come out
on top for the first time in six
years.
