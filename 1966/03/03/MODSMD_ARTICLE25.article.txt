# Lazarus And Student Drama
## 
### 
Last spring on this page, Daily Entertain
ment Editor Joe Jacobs predicted the end of
student drama on the Stanford campus. The ad
vent of the Stanford Repertory Theater was to
have been the death knell to Ram's Head and
the undergraduate program of the Speech and
Drama Department. Fortunately for Stanford,
Jacobs was wrong.
The past seven months have shown that stu
dent drama is far from dead. Ram's Head and
the Speech and Drama Department have faced
the challenge of professional competition and
have come through admirably. For a while it
appeared that both groups might not be able
(o meet the challenge of the Repertory Theater
simply because of scheduling problems. Ram's
Head, for example, will not be putting on its
traditional lavish musical this spring because
Memorial Auditorium's main stage has been
turned over to the Repertory Theater. Both
Ram's head and the Department, however,
have overcome this difficulty and—if the recent
productions of Lysistrata and Twelfth Night
are any indication—have presented to the Stan
ford community what is probably the best
drama the campus has seen in a long time.
Ram's Head, because of its autonomous na
ture, was faced with the brunt of the task of
rebuilding student drama. Encumbered with
the additional problem of supporting itself,
the Ram's Head Board accepted the challenge
and presented Blue and Gold Finger as the 1965
Big Game Gaieties. The show, a spoof of both
Stanford and James Bond, received widespread
critical acclaim.
Sensing greatness in its future, Ram's Head
decided to take an even bolder step for its
Winter Show. Lysistrata, which presented an
entirely new concept of drama to the audience,
was a direct challenge to the Repertory Thea
ter. The Rep had just closed with Prometheus
Bound, a Greek tragedy with music. Ram's
Head moved right in with its play, an updated
Greek comedy, also with music, and proceeded
to sell out its first six performances, then added
anil sold out a seventh.

The campus suddenly became hungry for
undergraduate theater. Speech and Drama's
"happening" of Twelfth Night opened in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder. The originally
scheduled performances were sold out; two ad
ditional shows—also sell-outs—were added be
fore the first performance.
While we are glad to see that there is still a
place here for student drama, the failure of the
Repertory Theater to generate student interest
raises serious questions about its value to the
Stanford Community. We fail to understand
why, for instance, That Scoundrel Scapin was
scheduled during Autumn Quarter midterms,
and The Skin of Our Teeth during finals in De
cember. Moreover, we wonder why the ticket
prices of the well-endowed Repertory Theater,
even with a discount for students, need be so
far above those of traditional campus drama.
(And we have just been informed that no stu
dent discount at all will be available for the
upcoming production of All's Well That Ends
Well.) It would seem as though the Repertory
Theater doesn't want students to come to its
performances, a situation which is intolerable
on a university campus, especially in light of
the success of both Ram's Head and Speech
and Drama Department productions.
We are not predicting the end of the Reper
tory Theater at Stanford; the type of drama it
has been presenting has a definite place here.
It is just that we feel the Rep should make it
self more a part of the campus, more a part of
the educational process. Legitimate theater of
any type should be an exciting and rewarding
experience for the actors and the audience.
We congratulate Ram's Head and the Speech
and Drama Department on their successes thus
far this year, and hope that they will continue
to present to the Stanford community the same
excellent drama. It should be possible, through
a program of mutual co-operation, and con
sideration for the student body at large, to as
sure the place of both groups, plus the Reper
tory Theater, on the Stanford campus.

turned over to the Repertory Theater. Both
Ram's head and the Department, however,
have overcome this difficulty and—if the recent
productions of Lysistrata and Twelfth Night
are any indication—have presented to the Stan
ford community what is probably the best
drama the campus has seen in a long time.
Ram's Head, because of its autonomous na
ture, was faced with the brunt of the task of
rebuilding student drama. Encumbered with
the additional problem of supporting itself,
the Ram's Head Board accepted the challenge
and presented Blue and Gold Finger as the 1965
Big Game Gaieties. The show, a spoof of both
Stanford and James Bond, received widespread
critical acclaim.
Sensing greatness in its future, Ram's Head
decided to take an even bolder step for its
Winter Show. Lysistrata, which presented an
entirely new concept of drama to the audience,
was a direct challenge to the Repertory Thea
ter. The Rep had just closed with Prometheus
Bound, a Greek tragedy with music. Ram's
Head moved right in with its play, an updated
Greek comedy, also with music, and proceeded
to sell out its first six performances, then added
anil sold out a seventh.

The campus suddenly became hungry for
undergraduate theater. Speech and Drama's
"happening" of Twelfth Night opened in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder. The originally
scheduled performances were sold out; two ad
ditional shows—also sell-outs—were added be
fore the first performance.
While we are glad to see that there is still a
place here for student drama, the failure of the
Repertory Theater to generate student interest
raises serious questions about its value to the
Stanford Community. We fail to understand
why, for instance, That Scoundrel Scapin was
scheduled during Autumn Quarter midterms,
and The Skin of Our Teeth during finals in De
cember. Moreover, we wonder why the ticket
prices of the well-endowed Repertory Theater,
even with a discount for students, need be so
far above those of traditional campus drama.
(And we have just been informed that no stu
dent discount at all will be available for the
upcoming production of All's Well That Ends
Well.) It would seem as though the Repertory
Theater doesn't want students to come to its
performances, a situation which is intolerable
on a university campus, especially in light of
the success of both Ram's Head and Speech
and Drama Department productions.
We are not predicting the end of the Reper
tory Theater at Stanford; the type of drama it
has been presenting has a definite place here.
It is just that we feel the Rep should make it
self more a part of the campus, more a part of
the educational process. Legitimate theater of
any type should be an exciting and rewarding
experience for the actors and the audience.
We congratulate Ram's Head and the Speech
and Drama Department on their successes thus
far this year, and hope that they will continue
to present to the Stanford community the same
excellent drama. It should be possible, through
a program of mutual co-operation, and con
sideration for the student body at large, to as
sure the place of both groups, plus the Reper
tory Theater, on the Stanford campus.
Last spring on this page, Daily Entertain
ment Editor Joe Jacobs predicted the end of
student drama on the Stanford campus. The ad
vent of the Stanford Repertory Theater was to
have been the death knell to Ram's Head and
the undergraduate program of the Speech and
Drama Department. Fortunately for Stanford,
Jacobs was wrong.
The past seven months have shown that stu
dent drama is far from dead. Ram's Head and
the Speech and Drama Department have faced
the challenge of professional competition and
have come through admirably. For a while it
appeared that both groups might not be able
(o meet the challenge of the Repertory Theater
simply because of scheduling problems. Ram's
Head, for example, will not be putting on its
traditional lavish musical this spring because
Memorial Auditorium's main stage has been
turned over to the Repertory Theater. Both
