## Academic Imbalance Debate 
### 
Editor. The Daily:
Whatever its intent, Mr. Bar
ry Greenberg's column in Mon
day's Daily has only succeeded
in besmogging what was be
coming a profitable and reveal
ing debate between Mr. John
Bonine and his detractors on the
issue of educational imbalance.
Mr. Grcenbcrg insists that it
is "unreasonable" and "ana
chronistic" to use such "ante
diluvian" terms as "liberal" and
"conservative" to discuss cur
rent politics.
One can concede that these
terms have changed definition,
at least on this side of the At
lantic, in the last few decades,
and that they are very general
categories indeed. But I would
contend that they do have con
siderable meaning today; that
academicians do divide into two
general groups; that they them
selves use the terms "liberal"
and "conservative" to describe
their own thinking; and that
while each term covers a broad
range of political thought, it de
scribes a common core of be
liefs, principles, and policy lean
ings.
On tbis issue I would recom
mend Mr. James Burnham's
book, Suicide of the West, for its
excellent analysis of "liberal
ism" and "conservatism," and
its finding that there is still a
distinct division between the
two.
But Mr. Greenberg is guilty
of a worse sin; he not only de
nies us the catcg6ries "liberal"
and "conservative," but he re
fuses to provide us with any al
ternative at all, on the grounds
that to categorize is to be "sim
plistic"; it is merely, he says, to
indulge in a "quest for certain
ty" of which he wants no part.
(Surely Mr. Greenberg could
not have learned this in the po
litical science department, where
building "models," constructing
"systems," and determining "in
puts" and "outputs" is the favo
rite sport.)
In his refusal to use cate
gories, Mr. Greenberg borders
dangerously on the anti-intellec

tual, for the very process of
thinking and learning demands
simplification and categoriza
tion, as he tacitly admits when
he talks of the "three major
types of liberalism." No more
effective means of choking off
debate could be found than to
destroy the agreed-upon terms
of the debate and then deny all
others.
Because the debate on academ
ic imbalance was just getting
interesting, I hope Mr. Bonine,
Mr. Edelstein and the rest will
continue the exchange, and ig
nore Mr. Greenberg's cry from
the wilderness.

• Draft Dodgers
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorial "Heavy Hangs
the Draft," Daily, March 2, just
goes to prove what many vet
erans have been saying for a
long time: The current genera
tion of students is made up
more of cowards than of real
students. Being drafted is as
sumed to be equivalent to being
sent to the end of the world.
The way today's students are
reacting, one would think that
military experience would cause
total ruin; that being drafted
would cause them to be brain
washed, leaving them intellec
tually bankrupt.
I challenge the current gener
ation of draft dodgers to seek
out faculty members who
taught classes of WWII and Ko
rean War veterans. Just ask
these faculty members about
these students. Ask them
whether veterans or non-veter
ans made the best students.
Grow up kids, become real stu
dents.

• Building A Bridge
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Beye, in criticizing the
SLAC exhibit at the Stanford

Museum, displays a perfect ex
ample of that Philistine attitude
that scientists are often credit
ed with by students of the hu
manities.
It is singularly pointless to
criticize the SLAC display as
unaesthetic plumbing, for that
is all the components of the ac
celerator were ever designed to
be. The reason they are dis
played is so that whatever new
perspectives might arise out of
the strict geometries of physics
and functionalisms of engineer
ing involved in their design
might be appreciated.
It may be that the written ex
planations accompanying the
components are jargonistic, but
certainly no less comprehensi
ble than any possible "formal"
artistic comment would be. The
explanations are as much of a
succinct guideline as is possible
without turning the exhibit into
a science show.
If Mr. Beye approached the

exhibit with hostility towards
science and hatred for SLAC
in his heart, his comments arc
understandable. If the exhibit
itself disgusted him so, then in
deed we at SLAC and the peo
ple In the Art Department have
failed. We attempted an exhibi
tion of some aesthetic proper
ties of nuclear physics research;
we attempted to bridge, for a
time, the gap between the sci
ences and the humanities. Per
haps such an exhibit cannot suc
ceed nor such a bridge be built,
but certainly it is necessary to
try.
