# Today And Tomorrow
## McGeorge Bundy's Shoes May Be Difficult To Fill 
### Walter Lippmann 
In speculating about Mc-
George Bundy's successor, and
even about whether there is to
be one, we may well ask our
selves first: what is the office
to which the successor would
succeed? The more we examine
that question, the more we shall
see, I think, that while there is
surely an office to be filled, how
that is to be done depends upon
how the President sees his own
role in the conduct of foreigfi
relations.
Two Predecessors
Bundy has had two predeces
sors, Colonel House under Presi
dent Wilson and Harry Hopkins
under President Roosevelt. He
and they have been closer to
and more intimate with the
President than were the men
who served as secretary of
state. This shows that the Presi
dent needs someone in his own
household who is closer to him
and more in his confidence than
the secretary can be. But all
three of these confidential ad
visers have operated differently.
Colonel House, for example,
lived in New York, not in Wash
ington, had no office in the
White House and operated be
hind the scenes as President
Wilson's principal secret agent.
Secret Agent
Harry Hopkins played some
thing like the same role for
President Roosevelt. He, too,
was a secret agent. But unlike
Colonel House he lived near and
at times even in the White
House itself.
He advised and represented

the President in his relations
with all the departments of gov
ernment in which great issues
were at stake, be it the conduct
of foreign relations or Ameri
can national politics. Harry
Hopkins came near to being an
assistant President. He was cer
tainly the most important of all
the assistants to a President.
Bundy's role can, I think, be
best described as that of a staff
officer in the field of national
security and foreign policy. I
once asked Gen. Bedell Smith,
who had been Gen. Dwight Ei
senhower's chief of staff dur
ing the war, just what is the
main job of the staff officer.
Gen. Smith replied:
"His first business is to know
his chief so well that he can tell
when his blood pressure is right
for making a big decision. Then
the staff officer goes to his chief
and says, 'Sir, there are three
things you can do. If you do A,
the cost will be X; if you do B,
the cost will be Y; if you do C,
you won't be able to look that
ugly face of yours in the mirror
when you shave tomorrow
morning.' "
Options
I am not suggesting that
Bundy has ever talked about the
'C' options in that way to either
of his two chiefs. Only the his
torians of the future will be
able to say how and why and
to what degree he deferred to
them when the question was *C\
The relationship between the
staff officer and his chief in the
White House is not defined in
any legal text and a balance has
to be struck between respect
and deference for the office and
the pride and imperiousness of
his chief. I have heard it from
both of the Presidents whom
Bundy has served that in the
field of defining the costs of A
and the costs of B he has shown
an incomparable ability to re
duce complex problems to the
choices which the President
must make in deciding the is
sue.
Indispensable Role
As the United States has be
come a world power, the role
of the principal staff officer in
the White House has become in
dispensable. Whether the Presi
dent has great confidence in his
secretary of state, as does Presi
dent Johnson, or whether he re
gards the secretary of state as
a bureaucrat who is not compe
tent in the field of high policy,
as did Presidents Wilson and
Roosevelt, there must be in the
White House itself a staff offi
cer, wholly bound to the Presi
dent personally.
There must be someone who
orders and orients the torrent of
information the President must
master in order to reach his de
cisions.
Someone will have to step
into Bundy's shoes and show
whether he can fill them.
