# Corps To Spring Recruit
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Managing Editor 
Ten Stanford graduate students,
most of them returned Peace Corps
volunteers, have initiated a program
to promote the Peace Corps here.
The program, first of its kind at
any university, will provide extended
Peace Corps orientation on a trial
basis during spring quarter.
"We have come up with an alterna
tive to the one-week recruiting blitz,"
remarked Dave Lewis, director of the
program, "and we think it is going
to work." Lewis returned from Wash
ington last week where he obtained
final approval of the proposal.
Voluntary Organisation
The students, who intend to form a
voluntary organization, plan a re
ception at three Tuesday afternoon in
Tresidder for Jack Hood Vaughn, na
tional Peace Corps director, and for
prospective Peace Corps volunteers
and students selected for training as a
"kick-off" for their program.
The organization will open an office
next quarter off the dining room in
the Old Union to maintain "almost

daily" contact with the Peace Corps
in Washington. The office is to be
open every afternoon of the quarter.
It will also sponsor seminars and
discussions in living groups, led by
returned volunteers and interested
faculty.
In this way Lewis hopes to present
a more "realistic" view of the Peace
Corps.

Ho does not believe this can be ac
complished during the "high-pres
sure blitz," as he calls the Peace
Corps' intensive week of recruiting
every fall.
"One of the greatest problems of
the Peace Corps is explaining it when
you get home," Lewis, a graduate
student in industrial engineering and
a former volunteer in the Phillipines,
explained. "I am not trying to sell
the Peace Corps but to see that it
gets a fair shake."
Lewis and his associates see the
project as the wave of the future.
They believe that recruitment must
be handled in a low-pressure, educa
tional way and that Stanford is a
test case for this philosophy.
Well-Prepared Volunteers
"We do not ask how many applica
tions the Peace Corps can round up
in one week but how many well-pre
pared volunteers Stanford can send
to the Peace Corps," Lewis com
mented.
He said that many or the 35 re
turned Peace Corps volunteers at
Stanford, most of whom are graduate
students, are supporting the project.
