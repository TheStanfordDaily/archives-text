## Old Dinosaurus Lassuius Cuts Its Own Heart Out 
### Steve Gruber 
Not all the dinosaurs are ex
tinct. In fact, LASSU, my fa
vorite monster, is still with us.
But just barely.
It seems that LASSU tried to
commit suicide a few weeks ago.
I can't call this form of suicide
cannabalism, because LASSU
simply hacked a few members
of its body off and left them to
rot.
Eating Alive
If they had eaten them alive
(or dead), The Daily really
would have had a story.
But to avoid becoming as con
fusing as LASSU itself, let me
tell you some of the dinosaur's
background.
LASSU resulted from the pre
historic mating of a bull, a jack
ass, and a member of the Abra
ham Lincoln Brigade. LASSU
is an abbreviation for "out to
Lunch, Always Sophomoric, and
never Silent." The U was added,
after careful consideration—and
five weeks' debate—to make the
abbreviation more aesthetic. It
was not added for the same rea
son that the U was added to
ASSU. That Is, there was no
double meaning to LASS.
Large Brain
LASSU has an extraordinari
ly large brain, as far as dino
saurs go. Its name is Sandy.
Unfortunately, the brain is lo
cated in the tail, which is nearly
as far from the head as Stern
is from Tresidder.
The mouthpiece of the mon
ster, Speakerus Kadanus, is the
actual brain of the organism.
He is affectionately known as
the "conductor" because his
hobby is building model rail
roads.
LASSU has two excellent
types of armament to protect it
self from its enemies, the stu
denti apatheti. The first is the
ability to listen with its mouth.

Actually, LASSU's ears are only
a vestige.
The second is that the stu
denti apatheti never bother
LASSU because they realize that
it only has one purpose—to pro
vide a proving ground for Rob
erts' Rules of Order.
I saw the monster about two
weeks ago in a classroom on
Quad. Its members were, as
usual, making a thorough study
of the Rules of Order. But this
time something was different.
The creature was spewing
flames and making an unearth
ly sound, which when translated,
sounded like "Screw Couzens".
Since this is a family newspaper,
a little had to be lost in transla
tlon.
Amputation
The debate centered around
amputating five of LASSU's
members. The members func
tioned perfectly, according to
the conductor and several of the
resident surgeons, but they
failed to respond as ordered by
the mouthpiece and the brain.
Besides, they did not seem gen
uinely interested in Roberts'
Rules of Order. And even worse,
they were more inclined to com
promise than to take unilateral
action.
So LASSU took a vote.
And another vote.
And another vote.
And another vote.
When the marathon was over,
the survivors found that LASSU
had cut out its heart, crippling
itself.
The only trouble was that
LASSU did not realize this. So
the studenti apatheti took a
vote.
The decision finally was to
send the crippled dinosaur to
Con Home so that it could
spend its last days reading Rob
erts' Rules of Order in peace.
