# Lyric Composer To Lecture On His Own Works
## 
### 
Leon Kirchner, American composer
of music at Harvard University, will
deliver a lecture on "Words and
Music" at 4:15 today in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Professor Kirchner will speak
about some of the problems connected
with the writing of his new opera,
which will be performed at New
York's Lincoln Center in about two
years. He is currently writing both
the libretto and score for an interpre
tation of Saul Bellow's "Henderson,
the Rain King."
Kirchner will conduct the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra Friday at 8:30
p.m. in two of his own compositions,
"Sinfonia," and "Concerto for Piano
and Orchestra" and in Mozart's Sym
phony No. 25.
After the war, Kirchner took his
master's degree in music at UC-Berk
eley. After teaching at Berkeley, the
University of Southern California,
and Mills, he joined the Harvard
music faculty in 1962.
Piano soloist will be Ralph Votapek,
a young American who won first
prize in the 1962 International Van
Cliburn Competition. He shot to fame
in 1965 when, on short notice, he
substituted for the ailing Emil Gilels.
Votapek played the Rachmaninoff
Third Piano Concerto with the Wash
ington Symphony and, when through,
was given a standing ovation from
both the orchestra and audience. The
Stanford concert will be his West
Coast debut.
