# Federal Agency Hustles Students

WASHINGTON (CPS) â€” College
students are used to being recruited
by all sorts of groups. Most businesses
have large scale college recruitment
programs and the success of the Peace
Corps has been due in large part to
its recruiting program on the nation's
campuses.
Perhaps prompted by the Peace
Corps success, a new government
agency has decided to actively recruit
on the college campus.
Last week the Central Intelligence
Agency confirmed reports circulating
around Washington that it now has
recruiting teams visiting about 100
colloge campuses to interview students
as prospective analysts and agents.
"We want good people," Col. Stanley
K. Gi-ogan, "and we're out looking for
them."
