# Triska States Central Leadership Impossible In World Communism
## 
### DAVE CAMPSI 
Autonomous national states and
a single central leadership party for
the world Communist system are in
compatible, Professor Jan Triska
asserted last night in the fourth of
the Tresidder Series on Communism.
The very fact that the satellite
nations of the Communist coalition
are permanent, rather than transitory
steps on the way to a single inter
national unit, brings with it a de
centralization of power, Triska said.
Why Polycentrism?
Speaking to an attentive audience,
Dr. Triska outlined a seven step dis
cussion of the causes and effects of
"Polycentrism."
He began the proof of his orig
inal thesis by defining Polycentrism
as a system having "no single abso
lute leader, no single absolute party,
no single absolute state party, and
no single absolute unity." The Sino-
Soviet split is only a symptom of this
growing trend, Dr. Triska explained.
The increasing autonomy of the
national states within the Communist
bloc gives them more power in over
all party policy decisions. Each state
becomes more and more dissatisfied
with the decisions of the central
power and this dissent is expressed
to the Socialist leaders of the world,
giving rise to a diffusion of power
centers.
Two Objections
This opposition to central party
decisions expresses itself in two ex
treme positions. One states that the
Soviets are not to be trusted and
power must be taken over by another

nation; this is the position taken by
China. The other extreme is that
powers must be given more and more
to the collective states. This desire
for a more democratic system is ex
pressed by the majority of Com
munist states, Triska said.
Organization, Not Ideals
If the National Communist Party
of the Soviet Union is to maintain its
grip on the coalition of states, it
must convince aU the people that its
policy decisions are based firmly in
Marxist doctrine. Only by claiming
to be true "Marxian Marxists" can
the ruling party depend on the sup
port of the individual party states
and so preserve the coalition of Com
munist states.
"Game Theory" offers another in
sight into the origins of Polycentrism,
Dr. Triska said. It states that as long
as a single state in a coalition holds
a majority of the power, there can
never be a successful union of smaller
states to overthrow the ruling body.
However in the Communist world
there are two major powers who
share between the '"96 per cent of the
area, 86 per cent of the population,
and 75 per cent of the gross national
product." From this fact comes an
inevitable struggle for power between
these two states: China and the
U.S.S.R.
The theory also states that the
more responsibility that a single state
takes for the coalition, the more
easily that state can maintain its hold
on the coalition. This means that the
Soviet Union must take risks in its
international policy in the name of

the Communist world in order to
secure its hold on these Socialists. But
to do this forces the Soviets to give
up more to these states and so to
increase their autonomy. This leads
to a self-perpetuation spiral which,
Triska claims, is incompatible with
the present power structure.
Because of this there is bound to
be a drastic change in the Communist
world system leading to more and
more democratic power placed in the
hands of the nation-states. This, ac
cording to Dr. Triska, is good for in
ternational Communism because it
will prevent the exploitation of the
individual states by a single central
power. This increasing democracy

the Tresidder Series on Communism.
The very fact that the satellite
nations of the Communist coalition
are permanent, rather than transitory
steps on the way to a single inter
national unit, brings with it a de
centralization of power, Triska said.
Why Polycentrism?
Speaking to an attentive audience,
Dr. Triska outlined a seven step dis
cussion of the causes and effects of
"Polycentrism."
He began the proof of his orig
inal thesis by defining Polycentrism
as a system having "no single abso
lute leader, no single absolute party,
no single absolute state party, and
no single absolute unity." The Sino-
Soviet split is only a symptom of this
growing trend, Dr. Triska explained.
The increasing autonomy of the
national states within the Communist
bloc gives them more power in over
all party policy decisions. Each state
becomes more and more dissatisfied
with the decisions of the central
power and this dissent is expressed
to the Socialist leaders of the world,
giving rise to a diffusion of power
centers.
Two Objections
This opposition to central party
decisions expresses itself in two ex
treme positions. One states that the
Soviets are not to be trusted and
power must be taken over by another

nation; this is the position taken by
China. The other extreme is that
powers must be given more and more
to the collective states. This desire
for a more democratic system is ex
pressed by the majority of Com
munist states, Triska said.
Organization, Not Ideals
If the National Communist Party
of the Soviet Union is to maintain its
grip on the coalition of states, it
must convince aU the people that its
policy decisions are based firmly in
Marxist doctrine. Only by claiming
to be true "Marxian Marxists" can
the ruling party depend on the sup
port of the individual party states
and so preserve the coalition of Com
munist states.
"Game Theory" offers another in
sight into the origins of Polycentrism,
Dr. Triska said. It states that as long
as a single state in a coalition holds
a majority of the power, there can
never be a successful union of smaller
states to overthrow the ruling body.
However in the Communist world
there are two major powers who
share between the '"96 per cent of the
area, 86 per cent of the population,
and 75 per cent of the gross national
product." From this fact comes an
inevitable struggle for power between
these two states: China and the
U.S.S.R.
The theory also states that the
more responsibility that a single state
takes for the coalition, the more
easily that state can maintain its hold
on the coalition. This means that the
Soviet Union must take risks in its
international policy in the name of

the Communist world in order to
secure its hold on these Socialists. But
to do this forces the Soviets to give
up more to these states and so to
increase their autonomy. This leads
to a self-perpetuation spiral which,
Triska claims, is incompatible with
the present power structure.
Because of this there is bound to
be a drastic change in the Communist
world system leading to more and
more democratic power placed in the
hands of the nation-states. This, ac
cording to Dr. Triska, is good for in
ternational Communism because it
will prevent the exploitation of the
individual states by a single central
power. This increasing democracy
Autonomous national states and
a single central leadership party for
the world Communist system are in
compatible, Professor Jan Triska
asserted last night in the fourth of
the Tresidder Series on Communism.
