# Legislature To Consider Student Draft Resolution
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
A resolution concerning the draft
ing of students will be the main topic
of debate at a short Legislature meet
ing tonight.
The resolution would request Pres
ident Sterling to support Columbia
President Grayson Kirk at the Asso
ciation of University Presidents this
spring.
Kirk will present a resolution ask
ing that university students be de
ferred from the draft.
The LASSU bill, sponsored by
Richard Gorin refers to congres
sional legislation stating that univer
sity studies are in the national inter
est and that students should be al
lowed to graduate before going into
military service.
Gorin's Resolution
Gorin's resolution also points out
the impossibility of applying one
standard selection procedure to Uni
versities of varying quality and to
students of different abilities.
It calls the policy of drafting stu
dents "detrimental to the University
community." The resolution is simi
lar to one proposed earlier in the quar
ter by John Shippee which has not
yet been reported out of committee.
The issue of drafting students who
drop out of school for a quarter may
be brought up, but is not included in
Gorin's original legislation. Under
present draft rules, any student not
officially enrolled during Autumn,

Winter and Spring quarters is eligible
for the draft.
The situation is of disadvantage to
Stanford participants in the Overseas
Campii Program who often attend
classes during Summer Quarter then
drop out to travel in Europe during
the regular school year.
Several bills concerning the Com
mittee of Fifteen will be brought to
the floor as legislation known to be
controversial.
Committee of Fifteen
Newly-appointed members will give
a report of proceedings in the Com
mittee of Fifteen, and will request
that LASSU representatives consult
with constituencies about problems in
the academic counselling program at
Stanford.
According to Speaker Jay Kadane
an inquiry into the effectiveness of
the program will be conducted by
the committee at the request of the
new Education Commission.
Other legislation known to be con
troversial will include an appropria
tion to finance the production of an
ASSU film about Stanford.
Speaker Jay Kadane will appoint a
committee to choose the new Tresid
der Union board and legislation on
electioneering rules and committee
minutes approval will be referred to
committee.
The meeting, which is the last of
Winter Quarter, will begin at 7:30
in room 370.
