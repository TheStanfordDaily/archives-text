# 'Take The Test,' Findeisen Urges
## 
### JOHN HODGES 
"I would urge all Stanford men to
take the Selective Service College
Qualification Test," National Service
Director Walter J. Findeisen said yes
terday. "Stanford students have his
torically done well on these tests."
Findeisen's comment was part of a
Stu-Fac Board sponsored discussion
on the current draft deferment situa
tion.
Explaining the Selective Service's
dual deferment criteria was the pur
pose of the discussion. Draft boards,
Findeisen noted, will now consider
both class rank and qualification test
scores in granting II S deferments.
Regardless of Rank
He urged all Stanford men to take
the test regardless of current class
standing. "I can't emphasize too
strongly the importance of giving
your board all the information you
can as evidence of deferment qualifi
cation," he said.
"The test is designed primarily to
enable college freshmen and high
school seniors to demonstrate their
capacity to do college level work,"
Findeisen explained. "The test will
probably be similar to college apti
tude tests." for high school seniors,"
he said.
Findeisen also stated that the basis
for class rank has not yet been de
cided. "In previous years this was
thought of in terms of your three
quarter average," he said, "but there
is a possibility that we could rank
students on a cumulative basis. It
would appear from preliminary stud
ies that this would make penalties
for an "F" grade or an incomplete
less severe."
During the Korean War, freshman
deferments were based on standing in
the upper half of the class; sopho
mores, upper two-thirds; juniors,

three-fourths; and seniors with grad
uate school plans, one-fourth. Ex
ceptions were for medical students,
who had to place in the top half, and
law students, who were required to
maintain a top three-fourths standing.
"We believe the same principle will
apply now," Findeisen said.
GPA's Listed
Based on 1965-'65 cumulative GPA
records, Stanford freshmen would
have to maintain a 2.6, sophomores a
2.3. Junior engineering majors would
need a 2.14, humanities and sciences
majors a 2.27, and mineral science ma
jors a 2.02. To qualify for graduate
school deferment, seniors in educa
tion would need a 2.85; in engineering,
3.06; in humanities and sciences, 3.12;
and in mineral sciences, 2.99.
Findeisen reminded students that
"one does not necessarily get a defer
ment because he makes the right av-„
erage. Classification depends entirely
on the local boards, he said.
In answer to a question from the
audience, Findeisen explained the
term "normal progress" as "com
pleting one-fourth of your gradua
tion requirements each year." In
terms of units, he saitjl, draft boards
look for 45 units from a freshman,
90 from a sophomore, and so on.
In California, he added, four years
are allowed for the Baccalaureate de
gree, two for the masters' degree and
five, including the time spent on the
masters', for the doctorate.

Asked whether graduate students
are more vulnerable to the draft than
undergraduates, Findeisen stated, "I

difference."

Force Major Harry Matthews, and

During the Korean War, freshman
deferments were based on standing in

Based on 1965-'65 cumulative GPA

Findeisen reminded students that

In answer to a question from the

"I would urge all Stanford men to

Qualification Test," National Service
Director Walter J. Findeisen said yes

Findeisen's comment was part of a
Stu-Fac Board sponsored discussion
on the current draft deferment situa

Explaining the Selective Service's
dual deferment criteria was the pur
pose of the discussion. Draft boards,
Findeisen noted, will now consider
both class rank and qualification test
scores in granting II S deferments.
Regardless of Rank
He urged all Stanford men to take
the test regardless of current class
standing. "I can't emphasize too
strongly the importance of giving
your board all the information you
can as evidence of deferment qualifi
cation," he said.
"The test is designed primarily to
enable college freshmen and high
school seniors to demonstrate their
capacity to do college level work,"
Findeisen explained. "The test will
probably be similar to college apti
tude tests." for high school seniors,"
he said.
Findeisen also stated that the basis
for class rank has not yet been de
cided. "In previous years this was
thought of in terms of your three
quarter average," he said, "but there
is a possibility that we could rank
students on a cumulative basis. It
