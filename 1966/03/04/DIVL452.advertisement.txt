Dr. Robert Hutchins, former President of the University
of Chicago, and founder of the great books program,
once said, "To destroy our Western Civilization, we
don't have to burn all the books. We merely have to
leave them unread for one generation." The principal
problem we have to face today, as the frontiers of
human knowledge are being thrust back, is that this
knowledge is being committed to print, and it must
be read before it can be used. Advances have been
made in almost every field of human endeavor. We
run faster, fly higher, and dive deeper, but we still read
at the same speed that our grandparents did; 300 words
per minute. The shame of it is that this is no longer
necessary. The whole philosophy of learning could be
changed 'if every person in this country would take the
time to use his dormant capabilities. No industry could
use the same standards and techniques it used 25 years
ago and expect to continue in existence. Yet we remain
satisfied with the same old reading standards and
techniques. This would be fine if there were no better
technique available, but a major breakthrough in this
field has occurred. Victor Hugo said, "There is nothing
in this world so powerful as an idea whose time has
come." And this is just such an idea. Some day our na
tional survival may depend on how well we are able to
utilize our greatest resource, the minds of our young
people. The "New Math" was first published in very
much its present form in the 1890's. Do we have to wait
70 years for each valuable new concept to gain accept
ance? Not if we can help it!
