lyn Wood at a recent
| teacher training con
ference. "If you aren't
;■ comprehending, you
aren't reading "
IMrs. Wood also was critical,
of skimming techniques,
commonly used in speed
reading courses and in
formed her teachers that
: hey must increase compre
hension at the same time
they are achieving high
speeds. She said, "Skipping
words is dangerous, as you
don't know whether or not
you have skipped a word
which could change the
whole meaning of the sen
tence. You read five times
faster, not by reading every
fifth word, but by reading
five times as many words
in the same amount of time.
It is impossible to tell which
words to skip or disregard
until you have seen them
all and determined their
relative importance and
meaning."
