The hero of the battlefield is the soldier who throws himself on an ex
ploding grenadte to shield his buddies. The parent who pushes a child from
an oncoming car earns lasting acclaim. The father who drowns but saves his
son is not soon forgotten. Good parents pour their best into us, then die and
leave us everything; Great leaders put themselves in constant jeopardy to
further the cause. It is a law of the harvest that new life springs forth only
from the death and sacrifice of another. Jesus Christ told his followers, "If
any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me. He who would find his life shall lose if, and he who loses his life
for my sake and the gospel's will find it."
While you and I ought to be self-giving, and to value our neighbor with
the greater esteem, in fact we are not and do not, we don't have what it takes.
It is self-centered living which destroys our potential; but we lack the keys
fo our own salvation. This is just why the Bible is all Good News:
While we were yet helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
Why, one will hardly die for a righteous man—though perhaps for a good
man one will dare even to die. But God shows his love for us in that while
we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Since, therefore we are justified by his
blood, much more shall we be saved by him from th wrath of God. For if while
we were enemies of God we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
much more now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life" (Romans
5).
Because we have been died for by the living God, our lives can be spared
and the records set straight in the highest of courts. The power for right living
and the resources of love become ours for the asking. To refuse such a gift is
suicide indeed! Jesus Christ said, "I am the door ; if anyone enters by me,
he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only
to steal and destroy; I came that men might have life, and that more abund
antly . . . Fear, not, I am the first and the last, and the living one; I died, and
behold I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades" (John
1 0, Revelation 1).

leave us everything; Great leaders put themselves in constant jeopardy to
further the cause. It is a law of the harvest that new life springs forth only
from the death and sacrifice of another. Jesus Christ told his followers, "If
any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me. He who would find his life shall lose if, and he who loses his life
for my sake and the gospel's will find it."
While you and I ought to be self-giving, and to value our neighbor with
the greater esteem, in fact we are not and do not, we don't have what it takes.
It is self-centered living which destroys our potential; but we lack the keys
fo our own salvation. This is just why the Bible is all Good News:
While we were yet helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
Why, one will hardly die for a righteous man—though perhaps for a good
man one will dare even to die. But God shows his love for us in that while
we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Since, therefore we are justified by his
blood, much more shall we be saved by him from th wrath of God. For if while
we were enemies of God we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
much more now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life" (Romans
5).
Because we have been died for by the living God, our lives can be spared
and the records set straight in the highest of courts. The power for right living
and the resources of love become ours for the asking. To refuse such a gift is
suicide indeed! Jesus Christ said, "I am the door ; if anyone enters by me,
he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only
to steal and destroy; I came that men might have life, and that more abund
antly . . . Fear, not, I am the first and the last, and the living one; I died, and
behold I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades" (John
1 0, Revelation 1).
