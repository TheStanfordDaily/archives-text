# LASSU Ends Long Winter
## 
### 
The Legislature last night used a
tranquil session, the last of the quar
ter, as a housecleaning for a dusty
accumulation of legislation before the
absence of a quorum halted the clean
up.
The quorum call interrupted con
sideration of a resolution concerning
student draft deferments. The resolu
tion would have asked Stanford Presi
dent Wallace Sterling to take a stand
against student induction at the April
meeting of the Association of Uni
versity Presidents.
Earlier the Legislature had voted
to consider the resolution, but no
final action was taken.
In other business before the
quorum call the Legislature:
• Drafted a resolution urging the
Committee of Fifteen to investigate
the "principle and mechanism" for in
cluding in particular the status of stu
dents with regard to voting member
ship on such committees."
• Approved a By-Laws amendment
establishing ASSU electioneering reg
ulations which, among other things,
created a sub-committee to enforce
the regulations and set a ceiling on ex
penditures by candidates for ASSU
president and vice-president at $135.
• Adopted into ASSU By-Laws the
Wilbur sponsor selection procedure
accepted earlier this week by the Com
mittee On Undergraduate Education,
the sponsors, and Wilbur Faculty
Master Eric Hutchinson.
• Approved social regulations
changes which permit open hours in
the lobbies of women's residence to
be extended to a maximum of 2:15.
