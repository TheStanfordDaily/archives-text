# Hershey's Reply To Inquiry
## 
### GAYLORD SHAW Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Draft
Director Lewis B. Hershey said
this week that Americans don't
like and don't understand the
"distant . . . dim" war in Viet
nam but "they like the prosperi
ty" it generates.
Lt. Gen. Hershey, who in near
ly a quarter century as head of
the Selective Service has di
rected the military draft of 13
million young men, said the gen
eral public doesn't understand
the war in Vietnam because:
"It's distant, it's dim and it
deals with people they're not fa
miliar with."
Americans Too Soft
In an interview, the 72-year
old Hershey criticized the toler
ant attitude he said has devel
oped toward those who deliber
ately break the law, said Amer
icans may be leading too soft a
life, again advocated universal
military training and said he
has no plans to retire.
Hershey said the Vietnam sit
uation is similar in some re
spects to the Korean War. "The
public just never understood it
(the Korean War) like they did
World War II," he said. "I think

we've got some of the same
problems now."
He isn't peeved by criticism
of the draft, although he hastens
to defend the system.
Only Wednesday, after 30 Re
publican House members called
for an immediate investigation
of the draft, Hershey pledged
his co-operation and said, "I have
always understood that one of
the functions of the Congress is
to look into how well the laws
they pass are being carried out."
'Human Nature'
He was philosophical about
criticism from individuals. "You
can't blame people for being un
comfortable when somebody's
going to put an obligation on
them—that's human nature," he
said.
He criticized, without men
tioning names, the current de
bate over Vietnam policy. "It's
unfortunate anytime to leave
the impression with other na
tions that there is weakness,"
he said. "Whenever there is con
fusion, the one looking at it
tends to believe it indicates
some weakness. Whenever you
lack unity, you lack strength,"
he said.
In calling for unity, he said it
is vital "to keep our youth be
lieving in our country."
"The youth always have the
responsibility of defending it.
How can they defend it if they
don't believe in it?"
Obeying the Law
As for those who argue "you
ought to pick the laws you want
to obey," Hershey said "I think
it is a very dangerous thing to
do ... I think you ought to
obey all of them."
What about young men who
burn their draft cards?
He describes these demonstra
tors as "misguided adolescents"
and says "they should be
spanked. Maybe they should be
inducted."

In speaking of the "soft
life," Hershey said "we're some
what the victim of a life that
has been easier than that of five
or six generations ago ... I
don't know how many genera
tions we could live through this
and still hang on."
Hershey is confident, how
ever, Americans would respond
if the war in Vietnam took a
turn for the worse. "I think
they've got some hardihood left
in them," he said.
Military Training
Hershey's own military train
ing began 55 years ago when
he enlisted in the Indiana Na
tional Guard as a teen-age pri
vate. He served during the Mex
ican border incident of 1916 and
in France during World War I.
His Army career appeared at
an end when he was retired af
ter removal of his right eye, in
jured while playing polo. But in
1936-40, he was an executive of
ficer of an Army-Navy commit
tee setting up a Selective Ser
vice System. In 1940, he was
named Deputy Director of the
system and became Director a
year later.
"Ain't No Use"
He could have retired in 1963,
when he was 70, but said at that
time he guessed he would stay
on the job until he was fired.
His attitude hasn't changed.
"That sort of thing generally
takes care of itself," he said
when asked if he has considered
retirement.
Hershey concedes, though, he's
not as active as he once was.
Long a Boy Scout leader, he
was asked if he still participates
in hikes and campouts.
"There ain't no use in me ly
ing about it,"he replied. "I'm a
little past being the hardy soul
who goes out and sleeps on the
ground with a great deal of sat
isfaction." '

Hershey is confident, how
ever, Americans would respond
if the war in Vietnam took a
turn for the worse. "I think
they've got some hardihood left
in them," he said.
Military Training
Hershey's own military train
ing began 55 years ago when
he enlisted in the Indiana Na
tional Guard as a teen-age pri
vate. He served during the Mex
ican border incident of 1916 and
in France during World War I.
His Army career appeared at
an end when he was retired af
ter removal of his right eye, in
jured while playing polo. But in
1936-40, he was an executive of
ficer of an Army-Navy commit
tee setting up a Selective Ser
vice System. In 1940, he was
named Deputy Director of the
system and became Director a
year later.
"Ain't No Use"
He could have retired in 1963,
when he was 70, but said at that
time he guessed he would stay
on the job until he was fired.
His attitude hasn't changed.
"That sort of thing generally
takes care of itself," he said
when asked if he has considered
retirement.
Hershey concedes, though, he's
not as active as he once was.
Long a Boy Scout leader, he
was asked if he still participates
in hikes and campouts.
"There ain't no use in me ly
ing about it,"he replied. "I'm a
little past being the hardy soul
who goes out and sleeps on the
ground with a great deal of sat
isfaction." '
WASHINGTON (AP)— Draft
Director Lewis B. Hershey said
this week that Americans don't
like and don't understand the
"distant . . . dim" war in Viet
nam but "they like the prosperi
ty" it generates.
Lt. Gen. Hershey, who in near
ly a quarter century as head of
the Selective Service has di
rected the military draft of 13
million young men, said the gen
eral public doesn't understand
the war in Vietnam because:
"It's distant, it's dim and it
deals with people they're not fa
miliar with."
Americans Too Soft
In an interview, the 72-year
old Hershey criticized the toler
ant attitude he said has devel
oped toward those who deliber
ately break the law, said Amer
icans may be leading too soft a
life, again advocated universal
military training and said he
has no plans to retire.
Hershey said the Vietnam sit
uation is similar in some re
spects to the Korean War. "The
public just never understood it
(the Korean War) like they did
World War II," he said. "I think

we've got some of the same
problems now."
He isn't peeved by criticism
of the draft, although he hastens
to defend the system.
Only Wednesday, after 30 Re
publican House members called
for an immediate investigation
of the draft, Hershey pledged
his co-operation and said, "I have
always understood that one of
the functions of the Congress is
to look into how well the laws
they pass are being carried out."
'Human Nature'
He was philosophical about
criticism from individuals. "You
can't blame people for being un
comfortable when somebody's
going to put an obligation on
them—that's human nature," he
said.
He criticized, without men
tioning names, the current de
bate over Vietnam policy. "It's
unfortunate anytime to leave
the impression with other na
tions that there is weakness,"
he said. "Whenever there is con
fusion, the one looking at it
tends to believe it indicates
some weakness. Whenever you
lack unity, you lack strength,"
he said.
In calling for unity, he said it
is vital "to keep our youth be
lieving in our country."
"The youth always have the
responsibility of defending it.
How can they defend it if they
don't believe in it?"
Obeying the Law
As for those who argue "you
ought to pick the laws you want
to obey," Hershey said "I think
it is a very dangerous thing to
do ... I think you ought to
obey all of them."
What about young men who
burn their draft cards?
He describes these demonstra
tors as "misguided adolescents"
and says "they should be
spanked. Maybe they should be
inducted."

In speaking of the "soft
life," Hershey said "we're some
what the victim of a life that
has been easier than that of five
or six generations ago ... I
don't know how many genera
tions we could live through this
and still hang on."
Hershey is confident, how
ever, Americans would respond
if the war in Vietnam took a
turn for the worse. "I think
they've got some hardihood left

to look into how well the laws
they pass are being carried out."
'Human Nature'
He was philosophical about
criticism from individuals. "You
can't blame people for being un
comfortable when somebody's
going to put an obligation on
them—that's human nature," he
said.
He criticized, without men
tioning names, the current de
bate over Vietnam policy. "It's
unfortunate anytime to leave
the impression with other na
tions that there is weakness,"
he said. "Whenever there is con
fusion, the one looking at it
tends to believe it indicates
some weakness. Whenever you
lack unity, you lack strength,"
he said.
In calling for unity, he said it
is vital "to keep our youth be
lieving in our country."
"The youth always have the
responsibility of defending it.
How can they defend it if they
don't believe in it?"
Obeying the Law
As for those who argue "you
ought to pick the laws you want
to obey," Hershey said "I think
it is a very dangerous thing to
do ... I think you ought to
obey all of them."
What about young men who
burn their draft cards?
He describes these demonstra
tors as "misguided adolescents"
and says "they should be
spanked. Maybe they should be
inducted."

In speaking of the "soft
life," Hershey said "we're some
what the victim of a life that
has been easier than that of five
or six generations ago ... I
don't know how many genera
tions we could live through this
and still hang on."
Hershey is confident, how
ever, Americans would respond
if the war in Vietnam took a
turn for the worse. "I think
they've got some hardihood left
in them," he said.
Military Training
Hershey's own military train
ing began 55 years ago when
he enlisted in the Indiana Na
tional Guard as a teen-age pri
vate. He served during the Mex
ican border incident of 1916 and
in France during World War I.
His Army career appeared at
an end when he was retired af
ter removal of his right eye, in
jured while playing polo. But in
1936-40, he was an executive of
ficer of an Army-Navy commit
tee setting up a Selective Ser
vice System. In 1940, he was
named Deputy Director of the
system and became Director a
year later.
"Ain't No Use"
He could have retired in 1963,
when he was 70, but said at that
time he guessed he would stay
on the job until he was fired.
His attitude hasn't changed.
"That sort of thing generally
takes care of itself," he said
when asked if he has considered
retirement.
Hershey concedes, though, he's
not as active as he once was.
Long a Boy Scout leader, he
was asked if he still participates
in hikes and campouts.
"There ain't no use in me ly
ing about it,"he replied. "I'm a
little past being the hardy soul
who goes out and sleeps on the
ground with a great deal of sat
isfaction." '
WASHINGTON (AP)— Draft
Director Lewis B. Hershey said
this week that Americans don't
like and don't understand the
"distant . . . dim" war in Viet
nam but "they like the prosperi
ty" it generates.
Lt. Gen. Hershey, who in near
ly a quarter century as head of
the Selective Service has di
rected the military draft of 13
million young men, said the gen
eral public doesn't understand
the war in Vietnam because:
"It's distant, it's dim and it
deals with people they're not fa
miliar with."
Americans Too Soft
In an interview, the 72-year
old Hershey criticized the toler
ant attitude he said has devel
oped toward those who deliber
ately break the law, said Amer
icans may be leading too soft a
life, again advocated universal
military training and said he
has no plans to retire.
Hershey said the Vietnam sit
uation is similar in some re
spects to the Korean War. "The
public just never understood it
(the Korean War) like they did
World War II," he said. "I think

we've got some of the same
problems now."
He isn't peeved by criticism
of the draft, although he hastens
to defend the system.
Only Wednesday, after 30 Re
publican House members called
for an immediate investigation
of the draft, Hershey pledged
his co-operation and said, "I have
always understood that one of
the functions of the Congress is
to look into how well the laws
they pass are being carried out."
