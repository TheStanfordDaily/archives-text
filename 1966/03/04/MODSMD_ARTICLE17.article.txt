# ‘New Isolationism' Dangerous For US
## 
### JAMES MARLOW Associated Press News Analyst 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
past year, particularly the past
two months, has been a dizzy
and confused a time in Ameri
can foreign affairs as any since
the isolationism of the 1930's
left the United States docile, un
armed and 111-prepared for the
war that came.
Now the divided opinion on
the Vietnamese war may well
make'the North Vietnamese
Communists and the Viet Cong
believe the American will to
fight is splintered and that by
contuing the war they may win
what they want.
Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, Connec
ticut Democrat, calls the criti
cism of the Vietnamese war "the
new isolationism." But the criti
cism is not so clear as that.
There is a general unhappiness
among the critics but no unity
on a solution.
Immoral and Godless
Sen. Wayne Morse, Oregon
Democrat, has denounced Presi
dent Johnson's Vietnam polisy
as "immoral and Godless." He
said Johnson has no constitu
tional right to send troops into
it without a declaration of war.
But there is not even a little
sign Congress intends to declare
war.
Morse called for arbitration
of the war by the United Na
tions. Johnson made a bid to the
United Nations for a negotiated
settlement. But the U. N. Secur
ity Council shows little stomach
for a getting involved.
Last spring Sen. J. W. Ful
bright, Arkansas Democrat,
Johnson's constant war critic,
and chairman of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee, called
for a halt to the bombing of
North Vietnam as a way to in
duce the Communists into a
negotiated settlement.

Starting late in December, and
for 37 days, Johnson halted the
bombings, sent peace emissaries
around the world. The North
Vietnamese ignored him and
Johnson ordered the bombing
resumed Jan. 31.
Later Fulbright called for a
negotiated settlement with ma
jor concessions by both sides,
and this week he proposed a
settlement by agreement with
Red China for neutralization of
all Southeast Asia.
But the United States has no
regular diplomatic relations
with the Chinese and has kept
them out of the United Nations.
And it is hard to see how China,
even if it agreed not-to invade its
neighbors, could be kept from
subverting them, which would
have the same effect as inva
sion.
War With Red China
Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin, re
tired, told Fulbright's committee
a large-scale increase of Ameri
can troops in Vietnam would
Involve the risk of war with Red
China. Yesterday Secretary of
Defense Robert S. McNamarra
announced American combat
strength in Vietnam would be
boosted from 205, to 235,000
men.
Yet, Gavin insisted American
troops should stay in Vietnam
but at the same time said this
country should not escalate the
war.
And George F. Kennan, one
time head of the tSate Depart
ment's policy planning staff,
also had some for Ful
bright's group: This country
should decide what could be se
curely held in Vietnam and then
dig in and wait for a political
solution. But even while he was
saying It the Viet Cong held
about 75 per cent of South Viet
nam.
