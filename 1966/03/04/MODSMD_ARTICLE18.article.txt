# Congressmen Request Draft Probe
## McNamara Admits Some Viet Failures 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
possibility that U.S. forces
fighting in Vietnam will be
doubled makes it urgent that a
hard look be taken at military
draft methods, Rep. Ogden Reid
said this week.
The New York Republican
made the statement as he and
29 other GOP House members
called for a broad Congressional
investigation to make sure draft
laws are "efficient and equit
able."
Right now, the Republicans
claimed, the draft is haphazard
and mired in a "jungle of red
tape," and not everybody is con
vinced selection methods are
fair or uniform.
Will Hear Hershey
Rep. L. Mendel Rivers said
later the House Armed Services
Committee he heads will hear
Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey and
then decide whether to investi
gate the military draft.
Rivers, whose committee
would make any such investiga
tion, said none of the Republi
cans had talked with him in ad
vance of their statement.
The "authority to induct"
phase of the Selective Service
System Law expires next year.
Rivers said it has been known
for weeks the committee plans
to hear Hershey.
The committee starts its reg
ular military posture hearings
Monday. A date to hear Her
shey has not yet been set.
Indirect Reply
Hershey, the Selective Service
Director, made an indirect reply
to the Republicans when he was
asked at a luncheon of the
Young Lawyers Committee of
the Federal Bar Association
whether the draft system should
be reorganized. Hershey reply
ed:
"No. That's the plain and un
adulterated answer. You would
not do something to something
that's working."
To a newsman who asked
Hershey about the Republican
statement, the Draft Director
replied:
"I have always understood
that one of the functions of the
Congress is to look into how
well the laws they pass are be
ing carried out."
Not Satisfied
Hershey said he is not satis
fied with the time it takes to

run men through the manpower
supply pipeline, but he pointed
out that experience has shown
it is necessary to have about six
times as many men in the draft
pipeline at any one time as are
expected to be needed to fill the
next monthly draft call.
Classification, appeal and
armed forces examining pro
cedures all take time, Hershey
said, adding that one local board
which recently came to his at
tention had received some 3,000
appeals in about six weeks.
Hershey conceded some in
equities exist but contended
that absolute equity has never
been attained.
At the Republicans' news con
ference, Rep. Robert F. Ells
worth of Kansas said, "No one
wants to take authority away
from local draft boards."
Uniform Guidelines
What's needed, said Rep. Rich
ard S. Schweiker of Pennsyl
vania, is uniform guidelines.
The Republicans stressed in a
statement that a look is needed
at Administration efforts to per
suade America's allies to con
tribute manpower to the Viet
namese War.
"We can no longer afford a
haphazard approach toward the
supply of personnel to support
objectives of the United States
in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,"
they said.
One of the areas that needs
Investigation, the 30 said, is the
shift, in policy toward drafting
college students and whether
use of grades and a qualifica
tion test are really equitable.
Ambiguity Of Standards
"A student may be doing very
well in a small college," Reid
commented, "but at Harvard or
Yale or some other college with
higher standards . . . may not
be doing so well because of
these standards."
The seven members who amp
lified the prepared statement
said they wanted to make it
clear they are not in favor of
"making the draft punitive . . .
the right of honest dissent must
be upheld."
"We're not talking about draft
card burners," Ellsworth said.
"They've violated a federal law."
He said the group feels the
courts were the proper places
to determine guilt or innocence
of a charge.
