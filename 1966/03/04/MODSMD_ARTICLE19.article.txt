# Whine A-Long With Chrysler
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
With the introduction of its
turbine powered car, Chrysler
Corporation has reached a mile
stone in automobile design.
Two of these cars were at
Stanford yesterday as part of a
six month promotional tour of
college campuses. This reporter
drove the turbine, as did a few
other students and professors.
The drive itself was a bizarre
experience. The turbine does not
respond to gentle pressure on
the acceleratorâ€”you have to de
press the accelerator approxi
mately an inch and a half for a
normal response.
The gearshift is like nothing
else in existence. It is not possi
ble to shift the more or less auto
matic transmission between
gears as is the case with other
automatics.
During the test drive we dis
covered several facts about this
automobile that would indicate
that more work will have to be
done. For example, it oversteers
and leans on corners. If you
want to drive in a straight line
for the rest of your life, then
this is the car for you.
The characteristic whine of the
turbine may be easily heard as
the car approaches. Unfor
tunately, the whine may also be
heard inside the car and could
become annoying during a long
trip.
Four six-footers would have
difficulty sitting in the car com
fortably. The driver would have
a difficult time finding all of
the instruments since they are
scattered around and about on
the dash. But these are not faults
of the turbine itself, they occur
on many American cars.
The turbine engine is light
weight and has about 80 percent
fewer parts than the normal pis
ton engine. Use of a turbine
should cost less due to lower oil
consumption and reduced need

for repairs.
This car can run on kerosene
or diesel fuel, thereby further
cutting costs even. For that mat
ter, it can also run on Jim Beam
or Channel No. 5.
We drove it over some of the
worst roads in this area, all of
which are conveniently located
on the Stanford campus. Near
the post office, for example, we
drove it fast and made no at
tempts to miss any of the pot
holes, but the suspension held
up beautifully.
On a stretch of road between
Encina and the Shell station, we
accelerated to 60. The whole
process took eleven seconds,
which is not a great selling
point for turbine-powered cars.
Top speed is approximately 117
mph, if you can find a road long
and straight enough to get up
to that speed.
It's a nice car, but I wouldn't
want to own one.
