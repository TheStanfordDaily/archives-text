# Swedish Legalist To Visit Stanford
## 
### 
Sweden's legal watchdog is
coming to the Stanford Univer
sity campus. Ombudsman Alfred
Bexelius will speak in History
214, at 3:30 p.m. today. His
talk at Stanford, at the invita
tion of the Stanford Law Fo
rum, will follow addresses to the
Government Organization Com
mittee at the State Capitol and
the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco.
The state legislature is study
ing the institution of the Om
budsman and is very interested
in the viewpoint of the world's
foremost authority on this
unique legal institution.
"The 'ombudsman concept' is

very simple," said David Lele
wer, president of the law forum.
"It means only that a citizen ag
grieved by an official's action or
inaction should be able to state
his grievance to an influential
functionary, empowered to in
vestigate and to express conclu
sions regarding the problem
stated." Mr. Bexelius, Sweden's
thirty â€¢ first Justitieombudsman
[popularly referred to as the
"JO"] is charged with the re
sponsibility of seeing that
judges and other officials ob
serve both the letter and the
spirit of the law.
He may prosecute those pub
lic servants who have acted il
legally or neglected their duties.
Alfred Bexelius will speak on
"The Ombudsman: Champion
of the Citizen" when he is at
Stanford. Mr. Bexelius, 62, is
currently in his third term as
Riksdagens Justitieombudsman.
During his term in office the
number of complaints have dou
bled, yet he is still able to take
on several hundred cases a year
on his own initiative.
In Mr. Bexelius' opinion, his
most powerful weapon is the an
nual report to the Parliament.
No official likes to have his
name included in this reverse
"Who's Who," and so will think
twice before making hasty or
Arbitrary decisions. "Every
country has things that are
wrong," says Mr. Bexelius, "and
all should have a JO."
The public is invited to Mr.
Bexelius' address.
