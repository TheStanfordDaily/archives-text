# Stanford Mystique Enriched Overseas
## 
### 
(Editor's note: With over half
of Stanford's undergraduates at
tending one of the five overseas
campuses during their college
years, the overseas experience
has imbedded itself deeply in
the Stanford mystique. Follow
ing are excerpts of two letters
received from Daily correspond
ents this week. They are from
Italy XI and France XI. Both
of these groups will be return
ing to the home campus later
this month. For those who have
not yet been overseas, these ex
cerpts will hopefully give some
what of an idea of the experi
ence. )
ITALY XI
By STEVEN TIPTON
FLORENCE, Italy—lt's late
for us now. The galleys of next
quarter's time schedule hang in
the corridor downstairs. We
have begun to think of return
ing, of new courses and old
friends. We look back on what
we have done and missed these
five months. So much remains,
and the weekends have run out.
With so many around us only
half-known we are about to part.
Academic Requirements
Personal comfort and freedom
from many academic require
ments can encourage a broader
range of experiences or permit
them to be more superficial.
Probably more than anything
else, however, our own interests

and initiative have stood be
tween what was and what might
have been. One thing may be im
portant: we need no one here.
And no one really needs us. Or
rather we have not made our
selves needed.
Tuscany had been warmer re
cently. Green of a new year al
ready colors the hills between
Florence and Siena. The farmers
fear what the cold will do if it
returns. Clouds are flowing up
Arno's valley. The sun has
drained one edge of the sky
transparent and stretched the
shadow of the great orange
dome of the Cathedral across its
city.
FRANCE XI
By HARRY KELLOGG
You don't ever have to go out
to find the French. The center
is literally crawling with them
during the week. Seeing a turn
over of succeeding groups has
apparently made them bold. At
times they seem to have taken
over—and some you could swear
have been camping in the lounge
for three days.
. . . On weekends, you are con
cerned with who has a car,
where he is going, and how
many people he is taking al
ready. You can take the train.
Most of the students have found
hitchhiking the most satisfying.
In spite of official disapproval
of this method it provides both
the cheapest transportation and
the best contact with the
French.
. . . Some of the lectures we
get are excellent; others are not,
and everyone's afraid to hurt
their feelings. Eventually you
don't distinguish between the
two.
The lectures come all in
French.

range of experiences or permit
them to be more superficial.
Probably more than anything
else, however, our own interests

and initiative have stood be
tween what was and what might
have been. One thing may be im
portant: we need no one here.
And no one really needs us. Or
rather we have not made our
selves needed.
Tuscany had been warmer re
cently. Green of a new year al
ready colors the hills between
Florence and Siena. The farmers
fear what the cold will do if it
returns. Clouds are flowing up
Arno's valley. The sun has

transparent and stretched the
shadow of the great orange
dome of the Cathedral across its

FRANCE XI
By HARRY KELLOGG
You don't ever have to go out
to find the French. The center
is literally crawling with them
during the week. Seeing a turn
over of succeeding groups has
apparently made them bold. At
times they seem to have taken
over—and some you could swear
have been camping in the lounge
for three days.
. . . On weekends, you are con
cerned with who has a car,
where he is going, and how
many people he is taking al
ready. You can take the train.
Most of the students have found
hitchhiking the most satisfying.
In spite of official disapproval
of this method it provides both
the cheapest transportation and
the best contact with the
French.
. . . Some of the lectures we
get are excellent; others are not,
and everyone's afraid to hurt
their feelings. Eventually you
don't distinguish between the
two.
The lectures come all in
French.
(Editor's note: With over half
of Stanford's undergraduates at
tending one of the five overseas
campuses during their college
years, the overseas experience
has imbedded itself deeply in
the Stanford mystique. Follow
ing are excerpts of two letters
received from Daily correspond
ents this week. They are from
Italy XI and France XI. Both
of these groups will be return
ing to the home campus later
this month. For those who have
not yet been overseas, these ex
cerpts will hopefully give some
what of an idea of the experi
ence. )
ITALY XI
By STEVEN TIPTON
FLORENCE, Italy—lt's late
for us now. The galleys of next
quarter's time schedule hang in
the corridor downstairs. We
have begun to think of return
ing, of new courses and old
friends. We look back on what
we have done and missed these
five months. So much remains,
and the weekends have run out.
With so many around us only
half-known we are about to part.
