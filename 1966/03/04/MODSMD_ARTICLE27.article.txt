### BOB THIERIOT 
The 1966 version of Stanford
Varsity Track goes into this Sat
urday's Stanford Relays with a
team lacking in depth and weak
in a few spots, but a team with
a sprinkling of stars and a ros
ter of dedicated and hard-work
ing performers.
Coach Payton Jordan feels
that the team is a bit small, but
he points out.that it has worked
hard to get into top condition.
This one factor could possibly
avert possible injuries, and some
what alleviate the depth prob
lem.
Discus Tops
Stanford boasts the leading
discus man in the countryâ€”Bob
Stoecker, the team's captain. He
was the 1965 NCAA and AAWU
Champion as a result of a 186'6"
heave. He is already an All-
American In track this year.
When needed Stoecker also
throws the shot-put and javelin.
In the pole vault Jim Esheman
ranks as the number one out
doors vaulter in the country on
the co.fciate level. He is only
a junior has already reached
16'1".
Larry Questad was the 1963
NCAA sprint champ. The follow
ing year he was injured. But
last year he was back in form.
He is timed at 9.3 for the 100
and 20.6 for the 220. He also
serves as anchor on the 440 re
lay team, which last yeai set the
world record. All the other mem
bers of the team have gradu
ated, but the new three runners
Don Forbes, Russ Taplin, and

Roger Cox should be able to
run somewhere between 40-41
seconds. They need to work on
their passing and teamwork, but
could conceivably approach the
39 second bracket.
Dave Deubner is the second
leading miler in the AAWU con
ference with a time of 4:03.7.
He is a very versatile performer
capable of doing the mile, half
mile, and 3000 meter steeple
chase in the same meet.
Strong Field
Stanford's field events are
strong except in the high jump,

Off (aimpus won the intra
mural basketball champion
ship last night, 41-40, in the
last 30 seconds on a three-point
play by George Manz. Theta
Delta Chi and ATO tied for
third place.

where sophomore Steve Suomi
is the only really capable per
former with a career high of
6'6".
Stoecker leads the discus
group followed by Tyler Wil
liams at 171% feet and Mickey
Wool at 160 plus. In the javelin
George Porter ranks second in
the AAWU with his longest toss
of 233 feet. He is backed by Dick
Warwick with 206 plus and
Chuck Smart at 195 plus.
The quarter mile is full of po
tential winners, but as yet only
Terry Fredrickson and Jim
Ward have proven themselves.

They both run near the 47 sec
ond mark. Other possibles are
Dell Martin, Glenn Havskjold,
and Mike Hughes.
Good Shot
The half mile looks promising
with sophomore Alex Whittle
from the cross country team.
He was voted the outstanding
cross country runner this fall.
He can run the half mile, mile,
and two mile.
Chuck Smart leads the list of
regular shot putters with a mark
over 52 feet. Bob Stoecker is
capable of over 54, but at times
shotputting detracts from his
discus performance, so he is
only used when absolutely need
ed. Bill Fyall Is capable of over
50 feet.
The long jump is full of men
able to jump over 24 feet. Craig
Vaughn Is the most consistent
jumper. Bud Walsh, who does
the long jump, and triple jump,
also sees action as the team'*;
leading hurdler, and is consi
dered to be the team's most ver
satile and dependable man.
The Frosh, led by captains Tom
Kommers and Pat Morrison,
have many able performers in
all categories except the long
jump and pole vault. In these
events one man holds all the
hopes for entries. Bob Smith Is
the only broad jumper, and Mike
Lemons is the sole pole vaulter.
Though the team is weak In
spots, the areas of concentrated
strength should be able to easily
offset any weaknesses. This
should be a very good season
for Stanford track.
