## Ruggers Meet Cal 
### JOHN MERRILL 
After a disappointing opener,
the Stanford ruggers travel to
Berkeley for the second and final
game of the home-and-home se
ries for the Big Scrum Axe.
The Indians dropped the first
contest 17-9, and have their
backs to the wall as the trophy
is awarded on the basis of total
points scored in the two games.
A victory by a margin of nine
or more points would regain the
Scrum Axe lost two years ago
to the Golden Bears.
Scrum Shines
The Card scrum turned in a
fine effort last Saturday, but
the cause was lost as the Indians
never scored a try. Each time
an effective offensive rush was
started, the Stanford backs ei
ther dropped the ball or were
cornered by the speedy Cal back
field.
Mike Grace supplied all the
Stanford offense with three pen
alty kicks good for nine points.
Scrum half for the Indians,
David Evans, was shaken up in
the Bear tilt and may not play

tomorrow. Evans has been a
standout all year for the Cards.
The Berkeley rugby field may
provide either an extra hazard
or a distinct advantage for the
Stanford ruggers. The field, thin
ner than the normal rugby field,
will be foreign to Stanford, but
may slow down the Bear back
field.
Stanford currently has a 4-2-2
season record. Tomorrow's Cal
game will be the last regular
match of the season for Stan
ford, though the Indians will de
fend their Monterey Tourna
ment Championship during the
spring break.
Probable starters for Stanford
are: Tom Fortmann, hooker;
Joe Neal, prop; Dave Pugh,
prop; Blaine Nye and Randy Va
han, 2nd row; Eric De Gooyer,
back row; Bob Newberry and
Frank Patitucci, breakaways;
David Evans, scrum half; Andy
Ovenstone Ist %, Mike Grace
2nd %; Erick Sutcliffe, center
%; Leon Hartvickson and Mac
Wylie, wings, and Bob Burke,
fullback.


The Tribe ruggers will be out to
reverse hurt week's defeat which
they suffered at the hands of the
Bears. The Rugby scrum axe is
awarded to the team which
scores the most points during
the two contests.

Mike Grace supplied all the
Stanford offense with three pen
alty kicks good for nine points.
Scrum half for the Indians,
David Evans, was shaken up in
the Bear tilt and may not play

tomorrow. Evans has been a
standout all year for the Cards.
The Berkeley rugby field may
provide either an extra hazard
or a distinct advantage for the
Stanford ruggers. The field, thin
ner than the normal rugby field,
will be foreign to Stanford, but
may slow down the Bear back
field.
Stanford currently has a 4-2-2
season record. Tomorrow's Cal
game will be the last regular
match of the season for Stan
ford, though the Indians will de
fend their Monterey Tourna
ment Championship during the
spring break.
Probable starters for Stanford
are: Tom Fortmann, hooker;
Joe Neal, prop; Dave Pugh,
prop; Blaine Nye and Randy Va
han, 2nd row; Eric De Gooyer,
back row; Bob Newberry and
Frank Patitucci, breakaways;
David Evans, scrum half; Andy
Ovenstone Ist %, Mike Grace
2nd %; Erick Sutcliffe, center
%; Leon Hartvickson and Mac
Wylie, wings, and Bob Burke,
fullback.


The Tribe ruggers will be out to
reverse hurt week's defeat which
they suffered at the hands of the
Bears. The Rugby scrum axe is
awarded to the team which
scores the most points during
the two contests.
