# Composer Tells Of New Work's Theme-Message

### DOUG RAYHER 
"Man's essential nature remains un
changed," said Leon Kirchner at Din
kelspiel yesterday, and we are still
saddled with "a human language not
significantly altered since the Stone
Age."
The experience of trying to form
an opera that successfully escapes
both these constrictions, and makes
a healthy and meaningful amalgam

of "Words and Music" was the topic
of his talk.
The "either-or" dilemma of objec
tive study also received attention;
Kirchner, a Harvard University Fel
low in Music, called it as a "natural
by-product of reductional analysis."
Elementary Fragments
"The best way of examining a liv
ing structure is to break it into ele
mentary fragments. But when we do,
we lose sight of the whole and its
functions," claimed Kirchner.
"Here is the function of the univer
sity. Not in the 'either-or,' but in ex
amining one, while not losing sight of
the other," and in counteracting the
way in which the "analytical process
ignores the fact that the functions
of living organisms come from the
interplay of fragments, rather than
from the particular properties of each
individual fragment."
'Henderson' Opera
Kirchner, who has already written
a symphony, two piano concertos,
and numerous sonatas, has approxi
mately two years of work left on his
currcnt effort, an opera based on Saul
Bellow's novel, Henderson, the Rain
Kinff. It is scheduled for performance
in the Lincoln Center for the Per
forming Arts, in New York City.
The central theme of the librette is
drawn from Bellow's assertion that
"in an age of madness, to expect to
be untouched by madness is a form
of madness. When, for example, Hen
derson's future wife asks him if he is
wasting his life, he muses, "I wonder
if it's too late to become a doctor?"
This illustrates Kirchner's opinions
of twentieth century forms of insan
ity.
