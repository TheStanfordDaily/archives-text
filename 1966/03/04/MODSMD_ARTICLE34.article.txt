# Indians vs. Bears In Finale; Tribe Tries For .500 Season
## 
### 
With their championship hopes
dashed last Saturday night by
the U.C.L.A. Bruins, the Stan
ford Indians return to the Bay
Area for their final two tilts of
the season.
The Tribe travels to engage
California, Friday night at 8:00
in Harmon Gym, and then hop
back home for a Saturday after
noon encounter with the same
team in Stanford Pavilion. Sat
urday's contest, commencing at
2:30 will be regionally televised
as the A.A.W.U. game of the
week.
In meeting the last place
Bears, Stanford is now out to
gain a winning campaign. The
up-and-down Tribe currently
rests at 12-11 on the season and
7-5, third place, in A.A.W.U.
competition. A single win would
give coach Howie Dallmer his
fifth straight winning campaign
and his eighth winning season
in 12 seasons as the Stanford
headman.
A pair of wins would also
bring Stanford closer in the
overall series which California
now heads by a lengthy 98-63
margin. However, it must be re
membered that Stanford has
won nine of the last eleven
games played between the
schools and has captured the
last three in a row. The first
game of this series was played
in 1912.
For eight members of the In

dian squad, including starters
Bob Bedell and Ray Kosanke,
it will mark the final collegiate
competition. The others are
Jack Gilbert, Rod Young, Mike
Preisler, Karl Wustrack, Skip
Hutchinson, and Bill Farley.
Bedell Big' Bomb
Bedell enjoyed another fine
weekend in the southland split
and vaulted into forth place
among the All-Time Stanford
scoring greats. The 6-6 Mi Los
Angeles product canned 25
points and grabbed 15 rebounds
in the come-from-behind victory
over the Trojans and then gar
nered 14 points the next night
to regain the team leadership in
scoring from sophomore Art
Harris.
Bedell's efforts put him past
the 1000 mark, 1022 to be exact,
on a career basis. Only Tom
Dose, Ron Tomsic, and the im
mortal Hank Luisetti have put
more Stanford points through
the hoop. Also, it left Bob only
12 points short of becoming the
tenth Indian performer to gar
ner 400 points into a season.
Harris also has a shot at the
400 point barrier and needs but
22 in the remaining two con
tests to become the third sopho
more ever to achieve the pla
teau.
The Cal Frosh, 9-3, needs two
wins over the tough Stanford
yearlings this weekend in order
to post the finest won-lost rec

ord at Cal in a decade. The In
dians are 13-2 on the season,
having lost to the Santa Clara
Frosh once and to the UC Med
Center.
The Cubs lost twice to the
Bronco Frosh, by a total of
three points, and to the Medi
cine Men. Leading scorers for

the Indians are Don Griffin,
Fremont HS, Oakland, a 6-4
guard, and center Mai McEl
wain, a 6-4 l A Piedmont product.
Cal is led by Don Johnson, a
6-2 forward-guard, whose 18.2
points per game average is ap
proaching the UC Frosh record,
Eric Davidson, a 5-10 guard
from Oakland, and center
Wayne Stewart, a 6-7 Downey
product, who is averaging 22
points a game over the last four
contests.
