# OPEN CIBA SEASON
## Tribe Meets Broncos Daily Sports 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford baseball team
opens up its last and hopefully
most successful pursuit of the
CIBA pennant today and tomor
row against perenially powerful
Santa Clara.
Today's game is in Sunken
Diamond at 3:00 p.m. Tomor
row the teams move to Santa
Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium for
a 2:00 p. m. contest.
The California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association will have
officially deceased at the end of
this season after 40 years of op
eration.
Southern Division
Four of the teams, Stanford,
USC, Cal, and UCLA will form
the southern division of the
AAWU next year. The remain

ing two teams in the league,
Santa Clara and Santa Barbara,
will probably free lanee before
deciding what to do.
Santa Clara's Broncos lost
some good players of last year's
team due to signing professional
contracts, but they are not suf-

fering as more fine sophomores
are around and a couple of J. C.
transfers have shown up.
Last season when the Indians
won the league title, Santa
Clara gave Coach Dutch Feh
ring a real fright. The Broncos
beat Stanford three out of four
times including two in the final
weekend of league play which
very nearly cost Stanford the
championship.
Sluggers
The Broncos, with a 5-1-1 rec
ord, are up to their usual hard
hitting tricks again this season
as they have been outslugging
their opponents regularly. They
have been scoring seven and
eight runs a game.
Typical of their play is little
Ray Hennington. One of the top
hitters in the league last year
In both power and percentage
Hennington, a s'B", 145 pound
second baseman, hit a home run
and a double for five rbi's in his
first two at bats of the season.
Although the Tribe got off to
a slow start up at the plate,
they have come alived in the last
few games. The last four games
the Indians have outscored the
opposition 33-5. Their record is
5-0-1 not including the freshman
game which they lost.
Their most recent conquest
was against Cal at Davis Tues
day. Jim Hibbs homered over
the left field fence in Sunken
Diamond to lead the long ball
hitters.
Top Three
Coach Fehring has his three
best pitchers poised to bust the
Broncos. John Mason will start
Friday. Daro Quiring will start
Saturday and Terry Docken will
be number one reliever both
days.
Mason has already looked as
good as he did during his best
mid-season days last year, and
if he can keep his pitches down
low, he will keep Santa Clara
at bay.

Quiring, who was an all-CIBA
selection last year, has been
slowed by a couple of injuries,
but last weekend he looked ex
tremely sharp for five innings
until he tired in the sixth.
Should either he or Mason fal
ter tricky Terry Docken will
come in with his usual assort
ment of curves, sinkers, and
screw balls. As the other two
he has a 1-0 record. He has the
best earned run verage of the
trio, though, at 0.70.
Trickery
If he gets a chance to pitch,
he may be the more effective
than Mason or Quirling. Mason
and Quirling are fast ball pitch
ers and Santa Clara usually de
vours anything that comes over
the plate without a bend on It.
Docken on the other hand con
tinually changes speedy on his
assortment of junk bam

week the Indians were de
feated 9-3 by the Palo Alto La
crosse Club.

ance and baffled so far this sea
son.
Santa Clara's pitching Is a
question mark. They have one
of the potentially best throwers
in the league in Jan Dukes. But
he has had arm troubles and
is an unknown quantity.
Jim Mclnerny, a J.C, transfer,
has been their best pitcher so
far, and the Tribe will see him
one day for sure.
New Start
Besides Henningson, the Bron
cos have a highly touted sopho
more in Bob Spence who is sup
posedly as good as last season's
third baseman A 1 Gallagher.
Gallagher signed a five figure
bonus and went pro.
The only Stanford hitter off
to a real good start is rightfield
er Ron Yett. He is hitting an
even .400.
Coach Fehring will stick with
his usual lineup of Mike Schu
maker (leftfield), Steve Hovley
(centerfield), Yett, Pete Middle
kauff (first base), Jim Hibbs
(catcher), Dick Swan (second
base), Frank Duffy (shortstop),
Tom Melzer (third base), and
the pitcher.
The only common foe Is USF.
Stanford beat them 2-1 while
Santa Clara tied them 8-8.

AAWU next year. The remain

ing two teams in the league,
Santa Clara and Santa Barbara,
will probably free lanee before
deciding what to do.
Santa Clara's Broncos lost
some good players of last year's
team due to signing professional
contracts, but they are not suf-

fering as more fine sophomores
are around and a couple of J. C.
transfers have shown up.
Last season when the Indians
won the league title, Santa
Clara gave Coach Dutch Feh
ring a real fright. The Broncos
beat Stanford three out of four
times including two in the final
weekend of league play which
very nearly cost Stanford the
championship.
Sluggers
The Broncos, with a 5-1-1 rec
ord, are up to their usual hard
hitting tricks again this season
as they have been outslugging
their opponents regularly. They
have been scoring seven and
eight runs a game.
Typical of their play is little
Ray Hennington. One of the top
hitters in the league last year
In both power and percentage
Hennington, a s'B", 145 pound
second baseman, hit a home run
and a double for five rbi's in his
first two at bats of the season.
Although the Tribe got off to
a slow start up at the plate,
they have come alived in the last
few games. The last four games
the Indians have outscored the
opposition 33-5. Their record is
5-0-1 not including the freshman
game which they lost.
Their most recent conquest
was against Cal at Davis Tues
day. Jim Hibbs homered over
the left field fence in Sunken
Diamond to lead the long ball
hitters.
Top Three
Coach Fehring has his three
best pitchers poised to bust the
Broncos. John Mason will start
Friday. Daro Quiring will start
Saturday and Terry Docken will
be number one reliever both
days.
Mason has already looked as
good as he did during his best
mid-season days last year, and
if he can keep his pitches down
low, he will keep Santa Clara
at bay.

Quiring, who was an all-CIBA
selection last year, has been
slowed by a couple of injuries,
but last weekend he looked ex
tremely sharp for five innings
until he tired in the sixth.
Should either he or Mason fal
ter tricky Terry Docken will
come in with his usual assort
ment of curves, sinkers, and
screw balls. As the other two
he has a 1-0 record. He has the
best earned run verage of the
trio, though, at 0.70.
Trickery
If he gets a chance to pitch,
he may be the more effective
than Mason or Quirling. Mason
and Quirling are fast ball pitch
ers and Santa Clara usually de
vours anything that comes over
the plate without a bend on It.
Docken on the other hand con
tinually changes speedy on his
assortment of junk bam

ance and baffled so far this sea
son.
Santa Clara's pitching Is a
question mark. They have one
of the potentially best throwers
in the league in Jan Dukes. But
he has had arm troubles and
is an unknown quantity.
Jim Mclnerny, a J.C, transfer,
has been their best pitcher so
far, and the Tribe will see him
one day for sure.
New Start
Besides Henningson, the Bron
cos have a highly touted sopho
more in Bob Spence who is sup
posedly as good as last season's
third baseman A 1 Gallagher.
Gallagher signed a five figure
bonus and went pro.
The only Stanford hitter off
to a real good start is rightfield
er Ron Yett. He is hitting an
even .400.
Coach Fehring will stick with
his usual lineup of Mike Schu
maker (leftfield), Steve Hovley
(centerfield), Yett, Pete Middle
kauff (first base), Jim Hibbs
(catcher), Dick Swan (second
base), Frank Duffy (shortstop),
Tom Melzer (third base), and

The Broncos, with a 5-1-1 rec
ord, are up to their usual hard
hitting tricks again this season
as they have been outslugging
their opponents regularly. They
have been scoring seven and
eight runs a game.
Typical of their play is little
Ray Hennington. One of the top
hitters in the league last year
In both power and percentage
Hennington, a s'B", 145 pound
second baseman, hit a home run
and a double for five rbi's in his
first two at bats of the season.
Although the Tribe got off to
a slow start up at the plate,
they have come alived in the last
few games. The last four games
the Indians have outscored the
opposition 33-5. Their record is
5-0-1 not including the freshman
game which they lost.
Their most recent conquest
was against Cal at Davis Tues
day. Jim Hibbs homered over
the left field fence in Sunken
Diamond to lead the long ball
hitters.
Top Three
Coach Fehring has his three
best pitchers poised to bust the
Broncos. John Mason will start
Friday. Daro Quiring will start
Saturday and Terry Docken will
be number one reliever both
days.
Mason has already looked as
good as he did during his best
mid-season days last year, and
if he can keep his pitches down
low, he will keep Santa Clara
at bay.

Quiring, who was an all-CIBA
selection last year, has been
slowed by a couple of injuries,
but last weekend he looked ex
tremely sharp for five innings
until he tired in the sixth.
Should either he or Mason fal
ter tricky Terry Docken will
come in with his usual assort
ment of curves, sinkers, and
screw balls. As the other two
he has a 1-0 record. He has the
best earned run verage of the
trio, though, at 0.70.
Trickery
If he gets a chance to pitch,
he may be the more effective
than Mason or Quirling. Mason
and Quirling are fast ball pitch
ers and Santa Clara usually de
vours anything that comes over
the plate without a bend on It.
Docken on the other hand con
tinually changes speedy on his
assortment of junk bam
By following this f'Vula he
has kept enemy batt W '112 bal-

crosse Club.

ance and baffled so far this sea
son.
Santa Clara's pitching Is a
question mark. They have one
of the potentially best throwers
in the league in Jan Dukes. But
he has had arm troubles and
is an unknown quantity.
Jim Mclnerny, a J.C, transfer,
has been their best pitcher so
far, and the Tribe will see him
one day for sure.
New Start
Besides Henningson, the Bron
cos have a highly touted sopho
more in Bob Spence who is sup
posedly as good as last season's
third baseman A 1 Gallagher.
Gallagher signed a five figure
bonus and went pro.
The only Stanford hitter off
to a real good start is rightfield
er Ron Yett. He is hitting an
even .400.
Coach Fehring will stick with
his usual lineup of Mike Schu
maker (leftfield), Steve Hovley
(centerfield), Yett, Pete Middle
kauff (first base), Jim Hibbs
(catcher), Dick Swan (second
base), Frank Duffy (shortstop),
Tom Melzer (third base), and
the pitcher.
The only common foe Is USF.
Stanford beat them 2-1 while
Santa Clara tied them 8-8.
The Stanford baseball team

most successful pursuit of the
CIBA pennant today and tomor

Santa Clara.
Today's game is in Sunken

row the teams move to Santa
Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium for
a 2:00 p. m. contest.
The California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association will have
officially deceased at the end of
this season after 40 years of op
eration.
Southern Division
Four of the teams, Stanford,
USC, Cal, and UCLA will form
the southern division of the
AAWU next year. The remain

ing two teams in the league,
Santa Clara and Santa Barbara,
will probably free lanee before
deciding what to do.
Santa Clara's Broncos lost
some good players of last year's
team due to signing professional
contracts, but they are not suf-

fering as more fine sophomores
are around and a couple of J. C.
transfers have shown up.
Last season when the Indians
won the league title, Santa
Clara gave Coach Dutch Feh
ring a real fright. The Broncos
beat Stanford three out of four
times including two in the final
weekend of league play which
very nearly cost Stanford the
championship.
