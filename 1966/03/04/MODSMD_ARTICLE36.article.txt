THEATER
The Speech and Drama Department presents two additional per
formances of Twelfth Night tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 in Tre
sidder large lounge (which, and I stand corrected, sports the most
resonant acoustical set-up on campus.) Tonight at 9, The Tangent
hosts a medley of attractions ranging from improvised theater to
folk-singer Dick Jacqua to dramatic readings.
FILMS
Glgl comes to the Tresidder Flicks tonight. A musical comedy,
the film has won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture
of the Year.
Saturday Night-At-The-Movies-In-Tresidder will feature The World
of Apu. This will be the last chance this quarter relive with the
wonderful Indians, India style, some of their more memorable ex
periences.
The Sunday Flicks will have The Americanization of Emily, star
ring James Garner and set in London during World War 11. It is
an excellent film and, notwithstanding Garner's ineptness at por
traying any character role other than Maverick, one you shouldn't
miss.
The Paris has probably the best bet around this week for value
of the dollar spent with the double feature Judith starring Sophia
Loren and Roman Holiday with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hep
burn. Audrey won an Academy Award for this one.
CONCERTS
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra, with Leon Kirchner conduct
ing two of his own works and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 will begin
at 8:30 tonight in Dinkelspiel. Organ and Choral Music will be
played by H. Nanney, University organist and the University Chorus
at Memorial Church, 3:30, Sunday. Skip James, an old time blues
singer from Mississippi makes his first West Coast appearance to
night at Tresidder.
