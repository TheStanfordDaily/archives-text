# Don't Miss 'The Chase'
## 
### ANDREW WILSON 
"The Chase" sports Marlon
Brando and a host of lesser stars
in what should have been one of
the best movies of the year.
From the familiar theme of the
home spun viciousness of a small
town against its deviate mem
bers, "The Chase" develops
shakily but furiously into a
powerful drama of people em
broiled and ultimately enervated
through their prejudices.
The action takes place in a
nondescript, south Texas town
and revolves around an escaped
convict's arrival back home. The
town's establishment is thrown
into considerable consternation
because several years prior they
had fixed his conviction, and
now word has it (wrongly) that
he has already killed a man since
escaping.
A Confused Young Man
The escaped convict, Bubber,
is portrayed warmly as a con
fused young man whose only
crime has been a bit too much
wildness. The sheriff has the
thankless job of trying to stay
the leaders of the town who are
all for going out en mob to gun
Bubber down, while he must
then also try to locate Bubber
himself.
In the movie's climactic mo
ments the civic leaders break
into the jail, mangle the sheriff
and pump a prisoner for Bub
ber's whereabouts, an old junk
yard on the outskirts of town.
They arrive there tailed by the
rest of the town which had wind
of the goings on and were
primed for a spectacle. In a
wild, pandamonious scene with
the townfolk yelling, dancijng
and boozing it about, an attempt

is made to flush Bubber out by
setting the junkyard on fire.
Skimpy Characters
The movie rides on its char
acterization and must manage
by sheer force to override some
skimpiness in that department.
Almost all the characters are
stock types, which is particular
ly unsettling toward the begin
ning of the movie.
There is, for example, a right
eous old gossip who provides
the oi poloi with coverage more
thorough than Huntley-Brink
ley: a nutty woman who pa
rades about pointing out sinners
and praying aloud for them: and,
of course, the crazy blond who
"just can't get over" anything.
Most of the characters, how
ever, do succeed in convincing
you of their essential shallow
ness and a number of them are
excellent. The overall effect,
stimulated by some fast and
vivid action, is to present a pan
orama of mass meanness, vice
and bigotry which is at once
intensely captivating and in
furiating. The film is most mov
ing in the maddening urge it is
able to excite iti one to annihilate
certain of the characters and the
town in general.
Marlon Brando
Marlon Brando plays the hard
bitten, courageous sheriff who
will not relent before the pres
sure of the citizens to hunt and
murder Bubber, and is superb
in this the movie's mai"n role.
His integrity sets him off from
virtually everybody else in the
town, though this does not make
him dominate the film which
concentrates rather on a wide
variety of reactions within the
town than the town against

Brando.
"The Chase" is a potent mo
vie strewn with many inanities.
The film is faced throughout
with maintaining a delicate bal
ance by which characters and
situations are standard without
being blatantly stereotyped. Typ
ical of the downfalls is a pro
longed party scene which seems
to call for a loose and decadent
display of small time wealth
from the town's elite. As often
happens in such cases, the dirty
fun and games seems a trifle
too shamelessly contrived, more
like drunks playing house than
playing around.
A Don't-MLss-It
Nevertheless, the movie does
convey a poignant general pic
ture of a town twisted by sordid
passions, the film's good p6ints
forcefully outweight the bad.
The Chase remains, in spite of
all, a terrifically powerful mo
vieâ€”a don't-miss-it, almost.
