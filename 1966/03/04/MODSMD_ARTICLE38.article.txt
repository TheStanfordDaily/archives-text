# The 						'Odd Couple? Is Amusing Farce
## 
### HENRY BRIGGS 
One member of the Odd Cou
ple is a heavy footed New York
sports writer who plays poker
in an unwashed Brooks Broth
ers shirt. The other is a light
footed T.V. news writer with a
fetish for cleanliness.
The two come together through
a mutual dilemma, divorce, and
form the nucleus of Neil Simon's
Broadway hit, The Odd Couple,
now playing at the Curran Thea
tre in San Francisco.
Opposites
On the surface, "The Odd Cou
ple" is a highly comic story of
opposites who live together for
three weeks without ever learn
ing to live with each other. Dan
Dailey as the brusque and flam
boyant Oscar has been living
alone in his eight-room New
York apartment for nine
months, ever since his wife
moved the children and herself
to California and got a divorce.
Except for a rag-doll on the
bookshelf and a crayon drawing
on one of the walls, the apart
ment has lost all signs of a
home. Clusters of magazines
and clothes allow just enough
room for the Friday-night poker
game, where the only rule is
that Oscar supply a fresh bag
of potato chips "at least one
every six months."
Into this unruly environment
comes Felix, played by Richard
Benjamin, who has just been
fired by his wife and is so de
spondant that had the kids not
been sleeping, he would have
shot himself right there.
From the first, the union is
doomer. Felix, whose cooking
and cleaning has already gotten
the better of his wife, brings in
a "Puriton" air cleaner, bakes
and bastes at every opportunity,
and develops numerous sympa
thy seeking ailments.
The final explosion is inevita
ble. When Oscar insults his
spaghetti, Felix tittered, "what
spaghetti. It's linguici!"
Whereupon Oscar stalks with
the plate into the kitchen, hurls

it at the wall, and rages, "There!
Now it's garbage!"
Felix leaves and moves in
with two empty-headed divorcees
from England who instantly
supply all the cooing mother
hood he has ever desired.
Funny Play
It is a very funny play, but
amongst this humor, Neil Simon
also weaves a curious comment
on human relations.
Oscar and Felix are not just
eccentrics; they are half-men.
The one with his poker games,
and mysterious sandwiches is
not just a proudly undomesti
cated male. Basically he is a
self-gratifying slob. The other
is not merely an oblivious pest;
he is an unweaned child. Their
unconscious selfishness makes
them intolerable first to their
wives and finally to each other.
Dan Dailey has made Oscar a
thoroughly enjoyable and be
lievable character whose baaic
gentleness never fully surfaces
from beneath the constant wise
cracks and locker room man
ner. Richard Benjamin's Felix
is equally enjoyable, and some
what more amusing if not quite
as believable. There are occa
sions when he nearly crosses the
line between effeminite hetero
sexuality and something
else (?).
William Pierson, Peter Boyle,
Harry Eno, and Rik Colitti make
up a comical, if somewhat com
mon poker gang. Diane Aubrey
and Barbara Evans, as thfe di
vorcees, actually do come from
England, so their accents are
good.
Amusing
Except for minor flaws, this
is an exceptionally amusing and
enjoyable play. It moves nat
urally and is performed well.
And although Simon does not
rock the intellect or create new
Universal Truths, he does offer
some valid insight, which is
quite rare in a successful Broad
way play.
It will run at the Curran
through Saturday, March 26.

hood he has ever desired.
Funny Play
It is a very funny play, but
amongst this humor, Neil Simon
also weaves a curious comment
on human relations.
Oscar and Felix are not just
eccentrics; they are half-men.
The one with his poker games,
and mysterious sandwiches is
not just a proudly undomesti
cated male. Basically he is a
self-gratifying slob. The other
is not merely an oblivious pest;
he is an unweaned child. Their
unconscious selfishness makes
them intolerable first to their
wives and finally to each other.
Dan Dailey has made Oscar a
thoroughly enjoyable and be
lievable character whose baaic
gentleness never fully surfaces
from beneath the constant wise
cracks and locker room man
ner. Richard Benjamin's Felix
is equally enjoyable, and some
what more amusing if not quite
as believable. There are occa
sions when he nearly crosses the
line between effeminite hetero
sexuality and something
else (?).
William Pierson, Peter Boyle,
Harry Eno, and Rik Colitti make
up a comical, if somewhat com
mon poker gang. Diane Aubrey
and Barbara Evans, as thfe di
vorcees, actually do come from
England, so their accents are
good.
Amusing
Except for minor flaws, this
is an exceptionally amusing and
enjoyable play. It moves nat
urally and is performed well.
And although Simon does not
rock the intellect or create new
Universal Truths, he does offer
some valid insight, which is
quite rare in a successful Broad
way play.
It will run at the Curran
through Saturday, March 26.
One member of the Odd Cou
ple is a heavy footed New York
sports writer who plays poker
in an unwashed Brooks Broth
ers shirt. The other is a light
footed T.V. news writer with a
fetish for cleanliness.
The two come together through
a mutual dilemma, divorce, and
form the nucleus of Neil Simon's
Broadway hit, The Odd Couple,
now playing at the Curran Thea
tre in San Francisco.
Opposites
On the surface, "The Odd Cou
ple" is a highly comic story of
opposites who live together for
three weeks without ever learn
ing to live with each other. Dan
Dailey as the brusque and flam
boyant Oscar has been living
alone in his eight-room New
York apartment for nine
months, ever since his wife
moved the children and herself
to California and got a divorce.
Except for a rag-doll on the
bookshelf and a crayon drawing
on one of the walls, the apart
ment has lost all signs of a
home. Clusters of magazines
and clothes allow just enough
room for the Friday-night poker
game, where the only rule is
that Oscar supply a fresh bag
of potato chips "at least one
every six months."
Into this unruly environment
comes Felix, played by Richard
Benjamin, who has just been
fired by his wife and is so de
spondant that had the kids not
been sleeping, he would have
shot himself right there.
From the first, the union is
doomer. Felix, whose cooking
and cleaning has already gotten
the better of his wife, brings in
a "Puriton" air cleaner, bakes
and bastes at every opportunity,
and develops numerous sympa
thy seeking ailments.
The final explosion is inevita
ble. When Oscar insults his
spaghetti, Felix tittered, "what
spaghetti. It's linguici!"
Whereupon Oscar stalks with
the plate into the kitchen, hurls

it at the wall, and rages, "There!
Now it's garbage!"
Felix leaves and moves in
with two empty-headed divorcees
from England who instantly
supply all the cooing mother
hood he has ever desired.
