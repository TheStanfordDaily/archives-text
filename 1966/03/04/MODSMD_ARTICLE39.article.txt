retary to the Stanford Fund and
Stern faculty resident compro
mise faculty-staff members.
Students on the committee in
clude Ted Anstedt, Eric Vitting
hoff, William Kelso, and Tom
Petersmeyer.
The most immediate concern
of the ad hoc committee on rush
procedure is to evaluate the
present policy and procedure
for men's living-group selection,
according to Lawrence A. Ben
ningson.
First organized last year by
Associate Dean of Students Rob
ert Gordon, then Dean of Men,
and the presidents of the Inter-
House, Inter-Club, and Inter-
Fraternity Councils, the com
mittee serves primarily as a
sounding board for ideas and
as an advisory group to the
Dean's Office and the student
organizations involved. In gen
eral, its objective is to provide
assistance and advice to those
student leaders responsible for
men's living group selection.
Profitable Idea
Benningson told The Daily
that for the present, the com
mittee's "most profitable idea
is to gather information about
how the selection process is
meeting the needs of freshmen
and the living groups." Once
the research is done, the prob
lem will be one of evaluation
and making suggestions for im
provement on that basis, he
said.
In the future the committee
tentatively plans to extend re
search beyond the limits of the
present procedures at Stanford
and to investigate other univers
ities' living groups. In this way
the committee hopes to increase
the number of alternatives to
consider without having any
specific one in mind.
Old Disadvantages
Prior to last year, each of
the three systems—lCC, IFC,
IMC—developed its own rush
program. Co-ordination was
done by the Dean of Men's
Office. The disadvantages of
the previous system were that
a student matter always ended
up being resolved by the admin
istration, that there was no
"growth" in the issue since it
began and ended at approximat
ely thes ame position each year,
and that consideration of the
freshmen rushees was omittedd
from what usually turned out
to be competition between the
various types of living groups,
Benningson said.

The first committee was ap
pointed by Dean Gordon with
the advice and approval of the
presidents of the three systems.
It was formed:
• To advise, not to set policy;
• To look at the freshmen
rushees as the center of the
selection process;
• To consider the "growth of
the issue" so that other more
progressive agreements could
be reached.
Although the present commit
tee contains faculty, student,
and administration representa
tives, they do not actually repre
sent constituencies as such. The
idea is that they do not neces
sarily have to defend the group
from which they come. The
committee tries to include mem
bers with a wide variety of ex
perience, including some mem
bers familiar with more than
one type of living group, accord
ing to Doug Davis, Assistant
Dean of Students.
'Basically Pragmatic*
He called the committee
"basically pragmatic" in that
it does not decide the basic is
sues of whether to have fra
ternities or not, whether to have
eating clubs or not; nor is the
committee meant as a detached
group whose decisions will be
imposed on the system. The
committee is designed to work
within the confines of the pres
ent system of living groups.
Although the committee is
technically responsible to the
Delia's Office, Davis went on
to emphasize that the attitude
of the office is to allow the
comimttee a good deal of inde
pendence while it continues to
create a "good and improving
situation."
'Successful'
Most of the parties involved
agree that so far, the work of
the committee has been rather
successful. The ideas of a uni
fied rush booklet and of send
ing information to the parents
of rushees were realized. Last
year's proposal for a unified en
forcement system has not been
accepted—among other things
it contradicted the ASSU Con
stitution —but a self-enforce
ment system evolved.
As for the future, Benningson
emphasizes that the committee
meets at the pleasure of the
systems concerned and that it
plans to continue its activities
as long as the members feel
they are meeting an eed.
