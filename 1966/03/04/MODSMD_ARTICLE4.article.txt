# SU Could Lose $1 Million In Student Loans
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER News Editor 
Termination of National Defense
Student Loans could deprive Stanford
of up to a million dollars in funds.
This warning comes from Robert
Iluff, director of financial aids, who
has been closely following changes in
national aid programs.
Huff explained that President John
son's budget report, released in Jan
uary, implies no further support is
available for the National Defense
loans, which are administered through
colleges. He noted that a second feder
ally-supported program—the Insured
or Guaranteed Loan program—was
established in 1965 "but is largely in
operative at this time."
Qualified I»aas
The Guaranteed Loans, Huff con-

tined, are not administered by col
leges but simply encourage private
commercial banks to make educa
tional loans. He said the Guaranteed
Loans "were the administration's al
ternative to a tax credit" for college
costs but were "not intended original
ly to replace Defense monies."
Huff said developments indicate ex
treme concern being expressed around
the country. a mighty big and
important source of aid to students,"
he said. "National Defense has been
a very popular program, and we'll
continue doing everything possible to
keep the program running until a suf
ficient replacement is available."
Under National Defense a student
could borrow up to $10,000. No inter
est was charged until nine months

after graduation, and up to 50 per
cent could be cancelled by subsequent
professional work in teaching.
Congressional Commitment
Because colleges themselves admin
istered the loans, financial aids offi
cials were able to counsel students
and assure financial help. Huff said
he felt Congress had "a certain com
mitment to those in college who are
expecting Defense loans now."
In addition, he was concerned that
Stanford and other schools may lack
direct funds in the future.
To get the Opportunity or Guaran
teed Loans will require certain state
legislation, Huff said. He is presently
representing private schools in the Co
ordinating Council for Higher Educa
tion to get proper legislation through.
"What we're trying to do," he said,

"is to get the Guaranteed Loan pro
gram implemented. But I think it is
going to take time."
'Cautious Optimism'
As for loans available next year,
Huff said he was "cautiously opti
mistic." He noted that considerable
pressure has been put on Congress
to keep funds available. "It is unreal
istic to expect the new system oper
ative in six months."
Huff recommended that students
who have received Defense Loans
write their Congressmen and express
their concern. He said these letters
would "have a pretty important im
pact" on those who structure various
finance bills. "This is the kind of sup
port they look for."
Stanford enjoys strong support in
financial aid, according to Huff. At

least 40 per cent of each incoming
class receives some sort of support,
including Stanford, National Merit,
state and federal scholarships, grants
in-aid, and loans.
In addition, student jobs help sup
plement funds, and many jobs on
campus are subsidized by federal
grants.
Salaries to students in the library,
guide service, and Tresidder an. fi
nanced nine-tenths by the federal gov
ernment.
Huff called attention to the May 1
deadline for scholarship applications.
Forms are in the Financial Aids of
fice, and several fact sheets are also
on hand. Most scholarship funds are
in use, Huff said, and there is pres
ently a need for "more unrestricted
funds."

national aid programs.
Huff explained that President John
son's budget report, released in Jan
uary, implies no further support is
available for the National Defense
loans, which are administered through
colleges. He noted that a second feder
ally-supported program—the Insured
or Guaranteed Loan program—was
established in 1965 "but is largely in
operative at this time."
Qualified I»aas
The Guaranteed Loans, Huff con-

tined, are not administered by col
leges but simply encourage private
commercial banks to make educa
tional loans. He said the Guaranteed
Loans "were the administration's al
ternative to a tax credit" for college
costs but were "not intended original
ly to replace Defense monies."
Huff said developments indicate ex
treme concern being expressed around
the country. a mighty big and
important source of aid to students,"
he said. "National Defense has been
a very popular program, and we'll
continue doing everything possible to
keep the program running until a suf
ficient replacement is available."
Under National Defense a student
could borrow up to $10,000. No inter
est was charged until nine months

after graduation, and up to 50 per
cent could be cancelled by subsequent
professional work in teaching.
Congressional Commitment
Because colleges themselves admin
istered the loans, financial aids offi
cials were able to counsel students
and assure financial help. Huff said
he felt Congress had "a certain com
mitment to those in college who are
expecting Defense loans now."
In addition, he was concerned that
Stanford and other schools may lack
direct funds in the future.
To get the Opportunity or Guaran
teed Loans will require certain state
legislation, Huff said. He is presently
representing private schools in the Co
ordinating Council for Higher Educa
tion to get proper legislation through.
"What we're trying to do," he said,

"is to get the Guaranteed Loan pro
gram implemented. But I think it is
going to take time."
'Cautious Optimism'
As for loans available next year,
Huff said he was "cautiously opti
mistic." He noted that considerable
pressure has been put on Congress
to keep funds available. "It is unreal
istic to expect the new system oper
ative in six months."
Huff recommended that students
who have received Defense Loans
write their Congressmen and express
their concern. He said these letters
would "have a pretty important im
pact" on those who structure various
finance bills. "This is the kind of sup
port they look for."
Stanford enjoys strong support in
financial aid, according to Huff. At

least 40 per cent of each incoming
class receives some sort of support,
including Stanford, National Merit,
state and federal scholarships, grants
in-aid, and loans.
In addition, student jobs help sup
plement funds, and many jobs on
campus are subsidized by federal
grants.
Salaries to students in the library,
guide service, and Tresidder an. fi
nanced nine-tenths by the federal gov
ernment.
Huff called attention to the May 1
deadline for scholarship applications.
Forms are in the Financial Aids of
fice, and several fact sheets are also
on hand. Most scholarship funds are
in use, Huff said, and there is pres
ently a need for "more unrestricted
funds."
Termination of National Defense
Student Loans could deprive Stanford
of up to a million dollars in funds.
This warning comes from Robert
Iluff, director of financial aids, who
has been closely following changes in
national aid programs.
