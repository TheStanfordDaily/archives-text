# KZSU Maintains Devoted Following
## 
### HENRY BRIGGS 
KZSU-A.M. and F.M., the sta
tion whose F.M. band requires
the same power as a 7 watt
light bulb, has always had a
loyal, if small following. Accord
ing to Ralf Peer, Director of
Station Relations, that following
is becoming larger and more
loyal, this in spite of a history
that includes being shut down
by the Federal Communications
Commission.
The station started operating
from the confines of Stanford
Village in 1948, under the aus
pices of the Speech and Drama
department. In the early fifties
it moved to Memorial Hall, and
in the late fifties was transfer
red to the tutelage of the Com
munications Department.
Until 1964, when it received
an F.M. license, the station oper
ated on an A.M. carrier current,
which alleviated the need for
federal licensing provided the
signal did not wander too far
from the carrier lines.
When the station and students
of Stanford took their custom
ary summer vacation in 1958,
however, some loyal fans in
Daly City called the F.C.C. to
ask why they no longer received
that wonderful station down the
peninsula somewhere. The
F.C.C. rapidly supplied answer,
stopping any kind of broadcast
from the little station.
It came back a few years later,
but with 1 i 11 le of its former
verve. In 1960, two freshmen,
Ken Byrom and Hal Williams,
decided to beef up the program
ming, which until then had con
sisted of little more than made
over, used recordings. Largely
because of the impetus they
supplied and the further efforts
of Ralf Peer and present Sta
tion Manager Penny Nilandy the
University decided to back a
push for an educational F.M.
license. In the fall of 1964, KZSU
added an F.M. broadcast on 90.1
megacycles to their normal 88
megacycle carrier current.
Smart White Rats
The addition of the F.M. band
gaye the station a greater finan
cial burden however. It got so
rough, that last summer, as part
of an overall modernizing of the
carrier current, they trained a
white rat to carry the lead sting
from a new wire that was to go
underneath a street. White rats
are smart, though, and appar
ently this one decided that a
trek of 600 feet underground
was too much for one lousy
piece of cheese, so he mutinied.

Eventually, the Corp Yard took
the job.
To help ease these problems, 1
the station has been supplying [
recording services to the com- 1
munity, as well as publishing a
bi-weekly Program Guide.

Daly City called the F.C.C. to
ask why they no longer received
that wonderful station down the
peninsula somewhere. The
F.C.C. rapidly supplied answer,
stopping any kind of broadcast
from the little station.
It came back a few years later,
but with 1 i 11 le of its former
verve. In 1960, two freshmen,
Ken Byrom and Hal Williams,
decided to beef up the program
ming, which until then had con
sisted of little more than made
over, used recordings. Largely
because of the impetus they
supplied and the further efforts
of Ralf Peer and present Sta
tion Manager Penny Nilandy the
University decided to back a
push for an educational F.M.
license. In the fall of 1964, KZSU
added an F.M. broadcast on 90.1
megacycles to their normal 88
megacycle carrier current.
Smart White Rats
The addition of the F.M. band
gaye the station a greater finan
cial burden however. It got so
rough, that last summer, as part
of an overall modernizing of the
carrier current, they trained a
white rat to carry the lead sting
from a new wire that was to go
underneath a street. White rats
are smart, though, and appar
ently this one decided that a
trek of 600 feet underground
was too much for one lousy
piece of cheese, so he mutinied.

Eventually, the Corp Yard took
the job.
To help ease these problems, 1
the station has been supplying [
recording services to the com- 1
munity, as well as publishing a
bi-weekly Program Guide.
KZSU-A.M. and F.M., the sta
tion whose F.M. band requires
the same power as a 7 watt
light bulb, has always had a
loyal, if small following. Accord
ing to Ralf Peer, Director of
Station Relations, that following
is becoming larger and more
loyal, this in spite of a history
that includes being shut down
by the Federal Communications
Commission.
The station started operating
from the confines of Stanford
Village in 1948, under the aus
pices of the Speech and Drama
department. In the early fifties
it moved to Memorial Hall, and
in the late fifties was transfer
red to the tutelage of the Com
munications Department.
Until 1964, when it received
an F.M. license, the station oper
ated on an A.M. carrier current,
which alleviated the need for
federal licensing provided the
signal did not wander too far
from the carrier lines.
When the station and students
of Stanford took their custom
ary summer vacation in 1958,
however, some loyal fans in
Daly City called the F.C.C. to
ask why they no longer received
that wonderful station down the
peninsula somewhere. The
F.C.C. rapidly supplied answer,
