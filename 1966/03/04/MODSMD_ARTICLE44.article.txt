# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## College, Courage And The Life Of The Green Beret 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.
CHERYL OSIfER
General Engineering:
. . . one might only reply that
being drafted today is all too
possibly equivalent to being sent
"to the end of the world." Fur
thermore, there is no chance
that Mr. Harrison has been
brainwashed by the military ex
perience. No Sir! He's been
bleached, starched and spun dry.

• Committee Of Fifteen
Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut
ed by The Daily staff itself.

• I\o Representation
Editor, The Daily:
In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela
tively representative.
His primitive statistical anal
ysis fails to consider that un
representative may mean more
than numerical inequality.
LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla
ture's claim that it should be
able to speak out on off-campus
issues.
Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con
cerned with their weekly bab
blings. Only when their discus
sions concern problems other
than the recall of committee
members and the activities of
the ski club will the Legislature
attain any stature in the Uni
versity.
Since I prefer the anonymity
of a non-Daily letter writer, and
since I fear the wrath of a hun
dred little lassus, I request that
my name be withheld.
NAME WITHHELD
• By The Artist
Editor, The Daily:
I regret that my paintings
have been misunderstood as
"vulgar" and that the Chronicle
and Palo Alto Times have mis
quoted me as well. I did not say
I was pleased whenever anyone
looks at my work. I said I was
pleased whenever people really
look at paintings. And if due to
the evidently disturbing (though
highly conventional) subject
matter of my work people have
actually looked at my pictures
and have experienced them
enough to react, then even an in
appropriate reaction shows that
something has occurred between
the viewer and the painting.
Kafka has said "the books we
need are the kind that act upon
us like a misfortune . . . should
serve as the axe for the frozen
sea within us." If my paintings
have been a misfortune for Mr.
Robert Houghton and others,
then I am pleased. I can only
hope that the resulting contro
versy has helped chip away a
little at their frozen attitudes
towards a subject of which ob
viously they know so little.

Editor, The Daily:
If Mr. Gale Cook, city editor
of Brand X, wants to know who
is covering Stanford (as well as
the southern part of the Penin
sula) for the Chronicle, he
might try the novel approach—
and that doesn't mean the usual
fiction—of sending a reporter
down here to find out. (Just fol
low the Chronicle circulation
trucks southward on the free
way. Don't forget to bring a pad
and pencil.)
Once here, Mr. Cook's repre
sentative will learn firsthand
why The Voice of the West
beats Brand X to practically
every major story in this area.
By about a week or so.
It's almost a maxim that the
only thing more scarce here
than a copy of the Examiner is
—an Examiner reporter. And,
wow, that's scarcity, brother.

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!

way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
Academic Coordinator SRT
JACK FISHER
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.
CHERYL OSIfER

. . . one might only reply that
being drafted today is all too
possibly equivalent to being sent

perience. No Sir! He's been

• Committee Of Fifteen
Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut
ed by The Daily staff itself.

In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela

His primitive statistical anal

LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla
ture's claim that it should be
able to speak out on off-campus
issues.
Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza

we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and

lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
Academic Coordinator SRT
JACK FISHER
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.
CHERYL OSIfER

. . . one might only reply that
being drafted today is all too
possibly equivalent to being sent
"to the end of the world." Fur
thermore, there is no chance
that Mr. Harrison has been

perience. No Sir! He's been
bleached, starched and spun dry.

Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut

In his column of March 1 Mr.

His primitive statistical anal

LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa

student body has an opportuni

the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla

Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con

• By The Artist
Editor, The Daily:
I regret that my paintings
have been misunderstood as
"vulgar" and that the Chronicle
and Palo Alto Times have mis
quoted me as well. I did not say
I was pleased whenever anyone
looks at my work. I said I was
pleased whenever people really
look at paintings. And if due to
the evidently disturbing (though
highly conventional) subject
matter of my work people have
actually looked at my pictures
and have experienced them
enough to react, then even an in
appropriate reaction shows that
something has occurred between
the viewer and the painting.
Kafka has said "the books we
need are the kind that act upon
us like a misfortune . . . should
serve as the axe for the frozen
sea within us." If my paintings
have been a misfortune for Mr.
Robert Houghton and others,
then I am pleased. I can only
hope that the resulting contro

little at their frozen attitudes
towards a subject of which ob

Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa

have been misunderstood as
"vulgar" and that the Chronicle

quoted me as well. I did not say
I was pleased whenever anyone
looks at my work. I said I was
pleased whenever people really
look at paintings. And if due to
the evidently disturbing (though
highly conventional) subject
matter of my work people have
actually looked at my pictures
and have experienced them
enough to react, then even an in
appropriate reaction shows that
something has occurred between
the viewer and the painting.
Kafka has said "the books we
need are the kind that act upon
us like a misfortune . . . should
serve as the axe for the frozen
sea within us." If my paintings
have been a misfortune for Mr.

then I am pleased. I can only
hope that the resulting contro

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
Academic Coordinator SRT
JACK FISHER
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.

being drafted today is all too

Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut
ed by The Daily staff itself.

• I\o Representation
Editor, The Daily:
In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela
tively representative.
His primitive statistical anal
ysis fails to consider that un
representative may mean more
than numerical inequality.
LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla
ture's claim that it should be
able to speak out on off-campus
issues.
Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con
cerned with their weekly bab
blings. Only when their discus
sions concern problems other
than the recall of committee
members and the activities of
the ski club will the Legislature
attain any stature in the Uni
versity.
Since I prefer the anonymity
of a non-Daily letter writer, and
since I fear the wrath of a hun
dred little lassus, I request that

Editor, The Daily:
In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela
tively representative.
His primitive statistical anal
ysis fails to consider that un

LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla

able to speak out on off-campus

Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con

I regret that my paintings
have been misunderstood as

quoted me as well. I did not say
I was pleased whenever anyone

pleased whenever people really
look at paintings. And if due to
the evidently disturbing (though
highly conventional) subject

actually looked at my pictures

something has occurred between

Kafka has said "the books we

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
Academic Coordinator SRT
JACK FISHER
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.

• Committee Of Fifteen
Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro

consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a

erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut
ed by The Daily staff itself.

• I\o Representation
Editor, The Daily:
In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela
tively representative.
His primitive statistical anal
ysis fails to consider that un
representative may mean more
than numerical inequality.
LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla
ture's claim that it should be
able to speak out on off-campus
issues.
Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con
cerned with their weekly bab

sions concern problems other
than the recall of committee
members and the activities of
the ski club will the Legislature
attain any stature in the Uni

I regret that my paintings

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
Academic Coordinator SRT
JACK FISHER
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.
CHERYL OSIfER
General Engineering:
. . . one might only reply that
being drafted today is all too
possibly equivalent to being sent
"to the end of the world." Fur
thermore, there is no chance
that Mr. Harrison has been
brainwashed by the military ex
perience. No Sir! He's been
bleached, starched and spun dry.

JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the

for its own sake would not be

success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten

For these reasons then, I urge

• Committee Of Fifteen
Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut
ed by The Daily staff itself.

• I\o Representation
Editor, The Daily:
In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela
tively representative.
His primitive statistical anal
ysis fails to consider that un
representative may mean more
than numerical inequality.
LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla
ture's claim that it should be
able to speak out on off-campus
issues.
Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con
cerned with their weekly bab
blings. Only when their discus
sions concern problems other
than the recall of committee
members and the activities of
the ski club will the Legislature
attain any stature in the Uni

Since I prefer the anonymity

I regret that my paintings
have been misunderstood as
"vulgar" and that the Chronicle

I was pleased whenever anyone

actually looked at my pictures

Kafka has said "the books we

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
Academic Coordinator SRT
JACK FISHER
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined

Editor, The Daily:
In regard to Mr. Carter Harri
son's letter (The Daily, March 3)
may I point out three things:
• I believe that Mr. Harrison
served in Germany during the
1950'5. From my personal ex
perience as an Army service
man's daughter living in Ger
many for 5 years, I would hard
ly call Germany a hardship post,
as is Vietnam. In fact, life for
a serviceman in Germany can be
rather plush.
• At the time Mr. Harrison
served, the war in Vietnam was
not being accelerated as it is
now. Therefore, Mr. Harrison's
chances of being sent to Viet
nam and his subsequent chances
of being killed were much less
than are the chances of any
man serving in the army now.
• There is nothing cowardly
about either of the following:
morally objecting to the war in
Vietnam, simply wishing to live,
or feeling that one could better
serve his country in another oc
cupation.
I therefore strenuously object
to Mr. Harrison's slanderous, un
founded, and illogical remarks.
Mr. Harrison, why don't you vol
unteer for Vietnam and see what
combat life is like?
MRS. LYNN B. DAVIDSON
. . . Mr. Carter Harrison un
fortunately bears out the mili
taristic stereotype many people
have of engineers (after all, the
historic origins of civil engineer
ing emanate from warfare im
provement needs centuries ago).
In his proud display of his mili
tary bias, he sees himself as the
"real student" in contrast to the
current cowardly generation.
The present college genera
tion has never experienced real
war. Yes. we have read how war
has been necessary to accom
plish certain goals, but we have
never experienced it and there
fore it is not an assumed, in
trinsic part of our ("under-thir
ty" or "youth") culture. Given
another 15 warless years, we
may bo able to maintain our cul
tural anti-war bias. Thus, when
we eventually become tired lib
erals in the station-wagon-and
swimming-pool set we may be
able to think in terms of non
war solutions. But the present
escalation and college draft is
killing that possibility.
If you are a "real student" as
you claim, I challenge you to
reevaluate the accepted norms
of the "over thirty" culture. If
you are going to justify war,
don't rationalize that it was
necessary for our parents' gen
eration, therefore we must ac
cept the concept.
I think hope lies with the
"cowards" who dare to chal
lenge and reject the unexamined
assumptions and rationalizations
of our parents.
CHERYL OSIfER
General Engineering:
. . . one might only reply that
being drafted today is all too
possibly equivalent to being sent
"to the end of the world." Fur
thermore, there is no chance
that Mr. Harrison has been
brainwashed by the military ex
perience. No Sir! He's been
bleached, starched and spun dry.

• Committee Of Fifteen
Editor, The Daily:
We urge passage of the second
option on today's initiative. It is
in the best interests of the Com
mittee of Fifteen and of the
community.
JENNIFER WATKINS
MIKE COUZENS
Editor, The Daily:
Today, a referendum on the
Committee of 15 is being held.
I urge all students to take the
necessary minute or two and
vote.
To my constituents, I recom
mend voting against the referen
dum and in favor of the LASSU
proposal. I support the LASSU
bill because it is in harmony
with the spirit of the Committee
of 15, because it has the support

of the injured parties, and be
cause it corrects the weaknesses
in the original LASSU position.
The Committee of 15 was set
up by students, faculty, and ad
ministration to represent, in one
body, representatives of the
President, the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and the Legislature, to discuss
and hopefully settle differences
between these three interest
groups. For this reason, it is
essential that the Legislature,
through its Speaker, retain the
power to appoint the student
representatives and exert some
control over their actions
through reports and recall.
Michael Couzens, speaking for
himself and Miss Watkins on
the floor of Legislature and over
the radio last Thursday night,
asked that the Committee now
serving — from which he and
Miss Watkins were excluded—
be retained since over-frequent
replacement of members would
hamper student interests. Since
the parties - at • interest have
agreed that the new Committee
is a good one and that the bill
is a just one, approving the ref
erendum to avenge injured par
ties is irrational.
Finally, the fundamental
weaknesses of the original
LASSU proposal have been elim
inated. Recall may not be used
capriciously since one week's
notice and a two-thirds vote are

necessary to recall. In the ab
sence of a recall, the term of of
fice for student members of the
Committee has now been set at
one year. Student members have
also been put on notice and
have agreed that a "hard line"
for its own sake would not be
their policy. Their preliminary
success in helping to bring
about a compromise on such a
thorny issue as Wilbur's sponsor
selection argues for their reten
tion on the Commtitee.
For these reasons then, I urge
you all to vote today, and to dis
approve the referendum and ac
cept the LASSU resolution.

• Bad Coverage?
Editor, The Daily:
It is our fear that the infor
mation connoted by The Daily
over the past two weeks shall
or might result in lack of confi
dence in the LASSU. The
Daily's diction in particular is
inaccurate and misleading. The
"small cabal," in the editor's
terms "a self-appointed hand,"
(Feb. 17) was neither "small"
nor "secret," nor was it an "in
trigue" nor a "junta" (c. 112. Web
ster). In open gatherings the
group gave form to the general
dissatisfaction with the Com
mittee of Five as expressed in

the February 10 session. One
can only conclude that the edi
tor is unacquainted with the
process and right of legislation.
That "student delegates" to
the Committee of Fifteen shall
consider their first responsibili
ty as being to the student body"
(Referendum section 2) was
precisely the concern of the
Feb. 17 session. That the legis
lature's major concern lies with
educative processes was demon
strated by its expressed wish to
conform in good faith to the
Joint Judicial Resolution of Sep
tember 29, 1965. Part Five, set
ting up the Committee of Fif
teen, provides (note, Mr. Rosen
bloom) that the LASSU should
receive, as do the other two "re
spective appointing powers,"
full report of (1) the matters
discussed, (2) the views of the
various groups of representa
tives thereon, and (3) the rec
ommendations of the reporting
representatives. . . ." The Daily
receives the Committee's min
utes. (Sic.) If Daily coverage of
the legislature for the past two
weeks is any indication of how
it reports for the Committee,
the concern of LASSU for ac
curate reports to the studtfnt
body is justified and even out
rageously minimal. The Joint
Judicial Resolution expects the
student constituency to "under
stand such matters," Mr. Rosen
bloom (Feb. 23). We doubt that

The Daily does. The Feb. 17 pro
ceedings took the form of order
ly, concentrated presentation
and debate. The three hours'
consideration of the resolution
was neither "heated" nor a
"hassle" (front page, Feb. 18).
The exception to the lack of per
sonal animosity was contribut
ed by The Daily staff itself.

• I\o Representation
Editor, The Daily:
In his column of March 1 Mr.
Haight claims that contrary to
popular opinion LASSU is rela
tively representative.
His primitive statistical anal
ysis fails to consider that un
representative may mean more
than numerical inequality.
LASSU is unrepresentative be
cause the views of the members
of that body are not representa
tive of the views of the student
body they represent. When the
student body has an opportuni
ty to evaluate the Legislature
the views of the two groups are
found to be contradictory. Evi
dence of this can be seen in last
year's rejection of the Legisla
ture's claim that it should be
able to speak out on off-campus
issues.
Members of the Legislature
must be made aware of the fact
that few on this campus are con
cerned with their weekly bab
blings. Only when their discus
sions concern problems other
than the recall of committee
members and the activities of
the ski club will the Legislature
attain any stature in the Uni
versity.
Since I prefer the anonymity
of a non-Daily letter writer, and
since I fear the wrath of a hun
dred little lassus, I request that
my name be withheld.
NAME WITHHELD
• By The Artist
Editor, The Daily:
I regret that my paintings
have been misunderstood as
"vulgar" and that the Chronicle
and Palo Alto Times have mis
quoted me as well. I did not say
I was pleased whenever anyone
looks at my work. I said I was
pleased whenever people really
look at paintings. And if due to
the evidently disturbing (though
highly conventional) subject
matter of my work people have
actually looked at my pictures
and have experienced them
enough to react, then even an in
appropriate reaction shows that
something has occurred between
the viewer and the painting.
Kafka has said "the books we
need are the kind that act upon
us like a misfortune . . . should
serve as the axe for the frozen
sea within us." If my paintings
have been a misfortune for Mr.
Robert Houghton and others,
then I am pleased. I can only
hope that the resulting contro

little at their frozen attitudes

• Lazarus
Editor, The Dally:
The editorial, "Lazarus and
Student Drama" is not as wrong
as Joe Jacob's prediction in par
ticulars — undergraduate drama
at Stanford seems to be sur
viving very well—but "Lazarus"
Is wrong in spirit. The spirit of
the piece states that the Stan
ford Repertory Theater isn't
aware of, or attempting to do
anything, about enthusiasm
among Stanford students.
My job with the SRT is di
rectly concerned with this prob
lem, and I feel some informa
tion should be available to cor
rect the impression of "Laza
rus."
The fact of my being hired to
stimulate student interest, mend
fences, and work for closer and
more productive relations be
tween SRT and the academic
community as a whole, which
especially includes Stanford stu
dents, and very especially Ram's
Head, is, I think, an important
indication of our concern.
"Lazarus" (alas!) does not
even hint at rny existence, in
spite of my having spent some
time explaining my job, and
earnestly asking for "Lazarus"
help with that job. Even allow
ing such an ommission as irrele
vant, there remain in the edito
rial a number of facts which
need answers: 1. The success of
Twelfth Night, about which we
are all delighted. Part of the suc
cess, however, must accrue to
Gerald Hiken as director. While
Mr. Hiken is a teacher at Stan
ford, he is also a member of
SRT and the existence of the
company in part explains his tal
ented presence at Stanford. 2.
The success of Ram's Head's
Lyslstrata is "a challenge" to
SRT. Quite the contrary, we are
delighted again with the show's
success, as people responsible
for Lysistrata's production will
testify.
I personally, as a representa
tive of SRT, am doing every
thing I can to arrange a meet
ing with Ram's Head to discuss
mutual problems (SRT isn't the
only organization that the stu
dents are avoiding) and con
sider means of cooperation and
mutual assistance. I have talked
with Bill Williams, the president
of Ram's Head, and we hope to
have a meeting with several in
terested parties early next quar
ter. 3. The failure of SRT to gen
erate student interest in its
shows. Granting, interest is slow
in coming, nevertheless it will
come. Stanford student attend
ance has risen from 400 at Sca
pin to 600 at Prometheus.
As both "Lazarus" and I know,
part of the resistance is to
prices. SRT has done something

about prices, including special
student performances. As far as
general price revisions on regu
larly scheduled performances,
this cannot be done this year
because of students who bought
season subscriptions and should
not be penalized for this.
Price adjustment is a two
way street. At the special pre
view performance of Promethe
us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!

us Bound — Stanford student
cost $1.25 —which we arranged
for at considerable difficulty, the
student response was perhaps
100. 4. Scheduling shows during
midterms and finals. This is a
problem, but I'm afraid that I
am not quite convinced that the
pressure of mid terms has the
same effects on the Flicks, the
"O", and the woods that it does
on SRT. 5. Student discounts.
The policy has been, and contin
ues to be, very substantial dis
counts on student groups of 25
plus (current cost $1.25). If the
student can't muster a group,
there is the preview perform
ance, and the $1.00 regular dis
count in Mem Aud, and 50c in
Little Theater.
Next year there will be a
more flexible discount policy
including weekends. But consi
dering the current discounts,
students can still get tickets
cheaper than for Gaities. 6. No
discount performance to All's
Well. Not true. Even allowing
the difficulties we are having
with a split season -Mem Aud
and Little Theater—we have ar
ranged for two student discount
performances — at. $1.50 — for
Stanford students only, on
March 29 and 30.
The problems of the Little
Theater for us are great. With
a substantial subscription list to
seat, and with limits on the num
ber of productions we can do
because of students in them; our
difficulty is not just discount
seats, but seats period. (We
turned away very substantial
numbers for Skin of our Teeth.)
This problem, too, however,
will be corrected next year.
7. The "well" endowment of
SRT. The Rockefeller grant can
only be used for very restricted
purposes. The rest has to come
from the box-office. "Lazarus"
(and others) would blanch at
our current seasonal deficit.
All of which is not to say there
are "not problems — lots of prob
lems —remaining. What "Laza
rus" suggests, however, is that
we aren't trying to correct prob
lems. This is simply untrue, and
in spite of any little remarks
from the past: "We do, we do
love SRT," my impression is
that one of the problems to be
corrected involves The Dally.
C'est dommage!
