"It's the best of all possible worlds," said
Pangloss. But we know better. And so it is that
a choice often must be made for the lesser of
two evils.
Today's ballot on the Committee of Fifteen
is ambiguous and confusing; even a student
government addict would have to be well-versed
in the ASSU Constitution and Robert's Rules to
understand its intricacies. But through all the
parliamentary garble surrounding the events of
the past three weeks, one vague nuance appears
hazily before our eyes: there is still a need at
Stanford for a force which can continue to press
for needed reform in both the educational and
non-academic areas of the University. Granted,
that such forces already exist, in piecemeal fash
ion, in both the administration and the faculty.
But reform often does not come easily to these
segments of the community; it often comes not
at all if some form of pressure—even unrepre
sentative pressure—does not arise from Stan
ford's 11,500-member Third Estate. And no
matter how ineffective or inefficient or obnox
ious one may think it, Stanford's student legis
lature remains the only organized and active
force for reform within the student body.
Although we believe LASSU deserves a vote of
"no confidence" for tampering with the Com
mittee of 15, we also believe, on less vindictive
and more pragmatic grounds, that the work of
the Legislature must continue. For this reason,
we reluctantly urge a "Yes" vote on Resolution
65-6-55 in today's election. It is the only alterna
tive which will allow the Legislature that small
amount of student support it needs to continue

its role in the reform process for the remainder
of the academic year.
The Resolution can hardly be called an im
provement over the one originally passed by
LASSU three weeks ago. It retains the new
student representatives to the Committee of
Fifteen—a matter of little importance now, since
Jennifer Watkins and Michael Couzens (see
letter this page) have, for partially political
reasons, given up their fight for reinstatement.
The only substantive difference in the new
measure is a change in the vote margin needed
in LASSU to recall the representatives—a meas
ure which ossifies the new, not-wholly-desirable
membership. Hut the Resolution, if passed,
would give the Legislature the expression of
support it now so desperately needs, a consid
eration that is perhaps more important for the
present than is a better Committee of 15. And
an ASSU Constitutional Amendment dealing
with die Committee of 15, which we understand
will be introduced in the spring, should guaran
tee the necessary independence of the Commit
tee's student representatives in the years to
come.
A student could, of course, vote "no" on both
propositions (double "yes" votes don't count,
since the two measures partially conflict), but
the result of a double defeat would be that only
LASSU's original—and unacceptable—resolu
tion of February 17 would remain standing.
Should the Resolution pass, it would then be
incumbent upon the Legislature to live up to
the students' expression of faith. Should it fail,
the usually farsical but sometimes useful body
will have lost cause for existence.

Pangloss. But we know better. And so it is that
a choice often must be made for the lesser of
two evils.
Today's ballot on the Committee of Fifteen
is ambiguous and confusing; even a student
government addict would have to be well-versed
in the ASSU Constitution and Robert's Rules to
understand its intricacies. But through all the
parliamentary garble surrounding the events of
the past three weeks, one vague nuance appears
hazily before our eyes: there is still a need at
Stanford for a force which can continue to press
for needed reform in both the educational and
non-academic areas of the University. Granted,
that such forces already exist, in piecemeal fash
ion, in both the administration and the faculty.
But reform often does not come easily to these
segments of the community; it often comes not
at all if some form of pressure—even unrepre
sentative pressure—does not arise from Stan
ford's 11,500-member Third Estate. And no
matter how ineffective or inefficient or obnox
ious one may think it, Stanford's student legis
lature remains the only organized and active
force for reform within the student body.
Although we believe LASSU deserves a vote of
"no confidence" for tampering with the Com
mittee of 15, we also believe, on less vindictive
and more pragmatic grounds, that the work of
the Legislature must continue. For this reason,
we reluctantly urge a "Yes" vote on Resolution
65-6-55 in today's election. It is the only alterna
tive which will allow the Legislature that small
amount of student support it needs to continue

its role in the reform process for the remainder
of the academic year.
The Resolution can hardly be called an im
provement over the one originally passed by
LASSU three weeks ago. It retains the new
student representatives to the Committee of
Fifteen—a matter of little importance now, since
Jennifer Watkins and Michael Couzens (see
letter this page) have, for partially political
reasons, given up their fight for reinstatement.
The only substantive difference in the new
measure is a change in the vote margin needed
in LASSU to recall the representatives—a meas
ure which ossifies the new, not-wholly-desirable
membership. Hut the Resolution, if passed,
would give the Legislature the expression of
support it now so desperately needs, a consid
eration that is perhaps more important for the
present than is a better Committee of 15. And
an ASSU Constitutional Amendment dealing
with die Committee of 15, which we understand
will be introduced in the spring, should guaran
tee the necessary independence of the Commit
tee's student representatives in the years to
come.
A student could, of course, vote "no" on both
propositions (double "yes" votes don't count,
since the two measures partially conflict), but
the result of a double defeat would be that only
LASSU's original—and unacceptable—resolu
tion of February 17 would remain standing.
Should the Resolution pass, it would then be
incumbent upon the Legislature to live up to
the students' expression of faith. Should it fail,
the usually farsical but sometimes useful body
will have lost cause for existence.
