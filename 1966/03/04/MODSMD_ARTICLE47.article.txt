# An Open Letter To Faculty
## 
### 
Through the year both students and faculty have expressed
concern in regard to the lack of communication existing be
tween them. In an effort to remedy this, several student
groups have taken the initiative and Invited members of the
faculty and their wives to their respective houses. These
were sincere and honest efforts by students to get to know
their faculty on a basis other than the academic one.
We greatly enjoyed and appreciated those faculty members
who responded, and we wish to thank them. However, on the
whole, the results were disappointing. In several Instances
only a very small percentage of faculty members came. Of
those who did not attend, very few gave any Indication be
forehand that they would not be able to. For example, at
Storey's tea last Sunday, there was absolutely no reply from
half of the faculty invited.
We do not wish to complain about the time and money
wasted on these efforts, for these are trivial, but the lack
of attendance and response leads us to consider the more im
portant problem of whether or not the faculty is at all in
terested in this type of interaction with the students. The
indications are that, they are not.
We want to bring this problem to the attention of the
faculty, in hopes that if they ARE interested in better student
faculty relations, they will give some thought to working
with us in reaching a satisfactory solution.
The college years can be the best time for students to
learn about people, as well as to absorb academic knowledge.
We want to get to know our faculty as people, and we hope
that they, too, want to get to know us. Perhaps we have not
approached the problem in the best way, but we have ap
proached it. It Is now up to the faculty, we feel, to make
some kind of response.
