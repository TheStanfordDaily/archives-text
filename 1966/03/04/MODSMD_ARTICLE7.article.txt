# Student Body To Vote On Question Of Power To Recall Committee Of 5.
## 
### RISSA WHITE 
The referendum on LASSU's power
to recall student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen is up for a student
body vote today. Polls will be open
from 9 a. m. to 3:30 p. m. at the Post
Office and Engineering Corner.
Both the student referendum and
LASSU resolution 65-6-55 (as amend
ed) appear on the ballot, though the
second proposition is merely a voter
opinion poll. The referendum requires
a majority of "yes" votes in order to
be enacted into law.
LASSU decided to have its resolu
tion appear on the ballot so it could
gauge student support. It will enact
its resolution if it receives a majority
of "yes" votes. 1
LASSU has also stated its intention
to enact the referendum into law if

it receives more "yes" votes than the
resolution but less than a majority.
Tom Galbraith, Stern freshman co
ordinator and initiator of the referen
dum, advised students to vote "no"
on his referendum and "yes" on
LASSU's resolution.
"I feel the legislature acted respon
sibly in amending its original resolu
tion (65-6-54) to which we were op
posed," he stated. "We are now satis
fied that the legislature and the stu
dents understand what the Commit
tee of Fifteen is, and this is the essen
tial question."
While Galbraith no longer supports
the referendum which he initiated, it
was constitutionally impossible for
him to withdraw his petition after it
had been submitted to ASSU. Dead
line for filing petitions was February

21; LASSU didn't amend its resolu
tion until February 24.
Therefore, students will vote today
in what Election Chairman Roger
Bounds calls "a unique election."
Three alternatives face the voter: 1)
he may vote "yes" to pass the refer
endum, 2) he may vote "yes" on the
second proposition to recommend to
the Legislature to pass Resolution 65-
6-55, 3) or he may vote "no" on both
propositions.
"You cannot vote yes on both prop
ositions," warned Bounds, "as they
are opposing stands."
The first proposition on the ballot
is the referendum, which expresses
"no confidence" in LASSU's original
Resolution 65-6-54.
That resolution called for appoint
ment of three new student members
to the committee — Tom Forstenzer,
Martin Gerry, and John Butler—to re
place Mike Couzens, Jennifer Watkins
and Gary Feldman. Old members Jay
Kadane and Sandy MacKenzie re
tained their positions.
Report to LASSU
The resolution also required mem
bers of the Committee of Five to re
port their actions to the Legislature.
It further made the members subject
to immediate recall by LASSU.
The student referendum was a re
sponse to this action. Galbraith cir
culated petitions which in addition to
expressing "no confidence" in the
LASSU resolution, call for its repeal
and add to the by-laws: "Student dele
gates to the Committee of Fifteen
shall consider their first responsibil
ity as being to the student body. They
shall be appointed by the Student
Body president with the consultation
and approval of the LASSU for a
term of one year. They shall not be
subject to recall."
Galbraith's intention was to have
LASSU reconsider its action. He
thought that a general election would
be unnecessary if LASSU could reach
a suitable compromise with his ad
hoc committee.
No Withdrawal
However, as LASSU Speaker Jay
Kadane pointed out, once a student
referendum is filed with the ASSU
office, it cannot be withdrawn. Only
LASSU's passage of a bill which
agreed word for word with the peti
tion could have stopped the referen
dum.
As it was, LASSU, at its next meet
ing, February 24, amended its resolu
tion to retain its new members to the
Committee but change recall proce
dure to require a two-thirds, rather

than majority, vote of the Legislature
for removal.
Its amended resolution, 65-6-56, will
appear on today's ballot. It rescinds
65-6-54 except for the "resolveds"
dealing with appointment of the three
new members, and repeats its demand
that members of the Committee of
Five report their activities regularly
to LASSU. It further states that stu
dent members of the Committee shall
be members of the Association and
that they shall be appointed by the
Legislature for one year. Its stand on
recall is that a two-thirds vote of the
members of the Legislature present
is needed, and that notice shall be
given at least a week in advance.
Couzens Supports LASSU
Mike Couzens, one of the deposed
members, asks voters to support the
LASSU proposal, as he feels the Com
mittee cannot survive another shake
up of membership.
The Committee of Fifteen was es
tablished last September by a joint
resolution of the Legislature, the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Academic
Council, and the President of the Uni
versity as an advisory body to make
recommendations, but not legislate. It
is comprised of five faculty members,
five members of the administration,
and five students. The students were
appointed by the Speaker of the Leg
islature.
The Committee is intended to be a
sounding-board for student, faculty
and administrative opinion. While
powerless, it is supposed to be influ
ential. Opposition to it began when
LASSU felt that the student members
were compromising too much and
were failing to represent the interests
of the student body.
LASSU Misinterpretation
LASSU voted to replace the mem
bers whom it considered to be not
forceful enough. This action prompted
Galbraith to establish the ad hoc com
mittee to oppose LASSU. Opponents
of the resolution claimed that LASSU
misinterpreted the aim of the Com
mittee.
They stated that students cannot
accomplish anything by being firm
and taking an extreme line on the
committee. Older members of the
committee would resent pressure tac
tics, and the spirit of the committee
would be defeated, they said.
