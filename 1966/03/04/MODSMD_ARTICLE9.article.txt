# Vatican Council: Jedin Hails Efforts For Unity
## 
### KIRK HANEN 
Will the Second Vatican Council
change the relationship between the
Catholic Church and the world's other
Christian denominations?
According to Professor Hubert Je
din, in an address to a near-capacity
crowd in Cubberley last night:
"It's impossible to say until its
policies are enacted."
But, he added in his lecture "The
Council of Trent and the Second Vati
can Council," its great significance
lies in the fact that "it makes us con
scious of the need for re-unification
of all Christian churches."
The Council of Trent, he stressed,
"accentuatcd the basic doctrinal dif
ferences between the Catholic Church
and the Protestant world."
'Most Important Council'
In doing so, the Council of Trent did
much to insure the separation and
division of the two religious poles.
This schism grew out of one of the
Council's basic aims: to state Catholic
stands.
Because of its divisive nature, the
Council of Trent, called in 1545, re
mains, according to Jedin, "one of the
most important councils in Church
history."
Convened in October, 1962, by Pope
John XXIII, the Second Vatican (Ecu
menical) Council "didn't deny the dif
ferences in doctrine," said Jedin, "but
put together what the Catholic

Church has in common with other
churches."
Considered one of the two leading
contemporary Catholic scholars, Jedin
is professor of medieval and modern
church history at the University of
Bonn.
Continental Education
Jedin is a member of the Mainz
Academy of Sciences and Literature;
a corresponding member of the So
cieta di Storia Patria, Rome; and Dr.
h.c., University of Louvain.
Educated at Breslau, Munich, and
Freiberg Universities, he later did his
torical research in Rome, 1939-49. He
is currently visiting professor at the
Institute for Research in the Humani
ties at the University of Wisconsin.
Among Professor Jedin's works are
Girolamo Seripando, two volumes,
translated into English; Concillium
Tridentinum; Kris Is und Wendepunkt
des Konzils von Tri©nt; and A His
tory of the Council of Trent, critical
ly acclaimed as the most authorita
tive study of this critical period.

Will the Second Vatican Council
change the relationship between the
Catholic Church and the world's other
Christian denominations?
According to Professor Hubert Je
din, in an address to a near-capacity
crowd in Cubberley last night:
"It's impossible to say until its
policies are enacted."
But, he added in his lecture "The
Council of Trent and the Second Vati
can Council," its great significance
lies in the fact that "it makes us con
scious of the need for re-unification
of all Christian churches."
The Council of Trent, he stressed,
"accentuatcd the basic doctrinal dif
ferences between the Catholic Church
and the Protestant world."
'Most Important Council'
In doing so, the Council of Trent did
much to insure the separation and
division of the two religious poles.
This schism grew out of one of the
Council's basic aims: to state Catholic
stands.
Because of its divisive nature, the
Council of Trent, called in 1545, re
mains, according to Jedin, "one of the
most important councils in Church
history."
Convened in October, 1962, by Pope
John XXIII, the Second Vatican (Ecu
menical) Council "didn't deny the dif
ferences in doctrine," said Jedin, "but
put together what the Catholic

Church has in common with other
churches."
Considered one of the two leading
contemporary Catholic scholars, Jedin
is professor of medieval and modern
church history at the University of
Bonn.
