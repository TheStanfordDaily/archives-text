If you've never used an electric shaver before, the Norelco 'Flip-
Top' Speedshaver® is a great way to find out the easier side of
shaving. Its rotary blades stroke whiskers off. Never cut or nick.
They won't hurt you. Neither will the price, which is about the JHK...
same as a year's supply of razor blades and shave cream. J|||
P.S. If you want to spend a littlemore, get the Norelco Speedshaver JB& jfr
30 (at right). 35% closer shaves. 'Floating heads,' too. And a
pop-up trimmer for sideburns. All the trimmings. From shave to N ' :: i liir .^<--^ y - y '^
price, it's clear about any Norelco—you can't get stung! ■
