# Updated 'All's Well' To Open

Stanford Repertory Theater's
fourth production of the season,
"All's Well That Ends Well" by
William Shakespeare, will con
tinue the precedent of present
ing unusual and novel interpre
tations for its Stanford area au
diences.
Director William Sharp has
set this comedy of a reluctant
husband and his resourceful
wife in the pre-world War I Ed
wardian period rather than in
the usual Elizabethan setting. "I
wanted the costumes and sets
done in a period where there
were exciting romantic wars,
where people died like heroes,
but the actual horrors are not
shown," he said.
The twin concept of women
and war Sharp added, makes the
early 1900's readily adaptable to
the story of Shakespeare's play.
The production is Sharp's first
attempt to stage "All's Well
That Ends Well."
Carrying the lead roles in
"All's Well" will be Paul E.
Richards as Parolls; Jane Hoff
man as Countess of Rousillon;
Gerald Hiken as Lafew; Ruth
Silveira as Helena; and John
Hellweg as Bertram. Eight stu
dents are included in the play's
cast of sixteen. Five are candi
dates for Master of Fine Arts
degrees, one a Ph.D. candidate
in French, and two undergradu
ate students, one in the French

Department and one in the Dra
ma Department.
The production staff includes
Robert B. Loper, producing di
rector; Derek Hunt, technical di
rector; Robert McFarland, set
designer; Jean Shultz, costume
designer; and Paul Landry,
lighting designer.
