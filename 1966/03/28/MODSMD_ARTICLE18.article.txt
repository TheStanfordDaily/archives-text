# New Cowell Health Center Opens For Business Today
## 
### 
Stanford's freshly-built $900,-
000 Cowell Student Health Cen
tr officially opens for business
today.
In addition, today marks the
abandonment of the present Stu
dent Health Service in the Wom
an's Gym originally built in
1931 to accommodate 500 women
students and now serving a stu
dent population of 11,000, and
the closing of Alpine House near
Ladera, used for patients with
communicable diseases.
Formal dedication of the new
building is set for May 13. The
29,000-square-foot structure, a
contemporary rendering of tra
ditional Stanford architectural
motifs, was designed by Ernest
J. Klump and Associates of Palo
Alto and built by Corelyou and
Cole of Mountain View.
Nearly all the total cost of the
structure was supplied by gifts
from the S. H. Cowell Founda
tion of San Francisco.
Features of the new Health
Center include round-the-clock
medical service, a 40-bed infirm
ary, doctors' offices, treatment
and examination rooms, labor
atories, emergency, physical
therapy and X-ray rooms.

It will also house a library for
both professional and student
use, staff conference rooms and
lounges.
Staff time has been organized
to provide the equivalent of 14
full-time physicians.
The building, with two floors
and a full basement, will offer
specialty rooms in the latter,
doctor's offices, lounge and li
brary on the main floor, and the
infirmary on the second floor.
It is fitted with a dumbwaiter,
an elevator, a drug storage area
which can convert to a pharma
cy, a whirlpool bath and an oper
ating room for minor surgery.
It is located on Campus Drive
near four large undergraduate
living units (Branner, Wilbur,
Toyon and Stern Halls) and the
three units of Escondido Village,
which is used mainly by mar
ried students and their children.
