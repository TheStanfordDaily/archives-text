# Stanford Poll Explores Vietnam Sentiment
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
The national debate on the Vietnam War
focused last week on a survey conducted by
seven Stanford social scientists into "the na
ture of approval and dissent" over American
policy.
The opinion poll released during Finals Week
found "a willingness for a variety of kinds of
negotiations" among the American people, in
cluding strong support for direct negotiations
with the Viet Cong. Results of the survey were
widely publicized throughout the country and
received editorial comment in New York and
Washington papers.
Citing the Johnson Administration's sensitivity
to public opinion, the survey noted "public opin
ion has not been explored in sufficient detail to
give policy-makers a fully rounded picture of
American thinking on choices in Vietnam and
their possible costs."
Deeper Exploration
Dr. Sidney Verba, head of the seven-man
team which developd and pre-tested the ques

tionnaire, told The Daily he was pleased with
national reaction to the poll. Although none of
the social scientists are experts in Southeast
Asian affairs, Verba said a deeper exploration
of American opinion "was a field in which our
social science skills were relevant."
The actual pollinig of the 1474 respondees was
conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center at the University of Chicago. Many of
the findings concurred with surveys by the Gal
lup and Harris organizations, but the more
detailed questionnaire of thirty questions used
in the Stanford Poll gaged reaction more com
pletely. Among the findings were the follow
ing:
• 88 per cent of those polled would favor ne
gotiations with the Viet Cong. Sentiment to ne
gotiate was about the same among those who
favor and also among those who oppose the
Johnson Administration's handling of the situ
ation.
• 70 per cent would favor a truce negotiated
by the United Nations or some neutral coun
try.

• 52 per cent would favor the formation of a
new government in South Vietnam with the
Viet Cong taking part, and 54 per cent of the
respondees would favor free elections even if
the Viet Cong might win.
No Acceptable Solution
Suggesting "some of the limits beyond which
public opinion would not like to push," the
Stanford Poll found Americans evenly divided
on the issue of a half-million man commitment
in Vietnam, while they were opposed to fight
ing China by a 2-1 margin. Given several op
tions on how to pay for the war, Americans
found no acceptable solution and opposed in
creased taxes (2-1), government price and wage
controls, cuts in education expenses and reduc
tion in the Medicare program.
Yet the poll also underlines American reluc
tance to abandon Vietnam. Only 15 per cent
would favor complete withdrawal which would
allow the Communists to take over the nation.
When faced with the three polar alternatives
—withdrawal, a major war with thousands of

casualties, and continuing the present policy—
49 per cent favor a continuance of the current
policy, 23 per cent would favor all-out war, and
only 19 per cent would abandon Vietnam.
The poll then asked the respondees which
choice they would make if it were no longer
possible to continue the present policy. Sixty
per cent would undertake a major war, while
only 31 per cent would withdraw.
Wrong: on Two Count s
The stereotype of the Vietnam policy dis
senter as a left-leaning beatnik proved to be
wrong on both counts, according to the poll.
"There is a large number of people who favor
negotiations, but it would be hard to character
ize them as shoeless, bearded draftcard burn
ers," Verba said.
In a series of questions designed to measure
the respondees anti-Communist sentiment to
other Red threats, the survey found dissenters
from Administration policy just as tough on
Communism as those who favored present US
policy.
Seventy-eight per cent of those
opposed to present policy be
lieved the handling of Castro
Cuba had been too soft, while
only 64 per cent of those now
backing the Administration
thought it was too lenient. The
policy showed a similar reaction
in relation to American policy
toward Red China and the So
view Union.
According to the survey, the
majority of Americans hold nei
ther a consistent "hawk" posi
tion, nor a consistent "dove"
position, since they favor some
moves toward de-escalation
while refusing to abandon Viet

nam entirely. Only six per cent
had a consistent "hawk" posi
tion, opposed to moves toward
de-escalation and in favor of
escalating the war. The number
of pure "doves" was 14 per cent.
Verba said the survey had
been privately financed with
half of the $10,000 costs coming
from members of the Bay Area
academic community. Verba not
ed the solicitation of funds was
presented to faculty members
as a "contribution to the Viet
nam debate."
The appeal for funds was
made without respect to any
stand on Vietnam policy and had
no connection with any of the
campus protest organizations.
Verba said both opponents and
proponents of Administration
had contributed.
Tested on Stanford
The poll itself was developed
in six days, then pre tested with
Stanford graduates and under
graduates, and later tested over
a 100 mile swath in the Bay
Area.
The members of the Stanford
team were Verba; Gordon Black,
graduate student; Richard A.
Brody, Professor of Political Sci
ence; Paul Ekman, Research As
sociate at the Institute of Politi
cal Studies; Norman Nie, grad
uate student; Edwin Parker, As

view Union.
According to the survey, the
majority of Americans hold nei
ther a consistent "hawk" posi
tion, nor a consistent "dove"
position, since they favor some
moves toward de-escalation
while refusing to abandon Viet

nam entirely. Only six per cent
had a consistent "hawk" posi
tion, opposed to moves toward
de-escalation and in favor of
escalating the war. The number
of pure "doves" was 14 per cent.
Verba said the survey had
been privately financed with
half of the $10,000 costs coming
from members of the Bay Area
academic community. Verba not
ed the solicitation of funds was
presented to faculty members
as a "contribution to the Viet
nam debate."
The appeal for funds was
made without respect to any
stand on Vietnam policy and had
no connection with any of the
campus protest organizations.
Verba said both opponents and
proponents of Administration
had contributed.
Tested on Stanford
The poll itself was developed
in six days, then pre tested with
Stanford graduates and under
graduates, and later tested over
a 100 mile swath in the Bay
Area.
The members of the Stanford
team were Verba; Gordon Black,
graduate student; Richard A.
Brody, Professor of Political Sci
ence; Paul Ekman, Research As
sociate at the Institute of Politi
cal Studies; Norman Nie, grad

The national debate on the Vietnam War
focused last week on a survey conducted by
seven Stanford social scientists into "the na
ture of approval and dissent" over American
policy.
The opinion poll released during Finals Week
found "a willingness for a variety of kinds of
negotiations" among the American people, in
cluding strong support for direct negotiations
with the Viet Cong. Results of the survey were
widely publicized throughout the country and
received editorial comment in New York and
Washington papers.
Citing the Johnson Administration's sensitivity
to public opinion, the survey noted "public opin
ion has not been explored in sufficient detail to
give policy-makers a fully rounded picture of
American thinking on choices in Vietnam and
their possible costs."
Deeper Exploration
Dr. Sidney Verba, head of the seven-man
team which developd and pre-tested the ques

tionnaire, told The Daily he was pleased with
national reaction to the poll. Although none of
the social scientists are experts in Southeast
Asian affairs, Verba said a deeper exploration
of American opinion "was a field in which our
social science skills were relevant."
The actual pollinig of the 1474 respondees was
conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center at the University of Chicago. Many of
the findings concurred with surveys by the Gal
lup and Harris organizations, but the more
detailed questionnaire of thirty questions used
in the Stanford Poll gaged reaction more com
pletely. Among the findings were the follow
ing:
• 88 per cent of those polled would favor ne
gotiations with the Viet Cong. Sentiment to ne
gotiate was about the same among those who
favor and also among those who oppose the
Johnson Administration's handling of the situ
ation.
• 70 per cent would favor a truce negotiated
by the United Nations or some neutral coun
try.

• 52 per cent would favor the formation of a
new government in South Vietnam with the
Viet Cong taking part, and 54 per cent of the
respondees would favor free elections even if
the Viet Cong might win.
No Acceptable Solution
Suggesting "some of the limits beyond which
public opinion would not like to push," the
Stanford Poll found Americans evenly divided
on the issue of a half-million man commitment
in Vietnam, while they were opposed to fight
ing China by a 2-1 margin. Given several op
tions on how to pay for the war, Americans
found no acceptable solution and opposed in
creased taxes (2-1), government price and wage
controls, cuts in education expenses and reduc
tion in the Medicare program.
Yet the poll also underlines American reluc
tance to abandon Vietnam. Only 15 per cent
would favor complete withdrawal which would
allow the Communists to take over the nation.
When faced with the three polar alternatives
—withdrawal, a major war with thousands of

casualties, and continuing the present policy—
49 per cent favor a continuance of the current
policy, 23 per cent would favor all-out war, and
only 19 per cent would abandon Vietnam.
The poll then asked the respondees which
choice they would make if it were no longer
possible to continue the present policy. Sixty
per cent would undertake a major war, while
only 31 per cent would withdraw.
Wrong: on Two Count s
The stereotype of the Vietnam policy dis
senter as a left-leaning beatnik proved to be
wrong on both counts, according to the poll.
"There is a large number of people who favor
negotiations, but it would be hard to character
ize them as shoeless, bearded draftcard burn
ers," Verba said.
In a series of questions designed to measure
the respondees anti-Communist sentiment to
other Red threats, the survey found dissenters
from Administration policy just as tough on
Communism as those who favored present US
policy.
Seventy-eight per cent of those
opposed to present policy be
lieved the handling of Castro
Cuba had been too soft, while
only 64 per cent of those now
backing the Administration
thought it was too lenient. The
policy showed a similar reaction
in relation to American policy
toward Red China and the So

controls, cuts in education expenses and reduc
tion in the Medicare program.
Yet the poll also underlines American reluc
tance to abandon Vietnam. Only 15 per cent
would favor complete withdrawal which would
allow the Communists to take over the nation.
When faced with the three polar alternatives
—withdrawal, a major war with thousands of

casualties, and continuing the present policy—
49 per cent favor a continuance of the current
policy, 23 per cent would favor all-out war, and
only 19 per cent would abandon Vietnam.
The poll then asked the respondees which
choice they would make if it were no longer
possible to continue the present policy. Sixty
per cent would undertake a major war, while
only 31 per cent would withdraw.
Wrong: on Two Count s
The stereotype of the Vietnam policy dis
senter as a left-leaning beatnik proved to be
wrong on both counts, according to the poll.
"There is a large number of people who favor
negotiations, but it would be hard to character
ize them as shoeless, bearded draftcard burn
ers," Verba said.
In a series of questions designed to measure
the respondees anti-Communist sentiment to
other Red threats, the survey found dissenters
from Administration policy just as tough on
Communism as those who favored present US
policy.
Seventy-eight per cent of those
opposed to present policy be
lieved the handling of Castro
Cuba had been too soft, while
only 64 per cent of those now
backing the Administration
thought it was too lenient. The
policy showed a similar reaction
in relation to American policy
toward Red China and the So
view Union.
According to the survey, the
majority of Americans hold nei
ther a consistent "hawk" posi
tion, nor a consistent "dove"
position, since they favor some
moves toward de-escalation
while refusing to abandon Viet

nam entirely. Only six per cent
had a consistent "hawk" posi
tion, opposed to moves toward
de-escalation and in favor of
escalating the war. The number
of pure "doves" was 14 per cent.
Verba said the survey had
been privately financed with
half of the $10,000 costs coming
from members of the Bay Area
academic community. Verba not
ed the solicitation of funds was
presented to faculty members
as a "contribution to the Viet
nam debate."
The appeal for funds was
made without respect to any
stand on Vietnam policy and had
no connection with any of the
campus protest organizations.
Verba said both opponents and
proponents of Administration
had contributed.
Tested on Stanford
The poll itself was developed
in six days, then pre tested with
Stanford graduates and under
graduates, and later tested over
a 100 mile swath in the Bay
Area.
The members of the Stanford
team were Verba; Gordon Black,
graduate student; Richard A.
Brody, Professor of Political Sci
ence; Paul Ekman, Research As
sociate at the Institute of Politi
cal Studies; Norman Nie, grad

The national debate on the Vietnam War
focused last week on a survey conducted by
seven Stanford social scientists into "the na
ture of approval and dissent" over American
policy.
The opinion poll released during Finals Week
found "a willingness for a variety of kinds of
negotiations" among the American people, in
cluding strong support for direct negotiations
with the Viet Cong. Results of the survey were
widely publicized throughout the country and
received editorial comment in New York and
Washington papers.
Citing the Johnson Administration's sensitivity
to public opinion, the survey noted "public opin
ion has not been explored in sufficient detail to
give policy-makers a fully rounded picture of
American thinking on choices in Vietnam and
their possible costs."
Deeper Exploration
Dr. Sidney Verba, head of the seven-man
team which developd and pre-tested the ques

tionnaire, told The Daily he was pleased with
national reaction to the poll. Although none of
the social scientists are experts in Southeast
Asian affairs, Verba said a deeper exploration
of American opinion "was a field in which our
social science skills were relevant."
The actual pollinig of the 1474 respondees was
conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center at the University of Chicago. Many of
the findings concurred with surveys by the Gal
lup and Harris organizations, but the more
detailed questionnaire of thirty questions used
in the Stanford Poll gaged reaction more com
pletely. Among the findings were the follow
ing:
• 88 per cent of those polled would favor ne
gotiations with the Viet Cong. Sentiment to ne
gotiate was about the same among those who
favor and also among those who oppose the
Johnson Administration's handling of the situ
ation.
• 70 per cent would favor a truce negotiated
by the United Nations or some neutral coun
try.

• 52 per cent would favor the formation of a
new government in South Vietnam with the
Viet Cong taking part, and 54 per cent of the
respondees would favor free elections even if
the Viet Cong might win.
No Acceptable Solution
Suggesting "some of the limits beyond which
public opinion would not like to push," the
Stanford Poll found Americans evenly divided
on the issue of a half-million man commitment
in Vietnam, while they were opposed to fight
ing China by a 2-1 margin. Given several op
tions on how to pay for the war, Americans
found no acceptable solution and opposed in
creased taxes (2-1), government price and wage
controls, cuts in education expenses and reduc
tion in the Medicare program.
