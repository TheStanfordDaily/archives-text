# Runners Nip USC At UCSB
## 
### 
Stanford's perenially almost
best track team took one hurdle
in stride at the Santa Barbara
Relays last weekend when they
nosed out USC for second place.
UCLA was well out in front with
53 points, then came Stanford
with 42, USC with 41, San Jose,
39, and Arizona, 23.
Although sensational Tommy
Smith anchored three winning
relay teams and was named out
standing athlete of the meet,
Stanford sophomore Jim Ward
gave him a good show in the
mile relay. Smith ran a fast 46.6
in his anchor lap, but Ward ran
even better. He got the baton
far in back of the leaders but
a blazing 46.1 lap got Stanford
third place in the race.
Stanford didn't get any out
right firsts but they finished in
the money in almost every race.
Freshman Pete Boyce cleared
6' 8" in the high jump as an
other frosh, Pat Morrison, took
third in the 199 in 9.7. Larry
Questad finished fourth.
Ex-Stanford great Dave Weill
easily took first in the discus
while present Indian discus hero
Bob Stoecker took second at
184' 8".
