# Stanford Swimmers Sixth In NCAA
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford varsity swimmers,
paced by a flurry of lifetime
best efforts and 11 Stanford rec
ords, placed sixth in the 43rd an
nual NCAA Championships held
last weekend at the Air Force
Academy.
Southern California upset a
"cinch" winner, Indiana, to gain
its third consecutive NCAA ti
tle. Roy Saari put on last min
ute spurts to win the 200, 500,
1650 freestyle and the 400 free
style relay. The victories made
Saari's ninth NCAA individual
championship.
The altitude of the Air Force
Academy (7250 feet) had little
effect on the 50 and 100 yard
sprints, but led to a 3-4 second
difference in the 200 yard races,
10-12 seconds in the 500, and
nearly 40 seconds in the 1650.
Only one NCAA record was

broken in the entire meet, as
Michigan State's Gary Dilley
swam 100 backstroke in 52.3, .3
below his own record and a full
second ahead of second place.
Indiana established a mark of
7:06.7 in the 800 free relay, a
new event this year.
Stanford entered the AAWU
Championships three weeks ago,
where it finished a dismal third
behind USC and UCLA. How
ever, the Indian's eggs were in
the big basket, as the tribe beat
UCLA by some 26 points in the
NCAA's.
In the individual events, Stan
ford took a second, a thud, two
fifths, an eighth, an eleventh,
and a twelfth. Stanford's med
ley relay placed sixth (3:36.6).
The Indian 400 free relay fin
ished fifth in 3:09.9, and the 800
free relay garnered a third with
a 7:10.4.

Bob Momsen streaked to a
2:14.8 (about 2:12.0 at sea level)
performance in the 200 breast
stroke to place second behind
USC's Wayne Anderson (2:14.3).
Momsen, a sophomore, started
swimming breaststroke only two
years age, switching from dis
tance freestyle.
Momsen hit 1:01.0 in Stan
ford's medley relay, which
placed sixth.
Mike Wall, also a sophomore,
was the tribe's chief point gath
erer. Wall pinned down fifth
place in the 500 freestyle after
qualifying in 4:52.4. In the 400
freestyle relay, Wall hit 48.3 for
one leg. Wall's biggest day, how
ever, came on the final night of
competition.
Stone Wall
Seeded twelfth in the 1650,
Wall did not swim with the final
heat. Wall churned out a 17:26.9
in the grueling race, swimming
in an outside lane with no one
to pace against. The time (about
16:45 here) gave him third be
hind Saari and Utah's Mike Gar
ibaldi.
Wall anchored the 800 free
style relay, the final event. Jim
Laney (1:47.3) led off. Bill Mey
er (1:51.3) dropped behind
Michigan, Indiana, and SMU.
Mark Parmely dropped in a
1:46.9 on the third leg, leaving
Stanford in fourth place, two
body lengths behind SMU.
Wall caught the SMU swim
mer with a length to go in the
race, and beat him in the home
stretch. Wall's time, an incredi
ble 1:45.1 after the 1650, was the
meet's fastest in the 800 relay,
being close to a 1:43.0 at sea
level.
Meyer Fifth in 50
Bill Meyer, a surprise at the
conference meet, was a wonder
at the NCAA's. Before the
AAWU meet, Meyer's best 50
freestyle was 22.6. Meyer earned
first place honors at the confer
ence meet with a 22.0.
Meyer hit 21.5 to qualify sixth
at the NCAA's, then moved up
a notch to take fifth in the fi
nals.
Meyer turned a 48.2 at the
AAWU's, bettering his previous
efforts by 1.4 second. The Stan
ford sophomore led off the 400
free relay in a sparkling 47.5,
setting the pace for a 3:09.9. In
the consolation finals at the
NCAA's, Meyer missed a turn to
place eleventh with a 48.1.
Bill Schubach, team captain
and only graduating senior from
the tribe's NCAA swimming
squad, started setting varsity
records at the AAWU's. Schu
back took second in the 100 back
stroke (55.6) and third in the
200 backstroke (2:04.3).
Schubach Backs Out
Schubach kept shaving off
tenths of seconds, leading the
400 medley relay in 55.0. In the
preliminaries of the 100 back
stroke, the Canton flash posted
a 54.7. A strained muscle slowed
him down to twelfth place in the
consolation finals.
Schubach came back the next
day to qualify 10th in the 200
backstroke. Schubach then

pulled to a 3:03.1 In the finals
to finish Bth in the nation.
Jim Laney, the only junior on
the NCAA squad, swam on all
three relays. Laney flashed to a
46.6 on the anchor leg of the 400
free relay to put the Cards be
low 3:10.0. In the medley relay,
Laney hit 51.4 for the 100 but
terfly leg. The junior from Phoe
nix led off the 800 free relay
with 1:47.3 (circa 1:45, elevation
zero).
Three Months Work
Laney returned from Stanford
In Germany late in December,
and had only three months to
get into shape after a 6 month
lay-off.
Mark Parmely, ill during the
conference meet, came through
with top performances in all
three relays. Parmely, a sopho
more, swam a 47.5 leg on the
400 free relay. Parmely's 1:46.9
leg of the 800 free relay put
Mike Wall within shooting dis
tance of SMU.
In the finals of the 400 medley
relay, Parmely severely bruised
both heels on his first turn, but
managed a 49.0 despite the acute
pain on the following two turns.
Freeman First in AAWU
Bill Freeman, senior diver,
aced the field of AAWU divers
in the low-board competition at
the conference meet. Freeman,
who returned after a year's ab
sence, took second in the 3 meter
competition.. Freeman placed
21st in a field of 45 in both divi
sions at the NCAA's.
Charlie Burbach took third in
the 400 yards individual medley
at the conference meet. He also
dropped his 200 IM time to
2:03.3, and his 200 breaststroke
time to 2:19.6. Burbach narrow
ly missed qualifying in the 400
IM at the NCAA's.

Doug Miller placed third at
the AAWU championships, but
mised the NCAA 200 butterfly
time (2:00.9) by half a second.
Bill Manoogian swam his best
200 fly by 5 seconds at the con
ference meet, finishing in 2:04.7.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
was overwhelmingly pleased
with the team's performance at
the NCAA's, noting the personal
"best-ever" performances for
every man in practically every
race.
Consistent Peak
Though other teams may have
come up with faster times in
places, Gaughran judged that no
team came up with the profu
sion of lifetime best perform
ances that Stanford competitors
consistently turned in.
Stanford was picked by Swim
ming World as ninth place be
fore the meet.
The Stanford Treshman team,
the best in the nation with two

world record holders and high
school All - Americans in 24
events, bettered 5 NCAA fresh
man records last season. Next
season, when joined with a var
sity that has already proved it
self of national caliber, the na
tion may have to reserve the
center lanes for the Indians.
Frosh Compete in AAU's
The freshman leave this week
for Tampa and the AAU Na
tional Championships. While
Stanford swimmers Momsen,
Wall, and national record-holder
Greg Buckingham cannot com
pete with the frosh on the same
team due to AAU-NCAA con
flicts, the freshman have an ex
cellent chance to win the meet.
Although complete funds have
not yet been raised, Gaughran
hopes to send nine competitors
to Florida. Dick Roth in the 200
and 400 individual medley and
Luis Nicolao in the 100 and 200
fly and 100 free, will be going
for gold medals.

Pete Siebert and Bob Hart
should score well in the back
stroke and individual medley.
Bill Kee will also be a top threat
in the backstroke events. Sprint
ers and middle distance men
Morgan Manning, Paul Meyer,
and Jeff Hammett will be in line
for big points.
Gaughran sees all three fresh
man relays as possible victors.
The medley relay of Kee or Sie
bert, Roth, Nicolao, and Man
ning should go 3:32 or faster.
(Michigan won the NCAA's in
3:33.3) The frosh have already
posted NCAA freshman 400 free
relay records with seven dif
ferent sprinters participating.

ords, placed sixth in the 43rd an
nual NCAA Championships held
last weekend at the Air Force
Academy.
Southern California upset a
"cinch" winner, Indiana, to gain
its third consecutive NCAA ti
tle. Roy Saari put on last min
ute spurts to win the 200, 500,
1650 freestyle and the 400 free
style relay. The victories made
Saari's ninth NCAA individual
championship.
The altitude of the Air Force
Academy (7250 feet) had little
effect on the 50 and 100 yard
sprints, but led to a 3-4 second
difference in the 200 yard races,
10-12 seconds in the 500, and
nearly 40 seconds in the 1650.
Only one NCAA record was

broken in the entire meet, as
Michigan State's Gary Dilley
swam 100 backstroke in 52.3, .3
below his own record and a full
second ahead of second place.
Indiana established a mark of
7:06.7 in the 800 free relay, a
new event this year.
Stanford entered the AAWU
Championships three weeks ago,
where it finished a dismal third
behind USC and UCLA. How
ever, the Indian's eggs were in
the big basket, as the tribe beat
UCLA by some 26 points in the
NCAA's.
In the individual events, Stan
ford took a second, a thud, two
fifths, an eighth, an eleventh,
and a twelfth. Stanford's med
ley relay placed sixth (3:36.6).
The Indian 400 free relay fin
ished fifth in 3:09.9, and the 800
free relay garnered a third with
a 7:10.4.

Bob Momsen streaked to a
2:14.8 (about 2:12.0 at sea level)
performance in the 200 breast
stroke to place second behind
USC's Wayne Anderson (2:14.3).
Momsen, a sophomore, started
swimming breaststroke only two
years age, switching from dis
tance freestyle.
Momsen hit 1:01.0 in Stan
ford's medley relay, which
placed sixth.
Mike Wall, also a sophomore,
was the tribe's chief point gath
erer. Wall pinned down fifth
place in the 500 freestyle after
qualifying in 4:52.4. In the 400
freestyle relay, Wall hit 48.3 for
one leg. Wall's biggest day, how
ever, came on the final night of
competition.
Stone Wall
Seeded twelfth in the 1650,
Wall did not swim with the final
heat. Wall churned out a 17:26.9
in the grueling race, swimming
in an outside lane with no one
to pace against. The time (about
16:45 here) gave him third be
hind Saari and Utah's Mike Gar
ibaldi.
Wall anchored the 800 free
style relay, the final event. Jim
Laney (1:47.3) led off. Bill Mey
er (1:51.3) dropped behind
Michigan, Indiana, and SMU.
Mark Parmely dropped in a
1:46.9 on the third leg, leaving
Stanford in fourth place, two
body lengths behind SMU.
Wall caught the SMU swim
mer with a length to go in the
race, and beat him in the home
stretch. Wall's time, an incredi
ble 1:45.1 after the 1650, was the
meet's fastest in the 800 relay,
being close to a 1:43.0 at sea
level.
Meyer Fifth in 50
Bill Meyer, a surprise at the
conference meet, was a wonder
at the NCAA's. Before the
AAWU meet, Meyer's best 50
freestyle was 22.6. Meyer earned
first place honors at the confer
ence meet with a 22.0.
Meyer hit 21.5 to qualify sixth
at the NCAA's, then moved up
a notch to take fifth in the fi
nals.
Meyer turned a 48.2 at the
AAWU's, bettering his previous
efforts by 1.4 second. The Stan
ford sophomore led off the 400
free relay in a sparkling 47.5,
setting the pace for a 3:09.9. In
the consolation finals at the
NCAA's, Meyer missed a turn to
place eleventh with a 48.1.
Bill Schubach, team captain
and only graduating senior from
the tribe's NCAA swimming
squad, started setting varsity
records at the AAWU's. Schu
back took second in the 100 back
stroke (55.6) and third in the
200 backstroke (2:04.3).
Schubach Backs Out
Schubach kept shaving off
tenths of seconds, leading the
400 medley relay in 55.0. In the
preliminaries of the 100 back
stroke, the Canton flash posted
a 54.7. A strained muscle slowed
him down to twelfth place in the
consolation finals.
Schubach came back the next
day to qualify 10th in the 200
backstroke. Schubach then

pulled to a 3:03.1 In the finals
to finish Bth in the nation.
Jim Laney, the only junior on
the NCAA squad, swam on all
three relays. Laney flashed to a
46.6 on the anchor leg of the 400
free relay to put the Cards be
low 3:10.0. In the medley relay,
Laney hit 51.4 for the 100 but
terfly leg. The junior from Phoe
nix led off the 800 free relay
with 1:47.3 (circa 1:45, elevation
zero).
Three Months Work
Laney returned from Stanford
In Germany late in December,
and had only three months to
get into shape after a 6 month
lay-off.
Mark Parmely, ill during the
conference meet, came through
with top performances in all
three relays. Parmely, a sopho
more, swam a 47.5 leg on the
400 free relay. Parmely's 1:46.9
leg of the 800 free relay put
Mike Wall within shooting dis
tance of SMU.
In the finals of the 400 medley
relay, Parmely severely bruised
both heels on his first turn, but
managed a 49.0 despite the acute
pain on the following two turns.
Freeman First in AAWU
Bill Freeman, senior diver,
aced the field of AAWU divers
in the low-board competition at
the conference meet. Freeman,
who returned after a year's ab
sence, took second in the 3 meter
competition.. Freeman placed
21st in a field of 45 in both divi
sions at the NCAA's.
Charlie Burbach took third in
the 400 yards individual medley
at the conference meet. He also
dropped his 200 IM time to
2:03.3, and his 200 breaststroke
time to 2:19.6. Burbach narrow
ly missed qualifying in the 400
IM at the NCAA's.

Doug Miller placed third at
the AAWU championships, but
mised the NCAA 200 butterfly
time (2:00.9) by half a second.
Bill Manoogian swam his best
200 fly by 5 seconds at the con
ference meet, finishing in 2:04.7.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
was overwhelmingly pleased
with the team's performance at
the NCAA's, noting the personal
"best-ever" performances for
every man in practically every
race.
Consistent Peak
Though other teams may have
come up with faster times in
places, Gaughran judged that no
team came up with the profu
sion of lifetime best perform
ances that Stanford competitors
consistently turned in.
Stanford was picked by Swim
ming World as ninth place be
fore the meet.
The Stanford Treshman team,
the best in the nation with two

world record holders and high
school All - Americans in 24
events, bettered 5 NCAA fresh
man records last season. Next
season, when joined with a var
sity that has already proved it
self of national caliber, the na
tion may have to reserve the
center lanes for the Indians.
Frosh Compete in AAU's
The freshman leave this week
for Tampa and the AAU Na
tional Championships. While
Stanford swimmers Momsen,
Wall, and national record-holder
Greg Buckingham cannot com
pete with the frosh on the same
team due to AAU-NCAA con
flicts, the freshman have an ex
cellent chance to win the meet.
Although complete funds have
not yet been raised, Gaughran
hopes to send nine competitors
to Florida. Dick Roth in the 200
and 400 individual medley and
Luis Nicolao in the 100 and 200
fly and 100 free, will be going
for gold medals.

Pete Siebert and Bob Hart
should score well in the back
stroke and individual medley.
Bill Kee will also be a top threat
in the backstroke events. Sprint
ers and middle distance men
Morgan Manning, Paul Meyer,
and Jeff Hammett will be in line
for big points.
Gaughran sees all three fresh
man relays as possible victors.
The medley relay of Kee or Sie
bert, Roth, Nicolao, and Man
ning should go 3:32 or faster.
(Michigan won the NCAA's in
3:33.3) The frosh have already
posted NCAA freshman 400 free
relay records with seven dif
ferent sprinters participating.

last weekend at the Air Force
Academy.
Southern California upset a
"cinch" winner, Indiana, to gain
its third consecutive NCAA ti
tle. Roy Saari put on last min
ute spurts to win the 200, 500,
1650 freestyle and the 400 free
style relay. The victories made
Saari's ninth NCAA individual
championship.
The altitude of the Air Force
Academy (7250 feet) had little
effect on the 50 and 100 yard
sprints, but led to a 3-4 second
difference in the 200 yard races,
10-12 seconds in the 500, and
nearly 40 seconds in the 1650.
Only one NCAA record was

broken in the entire meet, as
Michigan State's Gary Dilley
swam 100 backstroke in 52.3, .3
below his own record and a full
second ahead of second place.
Indiana established a mark of
7:06.7 in the 800 free relay, a
new event this year.
Stanford entered the AAWU
Championships three weeks ago,
where it finished a dismal third
behind USC and UCLA. How
ever, the Indian's eggs were in
the big basket, as the tribe beat
UCLA by some 26 points in the
NCAA's.
In the individual events, Stan
ford took a second, a thud, two
fifths, an eighth, an eleventh,
and a twelfth. Stanford's med
ley relay placed sixth (3:36.6).
The Indian 400 free relay fin
ished fifth in 3:09.9, and the 800
free relay garnered a third with
a 7:10.4.

Bob Momsen streaked to a
2:14.8 (about 2:12.0 at sea level)
performance in the 200 breast
stroke to place second behind
USC's Wayne Anderson (2:14.3).
Momsen, a sophomore, started
swimming breaststroke only two
years age, switching from dis
tance freestyle.
Momsen hit 1:01.0 in Stan
ford's medley relay, which
placed sixth.
Mike Wall, also a sophomore,
was the tribe's chief point gath
erer. Wall pinned down fifth
place in the 500 freestyle after
qualifying in 4:52.4. In the 400
freestyle relay, Wall hit 48.3 for
one leg. Wall's biggest day, how
ever, came on the final night of
competition.
Stone Wall
Seeded twelfth in the 1650,
Wall did not swim with the final
heat. Wall churned out a 17:26.9
in the grueling race, swimming
in an outside lane with no one
to pace against. The time (about
16:45 here) gave him third be
hind Saari and Utah's Mike Gar
ibaldi.
Wall anchored the 800 free
style relay, the final event. Jim
Laney (1:47.3) led off. Bill Mey
er (1:51.3) dropped behind
Michigan, Indiana, and SMU.
Mark Parmely dropped in a
1:46.9 on the third leg, leaving
Stanford in fourth place, two
body lengths behind SMU.
Wall caught the SMU swim
mer with a length to go in the
race, and beat him in the home
stretch. Wall's time, an incredi
ble 1:45.1 after the 1650, was the
meet's fastest in the 800 relay,
being close to a 1:43.0 at sea
level.
Meyer Fifth in 50
Bill Meyer, a surprise at the
conference meet, was a wonder
at the NCAA's. Before the
AAWU meet, Meyer's best 50
freestyle was 22.6. Meyer earned
first place honors at the confer
ence meet with a 22.0.
Meyer hit 21.5 to qualify sixth
at the NCAA's, then moved up
a notch to take fifth in the fi
nals.
Meyer turned a 48.2 at the
AAWU's, bettering his previous
efforts by 1.4 second. The Stan
ford sophomore led off the 400
free relay in a sparkling 47.5,
setting the pace for a 3:09.9. In
the consolation finals at the
NCAA's, Meyer missed a turn to
place eleventh with a 48.1.
Bill Schubach, team captain
and only graduating senior from
the tribe's NCAA swimming
squad, started setting varsity
records at the AAWU's. Schu
back took second in the 100 back
stroke (55.6) and third in the
200 backstroke (2:04.3).
Schubach Backs Out
Schubach kept shaving off
tenths of seconds, leading the
400 medley relay in 55.0. In the
preliminaries of the 100 back
stroke, the Canton flash posted
a 54.7. A strained muscle slowed
him down to twelfth place in the
consolation finals.
Schubach came back the next
day to qualify 10th in the 200
backstroke. Schubach then

pulled to a 3:03.1 In the finals
to finish Bth in the nation.
Jim Laney, the only junior on
the NCAA squad, swam on all
three relays. Laney flashed to a
46.6 on the anchor leg of the 400
free relay to put the Cards be
low 3:10.0. In the medley relay,
Laney hit 51.4 for the 100 but
terfly leg. The junior from Phoe
nix led off the 800 free relay
with 1:47.3 (circa 1:45, elevation
zero).
Three Months Work
Laney returned from Stanford
In Germany late in December,
and had only three months to
get into shape after a 6 month
lay-off.
Mark Parmely, ill during the
conference meet, came through
with top performances in all
three relays. Parmely, a sopho
more, swam a 47.5 leg on the
400 free relay. Parmely's 1:46.9
leg of the 800 free relay put
Mike Wall within shooting dis
tance of SMU.
In the finals of the 400 medley
relay, Parmely severely bruised
both heels on his first turn, but
managed a 49.0 despite the acute
pain on the following two turns.
Freeman First in AAWU
Bill Freeman, senior diver,
aced the field of AAWU divers
in the low-board competition at
the conference meet. Freeman,
who returned after a year's ab
sence, took second in the 3 meter
competition.. Freeman placed
21st in a field of 45 in both divi
sions at the NCAA's.
Charlie Burbach took third in
the 400 yards individual medley
at the conference meet. He also
dropped his 200 IM time to
2:03.3, and his 200 breaststroke
time to 2:19.6. Burbach narrow
ly missed qualifying in the 400
IM at the NCAA's.

Doug Miller placed third at
the AAWU championships, but
mised the NCAA 200 butterfly
time (2:00.9) by half a second.
Bill Manoogian swam his best
200 fly by 5 seconds at the con
ference meet, finishing in 2:04.7.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
was overwhelmingly pleased
with the team's performance at
the NCAA's, noting the personal
"best-ever" performances for
every man in practically every
race.
Consistent Peak
Though other teams may have
come up with faster times in
places, Gaughran judged that no
team came up with the profu
sion of lifetime best perform
ances that Stanford competitors
consistently turned in.
Stanford was picked by Swim
ming World as ninth place be
fore the meet.
The Stanford Treshman team,
the best in the nation with two

world record holders and high
school All - Americans in 24
events, bettered 5 NCAA fresh
man records last season. Next
season, when joined with a var
sity that has already proved it
self of national caliber, the na
tion may have to reserve the
center lanes for the Indians.
Frosh Compete in AAU's
The freshman leave this week
for Tampa and the AAU Na
tional Championships. While
Stanford swimmers Momsen,
Wall, and national record-holder
Greg Buckingham cannot com
pete with the frosh on the same
team due to AAU-NCAA con
flicts, the freshman have an ex
cellent chance to win the meet.
Although complete funds have
not yet been raised, Gaughran
hopes to send nine competitors
to Florida. Dick Roth in the 200
and 400 individual medley and
Luis Nicolao in the 100 and 200
fly and 100 free, will be going
for gold medals.

Pete Siebert and Bob Hart
should score well in the back
stroke and individual medley.
Bill Kee will also be a top threat
in the backstroke events. Sprint
ers and middle distance men
Morgan Manning, Paul Meyer,
and Jeff Hammett will be in line
for big points.
Gaughran sees all three fresh
man relays as possible victors.
The medley relay of Kee or Sie
bert, Roth, Nicolao, and Man
ning should go 3:32 or faster.
(Michigan won the NCAA's in
3:33.3) The frosh have already
posted NCAA freshman 400 free
relay records with seven dif
ferent sprinters participating.

"cinch" winner, Indiana, to gain
its third consecutive NCAA ti
tle. Roy Saari put on last min
ute spurts to win the 200, 500,
1650 freestyle and the 400 free
style relay. The victories made
Saari's ninth NCAA individual
championship.
The altitude of the Air Force
Academy (7250 feet) had little
effect on the 50 and 100 yard
sprints, but led to a 3-4 second
difference in the 200 yard races,
10-12 seconds in the 500, and
nearly 40 seconds in the 1650.
Only one NCAA record was

broken in the entire meet, as
Michigan State's Gary Dilley
swam 100 backstroke in 52.3, .3
below his own record and a full
second ahead of second place.
Indiana established a mark of
7:06.7 in the 800 free relay, a
new event this year.
Stanford entered the AAWU
Championships three weeks ago,
where it finished a dismal third
behind USC and UCLA. How
ever, the Indian's eggs were in
the big basket, as the tribe beat
UCLA by some 26 points in the
NCAA's.
In the individual events, Stan
ford took a second, a thud, two
fifths, an eighth, an eleventh,
and a twelfth. Stanford's med
ley relay placed sixth (3:36.6).
The Indian 400 free relay fin
ished fifth in 3:09.9, and the 800
free relay garnered a third with
a 7:10.4.

Bob Momsen streaked to a
2:14.8 (about 2:12.0 at sea level)
performance in the 200 breast
stroke to place second behind
USC's Wayne Anderson (2:14.3).
Momsen, a sophomore, started
swimming breaststroke only two
years age, switching from dis
tance freestyle.
Momsen hit 1:01.0 in Stan
ford's medley relay, which
placed sixth.
Mike Wall, also a sophomore,
was the tribe's chief point gath
erer. Wall pinned down fifth
place in the 500 freestyle after
qualifying in 4:52.4. In the 400
freestyle relay, Wall hit 48.3 for
one leg. Wall's biggest day, how
ever, came on the final night of
competition.
Stone Wall
Seeded twelfth in the 1650,
Wall did not swim with the final
heat. Wall churned out a 17:26.9
in the grueling race, swimming
in an outside lane with no one
to pace against. The time (about
16:45 here) gave him third be
hind Saari and Utah's Mike Gar
ibaldi.
Wall anchored the 800 free
style relay, the final event. Jim
Laney (1:47.3) led off. Bill Mey
er (1:51.3) dropped behind
Michigan, Indiana, and SMU.
Mark Parmely dropped in a
1:46.9 on the third leg, leaving
Stanford in fourth place, two
body lengths behind SMU.
Wall caught the SMU swim
mer with a length to go in the
race, and beat him in the home
stretch. Wall's time, an incredi
ble 1:45.1 after the 1650, was the
meet's fastest in the 800 relay,
being close to a 1:43.0 at sea
level.
Meyer Fifth in 50
Bill Meyer, a surprise at the
conference meet, was a wonder
at the NCAA's. Before the
AAWU meet, Meyer's best 50
freestyle was 22.6. Meyer earned
first place honors at the confer
ence meet with a 22.0.
Meyer hit 21.5 to qualify sixth
at the NCAA's, then moved up
a notch to take fifth in the fi
nals.
Meyer turned a 48.2 at the
AAWU's, bettering his previous
efforts by 1.4 second. The Stan
ford sophomore led off the 400
free relay in a sparkling 47.5,
setting the pace for a 3:09.9. In
the consolation finals at the
NCAA's, Meyer missed a turn to
place eleventh with a 48.1.
Bill Schubach, team captain
and only graduating senior from
the tribe's NCAA swimming
squad, started setting varsity
records at the AAWU's. Schu
back took second in the 100 back
stroke (55.6) and third in the
200 backstroke (2:04.3).
Schubach Backs Out
Schubach kept shaving off
tenths of seconds, leading the
400 medley relay in 55.0. In the
preliminaries of the 100 back
stroke, the Canton flash posted
a 54.7. A strained muscle slowed
him down to twelfth place in the
consolation finals.
Schubach came back the next
day to qualify 10th in the 200
backstroke. Schubach then

pulled to a 3:03.1 In the finals
to finish Bth in the nation.
Jim Laney, the only junior on
the NCAA squad, swam on all
three relays. Laney flashed to a
46.6 on the anchor leg of the 400
free relay to put the Cards be
low 3:10.0. In the medley relay,
Laney hit 51.4 for the 100 but
terfly leg. The junior from Phoe
nix led off the 800 free relay
with 1:47.3 (circa 1:45, elevation
zero).
Three Months Work
Laney returned from Stanford
In Germany late in December,
and had only three months to
get into shape after a 6 month
lay-off.
Mark Parmely, ill during the
conference meet, came through
with top performances in all
three relays. Parmely, a sopho
more, swam a 47.5 leg on the
400 free relay. Parmely's 1:46.9
leg of the 800 free relay put
Mike Wall within shooting dis
tance of SMU.
In the finals of the 400 medley
relay, Parmely severely bruised
both heels on his first turn, but
managed a 49.0 despite the acute
pain on the following two turns.
Freeman First in AAWU
Bill Freeman, senior diver,
aced the field of AAWU divers
in the low-board competition at
the conference meet. Freeman,
who returned after a year's ab
sence, took second in the 3 meter
competition.. Freeman placed
21st in a field of 45 in both divi
sions at the NCAA's.
Charlie Burbach took third in
the 400 yards individual medley
at the conference meet. He also
dropped his 200 IM time to
2:03.3, and his 200 breaststroke
time to 2:19.6. Burbach narrow
ly missed qualifying in the 400
IM at the NCAA's.

Doug Miller placed third at
the AAWU championships, but
mised the NCAA 200 butterfly
time (2:00.9) by half a second.
Bill Manoogian swam his best
200 fly by 5 seconds at the con
ference meet, finishing in 2:04.7.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
was overwhelmingly pleased
with the team's performance at
the NCAA's, noting the personal
"best-ever" performances for
every man in practically every
race.
Consistent Peak
Though other teams may have
come up with faster times in
places, Gaughran judged that no
team came up with the profu
sion of lifetime best perform
ances that Stanford competitors
consistently turned in.
Stanford was picked by Swim
ming World as ninth place be
fore the meet.
The Stanford Treshman team,
the best in the nation with two

world record holders and high
school All - Americans in 24
events, bettered 5 NCAA fresh
man records last season. Next
season, when joined with a var
sity that has already proved it
self of national caliber, the na
tion may have to reserve the
center lanes for the Indians.
Frosh Compete in AAU's
The freshman leave this week
for Tampa and the AAU Na
tional Championships. While
Stanford swimmers Momsen,
Wall, and national record-holder
Greg Buckingham cannot com
pete with the frosh on the same
team due to AAU-NCAA con
flicts, the freshman have an ex
cellent chance to win the meet.
Although complete funds have
not yet been raised, Gaughran
hopes to send nine competitors
to Florida. Dick Roth in the 200
and 400 individual medley and
Luis Nicolao in the 100 and 200
fly and 100 free, will be going
for gold medals.

Pete Siebert and Bob Hart
should score well in the back
stroke and individual medley.
Bill Kee will also be a top threat
in the backstroke events. Sprint
ers and middle distance men
Morgan Manning, Paul Meyer,
and Jeff Hammett will be in line
for big points.
Gaughran sees all three fresh
man relays as possible victors.
The medley relay of Kee or Sie
bert, Roth, Nicolao, and Man
ning should go 3:32 or faster.
(Michigan won the NCAA's in
3:33.3) The frosh have already
posted NCAA freshman 400 free
relay records with seven dif
ferent sprinters participating.

ute spurts to win the 200, 500,
1650 freestyle and the 400 free
style relay. The victories made
Saari's ninth NCAA individual
championship.
The altitude of the Air Force
Academy (7250 feet) had little
effect on the 50 and 100 yard
sprints, but led to a 3-4 second
difference in the 200 yard races,
10-12 seconds in the 500, and
nearly 40 seconds in the 1650.
Only one NCAA record was

broken in the entire meet, as
Michigan State's Gary Dilley
swam 100 backstroke in 52.3, .3
below his own record and a full
second ahead of second place.
Indiana established a mark of
7:06.7 in the 800 free relay, a
new event this year.
Stanford entered the AAWU
Championships three weeks ago,
where it finished a dismal third
behind USC and UCLA. How
ever, the Indian's eggs were in
the big basket, as the tribe beat
UCLA by some 26 points in the
NCAA's.
In the individual events, Stan
ford took a second, a thud, two
fifths, an eighth, an eleventh,
and a twelfth. Stanford's med
ley relay placed sixth (3:36.6).
The Indian 400 free relay fin
ished fifth in 3:09.9, and the 800
free relay garnered a third with
a 7:10.4.

Bob Momsen streaked to a
2:14.8 (about 2:12.0 at sea level)
performance in the 200 breast
stroke to place second behind
USC's Wayne Anderson (2:14.3).
Momsen, a sophomore, started
swimming breaststroke only two
years age, switching from dis
tance freestyle.
Momsen hit 1:01.0 in Stan
ford's medley relay, which
placed sixth.
Mike Wall, also a sophomore,
was the tribe's chief point gath
erer. Wall pinned down fifth
place in the 500 freestyle after
qualifying in 4:52.4. In the 400
freestyle relay, Wall hit 48.3 for
one leg. Wall's biggest day, how
ever, came on the final night of
competition.
Stone Wall
Seeded twelfth in the 1650,
Wall did not swim with the final
heat. Wall churned out a 17:26.9
in the grueling race, swimming
in an outside lane with no one
to pace against. The time (about
16:45 here) gave him third be
hind Saari and Utah's Mike Gar
ibaldi.
Wall anchored the 800 free
style relay, the final event. Jim
Laney (1:47.3) led off. Bill Mey
er (1:51.3) dropped behind
Michigan, Indiana, and SMU.
Mark Parmely dropped in a
1:46.9 on the third leg, leaving
Stanford in fourth place, two
body lengths behind SMU.
Wall caught the SMU swim
mer with a length to go in the
race, and beat him in the home
stretch. Wall's time, an incredi
ble 1:45.1 after the 1650, was the
meet's fastest in the 800 relay,
being close to a 1:43.0 at sea
level.
Meyer Fifth in 50
Bill Meyer, a surprise at the
conference meet, was a wonder
at the NCAA's. Before the
AAWU meet, Meyer's best 50
freestyle was 22.6. Meyer earned
first place honors at the confer
ence meet with a 22.0.
Meyer hit 21.5 to qualify sixth
at the NCAA's, then moved up
a notch to take fifth in the fi
nals.
Meyer turned a 48.2 at the
AAWU's, bettering his previous
efforts by 1.4 second. The Stan
ford sophomore led off the 400
free relay in a sparkling 47.5,
setting the pace for a 3:09.9. In
the consolation finals at the
NCAA's, Meyer missed a turn to
place eleventh with a 48.1.
Bill Schubach, team captain
and only graduating senior from
the tribe's NCAA swimming
squad, started setting varsity
records at the AAWU's. Schu
back took second in the 100 back
stroke (55.6) and third in the
200 backstroke (2:04.3).
Schubach Backs Out
Schubach kept shaving off
tenths of seconds, leading the
400 medley relay in 55.0. In the
preliminaries of the 100 back
stroke, the Canton flash posted
a 54.7. A strained muscle slowed
him down to twelfth place in the
consolation finals.
Schubach came back the next
day to qualify 10th in the 200
backstroke. Schubach then

pulled to a 3:03.1 In the finals
to finish Bth in the nation.
Jim Laney, the only junior on
the NCAA squad, swam on all
three relays. Laney flashed to a
46.6 on the anchor leg of the 400
free relay to put the Cards be
low 3:10.0. In the medley relay,
Laney hit 51.4 for the 100 but
terfly leg. The junior from Phoe
nix led off the 800 free relay
with 1:47.3 (circa 1:45, elevation
zero).
Three Months Work
Laney returned from Stanford
In Germany late in December,
and had only three months to
get into shape after a 6 month
lay-off.
Mark Parmely, ill during the
conference meet, came through
with top performances in all
three relays. Parmely, a sopho
more, swam a 47.5 leg on the
400 free relay. Parmely's 1:46.9
leg of the 800 free relay put
Mike Wall within shooting dis
tance of SMU.
In the finals of the 400 medley
relay, Parmely severely bruised
both heels on his first turn, but
managed a 49.0 despite the acute
pain on the following two turns.
Freeman First in AAWU
Bill Freeman, senior diver,
aced the field of AAWU divers
in the low-board competition at
the conference meet. Freeman,
who returned after a year's ab
sence, took second in the 3 meter
competition.. Freeman placed
21st in a field of 45 in both divi
sions at the NCAA's.
Charlie Burbach took third in
the 400 yards individual medley
at the conference meet. He also
dropped his 200 IM time to
2:03.3, and his 200 breaststroke
time to 2:19.6. Burbach narrow
ly missed qualifying in the 400
IM at the NCAA's.

Doug Miller placed third at
the AAWU championships, but
mised the NCAA 200 butterfly
time (2:00.9) by half a second.
Bill Manoogian swam his best
200 fly by 5 seconds at the con
ference meet, finishing in 2:04.7.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
was overwhelmingly pleased
with the team's performance at
the NCAA's, noting the personal
"best-ever" performances for
every man in practically every
race.
Consistent Peak
Though other teams may have
come up with faster times in
places, Gaughran judged that no
team came up with the profu
sion of lifetime best perform
ances that Stanford competitors
consistently turned in.
Stanford was picked by Swim
ming World as ninth place be
fore the meet.
The Stanford Treshman team,
the best in the nation with two

world record holders and high
school All - Americans in 24
events, bettered 5 NCAA fresh
man records last season. Next
season, when joined with a var
sity that has already proved it
self of national caliber, the na
tion may have to reserve the
center lanes for the Indians.
Frosh Compete in AAU's
The freshman leave this week
for Tampa and the AAU Na
tional Championships. While
Stanford swimmers Momsen,
Wall, and national record-holder
Greg Buckingham cannot com
pete with the frosh on the same
team due to AAU-NCAA con
flicts, the freshman have an ex
cellent chance to win the meet.
Although complete funds have
not yet been raised, Gaughran
hopes to send nine competitors
to Florida. Dick Roth in the 200
and 400 individual medley and
Luis Nicolao in the 100 and 200
fly and 100 free, will be going
for gold medals.

Pete Siebert and Bob Hart
should score well in the back
stroke and individual medley.
Bill Kee will also be a top threat
in the backstroke events. Sprint
ers and middle distance men
Morgan Manning, Paul Meyer,
and Jeff Hammett will be in line
for big points.
Gaughran sees all three fresh
man relays as possible victors.
The medley relay of Kee or Sie
bert, Roth, Nicolao, and Man
ning should go 3:32 or faster.
(Michigan won the NCAA's in
3:33.3) The frosh have already
posted NCAA freshman 400 free
relay records with seven dif
ferent sprinters participating.
