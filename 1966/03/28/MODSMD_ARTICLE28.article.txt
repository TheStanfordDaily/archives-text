# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Negroes, Vietcong Are Human 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In answer to one of the ques
tions raised in a recent letter to
The Daily, I want to offer an ex
ploration of some connections be
tween domestic problems in civil
rights and foreign policy prob
lems in Vietnam. Difficulties in
both areas may arise from a fail
ure to see the people concerned
as primarily human whether it
be American Negroes or Vietna
mese. It is possible that, feeling
threatened at the thought of Ne
groes moving in next, door, or of
Communists "moving in" across
the Pacific, many Americans re
ject the idea without considering
what such changes would be like,
concretely. They may dismiss
both groups from thought by
labelling them "evil"—using as
evidence the violence of ghetto
Negroes or the Viet Cong. The
same label may be applied to all
Communists.
What this thinking excludes is
any empathy for the human be
ings involved. It overlooks the
fact that violence is not the na
ture of Negroes or Viet Cong.
Thny too want food and shelter,
respect from other people, and
the j>eace necessary to live as
they choose. Like white Ameri
cans, Negroes and Vietnamese
want time to be with the friends
and relatives they love. In these
ways they are like us—they are
human.
The main difference between
"us" (white middle-class Ameri
cans) and these people is that we
are lucky enough to have these
basic wanls satisfiod and they
are not. "We," as long as we sit
tight at home, have everything
we want—food, respect, no war.
This is, however, becoming less
and less true, the more "we" are
drafted for it deprives young
men of their fredom and affects
those near to the draftees, those
who love them and may never
see them again.
There are many important fac
tors in the Vietnam situation. I
emphasize here just this one—
that if unfamiliar people are
thought of concretely and sym
pathetically, our formal dealings
with them can be more just and
productive.

• Moral Judgments
Editor, The Daily:
It seems somewhat inconsist
ent for the SSRF to recognize
one type of moral judgment in
the present Health Service pol
icy, yet, not to admit the impli
cation of another type, in their
proposed policy. The SSRF is
certainly within its rights in not
advocating any particular sex
ual ethic.
However, when It does not
even consider the implications
of the sexual ethic in its pro
posed contraceptive policy, I
cannot believe that the Forum
is interested in promoting the
happiness of individuals direct
ly affected. Yet, it is this latter
criterion that is not only the
business of government and of
every benevolent institute, rath
er, it is the sole standard in con
formity to which each individual
ought to be directed to fashion
his behavior.
Vindication for adoption by
the Health Service of the pro

posed policy is possible only if
the implied sexual ethic does
indeed lead to g r e a t er long
range happiness. As long as
SSRF refuses to squarely face
this aspect of the social situa
tion, its statements, such as the
one appearing in the Daily, Feb.
25, though palatable, can be con
sidered only as caricatures of
the total social involvement. The
factual insufficiency and super
ficiality of the rather circumloc
tory nature of the statement,
leads one in turn to a superfi
cial view of the forum itself.
I find it humorous that the
forum advocates the distribu
tion to freshmen at registration
time a "concise booklet" on
"Methods of Birth Control" and
a statement describing the con
traceptive policy of the Health
Service. In the interest of total
social enlightenment with re
gards to the "basic facts of life,"
it would seem desirable that if
the administration adapts an
"informative motherly role" it
also destribute "concise book
lets" on Free - Love Relation
ships, Life of a Prostitute, Life
of a Mistress, and to round out
the social picture, Life of a
Wife.

Speaking with the admittedly
restricted experience of one who
taught medical students after
World War II as well as after
Korea, I reply to Mr. Carter
Harrison's letter (The Daily,
March 3) that neither conflict
generated a wave of scholarship
or anything resembling it in the
student body. Tht G.I. students
were older than the others, but
ageing is known to occur with
out benefit of service in the
armed forces. They were some
times more serious, but serious
students are not always better
students. They were often
plagued by increased family re
sponsibilities and a sense of lost
time. Both helped make them
rather more pragmatic than
more scholarly. Even if there
were some basis for Mr. Carter's
contention, would he not agree
that controlled slaughter of po
tential students is an undesir
able way of raising standards in
those who survive?

After being disgusted with
Stanford girls for a year and a
half, I feel compelled to issue
a written statement of my
thoughts. I expected to find
some drop in the overall attrac
tiveness of Stanford girls, com
pared to .the women I know in
my home state, Mississippi, but
the quality of the average Stan
ford girl is ridiculous. These
girls don't have a fraction of
the poise, grace, and social pres
ence of a Southern woman.
As a rule, Stanford girls (I
refuse to say Stanford women)
don't give any indication of a

knowledge of the rudiments of
proper social behavior; neither
do they demonstrate a desire to
learn those basic codes which
promulgate a much more enjoy
able social life. I find this a
truly deplorable situation.
The incident which drove me
to write this was the reception
of a shaft letter from a "Stan
ford Dolly" who stood me up
twice in one evening. The fol
lowing verbatim portions of
that letter will perhaps serve as
a commentary on an all-too
large percentage of the Stan
ford females.
Lanny,
Forgive me if you can for
breaking not just one but two
dates with you this evening. I
realize that your gracious
Southern girls would not do
such a thing, but then you
must realize, as I'm sure you
do now, that I'm not one of
them. I'm impulsive when I
see reason to be, and worst of
all, I'm So I
can't possibly be what you're
looking 1 for.
I was going to tell you this
after dinner, for I fully in
tended to come. Only I went
to a Civ movie this afternoon
so I could go to bed right aft
er dinner tonight (that's
where I am now —I slept all
of two hours last night). It
started at 4:15, and I thought
surely I would be back by
5:30 —but even after running
most of the way back I didn't
get here until 6:15.
Please don't be offended
that I consider my sleep and
tomorrow's midterm more im
portant than you.
Thank you for that unfor
gettable but "unrepeatable"
night in the city.
Sincerely,
"
My apologies to those few
Stanford women who lie outside
the realm of my generalizations.

In answer to one of the ques

The Daily, I want to offer an ex
ploration of some connections be
tween domestic problems in civil
rights and foreign policy prob
lems in Vietnam. Difficulties in
both areas may arise from a fail
ure to see the people concerned
as primarily human whether it
be American Negroes or Vietna
mese. It is possible that, feeling
threatened at the thought of Ne
groes moving in next, door, or of
Communists "moving in" across
the Pacific, many Americans re
ject the idea without considering
what such changes would be like,
concretely. They may dismiss
both groups from thought by
labelling them "evil"—using as
evidence the violence of ghetto
Negroes or the Viet Cong. The
same label may be applied to all
Communists.
What this thinking excludes is
any empathy for the human be
ings involved. It overlooks the
fact that violence is not the na
ture of Negroes or Viet Cong.
Thny too want food and shelter,
respect from other people, and
the j>eace necessary to live as
they choose. Like white Ameri
cans, Negroes and Vietnamese
want time to be with the friends
and relatives they love. In these
ways they are like us—they are
human.
The main difference between
"us" (white middle-class Ameri
cans) and these people is that we
are lucky enough to have these
basic wanls satisfiod and they
are not. "We," as long as we sit
tight at home, have everything
we want—food, respect, no war.
This is, however, becoming less
and less true, the more "we" are
drafted for it deprives young
men of their fredom and affects
those near to the draftees, those
who love them and may never

There are many important fac

In answer to one of the ques

The Daily, I want to offer an ex
ploration of some connections be
tween domestic problems in civil
rights and foreign policy prob
lems in Vietnam. Difficulties in
both areas may arise from a fail
ure to see the people concerned
as primarily human whether it
be American Negroes or Vietna
mese. It is possible that, feeling
threatened at the thought of Ne
groes moving in next, door, or of
Communists "moving in" across
the Pacific, many Americans re
ject the idea without considering
what such changes would be like,
concretely. They may dismiss
both groups from thought by
labelling them "evil"—using as
evidence the violence of ghetto
Negroes or the Viet Cong. The
same label may be applied to all
Communists.
What this thinking excludes is
any empathy for the human be
ings involved. It overlooks the
fact that violence is not the na
ture of Negroes or Viet Cong.
Thny too want food and shelter,
respect from other people, and
the j>eace necessary to live as
they choose. Like white Ameri
cans, Negroes and Vietnamese
want time to be with the friends
and relatives they love. In these
ways they are like us—they are
human.
The main difference between
"us" (white middle-class Ameri
cans) and these people is that we
are lucky enough to have these
basic wanls satisfiod and they
are not. "We," as long as we sit
tight at home, have everything
we want—food, respect, no war.
This is, however, becoming less

drafted for it deprives young
men of their fredom and affects
those near to the draftees, those
who love them and may never

It seems somewhat inconsist

cannot believe that the Forum

Vindication for adoption by

such a thing, but then you
must realize, as I'm sure you

to a Civ movie this afternoon

of two hours last night). It
started at 4:15, and I thought
surely I would be back by

In answer to one of the ques
tions raised in a recent letter to
The Daily, I want to offer an ex
ploration of some connections be
tween domestic problems in civil
rights and foreign policy prob
lems in Vietnam. Difficulties in
both areas may arise from a fail
ure to see the people concerned
as primarily human whether it
be American Negroes or Vietna
mese. It is possible that, feeling
threatened at the thought of Ne
groes moving in next, door, or of
Communists "moving in" across
the Pacific, many Americans re
ject the idea without considering
what such changes would be like,
concretely. They may dismiss
both groups from thought by
labelling them "evil"—using as
evidence the violence of ghetto
Negroes or the Viet Cong. The
same label may be applied to all
Communists.
What this thinking excludes is
any empathy for the human be
ings involved. It overlooks the
fact that violence is not the na
ture of Negroes or Viet Cong.
Thny too want food and shelter,
respect from other people, and
the j>eace necessary to live as
they choose. Like white Ameri
cans, Negroes and Vietnamese
want time to be with the friends
and relatives they love. In these
ways they are like us—they are
human.
The main difference between
"us" (white middle-class Ameri
cans) and these people is that we
are lucky enough to have these
basic wanls satisfiod and they
are not. "We," as long as we sit
tight at home, have everything
we want—food, respect, no war.
This is, however, becoming less
and less true, the more "we" are
drafted for it deprives young
men of their fredom and affects
those near to the draftees, those
who love them and may never
see them again.
There are many important fac
tors in the Vietnam situation. I
emphasize here just this one—
that if unfamiliar people are
thought of concretely and sym
pathetically, our formal dealings
with them can be more just and

It seems somewhat inconsist
ent for the SSRF to recognize
one type of moral judgment in
the present Health Service pol
icy, yet, not to admit the impli
cation of another type, in their
proposed policy. The SSRF is
certainly within its rights in not
advocating any particular sex
ual ethic.
However, when It does not
even consider the implications
of the sexual ethic in its pro
posed contraceptive policy, I
cannot believe that the Forum
is interested in promoting the
happiness of individuals direct
ly affected. Yet, it is this latter
criterion that is not only the
business of government and of
every benevolent institute, rath
er, it is the sole standard in con
formity to which each individual
ought to be directed to fashion
his behavior.
Vindication for adoption by
the Health Service of the pro

posed policy is possible only if
the implied sexual ethic does
indeed lead to g r e a t er long
range happiness. As long as
SSRF refuses to squarely face
this aspect of the social situa
tion, its statements, such as the
one appearing in the Daily, Feb.
25, though palatable, can be con
sidered only as caricatures of
the total social involvement. The
factual insufficiency and super
ficiality of the rather circumloc
tory nature of the statement,
leads one in turn to a superfi
cial view of the forum itself.
I find it humorous that the
forum advocates the distribu
tion to freshmen at registration
time a "concise booklet" on
"Methods of Birth Control" and
a statement describing the con
traceptive policy of the Health
Service. In the interest of total
social enlightenment with re
gards to the "basic facts of life,"
it would seem desirable that if
the administration adapts an
"informative motherly role" it
also destribute "concise book
lets" on Free - Love Relation
ships, Life of a Prostitute, Life
of a Mistress, and to round out
the social picture, Life of a

were older than the others, but
ageing is known to occur with

After being disgusted with
Stanford girls for a year and a

a written statement of my
thoughts. I expected to find
some drop in the overall attrac
tiveness of Stanford girls, com
pared to .the women I know in
my home state, Mississippi, but
the quality of the average Stan
ford girl is ridiculous. These
girls don't have a fraction of
the poise, grace, and social pres
ence of a Southern woman.
As a rule, Stanford girls (I
refuse to say Stanford women)
don't give any indication of a

knowledge of the rudiments of
proper social behavior; neither
do they demonstrate a desire to
learn those basic codes which
promulgate a much more enjoy
able social life. I find this a
truly deplorable situation.
The incident which drove me
to write this was the reception
of a shaft letter from a "Stan
ford Dolly" who stood me up
twice in one evening. The fol
lowing verbatim portions of
that letter will perhaps serve as
a commentary on an all-too
large percentage of the Stan
ford females.
Lanny,
Forgive me if you can for
breaking not just one but two
dates with you this evening. I
realize that your gracious
Southern girls would not do
such a thing, but then you
must realize, as I'm sure you
do now, that I'm not one of
them. I'm impulsive when I
see reason to be, and worst of
all, I'm So I
can't possibly be what you're
looking 1 for.
I was going to tell you this
after dinner, for I fully in
tended to come. Only I went
to a Civ movie this afternoon
so I could go to bed right aft
er dinner tonight (that's
where I am now —I slept all
of two hours last night). It
started at 4:15, and I thought
surely I would be back by
5:30 —but even after running
most of the way back I didn't
get here until 6:15.
Please don't be offended
that I consider my sleep and
tomorrow's midterm more im
portant than you.
Thank you for that unfor
gettable but "unrepeatable"
night in the city.
Sincerely,
"
