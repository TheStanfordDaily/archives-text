# The
						Capitol Scene
## Wooden Horse, Machines Star In Automatic Circus 
### Art Bucbwald 
I went to the Ringling Bros,
and Barnum and Bailey Circus
last week with my children and
was shocked to discover that in
the age of automation the circus
was still going along with old
fashioned, out moded methods of
operation.
As I sat there and watched
the cast of over 100 people, not
to mention the people behind
the scenes, I couldn't help think
ing what the circus really need
ed was a good management con
sultant who could trim the man
power and make the show far
more efficient.
Consultation
I can just hear him talking to
John .Ringling North.
"Now Mr. North, I've made a
study of your circus and you're
in trouble, people-wise, that is."
"How do you mean?
"Well, let's take the trapeze
acts as an example. You've got
six men and two women work
ing two rings at the same time.
I think you could cut this down
to one ring, one woman, and one
man."
"But you need a third man to
catch the woman when she does
a flip."
"You can install a computer
which will be synchronized to
the trapeze. It will be right
where the woman artist wants
it to be when she flies through
the air. If it works well, you
might even be able to do with
out the man."
"What else?"
Lion Around
"Well, I noticed, in your lion
act, five of the lions are sitting
around in the cage while the
sixth lion is performing. There
really doesn't seem to be need
for all six lions."
"But each lion has a different
trick."
"You could teach one lion all
the tricks. I did a time study on
them and I discovered that, for
every minute they worked, the
lions took three minutes doing
nothing. This is a waste of lion
power."
"I don't want to argue with
you, but one of the things that
makes that act is that the train
er is in there with six lions. If
he was only in there with one
lion, there would be no danger
as far as the audience is con
cerned."
Sonnd Effects
"We could play a tape over a
loudspeaker during the act
which would make it sound as
if there were 12 lions in the ring.
Now I want to talk to you about
that Siberian tiger that rides a
horse."
"Don't tell me you want to get
rid of the tiger?"
"No, I want to red rid of the
horse. Why can't the tiger ride
a wooden horse? I seems to me
people are more interested in
watching the tiger than the
horse."
"But the whole idea is a live
tiger is riding a live horse. If
we make it a wooden horse, the
circus fans will object."
Boxers
"They will at first, but they'll
get used to it. Now about those
boxing bears. I think you only
need one."
"How can you have just one
bear fight?"
"What's the matter? Haven't
you ever heard of shadow box
ing?"
"What other suggestions do
you have?"
"You have too many juggling
acts. We have a machine that
can juggle twice as many bowl
ing pins in half the time. We
can speed up the whole oper
ation and, at the same time, put
a lot more balls in the air."
"I suppose you want me to cut
down on the clowns, too?"
"I was coming to that. My
study shows you can easily get
by with two clowns."
"But how do you make the
people laugh with just
clowns?"

"You install a laugh track
over the loudspeaker system. It
will sound as if you have 50
clowns.."
"If it's all the same to you, I
think I'll stick with what I've
got now."
"That's all right with me, Mr.
North. But you'd better realize
we're living in a computer age,
and if you keep using people in
your circus, you're going to lose
your shirt."
