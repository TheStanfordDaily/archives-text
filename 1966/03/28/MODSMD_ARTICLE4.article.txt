# SSRF, Army To Invade Pavilion
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
A battery of tables in front of the
Pavilion will be peddling everything
from sexual rights to Senior Ball tick
ets during registration today.
The Stanford Sexual Rights Forum
is seeking signatures for a new pe
tit ion calling for a by-laws change
that would abolish women's social reg
ulations after first quarter freshman
year and make sign-outs voluntary.
The SSRF has already obtained
enough signatures (575) on another
petition concerning Health Service
contraceptive policies to bring the
matter to a student vote, but this pe
tition will also be at the pavillion.
As part of the new campaign to
abolish social regs, The SSRF will in
troduce a bill for the same by-laws
change called for on the petition at
Thursday's Legislature meeing.
Conflict In Law
According to LASSU speaker Jay
Kadane, a by-laws change either as a
result of the referendum or the bill
would create a conflict in law with
present regulations.
"The changes made this year," says
SSRF President Jim Say re, "have
proved quite workable and a further
evolution in this direction would be
equally successful. It is completely
hypocritical for the girls to have
hours and not the guys.
"We believe Stanford women are
capable of acting as adults." he add
ed.
'Unbutton' Button
Another table set up by the Cali
fornia Committee to Legalize Abor
tion, a sub-committee of the SSRF,
will seek support for the repeal of
sections of the state penal code which
outlaw abortion.
The SSRF will also be selling lapel

buttons which read "Unbutton," "Co
pulate for Co-existence," and "Make
Love, Not War."
The Forum has recently revised its
statement of principles, saying among
other things, that the campus co-ed
residence apartments should be estab
lished in which residents have a room
mate of the opposite sex.
The Walter Army Society will also
be on hand today to sign up volunteer
blood donors in its second blood drive
in support of the U. S. commitment in
Vietnam. Blood will be taken from
the donors by the Amrican Red Cross
Tuesday, April 12 from 9 a.m. to 4
p. m. in the Old Union.
During the first drive in Autumn
Quarter, the Walter Army Society
collected 222 pints of blood for the
Defense Department, and received
commendation from several top U.S.
officials.
Blood drives, according to Com
manding General W. C. Westmoreland
of the U. S. Army in Vietnam, "have
more than offset the negative actions
of an uninformed minority."
Members of the Stanford Young
Democrats will be stationed at a table
to promote the campaign of Edward
Keating, who is running for the Dem
ocratic nomination as U.S. Represen
tative from the 11th Congressional
District (San Mateo County), as well
as that of congressional aspirant
George Leppert of Santa Clara Coun

mal," and the creator of the Peanuts
comic strip, Charles Schulz, has been
