# Board May Alter Liquor Rule
## 
### JON ROISE Editor 
Stanford may be legally wet by the
end of the year.
The Trustees received a report at
their March meeting proposing that
campus liquor policy "conform to the
law of the State of California"—and,
according to qualified sources,
chances are good that some version of
the proposal will be adopted at the
Board's next meeting on April 21.
The report, prepared for President
Wallace Sterling by the University's
Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee (SASC) and approved by the
Committee of Fifteen, would allow
students over 21 to drink alcoholic
beverages in residences and eating
clubs.
Also included in the report are sug
gestions that University authorities
"seriously consider" taking an active
role in encouraging the State of Cali
fornia to lower the drinking age from
21 to 18, and study the possibility of
establishing a campus Rathskeller
which would serve beer and wine.
But. according to Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
"it is not clear that the proposals will
be adopted.
"It's going to be up to President

Sterling as to what form the recom
mendations will be in," he said. Wert
explained that the President would
prepare a formal recommendation for
the Board's consideration.
Both Sterlfng and Wert have said
that if the Trustees revise the present
liquor regulations, the new policy
would be implemented before the end
of the year.
SASC's review of liquor policy, the
fourth such study in the last eight
years, was initiated last fall after
Dean of Students H. Donald Winbig
ler, noting that the Board of Trustees
had been reviewing the liquor situa
tion, sent Dean Wert a letter which
said:
"It is now time once again to en
gage faculty and students in such
discussions and to develop recommen
dations which the President of the
University can present to the Trus
tees."

The report presented to the Board
is the outgrowth of that letter. It
was approved unanimously by the
Committee of 15 March 11 and copies
of it were distributed to each of the
Trustees March 17.
SASC's report cites present liquor
policy as being "both unenforced and

perhaps unenforceable," and notes
that "a more practical policy would
at least reduce the hypocrisy inherent
and all too evident in the present
one."
But, while advocating the adoption
of a more liberal policy, the report
stresses "the great importance of all
students accepting in good faith the
essential responsibility of self-regula
tion and of avoiding . . . abuse of the
intent and spirit" of the new pro
posals.
Student Enforcement
If regulations were revised, the re
port would have responsibility for en
forcement placed with the student
judicial councils. As a result of a
1962 referendum in which students
voted by a four-to-one margin that
the University's rules "shall be in
with state law," ASSU
judicial councils cannot at present
legally enforce most of the Univers
ity's liquor regulations.
Long-standing University regula
tions prohibit the possession, trans
portation, or use of intoxicating liq
uors by Stanford students in the Uni
versity community. Liquor is legally
permitted only in faculty homos, mar
ried students housing in Escondido
Village, and the newly-built Faculty
Club.

SASC's report cites present liquor
policy as being "both unenforced and

perhaps unenforceable," and notes
that "a more practical policy would
at least reduce the hypocrisy inherent
and all too evident in the present
one."
But, while advocating the adoption
of a more liberal policy, the report
stresses "the great importance of all
students accepting in good faith the
essential responsibility of self-regula
tion and of avoiding . . . abuse of the
intent and spirit" of the new pro
posals.

If regulations were revised, the re
port would have responsibility for en
forcement placed with the student
judicial councils. As a result of a
1962 referendum in which students
voted by a four-to-one margin that
the University's rules "shall be in
with state law," ASSU
judicial councils cannot at present
legally enforce most of the Univers
ity's liquor regulations.
Long-standing University regula
tions prohibit the possession, trans
portation, or use of intoxicating liq
uors by Stanford students in the Uni
versity community. Liquor is legally
permitted only in faculty homos, mar
ried students housing in Escondido
Village, and the newly-built Faculty
Club.
Stanford may be legally wet by the
end of the year.
The Trustees received a report at
their March meeting proposing that
campus liquor policy "conform to the
law of the State of California"—and,
according to qualified sources,
chances are good that some version of
the proposal will be adopted at the
Board's next meeting on April 21.
The report, prepared for President
Wallace Sterling by the University's
Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee (SASC) and approved by the
Committee of Fifteen, would allow
students over 21 to drink alcoholic
beverages in residences and eating
clubs.
Also included in the report are sug
gestions that University authorities
"seriously consider" taking an active
role in encouraging the State of Cali
fornia to lower the drinking age from
21 to 18, and study the possibility of
establishing a campus Rathskeller
which would serve beer and wine.
But. according to Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
"it is not clear that the proposals will
be adopted.
"It's going to be up to President

Sterling as to what form the recom
mendations will be in," he said. Wert
explained that the President would
prepare a formal recommendation for
the Board's consideration.
Both Sterlfng and Wert have said
that if the Trustees revise the present
liquor regulations, the new policy
would be implemented before the end
of the year.
SASC's review of liquor policy, the
fourth such study in the last eight
years, was initiated last fall after
Dean of Students H. Donald Winbig
ler, noting that the Board of Trustees
had been reviewing the liquor situa
tion, sent Dean Wert a letter which
said:
"It is now time once again to en
gage faculty and students in such
discussions and to develop recommen
dations which the President of the
University can present to the Trus
tees."
