# Professor Napier Of Yale Accepts New Chapel Post
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
B. Davie Napier of the Yale Divin
ity School has been appointed Dean
of the Chapel here effective next fall,
Stanford President Wallace Sterling
has announced.
In this new position, created as part
of an overall expansion of Stanford's
religious programs, Prof. Napier will
take charge of Memorial Church and
related religious programs and activi
ties.
The Rev. Robert M. Minto, as chap
lain of the University, has been in
charge of these activities for the last
nineteen years. Minto, who will re
main as chaplain, plans to take a sab
batical leave next year.
Free Hand
"I am going to Stanford," Napier
told the Yale Daily News March 18,
"because it offers the kind of oppor
tunity that a man of my training and
experience and disposition cannot re
fuse."
"I go with some excitement," he
continued, "because I will have a free
hand and a fully adequate budget to
create a new, unified, ecumenical
ministry."
â€¢ Commenting on the appointment,
Minto said: "Since receiving the $1.2
million Berry gift, there has been
much discussion on the new fields
of development opened up in the total
religious program of the University.
The appointment of a Dean of the
Chapel is the culmination of that
planning.
"A considerably widened and varied
program is envisaged ,with a much
greater emphasis on the function of
the University pulpit.
Unique Talent
"Prof. Napier brings a unique tal
ent to a challenging situation and I
look forward to working with him,"
the chaplain concluded.
"We are delighted that he is com
ing," commented Dean Richard Ly
man, chairman of the Presidential
Advisory Committee on Religious Ac
tivities and a member of the search
committee which brought Napier to
Stanford. "He brings varied exper
ience to this post and he will strength
en campus life in general."
Napier is Holmes professor of Old
Testament criticism and interpreta
tion and master of Calhoun College
at Yale. As master, he is responsible
for approximately 75 freshmen, 250
upperclass residents, and 60 to 80
faculty fellows of the college.
Persistent Topic
He is an ordained Congregational
ist minister and has served as chap
lain at Alfred University from 1944-
46 as head of the department of re
ligion at the University of Georgia

from 1946-49. He moved to Yale in
1949.
Religion has been a persistent topic
of discussion at Stanford in recent
years, which two years ago promted
the appointment of the Presidential
Committee on Religion under Dean
Lyman. This action followed publica
tion by the Daily and LASSU of a
report on religion and reception by
the University of the gift of Alumnus
Lowell Berry.
The report stated: "It is apparent
that religion at Stanford is not now
meeting student needs. Both the op
portunity for changes and increases
in the entire religious program and
policy are very much in order." The

report recommended that worship by
all denominations be allowed on cam
pus.
Berry Gift
The Berry gift was made "for ex
pansion of Memorial Church and re
lated activities."
Study of the religious situation at
Stanford and a discussion of an ap
propriate use of the Berry money has
occupied the Committee for the past
year. In accordance with committee
recommendations, the Board of Trus
tees in February approved the hold
ing of sectarian worship services on
campus on a trial basis.
No announcement has been made
as to when services will begin.
