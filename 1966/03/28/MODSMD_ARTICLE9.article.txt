# All Men Urged To Register For Selective Service Test
## 
### MIKE ROSTER Associate Editor 
For Stanford males there's an extra
step recommended for today's regis
tration—applying for the Selective
Service test. A table with applica
tions will be located outside the pa
vilion, and University officials have
urged students to complete the forms
today and mail them promptly.
Applicants will be assigned to test
ing centers on a first-come first-serve
basis, according to Dr. John D. Black,
director of the Counseling and Test
ing Center, who has been designated
by Stanford to direct the massive test
ing operation.
"We have agreed to test as many as
3000 students on May 14 and another
3000 on May 21," Black explained,
"but there is no way we can exclude
students from other colleges in the
area if they get their applications in
ahead of our own students."
Stanford, which is Center No. 584,
will administer the test on only the
first two dates because the third test
ing session—June 3- is the first day
of finals and no adequate testing
space is available. Students may leave
the third date on the application form
blank.
Late Registrants
Students who register late may
pick up application blanks at the
Registrar's Office. Thereafter they
will be available at the Counseling
and Testing Center and at the Na
tional Service Office.
Walter Findeisen, National Service
Officer, has estimated that about
6000 Stanford students are registered

with draft boards and has urged that
all of them take the test, which will
be used by local boards in deciding
upon student deferments.
Just how local boards will use the
test is left to their discretion though
Stanford officials have urged Selec
tive Service Director Hershey to issue
guidelines.
"The selective service test used in
1951 was designed so that a score of
70 was equal to the average score
made by college freshmen who took
a well-known scholastic aptitude test
and students scoring above that were
recommended for deferments," Black
said.
"We were able to predict at that
time that 90 percent of our students
would score above 70, and if the same
standards prevail this time, I would
estimate that at least 98 per cent
will do so."
Superior Scores
Black estimates "conservatively"
that about three-fourths of male Stan
ford undergraduates should earn
scores in the upper 15 per cent of all
those who take the test and about
half should score in the upper 7 per
cent.
"This fact is important because if
some local boards pay limited atten
tion to the test they can hardly fail
to be impressed by very superior
scores," Black said.
During the Korean War it was
especially important for seniors hop
ing to do graduate work to take the
test in order to be considered for a
continuation of their deferments after
the June graduation.
Each of the two testing sessions
here will require from 20 to 30 test
administrators and as many as 75
proctors, Black said. Detailed arrange
ments are being made by Guy Brown
ing of the Counseling and Testing
Center and Findeisen.
