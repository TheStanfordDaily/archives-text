Want to go
50/50 on a
TWA jet?
If you're under 22,
TWA 50/50 Club
tmt* half fare.
You can get 60S off the regular Jet Coach fare when you fly TWA
in the U.S. If you're between 12 and 22, fill out the form below and
take it with proof of age to any TWA office. Buy your membership
card for $3—and the sky's the limit. You fly on a stand-by basis—
except for the few days listed below. Note: if you have an ID card
from another airline, we'll honor that, too.
And remember, even though you're going for half fare, you get
full service-meals and all. Questions? Call your TWA campus rep
resentative, George Mayer, at 323-8550. We're your kind of airline.
