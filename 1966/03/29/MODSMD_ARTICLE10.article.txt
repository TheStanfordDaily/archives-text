# Rush A-Go-Go: Some Questions And Answers
## 
### 
With the first week of spring
quarter comes the time when
freshmen must consider where
they will live their next three
years at Stanford. Eating club
and fraternity bids are ex
tended, and applications for
Stern houses are accepted.
To help explain the rush process
in areas where the rush books
skim only the surface, Daily As
sociate Editor Michael Roster
has compiled a list of questions
from freshmen and recorded re
sponses from club, fraternity,
and Stern officers.
★ ★ ★
What is the rush schedule dur
ing the first two weeks?
Open houses are Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday this
week from 7:15 to 9:30. Off cam
pus contact (generally for par
ties) is allowed Thursday night,
Friday, and Saturday only. Open
contact on campus, except in

freshmen houses, continues
throughout the quarter. During
the first week, no more than one
upperclassman may be in a
freshman's room—at the speci
fied times between 7 p. m. to 11
p. m. Between Sunday and Fri
day of next week there is no
contact in Wilbur or Stern.
Bids may be given out any
time beginning with the first
rush party. Bid cards may not
be signed until the second week
at Tresidder 236 Monday and
Tuesday or any time later at
the Dean of Students office.
Once a student signs a bid card
he is recognized as a pledge and
is permitted unlimited off-cam
pus contact.
★ ★ ★
How are applications to Stern
handled?
Openings next year will prob
ably be limited to 100 or 150.
Signups will be one day only—

the same day when students
may sign bid cards next Mon
day. The order in which stu
dents sign the list will deter
mine their placement. Prefer
ences for houses may be indi
cated, and Stern applicants may
also sign in groups.
★ ★ ★
When will party invitation be
given out, and how many will
each group distribute?
Most party invitations will be
mailed Sunday, March 27, and
will have arrived by today. Invi
tations may be handed out any
time prior to a party, and it is
not unusual for a freshman who
has never been to a house before
to receive an invitation at an
open house or later in the mail.
Fraternities and clubs distribute
an undefined number of invita
tions—depending on how many
men they feel they need in their
pledge class, how many they

feel will come if invited, and
how many they know.
★ ★ ★
Can a person get a party in
vitation if he is not sent one?
The only way is by the impres
sion he makes on various mem
bers. If the freshman does not
receive an invitation and no one
speaks to him about it, then it
would be poor policy to ask for
one. The freshman might get
to a party that way but certain
ly would not have helped his
cause. If a freshman is the close
friend of a man a house or club
is rushing strongly, he might
ask that man to look into his
chances; if the inquiry comes
from an individual the house
likes, it could only help.
★ ★ ★
What are the chances of being
bid if a person doesn't receive an
invitation?
Chances of being bid, having
never received an invitation, are
generally pretty slim but vary
extremely depending on circum
stances. A freshman may not
have had enough exposure and
consequently the house or club
may not know him at the time
of parties. Should he becomc
known after this, his chances
are the same as anyone else's.
★ ★ ★
What should a person do if
he Is invited to several parties
on the same night?
First night invitations (Thurs
day) are generally considered
the most important to a club or
house. If a freshman comes to
one group's party first, the as
sumption is usually that it is

the one he prefers. It is rare,
however, for a house or club to
hold it against a freshman for
not coming to a party, particu
larly if he has a valid excuse.
Since acceptances to party invi
tations are viewed as an expres
sion of preferences, however, it
would be intelligent to choose
carefully.
★ ★ ★
Should freshmen bring date*
to parties?
Clubs and fraternities gener
ally supply the dates—if the par
ty is a date function. The invi
tations will usually mention
something about this, but if
there is any doubt just ask the
group involved.
★ ★ ★
For how long is it possible to
get a bid?
Bids may be given out any
time — right through a man's
senior year.
★ ★ ★
How many men will a club
fraternity bid?
This, like a number of invi
tations, depends entirely on the
size of pledge class desired and
the expected return on bids of
fered. A good gauge is the num
ber of seniors who will be leav
ing next year.
★ ★ ★
Do members pledged help de
cide the rest of the pledge class?
It Is not unusual for a group
to solicit opinions and ideas
from freshmen once they have
indicated their preference. This

all depends on varying club and
house policies.
★ ★ ★
What is the significance of
imitations to dinner?
They generally mean the club
or house wants to get to know
the student better, indicating he
has made a good impression on
at least some members.
★ ★ ★
Can a student go to a club or
house for the first time this
quarter?
By all means, yes. It might de
crease chances of exposure to
groups already visited; but
aside from that, there is no prob
lem. The format is the same as
last quarter's open houses.
Can a freshman just "drop In"
at clubs or houses in order to see
what life is like when members
aren't in coat and tie and trying
to impress rushees?
They can, but unless they
know someone in the c lub or
house first, it probably wouldn't
be a very good idea. But if the
freshman does know someone,
then going up when the house
is more relaxed would generally
work in the rushee's favor both
for more exposure as well as to
get a better impression of what
the group is really like.
★ ★ ★
How does a fraternity or club
let a freshman know it Isn't go
ing to bid him and he should
concentrate on some other
group?
Generally, someone in the

group will take the rushee aside
and tell him, but this varies
widely with the type of houses.
Most groups are still under the
one-ding system — meaning one
negative vote will block every
one else's positive vote. Some
groups have modified the sys
tems, however, to one of balanc
ing votes, reducing senior mem
bers' strength, or similar meth
ods. Sometimes it is possible for
a member to remove his ding,
and some houses and clubs make
special efforts to allow such
change.
