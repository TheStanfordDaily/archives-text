## Jenks Wins Championship 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
A recent selection as "Stan
ford's Athlete of the Month"
boxer Tom Jenks fought his
way to the conference cham
pionship in the 172-pound divi
sion in Reno last weekend. Tom
was the only Stanford boxer
entered in the competition.
In his initial bout in the Cali
fornia Collegiate Boxing Confer
ence Championships Jenks de
feated Cal's Dave Archibald by

a unanimous decision. Archibald
was previously undefeated and
went into the match a heavy fa
vorite.
Jenks, however, used his right
crosses and jabs to keep Archi
bald on the defensive through
out the fight. Archibald went to
the mat for a nine count in the
third round.
Sent Foes to Mat
Jenks was also effective in
the finals, sending his opponent
again to the mat for a nine

count in the second round. Jenks
won the fight by a unanimous
decision.
Stanford's boxing Coach Ray
Lunny was indeed pleased with
Jenk s victory and stated that it
was too bad some of Stanford's
other boxers did not choose to
participate in the champion
ships.
Lunny said that several of the
champs crowned at Reno had
been previously defeated by
Stanford boxers. The tourna-

ment was held during spring
break and most of Stanford's
boxers decided to pass it up and
spend their vacation elsewhere.
First Season of Boxing
This was Jenk's first season
of boxing but revealed consider
able poise and boxing ability
throughout the season. Jenks
won five of his six bouts and
defeated Raley Beckett of Ne
vada in the finals of the Confer
ence Championships, only boxer
to defeat him all season. Sweet
revenge for Stanford's sopho
more scrapper.
Jenks registered two TKO's
during the season which illus
strates the power of Jenk's
punches. However, defense also
was an important element in
building Jenks into champion
ship calibre.
Jenks will certainly form a
big block out of which Coach
Lunny will mold his varsity

squad next year. However, this
year's team although not com
piling an impressive win-loss
record was composed of mainly
young, inexperienced bo x e r s
who, like Jenks, blossomed into
promising boxers.
George Bellows, who was elect
ed captain of this year's team,
was the only senior o"n the var
sity squad.

shown at the 43rd Annual NCAA Swimming and Diving Champion
ships at the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colo. Sixty teams with a total
of more than 300 swimmers and divers took part in the threo-day
meet. Stanford finished In sixth place.
A recent selection as "Stan
ford's Athlete of the Month"
boxer Tom Jenks fought his
way to the conference cham
pionship in the 172-pound divi
sion in Reno last weekend. Tom
was the only Stanford boxer
entered in the competition.
In his initial bout in the Cali
fornia Collegiate Boxing Confer
ence Championships Jenks de
feated Cal's Dave Archibald by

a unanimous decision. Archibald
was previously undefeated and
went into the match a heavy fa
vorite.
Jenks, however, used his right
crosses and jabs to keep Archi
bald on the defensive through
out the fight. Archibald went to
the mat for a nine count in the
third round.
Sent Foes to Mat
Jenks was also effective in
the finals, sending his opponent
again to the mat for a nine

count in the second round. Jenks
won the fight by a unanimous
decision.
Stanford's boxing Coach Ray
Lunny was indeed pleased with
Jenk s victory and stated that it
was too bad some of Stanford's
other boxers did not choose to
participate in the champion
ships.
Lunny said that several of the
champs crowned at Reno had
been previously defeated by
Stanford boxers. The tourna-

ment was held during spring
break and most of Stanford's
boxers decided to pass it up and
spend their vacation elsewhere.
First Season of Boxing
This was Jenk's first season
of boxing but revealed consider
able poise and boxing ability
throughout the season. Jenks
won five of his six bouts and
defeated Raley Beckett of Ne
vada in the finals of the Confer
ence Championships, only boxer
to defeat him all season. Sweet
revenge for Stanford's sopho
more scrapper.
Jenks registered two TKO's
during the season which illus
strates the power of Jenk's
punches. However, defense also
was an important element in
building Jenks into champion
ship calibre.
Jenks will certainly form a
big block out of which Coach
Lunny will mold his varsity

squad next year. However, this
year's team although not com
piling an impressive win-loss
record was composed of mainly
young, inexperienced bo x e r s
who, like Jenks, blossomed into
promising boxers.
George Bellows, who was elect
ed captain of this year's team,
was the only senior o"n the var
sity squad.
