# 'Boozeland'—Or Reality?
## 
### 
As the news of impending change in Stan
ford's liquor policy spreads from the campus
into the greater society, the need for a real under
standing of the situation by the public will no
doubt become acute.
We have not yet seen the headlines of this
morning's Chronicle, but we would guess that
the story of "Stanford s Bold Step Into Booze
land" has been played to its sensational hilt. The
Little Old Ladies of Palo Alto are no doubt
already organizing a mass mail-in to be directed
to President Sterling's office, and some Stanford
parents, with newspaper in one hand and martini
in the other, will soon be recoiling in amazement
at the audacity—or rather impending audacity
—of the Board of Trustees.
Through all this commotion, the real point
will be missed. A change in Stanford's anachron
istic liquor policy would not transform the Uni
versity into a Bacchanal drinking den. Rather,
it would simply be a recognition of reality. To
bring campus liquor policy into conformity with
state law, as is proposed by the report of the
University's Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee (SASC), would end the present hypocrisy
of having the administration say one tiling and
permit another. The present policy, in the words
of the Committee, "is both unenforced and per
haps even unenforceable."
The fact, as anyone who is associated with
the University community well knows, is that
students already imbibe. For more than three
out of four Stanford men and women "drinking
is well established . . . even at the time they enter
Stanford,' according to a live-year student-de
velopment study conducted by Stanford's Insti
tute for the Study of Human Problems. A few

of them drink because of "the mystique that
Stanford students, particularly men, are reported
to have created around the 'manly' aura of drink
ing, especially of drinking to excess." But for
most students, the reason is simply that drinking
"is apparently sanctioned by their peers, their
parents, and society."
If the policy were to change, we doubt that
total student consumption of alcohol would rise
by more than a keg. The only real changes that
would result would be beneficial. Fraternity
parties could be held on campus instead of off,
reducing the amount of "under the influence"
driving. A revised policy, according to the re
port, would encourage more students to live on
campus, thus furthering Stanford's goal of being
a "residence university." And perhaps most im
portantly, a less hypocritical policy would, in
the words of SASC, "increase students' respect
for the University's policies governing other
aspects of student conduct."
We congratulate the Student Affairs and
Services Committee on its comprehensive and
realistic study and on the cogent report that
resulted from it. It is encouraging that students
had a voice in its formulation, both at the Com
mittee's level and in the Committee of Fifteen.
We hope that the Board of Trustees will, in its
wisdom, see the need for the change within the
University, and will pay no more than cursory
attention to the expected clamor from that great
majority of the public which has no conception
of conditions at Stanford. And lastly, we hope,
somewhat futilely, that the greater society, and
especially the public press, will make an effort
to see beyond sensationalism into the real need
and true desirability of a modernization of Stan
ford's liquor policy.

a "residence university." And perhaps most im
portantly, a less hypocritical policy would, in
the words of SASC, "increase students' respect
for the University's policies governing other
aspects of student conduct."
We congratulate the Student Affairs and
Services Committee on its comprehensive and
realistic study and on the cogent report that
resulted from it. It is encouraging that students
had a voice in its formulation, both at the Com
mittee's level and in the Committee of Fifteen.
We hope that the Board of Trustees will, in its
wisdom, see the need for the change within the
University, and will pay no more than cursory
attention to the expected clamor from that great
majority of the public which has no conception
of conditions at Stanford. And lastly, we hope,
somewhat futilely, that the greater society, and
especially the public press, will make an effort
to see beyond sensationalism into the real need
and true desirability of a modernization of Stan
ford's liquor policy.
As the news of impending change in Stan
ford's liquor policy spreads from the campus
into the greater society, the need for a real under
standing of the situation by the public will no
doubt become acute.
We have not yet seen the headlines of this
morning's Chronicle, but we would guess that
the story of "Stanford s Bold Step Into Booze
land" has been played to its sensational hilt. The
Little Old Ladies of Palo Alto are no doubt
already organizing a mass mail-in to be directed
to President Sterling's office, and some Stanford
parents, with newspaper in one hand and martini
in the other, will soon be recoiling in amazement
at the audacity—or rather impending audacity
—of the Board of Trustees.
Through all this commotion, the real point
will be missed. A change in Stanford's anachron
istic liquor policy would not transform the Uni
versity into a Bacchanal drinking den. Rather,
it would simply be a recognition of reality. To
bring campus liquor policy into conformity with
state law, as is proposed by the report of the
University's Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee (SASC), would end the present hypocrisy
of having the administration say one tiling and
permit another. The present policy, in the words
of the Committee, "is both unenforced and per
haps even unenforceable."
The fact, as anyone who is associated with
the University community well knows, is that
students already imbibe. For more than three
out of four Stanford men and women "drinking
is well established . . . even at the time they enter
Stanford,' according to a live-year student-de
velopment study conducted by Stanford's Insti
tute for the Study of Human Problems. A few

of them drink because of "the mystique that
Stanford students, particularly men, are reported
to have created around the 'manly' aura of drink
ing, especially of drinking to excess." But for
most students, the reason is simply that drinking
"is apparently sanctioned by their peers, their
parents, and society."
If the policy were to change, we doubt that
total student consumption of alcohol would rise
by more than a keg. The only real changes that
would result would be beneficial. Fraternity
parties could be held on campus instead of off,
reducing the amount of "under the influence"
driving. A revised policy, according to the re
port, would encourage more students to live on
campus, thus furthering Stanford's goal of being
a "residence university." And perhaps most im
portantly, a less hypocritical policy would, in
the words of SASC, "increase students' respect
for the University's policies governing other
aspects of student conduct."
