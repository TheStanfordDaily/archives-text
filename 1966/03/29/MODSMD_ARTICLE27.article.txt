# Today And Tomorrow
## Forties-Style Foreign Policy Has Become A 'Dead Hand' 
### Walter Lippmann 
By a rather neat coincidence
we have been forced recently to
begin discussion of two of our
principal foreign policies — the
isolation of China and the func
tion of NATO in Europe.
It is a coincidence that Gen.
Charles de Gaulle has raised the
European question just when
Sen. J. W. Fulbright was raising
the China question. But it is not
a mere accident that the two
central policies should be show
ing all the signs of a breakdown
at approximately the same time.
For the two policies were
fashioned at about the same
time. The China policy was
adopted when Mao Tse-tung
drove Chiang Kai Shek out of
mainland China in 1949. The
European policy was adopted in
1948 when the United States
rallied Western Europe with
the Marshall Plan and a year
later with the military guaran
tees of the NATO alliance. These
two policies were the main
American contribution to the
problem of the disorders and
dangers of the postwar era.
Up For Revision
It should not astonish us to
day, some 18 years later, that
both policies are up for revision.
For both of the policies are now
out of date. Both have been over
taken by events. Both have
served their original purpose,
and both will have to be reex
amined and revised if this coun
try is to have a foreign policy
which works in the world as it
is today.
For the world today is a very
different world than it was in
1948. In Asia the Communist
revolution has consolidated its
grip on mainland China. Japan
is well on the way to the re
covery of its position as a world
power. Red China, instead of
being a weak satellite of the
Soviet Union as it was in 1949,
is in fierce conflict with the So
viet Union.
In Europe there has been a
spectacular recovery of the na
tions prostrated by occupation
or defeat—this is true both of
Eastern and of Western Europe.
The American monopoly of
nuclear weapons, which was
unchallenged when NATO was
formed, has been broken. The
Soviet Union is a nuclear great
power and at the same time, as

even Dr. Konrad Adenauer has
now pointed out, a nation which
has a paramount interest in the
preservation of peace.
Petty and Shallow
It would be surprising, there
fore, if there were not a demand
that the old postwar policies be
re examined and revised. It is a
petty and shallow view to think
that but for a few dissenting
scholars and senators our Asian
policy today would be unchal
lenged, that but for Gen. de
Gaulle our European policy
would stand intact. Those who
talk and write in this vein
should try to realize that after
every great war there comes a
time—some 12 to 20 years later
—when the postwar settlement
breaks down.
The breakdown of the post
war settlement came 15 years
after the end of World War I
when Hitler came to power in
1933. The reconstruction era
broke down after the T i 1 d en-
Hayes election, some 13 years
after the end of the War Be
tween the States. The European
settlement after Waterloo broke
down by 1830. It always hap
pens. The postwar settlement
breaks down because about 15
years after the end of a war a
new generation of men has
grown up and taken power.
Yet the extraordinary thing is
that, instead of anticipating the
inevitable revision of the post
war policies, the Johnson ad
ministration has lost, indeed has
renounced, the initiative in for
eign affairs and is aggrieved be
cause so many people at home
and abroad are making trouble
some questions.
'Fighting the Problem'
In this posture the adminis
tration finds itself engaged not
in tackling the problem of the
postwar era but, as Gen. George

Marshall used to say, in "fight
ing the problem" rather than
trying to deal with it.
Thus, instead of coming for
ward with proposals to bring
the western alliance up to date
and to make it consistent with
the realities of today, the ad
ministration complains about
Gen. De Gaulle forcing the prob
lem into the open.
Why have we not made pro
posals of our own for the mod
ernization of NATO? Why do
we sit back sullenly and demand
that Gen. De Gaulle expound
his proposals?
Looking Backward
The reason we sit back and
do nothing but complain is that,
unfortunately for the country,

at a time when wise and re
sourceful diplomacy is most
needed, the State Department is
looking only backward.
The President will find all too
soon that his problem is not
how to get the better of Sen.
Fulbright or even of Gen. De
Gaulle, but of how to master the
realities which they are talking
about.
The President can overcome
the arguments with his domes
tic opposition. But the argument
will not stay won because the
realities in Asia and Europe are
not under his control. The reali
ties will not yield to his argu
ments and his briefings and will
continue relentlessly on their
course.
