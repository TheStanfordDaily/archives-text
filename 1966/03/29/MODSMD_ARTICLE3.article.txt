# Registration Delivers Usual Horde To Pavilion; 9808 Accepted C.O.D.

As calmly as Stanford students
might take spring quarter registra
tion, the routine is a sometimes frus
trating, rarely speedy, but always
interesting process.
According to Registrar Harvey Hall,
7,568 men and 2,240 women registered
yesterday for a total of 9,808 out of
an expected 10,500 for spring quarter
of 1966. That such a frightful process
should be reduced to a few figures
is probably indicative of the modern
age. There is more, however, than
just the figures.
The crowded path in front of the
Pavilion was an unfamiliar world. "It
almost looks like Berkeley. It's a good
sign," commented a student in front
of the SNCC tables. The tables of the
various campus organizations lined
both sides of the black-topped trail.
"Registration is the only time you
have a large number of tables like
this drawing attention to political is
sues. At Berkeley these things exist
on a daily basis," said Hubbard Kirk
patrick, head of the Stanford Friends
for the American Civil Liberties Un
ion. He felt that this registration

showed a large increase in political
and "action-type" activity.
This was the row, and it offered
something to suit every taste. The
film department sponsored the first
table where students were selling
tickets for the film series sponsored
by the department. "We've sold up
to normal expectations," reported
Dwight Johnson, a graduate student;
"We've sold 39 tickets and had one
stolen."
At the next table, students were
trying to get financial assistance for
radio station KPFA. The KPFA table
seemed to be sharing clientele with
the Young Socialist Alliance group
beside it. The purpose of their table
mates was just "spreading the word
with the help of several piles of pam
phlets.
One table was gathering signatures
from blood donors, another for sup
porters of Ronald Reagan. A group of
students in the Ayn Rand Society
were materialistically selling Ayn
Rand literature priced from 25 cents
to a dollar.
Seniors peddled tickets for the Sen

ior Ball. But according to Mike Grant,
the most popular table of all, at'least
among male students, was the Selec
tive Service Examination application
table.
Not all students found registration
a delightful beginning for a quarter's
academic pursuits. One person in the
Daily office shared his tale of woe:
"First I had to go see an old bureau
cratic lady who checked on my last
quarter's bill and gave me a release.
I left and went on to the Pavilion
where they said I had come to the
wrong window and sent me over to
Mem Aud. But Mem Aud was closed
by that time and I couldn't get my
cardsâ€”it was the University's fault,
not mine! If they send me a bill for
late registration I shall send them a
bill for my lost time. However, I
might agree to a mutual cancellation
of the bills."
With so many people on the tread
mill, it seems miraculous that any
thing is ever completed.
After all the confusion, the pain,
and the frustration, of registration
day, another quarter begins at Stan
ford.
