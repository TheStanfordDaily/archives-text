# Daily Opinion Poll Shows Approval Of De-Escalation
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
Campus sentiment favors de-esca
lation of the Vietnam war, but stu
dents are unwilling to abandon the
Southeast Asian nation to the Com
munists, according to an opinion poll
taken by The Daily yesterday.
The results of the survey paralleled
the findings of the nationwide Stan
ford Poll, yet there were several nota
ble differences. Of the 230 students
who participated in the survey, only
42 per cent approved the Johnson Ad
ministration's handling of the situa
tion while 47 per cent were opposed.
The questionnaire used by The Daily

was a shortened version of the ques
tionnaire developed by seven Stanford
social scientists for use in their na
tional study.
Critics Lend Support
An overwhelming majority of 88
per cent favored negotiations with the
Viet Cong. Opponents as well as pro
ponents of present policy strongly
supported negotiation, with 79 per
cent of Administration backers favor
ing such a move and 96 per cent of
Administration critics lending their
support. Similar approval for nego
tiations with the Viet Cong was also
found in the nationwide Stanford Poll.
Stanford students also gave approv

al to various de-escalation measures,
including a coalition government with
the Viet Cong taking part (58 per
cent), free elections even if the Viet
Cong might win (71 per cent), and a
truce negotiated by the United Na
tions or some neutral country (62 per
cent).
Contrary to the national findings,
the Stanford student body showed it
self more willing to take steps to es
calate the conflict in certain areas.
Fifty-four per cent of those polled
favored bombing military targets in
North Vietnam, yet the opposition to
bombing North Vietnamese cities was
nearly 5-1. However, when faced with
the possibility of £ war with China or
a nuclear conflict which might in
volve the Soviet Union, students op
posed escalating the war by a wide
margin.
Hybrid Quality
The pattern of campus opinion
showed the same hybrid quality
which had been detected on a nation
wide scale. For while a majority ad
vocates definiite steps toward de-esca
lation, campus sentiment showed a
deep reluctance to abandon Vietnam
to the Communists. Only 18 per cent
favored a complete withdrawal which
would allow the country to come un
der Red control.
When asked to choose among a ma
jor war, withdrawal, and a continua
tion of the present policy, 30 per cent
would maintain the status quo in
American policy, 38 per cent would
withdraw from Vietnam completely,
while only 6.6 per cent gave support
for an all-out war.
If the possibility of maintaining
current policy were removed, students
were roughly divided on whether to
support an all-out war or withdraw
from the country.
Three Red Challenges
Questions designed to demonstrate
that supporters of de-escalation
moves were not soft on communism
proved to be inconclusive. Students
were asked to rate America's handling
another Communist threat (Red
China), while the national survey
measured opinion on three separate
Red challenges. Forty per cent of
those who favored negotiations found
U.S. policy toward Red China had
been too soft.
The Stanford Poll found 94 per cent
of the people across the nation be
lieved that U.S. policy toward China
had been just about right or too soft.
In sharp contract, only 26 per cent of
the students favoring negotiations
held a similar opinion.

Cong might win (71 per cent), and a
truce negotiated by the United Na
tions or some neutral country (62 per
cent).
Contrary to the national findings,
the Stanford student body showed it
self more willing to take steps to es
calate the conflict in certain areas.
Fifty-four per cent of those polled
favored bombing military targets in
North Vietnam, yet the opposition to
bombing North Vietnamese cities was
nearly 5-1. However, when faced with
the possibility of £ war with China or
a nuclear conflict which might in
volve the Soviet Union, students op
posed escalating the war by a wide
margin.
Hybrid Quality
The pattern of campus opinion
showed the same hybrid quality
which had been detected on a nation
wide scale. For while a majority ad
vocates definiite steps toward de-esca
lation, campus sentiment showed a
deep reluctance to abandon Vietnam
to the Communists. Only 18 per cent
favored a complete withdrawal which
would allow the country to come un
der Red control.
When asked to choose among a ma
jor war, withdrawal, and a continua
tion of the present policy, 30 per cent
would maintain the status quo in
American policy, 38 per cent would
withdraw from Vietnam completely,
while only 6.6 per cent gave support
for an all-out war.
If the possibility of maintaining
current policy were removed, students
were roughly divided on whether to
support an all-out war or withdraw
from the country.
Three Red Challenges
Questions designed to demonstrate
that supporters of de-escalation
moves were not soft on communism
proved to be inconclusive. Students
were asked to rate America's handling
another Communist threat (Red
China), while the national survey
measured opinion on three separate
Red challenges. Forty per cent of
those who favored negotiations found
U.S. policy toward Red China had
been too soft.
The Stanford Poll found 94 per cent
of the people across the nation be
lieved that U.S. policy toward China
had been just about right or too soft.
In sharp contract, only 26 per cent of
the students favoring negotiations
held a similar opinion.
Campus sentiment favors de-esca
lation of the Vietnam war, but stu
dents are unwilling to abandon the
Southeast Asian nation to the Com
munists, according to an opinion poll
taken by The Daily yesterday.
The results of the survey paralleled
the findings of the nationwide Stan
ford Poll, yet there were several nota
ble differences. Of the 230 students
who participated in the survey, only
42 per cent approved the Johnson Ad
ministration's handling of the situa
tion while 47 per cent were opposed.
The questionnaire used by The Daily

was a shortened version of the ques
tionnaire developed by seven Stanford
social scientists for use in their na
tional study.
Critics Lend Support
An overwhelming majority of 88
per cent favored negotiations with the
Viet Cong. Opponents as well as pro
ponents of present policy strongly
supported negotiation, with 79 per
cent of Administration backers favor
ing such a move and 96 per cent of
Administration critics lending their
support. Similar approval for nego
tiations with the Viet Cong was also
found in the nationwide Stanford Poll.
Stanford students also gave approv

al to various de-escalation measures,
including a coalition government with
the Viet Cong taking part (58 per
cent), free elections even if the Viet
Cong might win (71 per cent), and a
truce negotiated by the United Na
tions or some neutral country (62 per
cent).
