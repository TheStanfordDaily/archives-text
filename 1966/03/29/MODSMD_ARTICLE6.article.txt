## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
H. Bruce Franklin, a Stanford En
glish professor, was ejected last Tues
day from a meeting of the Redwood
City Port Commission after he tried
to protest the construction of a na
palm plant in that city.
"The plant indicates a plan to burn
the countryside of Vietnam," Frank
lin, who was not permitted to speak
at the meeting, explained.
A representative from the Stanford
Faculty Committee for Peace in Viet
nam. he attempted to explain what he
sees as the dangers of the plant to the
community and the hazards of use of
the gas in Vietnam.
The United Technology Center of
Sunnyvale has received an $11 million
contract to manufacture in Redwood
City the explosive gasoline jelly now
used in the Vietnam War, but Frank
lin points out, would be the first to
produce napalm-6, a more adhesive
strain of the gas than now in use.
The port commissioners, who ap
proved construction, contended that
the manufacture of napalm would be
no different from that of gasoline.
Franklin, however, cites California
statutes requiring different routes for
trucks transporting napalm and gaso
line.

The Stanford professor hopes to
"educate the voters of Redwood City"
in the event that a referendum is held.
He believes the city would gain noth
ing by the construction of the plant.
"I have good faith that the people

would recognize the liabilities of the
plant," he said.
The Faculty Committee for Peace
in Vietnam will meet tonight to dis
cuss further plans for protest, but ac
cording to Franklin, "the burden rests
with the people of Redwood City."
