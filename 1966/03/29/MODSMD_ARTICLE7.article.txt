# Close Margin Defeats Referendum On Recall
## 
### 
By a vote of 279 to 235, students
supported LASSU's amended resolu
tion and rejected a referendum that
would have expressed a vote of "no
confidence" in the Legislature and re
jected any recall of the student mem
bers of the Committee in balloting
March 4.
The LASSU resolution, which re
placed members on the Committee
and stipulated conditions for the re
call of the members, was put on the
ballot in order to gauge student body
support for the resolution. While the
resolution was only an opinion poll,
the referendum needed a majority
vote to be enacted.
Roger Bounds, election chairman,
annnouticed that the greatest number
of ballots were cast by seniors with
142; graduate students cast the
least number with 79. Bounds noted
that there was "a surprising amount
of interest," and termed the turnout
"good."
Jay Kadane, LASSU speaker, noted
that now that the student body had
"ratified what LASSU had passed,"
LASSU's action is now "more perma

nent." He also noted that the issue is
now of little consequence, since the
students merely supported an action
already taken.
The LASSU resolution was support
ed by Tom Galbraith, the student who
initiated a petition which brought the
referendum to a vote, by Jennifer
Watkins and Michael Couzens, the two
students who lost their seats on the
Committee of Fifteen as a result of
the Legislature's action, and by The
Daily, editorially.
The referendum was originally a
response to LASSU's first resolution
which made the student members of
the Committee of Fifteen subject to
immediate recall by the Legislature.
Tom Galbraith, the freshman coordi
nator in S t e rn, circulated petitions
which, while expressing "no confi
dence" in LASSU's action, also would
have made "student delegates consid
er their responsibility to the student
body."
However, Galbraith withdrew sup
port from the resolution after LASSU
amended its resolution. He attempted
unsuccessfully to withdraw the peti
tion.
