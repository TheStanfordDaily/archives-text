The IBM interviewer
will be on campus
April 12-13
Interview him. How else
are you going to find
out about new ways to
use your talents and
skills in an exciting
"go-places" career ?
You could visit a nearby IBM branch office. You could write
to the Manager of College Relations, IBM Corporate Head
quarters, Armonk, New York 10504. But we would like to see
you on campus. Why not check at your placement office
today? See if you can still make an appointment for an
on-campus visit with IBM. Then interview the IBM inter
viewer. Whatever your area of study, ask him how you might
use your particular talents at IBM. Ask about your growth
potential in America's fastest-growing major industry.
You'll never regret it. IBM is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
