SOPH., JR.) SR.
MEN :
Want to be a leader and double your chances for success in life ? You can, by earning
both a degree and an Army officer's commission at the same time*... even though you may
not have taken ROTC training in your first two years!
Through a new program, you can be commissioned as a Second Lieutenant after
taking two years of Army ROTC training while you complete your studies for a college
degree. You can qualify for this program by attending a special six-week summer training
camp after your sophomore year and then completing the ROTC Advanced Course in
your junior and senior years of college 0 r graduate school.
Here's what ROTC training and an officer's commission will do for you:
• It will qualify you to fulfill your military obligation as an officer.
• You will learn to organize, motivate, and lead others.
• You will develop leadership qualities that many college men miss —self-discipline,
physical stamina, poise, bearing, the acceptance of responsibility and other qualities
that contribute to success in either a civilian or military career.
• You will receive $4.0 per month during your junior and senior years, plus pay and mile
age for summer training.
The training and experience you will receive through Army ROTC will pay off for the
rest of your life. A decision to take advantage of this new program could be one of the
most important you will ever make.
You owe it to yourself to investigate this new important opportunity.
For complete information on the new Two-Year Army ROTC Program see the Professor
of Military Science on campus.

IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A LEADER, DON'T SETTLE FOR LESS!
