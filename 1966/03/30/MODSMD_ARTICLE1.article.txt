"lndescribable bliss!" breathed one
sunburned Freshman when asked
about her activities during spring
break.
From Vancouver, B. C., to the Vir
gin Islands, Stanford students recu
perated from Winter Quarter last
week. Some surfed, others skied.
Many sunbathed, a few shovelled
snow. Disneyland, Catalina Island,
Mexico City, Newport Beach, Bermu
da, Vale, and Big Sur all attracted
book-free fun seekers.
A small group remained on cam
pus. "Mortuary quiet all over ... it
was eery," a hardy graduate student
commented. Another, one of the four
freshmen who remained in Wilbur,
unplugged his clock, put away hi s
watch, and tried to disassociate him

self from the time-scheduled routine
of the past weeks. He read, ate, and
slept whenever he so desired. He ven
tured outside only to walk around
Lake Lag.
Several groups from Stanford spent
their vacations on work projects. Ten
students, under the leadership of Mar
garet Gates of the Stanford Y, went
to East Oakland. They walked from
door to door encouraging Negroes to
register for voting and met with wel
fare officials and members of the city
council to discuss how underprivi
ledged minority groups can gain a
voice in government. During their
seven-day stay, they also attended a
convention for the Democratic Pri
mary.
Pell Fender organized 30 volun
teers and went to two Mexican bor

der towns. Half of the students went
to Morelos where they saw the prob
lems created by natives trying to ac
cept American ways. They painted a
school for blind children "who will
never see it," explained Jennifer
Fricker.
Mixing Cultures
The other members of the project
went to Mexicali and built sidewalks,
painted, played with the children,
talked with college students, and
gained an understanding of the cus
toms of the people.
Sixteen students, under the guid
ance of Steve Hurlbut, an Otero spon
sor, traveled to a semi-primitive In
dian reservation about sixty miles
northeast of Bakersfield, California.
They spent eight days living with the
Tule River Indians, doing some con

struction work, but "the most impor
tant thing we did was to see the con
trast between the two cultures.
"We tried to show the kids an alter
native to the drunken, defeated adults
they saw wandering around every
night. We wanted them to see that
there was a friendly world outside the
reservation," said Cherie Greene, one
of the participants. No great miracles
were accomplished, but the campers
felt they did make a favorable im
pression on the children, thus making
their trip worthwhile.
Stu-Fac Hostel
Dr. and Mrs. Rathbun invited ten
undergraduates to their home in the
Sequoia Camp Grounds for a three
day hostel to plan the second Stu-Fac
symposium. The group discussed edu
cation in relation to Stanford and

planned a program that will deal with
the problems of college educations.
Topics varied from freedom vs. dis
cipline to the merits of a specialized
vs. a general education.
"We plan to deal with the question,
'what are you after four years at Stan
ford besides four years older?" Bobbi
Birleffi summarized.,;"We our
discussions with a Carmel
and Monterey, day
with the guitar, bre;> H «nlami,
and sea gulls."

Two Stanford travelers, Sara Wood
and Joan Baer, found Bermuda so
great that—they still haven't re

turned.
Then there were the seven Stanford
men and one dolly who lived on C
rations, packed in 1958, for a week
at Big Sur. They also managed to
hitch a ride from a policeman for six
miles.
The men of El Tigre eating club
were in the southwest, initiating
"Stanford Under Rainbow Bridge."
The "magnificant seven" made an at
tempt at growing beards but appar
ently did better with callouses.
For the majority of the returning
registrants, however, spring break
was an opportunity to visit their
.State's universities that were still in
Session, to rekindle old romances, to
loiifok for summer jobs, and to prepare
for the warm months ahead at Stan
; ford.
