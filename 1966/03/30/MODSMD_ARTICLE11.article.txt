# ADB Gives Asia Economic Hope
## 
### SPENCER DAVIS Associated Press Writer 
In a major policy speech April
7, 1965, President Johnson
pledged an American investment
of $1 billion for the economic and
social development of all of Asia
—provided other nations also
helped.
Less than one year later, he
announced in a M a r c h 16 cere
mony at the White House "We
have begun to redeem that
pledge.. .this is the first step of
what I conceive to be a very long
journey." With that he signed
legislation authorizing U. S. par
ticipation in the Asian Develop
ment Bank.
Some Johnson Administration
critics have called the response
of the Asian nations to the Presi
dent's Johns Hopkins University
speech last year disappointing
and low-keyed. It has been linked
to North Vietnam's failure to ac
cept his offer for unconditional
discussions for a peace settle
ment.
But Eugene R. Black, 68-year
old former World Bank presi
dent, who came out of retire
ment to serve without pay as
Johnson's special advisor on
southeast Asia, considers the

challenge big, exciting and filled
with opportunity.
In his Johns Hopkins speech,
Johnson said "Neither indepen
dence nor human dignity will
ever be won by arms alone. It
also requires the works of
peace."
"Coming out of that speech,"
said Black in an interview, is the
possibility that if the countries
get together, and if they can
have peace, they will have the
money available to them for de
velopment.
"We feel strongly that before
we give them money, they have
got to do their part. They have
big populations and big prob
lems. There are enormous possi
bilties there."
Black noted that there were
two strings attached to the Presi
dent's of 112 e r—first, that Asian
nations should present their own
programs for action; second, that
other countries join with the
U. S. in the cooperative develop
ment effort.
Black said it was decided that
the first thing to do was to help
get the Asian Development Bank
started. The United States had
been co ol to the project in the
past, but it represented Asian ini
tiative and had the support of
other countries. U. S. objections
were withdrawn and $200 mil
lion was offered toward the $1
billion capitalization.
Some 31 nations joined in sign
ing the Bank Charter in Manila
last December, and by next Sep
tember it is anticipated that 15
nations will have ratified the
charter and the Bank can begin
functioning in its new Manila
Manila headquarters.
The United States has offered
to establish a $100 million trust
fund for Southeast Asia to be ad
ministered by the Bank, Black
said, if other nations will match
that amount.
The second major achievement
has been in the international co
operation which brought the
United States and seven other
countries to pledge $21.4 million
for the construction of the larg
est Mekong .River Project thus
far. That is the Nam Ngum Pow
er and Dam Project near Vienti
ane, the capital of Laos. The
United States has pledged one
half of this amount under the
Johnson program and the re
mainder is being contributed by
Japan, The Netherlands, Canada,
Thailand, Denmark, Australia
and New Zealand.
Thailand is contributing ce
ment for the project and will be
paid back later with electrical
power once the 120,000-kilowatt
project is completed.
The Mekong is one of the 12
mightiest rivers in the world.
The 2600-mile-long Mekong has
never been bridged.
