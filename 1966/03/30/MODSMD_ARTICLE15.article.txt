# U.S. Malady Traced To Economic Roots
## 
### PETER LATHROP 
(Editor's n*>te: Paul A. Baran
was professor of economics at
Stanford from 1949 until his
death in 1964. He was perhaps
the only Marxist economist
teaching in a major American
university during his period.
This review of his last book, fin
ished by Paul Sweezy after his
death, was written by a former
Stanford graduate student who
wrote his doctoral thesis under
Baran. It is presented in connec
tion witli the conference on
"Baran and American Radical
ism Today" which will be held
in Tresidder Union and at the
Free University of Palo Alto this
weekend.)

Postwar American social criti
cism bears more than a passing
resemblance to postwar tooth
pastes based on detailed, "neu
tral" scientific research, both
commodities are brightly pack
aged, endlessly multiplied, con
stantly advertised, and available
at the nearest supermarket.
Both sweeten the user's breath,
but neither cures decay.
By a specious, incessant, repi
tition and description of symp
toms we paradoxically conceal
the structural causes of social
diseases. Real social prob
lems are inundated by volumes
of that genre of criticism "which
knows how to judge and con
demn the present, but not how
to comprehend it" (Marx).
And as pleasant but ineffec
tive "cures" become addictive,
we require larger doses of Vance
Packard or Jessica Mitzford to
produce a catharsis of indigna
tion.
Thus, a self-confessional social
criticism which permits individu
al withdrawal under a smoke
screen of "confrontation" and
"engagement" generates its own
illness an increasing inability
to produce or, for that matter,
to recognize a genuine critique
of the social whole.
National Misfortune
If Monopoly Capital: An Es
say on the American Economic
and Social Order by Paul Baran
and Paul Sweezy is buried in
this dreary context of hastily
written and soon forgotten pseu
do-criticism, it will be a national
rather than an international mis
fortune. For outside the U. S.,
the authors are considered lead
ing Marxist economists and so
cial critics of this century.
Baran is known primarily for
his important work on the eco
nomics of underdevelopment,
The Political Economy of
Gruwtli (1956), and Sweezy for
The Theory of Capitalist Devel
opment (1942), still the best ex
position of Marxian economic
theory in English.
Their long awaited book will
be carefully studied by revolu
tionaries and students in Latin
America, Asia, and Africa, as
well as by intellectuals in En
gland and Europe—in short, by
those who need to understand
the domestic character of Ameri
can monopoly capitalism in or
der to combat its global imper -
ialist manifestations.
Professor at Stanford
And however obscured by a
national cultural apparatus
which systematically distorts
theoretical reflections of its ir
rationality, their work should
also receivc careful attention lo
cally, for until his death in 1964,
Paul Baran was Professor of
Economics at Stanford.
A brilliant teacher, he was ad
mired by students and despised
by a timid administration finan
cially dependent on the corpor
ate rich, on the managers of the
irrational social order which
Baran brilliantly andd remorse
ly dissected.
Monopoly Capital is the distil
lation of decades of critical
thought and analysis, a written
record available to Stanford stu
dents who missed the rare op
portunity of knowing Paul
Baran.

Written over a ten year period
in close collaboration with Paul
Sweezy, the book is an "essay
sketch," a preliminary overview
of the contemporary American
socio-economic structure.
It "derives its essential unity
from one central theme: the gen
eration and absorption of the
social surplus (i.e., the differ
ence between what a society pro
duces and the costs of produc
tion) under conditions of monop
oly capitalism."
Main Locus
In Chapters 1-3, Baran and
Sweezy analyze the large corpor
ation, the primary generator of
surplus and hence the main lo
cus of economic and political
power. They argue that "owing
to the nature of price and cost
policies of the giant corpora
tions, there is a strong and sys
tematic tendency for the surplus
to rise."
Chapters 4-7 focus on the chief
possibilities of absorbing the sur
plus: consumption, investment,
and waste. Consumption and in
vestment, they demonstrate,
cannot provide sufficient escape
valves for a constantly expand
ing surplus. Therefore, "since
surplus which cannot be ab
sorbed will not be produced, it
follows that the normal state of
the monopoly capitalist economy
is stagnation."
Other Outlets
To counteract depressive ten
dencies, monopoly capitalism
seeks other outlets for its sur
plus—in the "sales effort," in an
unwieldly civilian government,
and in militarism and imperial
ism. Since these wasteful and
destructive outlets are crucial to
the survival of the entire social
order and hence to the preser
vation of its hie archy of
wealth, power, and prestige—
they become institutionalized
and vigorously defended by the
system's apologists.
Irrationality is thus shown to
be generated by a contradictory
economic structure and ex
pressed in the quality of indi
vidual and social life which the
authors survey in the closing
chapters of the book.
In terms of their theory of
monopoly capitalism, Baran and
Sweezy explain the chief social
maladies which most social crit
ics merely describe. Thus, the
enormously debilitating human
effects of advertising and fran
tic consumption are traced to
the sales effort, a necessary
weapon in the fight against
stagnation.
Similarly, the anti-communist
crusade which has dominated
and infected the American men
tality, justifying witch hunts at
home and brutal wars of inter
vention abroad, is shown to be
a consequence of the most "ra
tional" solution to the thorny
problem of surplus absorption—
a gigantic military establish
ment.
Illumination
By exposing the basic mecha
nisms of monopoly capitalism,
Baran and Sweezy illuminate the
limits of the system and the fu
tility of efforts to reform it.
The reader may reject their
prescription of socialism, of
planned production to satisfy hu
man need, but he should first
study the theory of monopoly
capitalism. Closely reasoned and
skillfully documented, Monopoly
Capital is probably the most im
portant postwar critique of
American society as a whole.
The authors have not merely
imposed an ill-fitting nineteenth
century model of competitive
capitalism on contemporary con
ditions. Instead, they have used
Marx's methodology as a tool
for analyzing the present as his
tory.
Their model, therefore, can
not be dismissed with simplistis
tic anti-Marxist cliches: it must
be discussed, revised, refined, or
refuted in terms of contempor
ary social reality.

duces and the costs of produc
tion) under conditions of monop
oly capitalism."
Main Locus
In Chapters 1-3, Baran and
Sweezy analyze the large corpor
ation, the primary generator of
surplus and hence the main lo
cus of economic and political
power. They argue that "owing
to the nature of price and cost
policies of the giant corpora
tions, there is a strong and sys
tematic tendency for the surplus
to rise."
Chapters 4-7 focus on the chief
possibilities of absorbing the sur
plus: consumption, investment,
and waste. Consumption and in
vestment, they demonstrate,
cannot provide sufficient escape
valves for a constantly expand
ing surplus. Therefore, "since
surplus which cannot be ab
sorbed will not be produced, it
follows that the normal state of
the monopoly capitalist economy
is stagnation."
Other Outlets
To counteract depressive ten
dencies, monopoly capitalism
seeks other outlets for its sur
plus—in the "sales effort," in an
unwieldly civilian government,
and in militarism and imperial
ism. Since these wasteful and
destructive outlets are crucial to
the survival of the entire social
order and hence to the preser
vation of its hie archy of
wealth, power, and prestige—
they become institutionalized
and vigorously defended by the
system's apologists.
Irrationality is thus shown to
be generated by a contradictory
economic structure and ex
pressed in the quality of indi
vidual and social life which the
authors survey in the closing
chapters of the book.
In terms of their theory of
monopoly capitalism, Baran and
Sweezy explain the chief social
maladies which most social crit
ics merely describe. Thus, the
enormously debilitating human
effects of advertising and fran
tic consumption are traced to
the sales effort, a necessary
weapon in the fight against
stagnation.
Similarly, the anti-communist
crusade which has dominated
and infected the American men
tality, justifying witch hunts at
home and brutal wars of inter
vention abroad, is shown to be
a consequence of the most "ra
tional" solution to the thorny
problem of surplus absorption—
a gigantic military establish
ment.
Illumination
By exposing the basic mecha
nisms of monopoly capitalism,
Baran and Sweezy illuminate the
limits of the system and the fu
tility of efforts to reform it.
The reader may reject their
prescription of socialism, of
planned production to satisfy hu
man need, but he should first
study the theory of monopoly
capitalism. Closely reasoned and
skillfully documented, Monopoly
Capital is probably the most im
portant postwar critique of
American society as a whole.
The authors have not merely
imposed an ill-fitting nineteenth
century model of competitive
capitalism on contemporary con
ditions. Instead, they have used
Marx's methodology as a tool
for analyzing the present as his
tory.
Their model, therefore, can
not be dismissed with simplistis
tic anti-Marxist cliches: it must
be discussed, revised, refined, or
refuted in terms of contempor
ary social reality.

Postwar American social criti

National Misfortune
If Monopoly Capital: An Es
say on the American Economic
and Social Order by Paul Baran
and Paul Sweezy is buried in
this dreary context of hastily
written and soon forgotten pseu
do-criticism, it will be a national
rather than an international mis
fortune. For outside the U. S.,
the authors are considered lead
ing Marxist economists and so
cial critics of this century.
Baran is known primarily for
his important work on the eco
nomics of underdevelopment,
The Political Economy of
Gruwtli (1956), and Sweezy for
The Theory of Capitalist Devel
opment (1942), still the best ex
position of Marxian economic
theory in English.
Their long awaited book will
be carefully studied by revolu
tionaries and students in Latin
America, Asia, and Africa, as
well as by intellectuals in En
gland and Europe—in short, by
those who need to understand
the domestic character of Ameri
can monopoly capitalism in or
der to combat its global imper -
ialist manifestations.

And however obscured by a

A brilliant teacher, he was ad

by a timid administration finan

Written over a ten year period
in close collaboration with Paul
Sweezy, the book is an "essay

National Misfortune
If Monopoly Capital: An Es
say on the American Economic
and Social Order by Paul Baran
and Paul Sweezy is buried in
this dreary context of hastily
written and soon forgotten pseu
do-criticism, it will be a national
rather than an international mis
fortune. For outside the U. S.,
the authors are considered lead
ing Marxist economists and so
cial critics of this century.
Baran is known primarily for
his important work on the eco
nomics of underdevelopment,
The Political Economy of
Gruwtli (1956), and Sweezy for
The Theory of Capitalist Devel
opment (1942), still the best ex
position of Marxian economic
theory in English.
Their long awaited book will
be carefully studied by revolu
tionaries and students in Latin
America, Asia, and Africa, as
well as by intellectuals in En
gland and Europe—in short, by
those who need to understand
the domestic character of Ameri
can monopoly capitalism in or
der to combat its global imper -
ialist manifestations.
Professor at Stanford
And however obscured by a
national cultural apparatus
which systematically distorts
theoretical reflections of its ir
rationality, their work should
also receivc careful attention lo
cally, for until his death in 1964,
Paul Baran was Professor of
Economics at Stanford.
A brilliant teacher, he was ad
mired by students and despised
by a timid administration finan
cially dependent on the corpor
ate rich, on the managers of the
irrational social order which
Baran brilliantly andd remorse
ly dissected.
Monopoly Capital is the distil
lation of decades of critical
thought and analysis, a written
record available to Stanford stu
dents who missed the rare op
portunity of knowing Paul
Baran.

Written over a ten year period
in close collaboration with Paul
Sweezy, the book is an "essay
sketch," a preliminary overview
of the contemporary American
socio-economic structure.
It "derives its essential unity
from one central theme: the gen
eration and absorption of the
social surplus (i.e., the differ
ence between what a society pro
duces and the costs of produc
tion) under conditions of monop
oly capitalism."
Main Locus
In Chapters 1-3, Baran and
Sweezy analyze the large corpor
ation, the primary generator of
surplus and hence the main lo
cus of economic and political
power. They argue that "owing
to the nature of price and cost
policies of the giant corpora
tions, there is a strong and sys
tematic tendency for the surplus
to rise."
Chapters 4-7 focus on the chief
possibilities of absorbing the sur
plus: consumption, investment,
and waste. Consumption and in
vestment, they demonstrate,
cannot provide sufficient escape
valves for a constantly expand
ing surplus. Therefore, "since
surplus which cannot be ab
sorbed will not be produced, it
follows that the normal state of
the monopoly capitalist economy
is stagnation."
Other Outlets
To counteract depressive ten
dencies, monopoly capitalism
seeks other outlets for its sur
plus—in the "sales effort," in an
unwieldly civilian government,
and in militarism and imperial
ism. Since these wasteful and
destructive outlets are crucial to
the survival of the entire social
order and hence to the preser
vation of its hie archy of
wealth, power, and prestige—
they become institutionalized
and vigorously defended by the
system's apologists.
Irrationality is thus shown to
be generated by a contradictory
economic structure and ex
pressed in the quality of indi
vidual and social life which the
authors survey in the closing
chapters of the book.
In terms of their theory of
monopoly capitalism, Baran and
Sweezy explain the chief social
maladies which most social crit
ics merely describe. Thus, the
enormously debilitating human
effects of advertising and fran
tic consumption are traced to
the sales effort, a necessary
weapon in the fight against
stagnation.
Similarly, the anti-communist
crusade which has dominated
and infected the American men
tality, justifying witch hunts at
home and brutal wars of inter
vention abroad, is shown to be
a consequence of the most "ra
tional" solution to the thorny
problem of surplus absorption—
a gigantic military establish
ment.
Illumination
By exposing the basic mecha
nisms of monopoly capitalism,
Baran and Sweezy illuminate the
limits of the system and the fu
tility of efforts to reform it.
The reader may reject their
prescription of socialism, of
planned production to satisfy hu
man need, but he should first
study the theory of monopoly
capitalism. Closely reasoned and
skillfully documented, Monopoly
Capital is probably the most im
portant postwar critique of
American society as a whole.
The authors have not merely
imposed an ill-fitting nineteenth
century model of competitive
capitalism on contemporary con
ditions. Instead, they have used
Marx's methodology as a tool
for analyzing the present as his
tory.
Their model, therefore, can
not be dismissed with simplistis
tic anti-Marxist cliches: it must
be discussed, revised, refined, or
refuted in terms of contempor
ary social reality.

unwieldly civilian government,
and in militarism and imperial

destructive outlets are crucial to
the survival of the entire social

the sales effort, a necessary

stagnation.
Similarly, the anti-communist

problem of surplus absorption—
a gigantic military establish

Illumination
By exposing the basic mecha
nisms of monopoly capitalism,
Baran and Sweezy illuminate the
limits of the system and the fu
tility of efforts to reform it.
The reader may reject their
prescription of socialism, of
planned production to satisfy hu
man need, but he should first
study the theory of monopoly
capitalism. Closely reasoned and
skillfully documented, Monopoly
Capital is probably the most im
portant postwar critique of
American society as a whole.
The authors have not merely
imposed an ill-fitting nineteenth
century model of competitive
capitalism on contemporary con
ditions. Instead, they have used
Marx's methodology as a tool
for analyzing the present as his
tory.
Their model, therefore, can
not be dismissed with simplistis
tic anti-Marxist cliches: it must
be discussed, revised, refined, or
refuted in terms of contempor
ary social reality.
(Editor's n*>te: Paul A. Baran
was professor of economics at
Stanford from 1949 until his
death in 1964. He was perhaps
the only Marxist economist
teaching in a major American
university during his period.
This review of his last book, fin
ished by Paul Sweezy after his
death, was written by a former
Stanford graduate student who
wrote his doctoral thesis under
Baran. It is presented in connec
tion witli the conference on
"Baran and American Radical
ism Today" which will be held
in Tresidder Union and at the
Free University of Palo Alto this
weekend.)

Postwar American social criti
cism bears more than a passing
resemblance to postwar tooth
pastes based on detailed, "neu
tral" scientific research, both
commodities are brightly pack
aged, endlessly multiplied, con
stantly advertised, and available
at the nearest supermarket.
Both sweeten the user's breath,
but neither cures decay.
By a specious, incessant, repi
tition and description of symp
toms we paradoxically conceal
the structural causes of social
diseases. Real social prob
lems are inundated by volumes
of that genre of criticism "which
knows how to judge and con
demn the present, but not how
to comprehend it" (Marx).
And as pleasant but ineffec
tive "cures" become addictive,
we require larger doses of Vance
Packard or Jessica Mitzford to
produce a catharsis of indigna
tion.
Thus, a self-confessional social
criticism which permits individu
al withdrawal under a smoke
screen of "confrontation" and
"engagement" generates its own
illness an increasing inability
to produce or, for that matter,
to recognize a genuine critique
of the social whole.
National Misfortune
If Monopoly Capital: An Es
say on the American Economic
and Social Order by Paul Baran
and Paul Sweezy is buried in
this dreary context of hastily
written and soon forgotten pseu
do-criticism, it will be a national
rather than an international mis
fortune. For outside the U. S.,
the authors are considered lead
ing Marxist economists and so
cial critics of this century.
Baran is known primarily for
his important work on the eco
nomics of underdevelopment,
The Political Economy of
Gruwtli (1956), and Sweezy for
The Theory of Capitalist Devel
opment (1942), still the best ex
position of Marxian economic
theory in English.
Their long awaited book will
be carefully studied by revolu
tionaries and students in Latin
America, Asia, and Africa, as
well as by intellectuals in En
gland and Europe—in short, by
those who need to understand
the domestic character of Ameri
can monopoly capitalism in or
der to combat its global imper -
ialist manifestations.
Professor at Stanford
And however obscured by a
national cultural apparatus
which systematically distorts
theoretical reflections of its ir
rationality, their work should
also receivc careful attention lo
cally, for until his death in 1964,
Paul Baran was Professor of
Economics at Stanford.
A brilliant teacher, he was ad
mired by students and despised
by a timid administration finan
cially dependent on the corpor
ate rich, on the managers of the
irrational social order which
Baran brilliantly andd remorse
ly dissected.
Monopoly Capital is the distil
lation of decades of critical
thought and analysis, a written
record available to Stanford stu
dents who missed the rare op
portunity of knowing Paul
Baran.

Written over a ten year period
in close collaboration with Paul
Sweezy, the book is an "essay
sketch," a preliminary overview
of the contemporary American
socio-economic structure.
It "derives its essential unity
from one central theme: the gen
eration and absorption of the
social surplus (i.e., the differ
ence between what a society pro
duces and the costs of produc
tion) under conditions of monop
oly capitalism."
Main Locus
In Chapters 1-3, Baran and
Sweezy analyze the large corpor
ation, the primary generator of
surplus and hence the main lo
cus of economic and political
power. They argue that "owing
to the nature of price and cost
policies of the giant corpora
tions, there is a strong and sys
tematic tendency for the surplus
to rise."
Chapters 4-7 focus on the chief
possibilities of absorbing the sur
plus: consumption, investment,
and waste. Consumption and in
vestment, they demonstrate,
cannot provide sufficient escape
valves for a constantly expand
ing surplus. Therefore, "since
surplus which cannot be ab
sorbed will not be produced, it
follows that the normal state of
the monopoly capitalist economy
is stagnation."
Other Outlets
To counteract depressive ten
dencies, monopoly capitalism
seeks other outlets for its sur
plus—in the "sales effort," in an
unwieldly civilian government,
and in militarism and imperial
ism. Since these wasteful and
destructive outlets are crucial to
the survival of the entire social
order and hence to the preser
vation of its hie archy of
wealth, power, and prestige—
they become institutionalized
and vigorously defended by the
system's apologists.
Irrationality is thus shown to
be generated by a contradictory
economic structure and ex
pressed in the quality of indi
vidual and social life which the
authors survey in the closing
chapters of the book.
