# Statistical Avalanche Freezes Kennedy Assassination Study
## 
### SUZANNE MEYER 
Oswald's bullet placed ordi
narily dispersed public attention
on one event and its after ef
fects. The Kennedy Assassina
tion confronted Americans with
a crisis matched in recent years
only by Pearl Harbor and the
death of FDR in evoking wide
spread public emotional re
sponse.
Yet even as most Americans
were trying to understand and
adjust to what had happened,
social scientists were organizing
to analyze public reaction. The
Kennedy Assassination and the
American Public, edited by Brad
ley S. Greenberg and Edwin B.
Parker, anthologizes some of
these studies.
While surveys result in sterile
figures, personal responses and
recollections, newspaper and
magazine articles, radio and tel
evision programs all presented
the assassination in human
terms. The story behind these
presentations, that of reporters
and newspaper and network ex
ecutives, is sketched in the first
of the book's four parts.
Thus, Tom Wicker, the New
Times' only reporter that
day in Dallas, recounts how he
tried to discover exactly what
was happening but had to rely
on instinct much of the time.
Harrison E. Salisbury and
Tom Petit reveal the problems
faced respectively by newspa
pers and television in keeping
the public accurately and quick
ly informed.
Interspersed with these per
sonal accounts are analyses of
'te role and effects of media in
the crisis: the back-patting gen
oal agrement is that the
abundance of information helped
avert public panic or accusing
expressions of ideological fervor.
Serious questions complement
the self-congratulations, how
ever, in an article by William L.
Rivers: the press, he says, has
a responsibility to report, not
manufacture news; catering to
public demand for detail should
not lead to identifying supposi
tion with fact.
Statistical Avalanche
The section on the media and
the assassination sparkles with
personal incident and insight;
most of the articles in the fi
nal three sections, on the other
hand, freeze out the human fac
tor with an avalanche of statis
tics and methodology.
Unless he is well-versed in the
statistical idiom, the reader will
be lost in a desert of facts and
figures, which, if it can be sur
vived, hides an informative and
precise picture of how America
found out about and reacted to
Kennedy's death.

Public reaction was one of
grief. Negroes tended to be
more emotional than whites; a
parallel comparison holds be
tween Democrats and Republi
cans, and people with less and
more education. College students
and children reacted in patterns
similar to those of the general
public—except that children, un
like adults, did not admit that
they had cried.
Incoherence
This information is interest
ing; the data collected are cer
tainly overwhelming. What em
erges, however, is nothing but a
loose potpourri of percent
ages, mottled often with rep
etition of statistical conclusions.
One finds himself in a hurry to
seize any coherent set of implica
tions he can find.
Thus, we learn what the
changes were in public reaction
as time passed; we find very
little to suggest what these
changes meant. We learn that
the amount of grief was directly
related to the degree of post- as
sassination rededication, identifi
cation with Kennedy, and politi

cal involvement, bilt have no ap
plication for this information.
The introductory and conclud
ing essays attempt to provide a
structure for these surveys, but
they are merely summaries of
the statistics, neither suggesting
nor investigating the implica
tions and applications of the sur
vey.
This is done, however, in the
book's outstanding article, "The
Kennedy Assassination and the
Nature of Political Commit
ment," by Sidney Verba. Here,
the author suggests that the
anlysis of public reaction to the
crisis demonstrates an emotion
al commitment to our political
system, overtly expressed only
in this type of crisis situation.
The Kennedy Assassination
and the American Public elabo
rately and often tediously de
scribes public reaction to the
crisis; the empirical description,
interesting behind its statistical
screen, lacks a set of implica
tions, a justification for its ex
istence beyond the pure intel
lectual pleasure of knowing
what Americans thought and
did.

the assassination sparkles with
personal incident and insight;
most of the articles in the fi
nal three sections, on the other
hand, freeze out the human fac
tor with an avalanche of statis
tics and methodology.
Unless he is well-versed in the
statistical idiom, the reader will
be lost in a desert of facts and
figures, which, if it can be sur
vived, hides an informative and
precise picture of how America
found out about and reacted to
Kennedy's death.

Public reaction was one of
grief. Negroes tended to be
more emotional than whites; a
parallel comparison holds be
tween Democrats and Republi
cans, and people with less and
more education. College students
and children reacted in patterns
similar to those of the general
public—except that children, un
like adults, did not admit that
they had cried.
Incoherence
This information is interest
ing; the data collected are cer
tainly overwhelming. What em
erges, however, is nothing but a
loose potpourri of percent
ages, mottled often with rep
etition of statistical conclusions.
One finds himself in a hurry to
seize any coherent set of implica
tions he can find.
Thus, we learn what the
changes were in public reaction
as time passed; we find very
little to suggest what these
changes meant. We learn that
the amount of grief was directly
related to the degree of post- as
sassination rededication, identifi
cation with Kennedy, and politi

cal involvement, bilt have no ap
plication for this information.
The introductory and conclud
ing essays attempt to provide a
structure for these surveys, but
they are merely summaries of
the statistics, neither suggesting
nor investigating the implica
tions and applications of the sur
vey.
This is done, however, in the
book's outstanding article, "The
Kennedy Assassination and the
Nature of Political Commit
ment," by Sidney Verba. Here,
the author suggests that the
anlysis of public reaction to the
crisis demonstrates an emotion
al commitment to our political
system, overtly expressed only
in this type of crisis situation.
The Kennedy Assassination
and the American Public elabo
rately and often tediously de
scribes public reaction to the
crisis; the empirical description,
interesting behind its statistical
screen, lacks a set of implica
tions, a justification for its ex
istence beyond the pure intel
lectual pleasure of knowing
what Americans thought and
did.
Oswald's bullet placed ordi
narily dispersed public attention
on one event and its after ef
fects. The Kennedy Assassina
tion confronted Americans with
a crisis matched in recent years
only by Pearl Harbor and the
death of FDR in evoking wide
spread public emotional re
sponse.
Yet even as most Americans
were trying to understand and
adjust to what had happened,
social scientists were organizing
to analyze public reaction. The
Kennedy Assassination and the
American Public, edited by Brad
ley S. Greenberg and Edwin B.
Parker, anthologizes some of
these studies.
While surveys result in sterile
figures, personal responses and
recollections, newspaper and
magazine articles, radio and tel
evision programs all presented
the assassination in human
terms. The story behind these
presentations, that of reporters
and newspaper and network ex
ecutives, is sketched in the first
of the book's four parts.
Thus, Tom Wicker, the New
Times' only reporter that
day in Dallas, recounts how he
tried to discover exactly what
was happening but had to rely
on instinct much of the time.
Harrison E. Salisbury and
Tom Petit reveal the problems
faced respectively by newspa
pers and television in keeping
the public accurately and quick
ly informed.
Interspersed with these per
sonal accounts are analyses of
'te role and effects of media in
the crisis: the back-patting gen
oal agrement is that the
abundance of information helped
avert public panic or accusing
expressions of ideological fervor.
Serious questions complement
the self-congratulations, how
ever, in an article by William L.
Rivers: the press, he says, has
a responsibility to report, not
manufacture news; catering to
public demand for detail should
not lead to identifying supposi
tion with fact.

ment," by Sidney Verba. Here,
the author suggests that the
anlysis of public reaction to the
crisis demonstrates an emotion
al commitment to our political
system, overtly expressed only
in this type of crisis situation.
The Kennedy Assassination
and the American Public elabo
rately and often tediously de
scribes public reaction to the
crisis; the empirical description,
interesting behind its statistical
screen, lacks a set of implica
tions, a justification for its ex
istence beyond the pure intel
lectual pleasure of knowing
what Americans thought and
did.
