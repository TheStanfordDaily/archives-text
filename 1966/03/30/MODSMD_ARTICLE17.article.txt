# 'Dark' Evaluated As Lyrical, Touching, Immature, Ingrown
## 
### DEBORAH HARTEL 
The Dark, a new novel by
John McGahern, is a wistful,
lovely piece of writing which
unfortunately never comes out
of itself—not enough at least to
offer the reader any truths
about life. It is not so much the
shortness of the novel (only 191
pages) that inhibits the com
munication betweeen the author
and reader, but the author's lack
of objectivity in viewing his sit
uation.
The main character, Paul Ma
honey, is a young Irish peasant
who is prevented from becoming
a Catholic priest by his own im
mensely inflated sense of guilt.
The boy's struggle with his guilt
complex could have been a mov
ing experience to the reader, but
the author has not put across
the intensity of the problem.
Mr. McGahern describes the
boy's feelings with a believable
interior monologue — his emo
tional associations are convinc
ing — but the author never
makes a mature judgment o*n
these feelings
Potentially Dramatic
For instance, in one potential
ly emotional sequence where the
boy is in the confession box
waiting to speak with the priest,

he envisions this situation as his
execution... "Was the flow of
time towards the minute of his
confession different from the
man in the condemned cell in
Mount joy? Here he'd only to
move nearer in the queue and
when it got to his turn draw the
heavy curtain aside, "no screams
at the sight of the scaffold, and
kneel in the darkness to wait."
The relation between the au
thor and his character does not
come through clearly, if at all.
Mr. McGahern is not involved
wi h his character in an objec
tive way, not using his charac
ter to put across any point or
idea. He refuses to comment on
the story he creates. When the
boy is accepted to a university,
he has chosen the only way he
feels he can accomplish any
thing worthwhile, since he is
not "good enough" to be a
priest.
Baffling Climax
His first night at the Univer
sity in Dublin is his first con
frontation with a new way of
life—it is the climax of all his
internal struggles, the decision
he has finally reached. However,
the boy's thoughts are obscure
at this point... "In the bed he
lay awake for long, listening to

the cars close and fade, and the
fascination of fact he knew noth
ing about go by on the concrete
underneath the vv in d o w."
A faithful representation of
a feeling, but the reader
is left with no idea of how the
author regards it. Whether it
was right for the boy to suc
cumb to his supposed guilt or
not, whether he should have at
tempted to rise above his psy
chological problem or not—these
are questions inevitably raised
hut never answered.
Luminous Impressions
The reader must admire Mr.
McGahern's uncanny fellowship
with children's minds; for the
near stream -of • consciousness
techniques which present them
seem neither over used nor self
conscious. His description of ma
terial objects is also excellent—
as it has a distinct fragile qual
ity somewhat similar to Nabo
kov... "He walked along the
rotting network of the canals,
stars caught between the invad
ing grass and reeds, the flour
mills luminous in the lamp
light." His presentation of sit
uations can be appreciated for
their poetic quality... "This
whole corner of river was a
painting of a Sunday, even the
children," but unfortunately
these never offer any idea to the
reader other than pictorial beau
ty.
What the author has done is
record his impressions; but
he makes no comment upon
them, draws out no meaning
from them. Perhaps The Dark
would be strong as a long de
scriptive essay; but as a novel it
is weak. Ultimately, it offers
no analysis of life, and the read
er is left with only the melan
choly sound of dead leaves blow
ing in the dust.
