# Anthology Glitters With Masters' Firsts
## 
### BILL BRINNON 
The Harvard Advocate Cen
tenial Anthology is a thick book:
there are 500 large pages, and the
works are prefaced by 15 pages
of something called the Introduc
tion. The works are short stories,
poems, essays, and editorials se
lected from Harvard's literary
magazine since its founding in
1866. No paperback can be fore
seen, but the book is still worth
considering; it will probably be
come a symbol of status in lit
erary circles if one believes the
remarks of the editor, Jonathan
D. Culler, set forth in the Intro
duction along with a fairly de
tailed history of the magazine.
The Harvard Advocate was es
tablished in 1866 as a substitute
for a belligerent student weekly,
which had just been dissolved by
the administration for some
strongly-worded "caricatures" of
trustees who upheld compulsory
attendance at chapel. In the be
lief that student interests in lo
cal controversies should be rep
resented in print, the new maga
zine promised to stand up to the
administration "assiduously yet
tactfully." From this time on,
says Cullers, the Advocate was
concerned with style.
Initial Stages
In the beginning, this concern
was devoted to coverage of foot
ball games and comments on
campus life: "The Matthews
pump has been without a handle
for at least three weeks, and the
southern part of the Yard is
very much inconvenienced."
Around the turn of the century,
however, a transition of focus
was in progress. In 1900, the
new editor, Wallace Stevens,
described the Harvard cheer.
A few years before, another
weekly paper, the Crimson, had
been introduced, and the rivalry
between the two plus the gravi
tation to the Advocate of several
"promising" young writers, in
cluding Stevens, E. A. Robinson,
George Lyman Kittredge, and
Witter Brynner, caused the old
er paper to become more and
more a magazine devoted to
creative writing.
In the next decade, T. S. Eliot
and Conrad Aiken were loyal
contributors. Through the years,
the Advocate has published
works of E. E. Cummings, Hen
ry Cabot Lodge, James Agee,
Ezra Pound, Henry Miller, Nor
man Mailer, Boris Pasternak,
Stephen Spender, Gregory Cor
so, and others, many while they
were undergraduates. The Advo
cate has become of international
importance with a broad range
of literary influence.

To the editors of the Centen
nial Anthology, this prestige of
a hundred well-known names
seems to be the most impressive
aspect of their book. In the In
troduction, Cullers goes to great
pains (for the reader, at least)
to reconstruct a self-commend
ing history of the magazine, in
cluding what it takes to make
a literary "ingroup": stimu
lating, witty people who hang
around an exclusive sanctum be
ing literary.
Unless one went or wanted to
go to Harvard, or if one would
like to establish another such
clique at Stanford, the Intro
duction is of little value. The
real attraction of the book will
lie in one's reaction to hearing
Leonard Bernstein, music critic
of the Advocate, who becomes
excited over the Schubert re
cordings of 1939 that he can't,
set the words down on the page
fast enough.
The attraction also lies in un
dergraduate Arthur Schlesin
ger's discussion of the future of
the Republican Party (in 1936);
or discovering lines in Wallace
Stevens' undergraduate poetiy
of 1900 that, twenty years later,
were metamorphosized into the
delicate closing lines of "Sunday
Morning": "At evening, casual
flocks of pigeons make/Ambigu
ous undulations as they sink,/
Downward to darkness, on ex
tended wings."
Revealltng Condemnation
Today, at a time of anti-war
demonstrations, Theodore
Ro os e v e 1 t's condemnation of
pacifism (he was a former edi
tor of the Advocate) is timely
and revealing: "The pacifist's
appropriate place is with the
college sissy who disapproves of
football or boxing because it is
rough."
The exclusivcness of the Ad
vocate Board, the plush dinner
parties, and the vari o us lo
cations of the editorial "homes"
of the magazine do not have the
same interest value as the first
published works of T. S. Eliot.
In his college poetry, we can see
him laying the groundork for
the dry, tired narrative voice of
his later work, at a time when
Longfellow was king of the
salons.
Glimmering: Skills
These comparisons of the
rough, unsure early works with
the recognized masterpieces for
which we know the writers
make the Centennial Advocate
an anthology of discovery; for
here we see the first glimmers
of masterful expression. The
Anthology is excellent reading,
not because it contains a num
ber of very famous names or be
cause the works are selected
from such a notable source as
the Advocate, but because the
works show us a very different
side, a more humble side, often
the very beginnings of the crea
tivity we now unquestionably
admire. The Anthology is excel
lent reading because it reveals
the struggles that led to some
of the finest expression of our
language.
