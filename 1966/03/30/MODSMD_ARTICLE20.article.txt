# UC Report Advocates Major Reforms
## 
### 
BERKELEY (CPS)—A Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
faculty committee has released
a massive document containing
42 recommendations on every
aspect of higher education here
from freshman admissions to
Ph.D-level work.
The 200-page report, which
proposes major reforms, essen
tially seeks "a new rapport be
tween faculty and student—
bringing them closer to the
needs of students," according to
Prof. Charles Muscatine of Ber
keley's English department. He
chaired the nine-man committee
which has been at work since
last April.
Acknowledging that his com
mittee was a direct response to
the demonstrations which "stop
ped the machine" at Berkeley
in the fall of 1964, Muscatine
adds that the report addresses
itself beyond the recent student
unrest "to the more profound
changes which are among the
causes of student unrest." The
report itself declares: "Almost
all the major elements that com
pose a university . . . are in an
unprecedented state of change.
The universities that survive and
prosper will be those which

learn to preserve their integrity
and stability while accepting
change."
The committee's most far
reaching recommendation in
volves a structure which would
attempt to promote continuous
but gradual change. It proposes
a Board of Educational Develop
ment, consisting of six faculty
members and presided over by a
new vice-chancellor, whose au
thority would range from ex
perimental courses to full, de
gree-granting programs which
might not fall under an estab
lished school or department of
the university.
"Initial encouragement and
continuing institutional support
is urgently needed for experi
mental programs," the report
states. "The regular machinery
is already only too busy with on
going programs. We need an en
during body with its own esprit

de corps which can devote itself
to long-term review ... to de
termine the needs and possibili
ties for innovation on this cam
pus."
The board could have fund
raising authority and would be
able both to initiate and to ad
minister programs up through
a period of five years. If a given
program were not adopted by
one of the established agencies
on campus after that period of
time, it would be dropped. The
board would also act as an acces
sory to experimental programs
within the other departments,
schools, and colleges which com
pose the Berkeley campus, but
it would have its own degree
granting authority, raising the
possibility of one of more four
year curricula.
More Flexibility
Besides offering potential for
"keeping the campus continu
ously abreast of its educational
opportunities," the board under
lies the committee's concern
with, in Muscatine's words,
"making the educational system
more flexible, more cognizant of
the student as an individual, and
and more adaptable to student
differences." Five specific pro
posals along this line involve:
• An experimental, campus
wide program of freshman sem
inars to begin next fall: groups
of no more than 12 students and
one faculty-member would work
without restrictions to subject
matter "as long as the orienta
tion is one of dialogue and the
spirit of free inquiry";
• Decreasing of lecture
courses in favor of more discus
sion sections, small classes, tu
torials, preceptorials and co-op
erative student self-instruction;
• Permission for students to
undertake supervised independ
ent study at any point in their
academic careers and involving
"any proportion of their time
justifiable by sound educational
reasons";
• Ad Hoc courses: courses
which might arise at any time
"to supply the relevant scholarly
and intellectual background to
subjects of active student con
cern." (The report lists "The
Idea and Uses of the Univers
ity," "Vietnam," and "Literary
Censorship" as three such
courses which might have been
appropriate in the past 16
months.);
• A new degree—Doctor of
Arts — at the graduate level
which would include all require
ments for a Ph.D except a dis
sertation.
Teaching Performance
The report rejects "the idea
of teachers who are not also
scholars" but acknowledges a
"danger that deficient perform
ance of teaching is not adequat
ely recognized and outstanding
performance given due credit."
It proposes that all recommenda

tions for tenure be accompanied
by a formal dossier on the can
didate's teaching performance.
In a related area, the report
recommends that the faculty de
sign an experimental student
evaluation form to be used in all
undergraduate courses. The
form would go directly to the
individual faculty members con
cerned.
The committee devoted sub
stantial attention to the grading
system. While concluding that
changes were necessary, it was
unable to reach any clear con
sencus and wound up recom
mending "only limited changes
together with a proposal for
further experiments." Recom
mendations included:
• The opportunity for stu
dents in good standing to take
one Pass-Not Passed course each
term which would give credit
towards a degree (although only
by special permission in a ma
jor) without counting in a
grade-point average;
• Courses offered in sequence
over two or three quarters in
which the student would receive
only one grade, at the end;
• Elimination of grades from
a student's grade-point average
for courses taken in his first
term of residence.
Frosh Admissions
Concerning freshman admis
sions, the committee urged rec
ognition that "the tone of the
(entire) campus will be set in
creasingly by the needs and val
ues of the graduate students."
It proposed that the admissions
office become more sensitive to
which students would "flourish
in this atmosphere" and which
would not.
