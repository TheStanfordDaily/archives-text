# Ky Facing First VN Political Crisis
## 
### PETER ARNETT Associated Press Writer 
Premier Nguyen Cao Ky is
sliding into his first major gov
ernment crisis beset by the
twin problems that plagued Ngo
Dinh Diem and Lt. Gen. Nguyen
Khanh, the two previous strong
men in Vietnam.
How can he keep extremists
off the streets and at the same
time retain the full backing of
the all-powerful military junta?
His survival will depend upon
a judicious use of power, per
suasion and tact, qualities that
have never been prominent in
Vietnamese politics.

For a time the powerful back
ing of the United States that Ky
enjoys seemed sufficient to
shield him from the vagaries of
local politics. But in this crisis,
the United States can only stand
self consciously aside, hopeful
that the vague anti-American
overtones of recent demonstra
tions don't build up.
Ky and the handful of gen
erals who share the pinnacle of
power in Vietnam brought much
of the trouble upon themselves.
They exposed a crack in the
ruling group by expelling one of
the most powerful members, Lt.
Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi, Com
mander of the Ist Military
Corps, early this month.
The explosion and the contro
versy within the military that it
caused, gave agitators and po
litical opportunists the chance
they wanted.
Long stifled by Premier Ky's
stand against opposition, these
student and Buddhist agitators
took to the streets in Saigon, at
Da Nang and at the Buddhist
center of Hue.
The demonstrations are get
ting bigger, the cries for the
ouster of Ky louder.
Puzzled
What does the opposition
want? Premier Ky, as were his
predecessors, must be puzzled.
The Buddhists say they desire a
civilian government and the im
plementation of a vague "four
point" program, including the
return to Vietnam of all ousted
generals.
The cry has been raised for
early general elections in a
country where at least as many
people are under the control of
the communists as are under the
control of the government.
Some agitators are complain
ing about U.S. bases along the
coast and in the mountains, sug
gesting that the government has
sold out to the Americans.
List Gets Longer
The list gets longer and the
situation is beginning to look
like the political turmoil of 1964
and early 1965.
So far Ky has concentrated on
speeches calling for public
unity.
U. S. authorities would like
him to take a firm stand against
the public demonstrations.
One American view is that
Communists are behind much of
the agitation. The argument is
made that the list of alleged
grievances seems aimed more at
creating confusion than solving
anything.
One American official com
mented: "Where does a Buddhist
end and a Communist begin?"
