### M. T. Minds 
In the rush of our busy courses
and the beginning of a new
quarter here at Stanford, it is
worth repeating the words of
Wordsworth, Emerson, and the
like. Let us pause for a moment
to meditate on those natural
and Godlike things about us. Let
us relish in our knowledge of
timeless and beautiful things.
For if this is March 30, can base
ball season be more than two
weeks off? Of course not; ma
jor leaguers have been training
for weeks now preparing them
selves for the next six months.
To help those Stanford men
and women who choose to go to
Candlestick Park to watch the
Giants play, we present a Guide
to National League Baseball for
the Stanford sports enthusiast.
First, last, and always there
is Willie Mays. Mays has led the
Giants in nearly all departments
for over a dozen years. In hit
ting, fielding, running, and
savoir faire he has no equal.
Magic Juan: Giant Swinger
But Mays is by no means the
only star of the Giants. There
is Juan Marichal, top right hand
er in baseball, who is also known
for his ability with a bat, as
John Roseboro will attest to. Or
lando Cepeda is another Giant
from Latin America with a
quick temper. He has well
earned his nickname of Baby
Bull, not for his temper but for
his locker room stories.
Then there are the near greats
of San Francisco. Who can ever
forget Willie McCovey's first
day in the majors. A perfect
four for four. All six feet and
four inches of him determined
to crush four Coors cans in four
tries in his lockerroom debut.
And how can we ever forget Jim
Davenport. Jim was voted the
Golden Glove in four successive
seasons. He beat out all other
infielders in the National
League for this, the sports
writers highest tribute. In Jim
the writers of the Examiner and
Chronicle impartially found the
best.
Jesus On Giants' Side
Playing next to Mays in the
outfield is Jesus (Hay-sus)
Alou. He is the only one of the
three Alou brothers still with
the Giants. He hasn't much
power, but as Wee Willie Keeler
said, he "hits 'em where they
ain't."
The prospects for the Giants
winning the pennant this year
are very good. Why not, the
obedient groundskeepers are in
as good a form as ever. If Bob
Shaw will ever show up to play
and leave his sheep ranch for
six months, the Giants' pitching
should be no problem. But there
are, much as we like to deny it,
other good players in the
League.
Even the Chicago Cubs have
their star. Long a second divi
sion team with a poor atten
dance record, the Cubs suffer
from an owner who does not
"believe" in installing night
lights at Wrigley Field, but The
Cubs now have a star to replace
Ernie Banks. He is their new
manager, Leo Durocher, famous
for his words, "No your Honor,
I never saw this girl before in
my life."
"66" Stuart" vs. "46" Mansfield
Now the Mets have acquired
some real ballplayers. At first
baÂ«e they will have Dick Stuart,
or as Dick prefers, Dick "66"

Stuart. The "66" refers to his
great year in the minors when
he hit 66 home runs. He finished
up that year with the old Holly
wood All-Stars, and he was the
talk of the town. While at a
cocktail party that fall in Holly
wood, Dick was approached by
Jayne Mansfield, who com
plained to him, "Gosh Mr. Stu
art, since you've come to town,
I can't get my name in the pa
pers any more."
To this Dick reared back and
fired, "Hell, Lady, that's cause
you didn't hit no 66 home runs."
In St. Louis, they're raving
about their new ball park, but
they've traded away all their
players. What's left now is Curt
Simmons, and what's left of
Curt Simmons is very little of
what used to be.
Cincinanti traded away Frank
Robinson last year, but they still
have Vada Pinson. Pinson is
known his speed. He has
been clocked at running from
home to first base in 3.2 seconds
and at signing his autograph at
8.7.
Baseball Pastimes
The Pittsburgh Pirates still
have their Roberto Clemente.
He is known throughout the
land for his contributions to
linguistic analysis, for he has
given such word insights as,
"What is bad ball? If I can hit
it, is good ball." Roberto with
his .220 swing still keeps hitting
.320.
Now there is a new team on
the scene; or rather an old team
with a new name. They are the
old Milwaukee Braves, the Old
er Boston Braves, and now the
Atlanta Federal Court Braves.
They have Hammerin' Hank
Aaron, and a more serious stu
dent of the game there never
was. Once in the World Series,
Hank came up to bat while Yogi
Berra was catching. Yogi point
ed out to Hank that his bat label
was upside-down. Hank astutely
replied, "I didn't come up here
to read."
The Braves also have Eddie
Mathews, the only man ever to
play for one team in three dif
ferent cities. But don't let the
toupee fool you, he's well in his
thirties.
Baseball And Its Glamor
To those who cry that the
stars of today are not as color
ful as those of twenty years ago,
we reply that this is rubbish.
What in 1940 could match the
color of Roger Maris sitting in
his home in Kansas City watch
ing baseball on television and
earning $70,000 doing it? What
could match the tension of
waiting to see if Houston's As
trodome will allow real grass to
grow? What could match the
excitement of seeing Cleveland's
Cadillac driving a relief pitcher
in from the bullpen for the first
time?
This then has been a brief
resume of what to look for
when you decide to lay aside
your troubles and fight the traf
fic up Bayshore to Candlestick
Park. These then are the top
stars of the National League
which fans around the world
cheer, and we have tried to pick
out for you the best of the con
tending teams. And as a final
tribute to the fans of the Dodg
ers, heretofore unmentioned, let
us note in passing two great
stars, Sandy Koufax and Don
Drysdale, now pitching for
MGM.
