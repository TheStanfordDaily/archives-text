# It's Been A Long, Long War For Conscientious Objectors

conscientious objection and non-cooperation as
alternatives to bearing arms. This article deals
with conscientious objection.)

"War will exist until that distant day when
the conscientious objector enjoys the same repu
tation and prestige that the warrior does today."
â€”John Fitzgerald Kennedy
The current state of world affairs has greatly
increased the popularity of conscientious objec
tion as a moral alternative to bearing arms.
On the nation's campuses, hundreds of male
students are flooding the counseling centers for
conscientious objectors. From Washington, D. C.,
threats of federal investigation and accusations
of treason filter through the wire services.
300,000 CO's
According to the American Friends Service
Committee in San Francisco, there are currently
300,000 conscientious objectors in this country.
The figure is constantly climbing as young men
increasingly refuse to bear arms in Vietnam.
Robert Catlett, a counselor for prospective
conscientious objectors at Turn Toward Peace,
said recently that its counseling rate had tripled
since February, 1965.
The Central Committee for Conscientious Ob
jectors in Philadelphia, which started to atrophy
a few years ago for lack of business, was
swamped by a deluge of mail requesting advice
and information.
As an answer to military conscription, con
scientious objection owes its beginning to the
Militia Act of 1792, which compelled every white
male over the age of 18 to enlist in his state
militia.
$300 Release
Conscientious objectors during the Civil War,
mostly Quakers and Mennonites, were exempted
from military service either by procuring a sub
stitute or by paying the government $300.
During World War I, when non-involvement
seemed impossible, President Woodrow Wilson
pushed leigslation through Congress that obli
gated all men between the ages of 21 and 30 to
register for the draft and serve for the duration
of the war if called.
In addition, Wilson's legislation allowed for
members of "well-recognized" religious sects to
serve in non-combat units in the Army.

Caleb Foote, professor of law at the University
of California at Berkeley, and an authority on
the legal aspects of conscientious objection, esti
mates that about 5,000 conscientious objectors
were convicted in civilian courts during World
War I and given either prison terms or fines. An
additional 500 persons were court-martialed and
sent to prison for their conscientious objection.
Peace-Time Conscription
Peacetime conscription was first legalized in
1940 as it became inevitable that United States
neutrality was a mere chimera as Hitler's army
ripped through Poland.
The legislation, which passed the House of
Representatives with a paper-thin margin of
one vote, provided non-combatant service for
those whose religious beliefs, based on a Supreme
Being, would not permit them to bear arms.
The present Universal Military Training and
Service Act grants conscientious objector status
to those who have a "belief in a relation to a
Supreme Being involving duties superior to those
arising from any human relation, but does not in
clude essentially political, sociological, or philo
sophical views or a merely personal moral code."
In 1965, the U. S. Court of Appeals upheld the
case of an agnostic, Daniel Seeger, to obtain C.O.
status. The court said, "...Commitment to a
moral ideal is for many the equivalent of what
was historically considered the response to di
vine commands."
Remaining Difficulties
Although the court expanded the grounds for
exemption as a conscientitious objector if one
had a consistent belief "parallel to that filled by
the orthodox belief in God," there remain great
difficulties facing a prospective C.O. who bases
his appeal merely on moral or political grounds.
The vast majority of those who refused a pair
of GI boots and an M-l rifle were formulating
a new definition of patriotism.
Service to one's country was taking new
forms, such as VISTA, the Peace Corps, and
countless variations of social work.
But the new patriotism is faced with a seem
ingly anachronistic draft policy that grants de
ferments only to those who have the time, en
ergy, persistence and education to grapple with
the rigorous and exhausting road of appeal
boards, cross examination by hearing officers and
the scrutiny of federal officials.
