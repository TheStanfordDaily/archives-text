# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Nobody Talks Things Over 
### 
Editor, Tho Daily:
I am not surprised that the
United States cannot or will not
communicate with the Viet
Cong. It is irrelevant whether
I believe this to be improvident,
for my object here is not to dis
cuss the war.
GiveYi the wisdom of com
municating with one's adver
saries, we here at Stanford have
evinced a marked inability to
do so.
At a school where some of the
most promising of our genera
tion complete their formal and
most rigorous education, wo are
unable to communicate with an
administration of equally com
petent men, and we are unable
to reach those who hold differ
ent views on the war in Viet
nam.
It is ironic that many who feel
strongly enough about a sub
stantive issue to write a letter
or take a stand, usually do so in
such a manner as to offend and
alienate the adversary. Means
become ends for these people in
as much as their letters serve as
emotional diatribes against op
posing views.
It is almost as disturbing to
find in conversation some excel
lent ideas which are never
shared; these are opinions which
need to be broadcast, but ironi
cally the most carefully delib
erated views seem to be most
carefully and deliberately kept
personal.
As I said, it is not surprising
that communication is so diffi
cult with the enemy in Vietnam,
for we seem to be unable to talk
even among ourselves.

• Making Excuses
Editor, The Daily:
There has been, there is and
will be much talk about the
"morality" or "immorality" of
the war in Viet Nam. I wish I
could say whether I am "for" or
"against" it. Of course, li k e
everyone who does not have a
direct interest in the war, which
is almost everybody, I am

against war! But sometimes,
war is necessary, e.g. our fight
against the Nazis during World
War 11.
Perhfaps our fight in Viet
Nam is also necessary . . . but
then, why, if we fight evil in
Vietnam, if we interfere in the
Dominican Republic, why don't
we do anything at all about
those martyrs of fascism at the
other end of that island, i.e. why
don't we help the Haitian peo
ple? Is it because Fascism is not
felt to be a threat to us, while
Communism is? Do we really
care about people? Or is not war
against Communism just a war
we are fighting for ourselves
and only for ourselves? At least
let us not pretend that we are
crusading against "evil"; this is
just a good excuse we give our
selves, and we are fooling none
of our neighbors in the world.

• Enjoying War
Editor, The Daily:
Though the recent press con
ference (March 1, 19G6) held by
Secretary of Defense, Robert
McNamara, was widely covered
by the local news media, few
papers chose to print the most
important statement attributed
to the Secretary. Pounding on
the table in front of him as if
in frustration, he declared, "We
(Americans) are a peculiar peo
ple. We should be proud of ful
filling our commitments ... no
nation in history has accom
plished what we have- deploy
ing 300,000 people 10.000 miles
away. . .
No matter how one feels
toward the War in Vietnam, this
remark by Mr. McNamara has
serious implications for those of
us who happen to be "peculiar"
people. Are we odd because we
question the glory in deploying
300,000 men who are to kill and
be killed? Is it not somewhat
anachronistic and chauvinistic
for the United States to pride it
self on "military preparedness
and flexibility?" Is McNamara's
exhortation just possibly an at

tempt to lull the consensus mind
into the "peacefulness and tran
quility that comes with war,"
that Randolph Bourne warned
us of during World War I?
Or more positively, has it be
come impossible for this govern
ment to consider the American
people as anything other than
peculiar simply because they
don't enjoy war as much as Mc-
Namara, S t en n is, Westmore
land, et. al.? There are still just
a few things, Mr. McNamara,
that this something less than a
Great Society cannot do as well
as deploy troops. It cannot pro
vide Negroes with the right to
vote and hold office. It cannot
eliminate crime from the streets.
It cannot rid the air of pollution
nor our rivers of garbage. Per
haps what really makes us pe
culiar is the 45 per cent among
us who can't recall the names
of their representatives who
voted us into this obsession with
troop deployment.

• Dead Stanford Red
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman, I have been at
Stanford for only six months,
but during that time I have had
numerous occasions to witness
that amazing phenomenon
known as the "Stanford spirit".
One of the best and most recent
examples of this "spirit" is to
be found in the Stanford basket
ball team which finished an
other disappointingly mediocre
season. They proved they were
capable of being one of the best
teams on the coast by beating
both USF and UCLA*. All too
often, however, they were con
tent to sit back in complacency,
barely beating teams they could
have run off the court, and
losing to others they should
easily have* beaten. Stanford
managed to finish the season on
a typically sour note by losing
to a Cal squad simply because
they didn't try. Cal made Stan
ford look sick despite a con
siderable height disadvantage
because they cared enough

about winning to run, jump and
exhibit the aggressiveness which
Stanford completely lacked.
With the immense talent pres
ently on the Stanford freshman
teams, we have a chance to
emerge in the near future as
one of the foremost athletic
powers in the nation. If the class
of '69 allows itself to become in
fected with the "Stanford spir
it", however, we will remain as
complacent and mediocre as al
ways. In short, it's time the stu
dents and players at Stanford
decided to take some pride in
their school. They might be sur
prised at what can happen.

• Brothers, Sisters
Editor, The Daily:
I have read of the work of
students of American universi
ties, particularly Harvard, in
working with and assisting
young adults in resocialization
after mental illness.
I am the friend and sponsor
of a youth group of about 18
who have varying handicaps.
Some are slow learners, others
have dropped out of high school
due to emotional problems.
Do you suppose there might
be Stanford students interested
in this group? I am thinking of
one young lady, a high school
graduate, who cannot get a job
she can keep due to poor self
image. I am thinking of another
boy who dropped out of school
at age 16 and at age 20 is a
"lost soul". If these young
adults could be adopted by a
"big sister" or "big brother" at
Stanford, it would be truly a
marvelous morale-booster! One
of the just got a civil
service job in spite of his handi
cap and the rest of the group,
although rejoicing in his good
fortune, are more frustrated
than ever.
My phohe number is DA 5-
8228; I would welcome any in
quiries from any students inter
ested in this project.
