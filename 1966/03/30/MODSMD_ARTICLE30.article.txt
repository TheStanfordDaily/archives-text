# The 						Commie-Chasers Get W.E.B. DuBois And Boys
## 
### Jim Sayre 
It is hard to tell if Katzenbach
and Co. are really serious in
their recent effort to get the
W.E.B. Dußois Clubs to register
as "Communist-front" organiza
tions. When I first read of this
action of the U.S. Justice Dept.,
I was disgusted and angry. It
seemed that Johnson was abus
ing hi s extensive executive
powers by attempting to smear
some of his more bitter anti-
Vietnam war critics.
Last Straw
The bombings of the national
headquarters of the Dußois
Clubs in San Francisco a couple
days after the Katzenbach an
nouncement was the last straw.
It seemed like a new wave of
McCarthyism was beginning to
stir in the land. Since I was only
in grade school at the time Sen
ator McCarthy was conducting
his little Red witchhunt, I never
really had the opportunity to
publicly stand up and buck the
tide of anti-communist hysteria.
This time I am old enough to
be directly involved in partisan
politics; I decided to write to the
Dußois Clubs and find out their
political positions. The following
paragraph is a summary of their
positions as taken from one of
their information sheets:
"The Dußois Clubs, named af
ter W.E.B. Dußois, a great
American Negro writer, educa
tor and freedom fighter, were
founded on a nationwide scale
in June, 1964. The national or
ganization grew out of many lo
cal groups and individuals who
had been active in the movement
for peace, civil rights, an end to
unemployment and poverty, and
an extension of democracy.
"The Dußois Clubs participate

in action around such issues as
these, and in addition carry on
programs of study and discus
sion. The basis of the Dußois
Clubs program is the considera
tion of socialism as an alterna
tive to the present system.
While not all Dußois Club mem
bers are socialists, they are all
interested in learning about so
cialism, and most of the mem
bership considers a transition to
a socialist society in the United
States as the only way that the
fundamental problems of pover
ty, discrimination and war will
be solved. The Dußois Club
maintains, however, that such a
change in American society can
only come about when the ma
jority of the American people
desire a socialist system."
All this seemed reasonable
enough. And not even a hint of
pink! (except in the minds of
those who can see the I.C.C. (In
ternational Communist Conspir
acy) behind every attempt to
extend the blessings of liberty,
justice and democracy to some
of our more oppressed and un
derprivileged citizens).
Boys Club
But wait . . . we now hear
from Mr. Dick Dixon, that great
old Commie - chaser and Red
paint-thrower. It seems that
some of the more fanatic (and
hard of Hearing) right-wing ex
tremists had started threatening
the Boys Clubs of America (by
mistake, presumably, due to the
voiced likeness to the wicked
Dußois Clubs). Mr. Nixon was
very troubled by the misplaced
smear, because he is the nation
al board chairman of the Boys
Clubs.
Imagine, Dick Nixon as the
head of a "Communist-front" or
ganization; the mind boggles at
the prospect! However, our for
mer Vice-President had a rather
smashing reply; he saw the con
fusion over names as "an al
most classic example of Commu
nist deception and duplicity ..."
Unfortunately, Mr. Nixon had
failed to check up on a few
facts; for example, the fact that
Dr. Dußois was born in 1868, a
full 38 years before the Boys
Clubs were founded. It would
seem that he had never even
heard of Dr. Dußois. Oh well,
he always did seem to have trou
ble getting his facts straight...
Reaction
My story is not yet finished;
a reaction has developed against
the Red smear, the bombing and
the mob violence directed
against a Dußois Club rally in
New York City. New chapters
of the Dußois Clubs have been
formed at several colleges across
the country—among them, Yale
and the University of Michigan.
Also, the American Civil Lib
erties Union has protested the
Justice Department's action and
has urged the Government to
drop its proceedings against the
Dußois Clubs. The ACLU has
termed the Government's action
as an attack on political dissent.
After careful consideration I
have decided that the only
proper action that I can take is
to join the W.E.B. Dußois Clubs.
Their new national headquar
ters is located (mad bombers,
please note) at 1830 Fell Street,
San Francisco. I urge those
among my fellow students who
both favor civil liberties and op
pose our war in Vietnam to seri
ously consider joining the Du-
Bois Clubs.

bership considers a transition to
a socialist society in the United
States as the only way that the
fundamental problems of pover
ty, discrimination and war will
be solved. The Dußois Club
maintains, however, that such a
change in American society can
only come about when the ma
jority of the American people
desire a socialist system."
All this seemed reasonable
enough. And not even a hint of
pink! (except in the minds of
those who can see the I.C.C. (In
ternational Communist Conspir
acy) behind every attempt to
extend the blessings of liberty,
justice and democracy to some
of our more oppressed and un
derprivileged citizens).
Boys Club
But wait . . . we now hear
from Mr. Dick Dixon, that great
old Commie - chaser and Red
paint-thrower. It seems that
some of the more fanatic (and
hard of Hearing) right-wing ex
tremists had started threatening
the Boys Clubs of America (by
mistake, presumably, due to the
voiced likeness to the wicked
Dußois Clubs). Mr. Nixon was
very troubled by the misplaced
smear, because he is the nation
al board chairman of the Boys
Clubs.
Imagine, Dick Nixon as the
head of a "Communist-front" or
ganization; the mind boggles at
the prospect! However, our for
mer Vice-President had a rather
smashing reply; he saw the con
fusion over names as "an al
most classic example of Commu
nist deception and duplicity ..."
Unfortunately, Mr. Nixon had
failed to check up on a few
facts; for example, the fact that
Dr. Dußois was born in 1868, a
full 38 years before the Boys
Clubs were founded. It would
seem that he had never even
heard of Dr. Dußois. Oh well,
he always did seem to have trou
ble getting his facts straight...
Reaction
My story is not yet finished;
a reaction has developed against
the Red smear, the bombing and
the mob violence directed
against a Dußois Club rally in
New York City. New chapters
of the Dußois Clubs have been
formed at several colleges across
the country—among them, Yale
and the University of Michigan.
Also, the American Civil Lib
erties Union has protested the
Justice Department's action and
has urged the Government to
drop its proceedings against the
Dußois Clubs. The ACLU has
termed the Government's action
as an attack on political dissent.
After careful consideration I
have decided that the only
proper action that I can take is
to join the W.E.B. Dußois Clubs.
Their new national headquar
ters is located (mad bombers,
please note) at 1830 Fell Street,
San Francisco. I urge those
among my fellow students who
both favor civil liberties and op
pose our war in Vietnam to seri
ously consider joining the Du-
Bois Clubs.
It is hard to tell if Katzenbach
and Co. are really serious in
their recent effort to get the
W.E.B. Dußois Clubs to register
as "Communist-front" organiza
tions. When I first read of this
action of the U.S. Justice Dept.,
I was disgusted and angry. It
seemed that Johnson was abus
ing hi s extensive executive
powers by attempting to smear
some of his more bitter anti-
Vietnam war critics.
Last Straw
The bombings of the national
headquarters of the Dußois
Clubs in San Francisco a couple
days after the Katzenbach an
nouncement was the last straw.
It seemed like a new wave of
McCarthyism was beginning to
stir in the land. Since I was only
in grade school at the time Sen
ator McCarthy was conducting
his little Red witchhunt, I never
really had the opportunity to
publicly stand up and buck the
tide of anti-communist hysteria.
This time I am old enough to
be directly involved in partisan
politics; I decided to write to the
Dußois Clubs and find out their
political positions. The following
paragraph is a summary of their
positions as taken from one of
their information sheets:
"The Dußois Clubs, named af
ter W.E.B. Dußois, a great
American Negro writer, educa
tor and freedom fighter, were
founded on a nationwide scale
in June, 1964. The national or
ganization grew out of many lo
cal groups and individuals who
had been active in the movement
for peace, civil rights, an end to
unemployment and poverty, and
an extension of democracy.
"The Dußois Clubs participate

in action around such issues as
these, and in addition carry on
programs of study and discus
sion. The basis of the Dußois
Clubs program is the considera
tion of socialism as an alterna
tive to the present system.
While not all Dußois Club mem
bers are socialists, they are all
interested in learning about so

New York City. New chapters
of the Dußois Clubs have been
formed at several colleges across
the country—among them, Yale
and the University of Michigan.
Also, the American Civil Lib
erties Union has protested the
Justice Department's action and
has urged the Government to
drop its proceedings against the
Dußois Clubs. The ACLU has
termed the Government's action
as an attack on political dissent.
After careful consideration I
have decided that the only
proper action that I can take is
to join the W.E.B. Dußois Clubs.
Their new national headquar
ters is located (mad bombers,
please note) at 1830 Fell Street,
San Francisco. I urge those
among my fellow students who
both favor civil liberties and op
pose our war in Vietnam to seri
ously consider joining the Du-
Bois Clubs.
It is hard to tell if Katzenbach
and Co. are really serious in
their recent effort to get the
W.E.B. Dußois Clubs to register
as "Communist-front" organiza
tions. When I first read of this
action of the U.S. Justice Dept.,
I was disgusted and angry. It
seemed that Johnson was abus
ing hi s extensive executive
powers by attempting to smear
some of his more bitter anti-
Vietnam war critics.
Last Straw
The bombings of the national
headquarters of the Dußois
Clubs in San Francisco a couple
days after the Katzenbach an
nouncement was the last straw.
It seemed like a new wave of
McCarthyism was beginning to
stir in the land. Since I was only
in grade school at the time Sen
ator McCarthy was conducting
his little Red witchhunt, I never
really had the opportunity to
publicly stand up and buck the
tide of anti-communist hysteria.
This time I am old enough to
be directly involved in partisan
politics; I decided to write to the
Dußois Clubs and find out their
political positions. The following
paragraph is a summary of their
positions as taken from one of
their information sheets:
"The Dußois Clubs, named af
ter W.E.B. Dußois, a great
American Negro writer, educa
tor and freedom fighter, were
founded on a nationwide scale
in June, 1964. The national or
ganization grew out of many lo
cal groups and individuals who
had been active in the movement
for peace, civil rights, an end to
unemployment and poverty, and
an extension of democracy.
"The Dußois Clubs participate

in action around such issues as
these, and in addition carry on
programs of study and discus
sion. The basis of the Dußois
Clubs program is the considera
tion of socialism as an alterna
tive to the present system.
While not all Dußois Club mem
bers are socialists, they are all
interested in learning about so
cialism, and most of the mem
bership considers a transition to
a socialist society in the United
States as the only way that the
fundamental problems of pover
ty, discrimination and war will
be solved. The Dußois Club
maintains, however, that such a
change in American society can
only come about when the ma
jority of the American people
desire a socialist system."
All this seemed reasonable
enough. And not even a hint of
pink! (except in the minds of
those who can see the I.C.C. (In
ternational Communist Conspir
acy) behind every attempt to
extend the blessings of liberty,
justice and democracy to some
of our more oppressed and un
derprivileged citizens).
Boys Club
But wait . . . we now hear
from Mr. Dick Dixon, that great
old Commie - chaser and Red
paint-thrower. It seems that
some of the more fanatic (and
hard of Hearing) right-wing ex
tremists had started threatening
the Boys Clubs of America (by
mistake, presumably, due to the
voiced likeness to the wicked
Dußois Clubs). Mr. Nixon was
very troubled by the misplaced
smear, because he is the nation
al board chairman of the Boys
Clubs.
Imagine, Dick Nixon as the
head of a "Communist-front" or
ganization; the mind boggles at
the prospect! However, our for
mer Vice-President had a rather
smashing reply; he saw the con
fusion over names as "an al
most classic example of Commu
nist deception and duplicity ..."
Unfortunately, Mr. Nixon had
failed to check up on a few
facts; for example, the fact that
Dr. Dußois was born in 1868, a
full 38 years before the Boys
Clubs were founded. It would
seem that he had never even
heard of Dr. Dußois. Oh well,
he always did seem to have trou
ble getting his facts straight...
Reaction
My story is not yet finished;
a reaction has developed against
the Red smear, the bombing and
the mob violence directed
against a Dußois Club rally in
New York City. New chapters
of the Dußois Clubs have been
formed at several colleges across
the country—among them, Yale
