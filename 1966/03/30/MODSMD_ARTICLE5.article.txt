# Art Series Opens With Rodin Talk
## 
### 
Dr. Albert E. Elsen, professor of
art at the University of Indiana and
former visiting professor at Stan
ford, will speak tonight at 8 o'clock
in the Physics Lecture Hall.
His talk, "Rodin and the Begin
nings of Modern Sculpture," will open
a six week lecture series, sponsored
by the University's Art and Architec
ture Department and the Committee
for Art at Stanford.
Professor Elsen is one of the fore
most authorities on the work and life
of Auguste Rodin, the French sculp
ture, who —after a temporary eclipse
—is now considered among the great
est artists of the 19th and 20th cen
turies.
Elsen helped organize the Rodin
exhibition for the Museum of Mod-

ern Art in New York, which, after its
opening in 1963, was shown at the
San Francisco Museum of the Palace
of the Legion of Honor in 1964. This
exhibition and several recent books
—among them Elsen's Rodin's Gates
of Hells—have been mainly responsi
ble for the current re-appraisal of Ro
din's stature among modern artists.
After receiving his doctorate from
Columbia University, Elsen spent the
year 1963-64 at Stanford. He is also
an authority in the field of 20th cen
tury art.
Professor Elsen has also taken a
leading part in setting up a national
organization to help Negro colleges
and universities become effective in
the training of art historians and
artists.
