# SPCC To Orient, Recruit Students
## 
### MARK TAPIA 
Today the Stanford Peace Corps
Committee (SPCC) is launching its
Spring Quarter recruitment and orien
tation program. SPCC was organized
by returning Peace Corps volunteers
on campus and has the full sanction
of the Peace Corps in Washington.
SPCC is organizing several programs
to acquaint the students with the
Peace Corps, to give them a more
realistic picture of it and to provide
potential volunteers with experience.
The program will make the Peace
Corps a greater part of the university.
Stanford was recently cited by the
Peace Corps for having the largest
percentage of volunteers per capita
and for being the school most favored
by returning volunteers. At present
there are 35 returning Peace Corps
members on campus. Thus Stanford
seemed to be the ideal place to start
the program.
'Impact'
The first meeting will be at 4 p.m.
today in the large lounge of Tresid
der Memorial Union. Entitled "Impact
of the Peace Corps," the program
will inform people about both the
Peace Corps and the spring quarter
program.
A panel discussion will be led by
Maury Sterns, a Peace Corps Volun
teer from Peru, where he worked on
the University Teaching Program.
With him will be Ken Harding from
Peru, Kay Meister, who returned
from the West Cameroons after hav
ing served two months, Venkata
Rao (visiting scholar from India),
George Parker from Peru, who work
ed for the Credit Cooperative pro
gram. They will discuss their stay in
the Peace Corps from various angles.
Throughout the quarter former
Peace Corps volunteers will deliver
talks on the various areas. The talks
will be supplemented by color slides
taken by the volunteers.
Natives of the area will also help'
orient the prospective volunteer.
To give the applicant experience,

"on the job" training will be initiated.
Students will be asked to teach a
class to Mexican-Americans, or Puer
to Ricans, using the micro-teaching
technique. The student teacher will
be filmed by a television camcra and
then the tapes will be played back
to him so he can correct his mistakes.
They may teach in the Ravenswood
district, participate in neighborhood
clean-up campaigns, or do other social
work in minority areas. In addition,

seminars will be held in community
development. At least 105 Peace
Corps volunteers are expected to par
ticipate in this program.
The SPCC has a booth on White
Plaza where there are brochures and
further information on the program.
The Peace Corps office is located in
the dining hall of the old Union build
ing. There is a hot line to Washing
ton there to help speed the processing
of forms.
