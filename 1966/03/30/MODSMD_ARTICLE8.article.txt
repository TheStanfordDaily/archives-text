# Student Grade Reports Optional For Deferment
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
Grades will be sent to local draft
boards only with individual student
permission, according to the campus
National Service office.
Walter J. Findeisen, who serves as
a liaison with the Selective Service
Syetem and veteran's benefit pro
gram, said a questionnaire would be
sent to all students in mid-April or
early May which would ask students
to release their grades as a basis for
2S classification and student defer
ment.
Voluntary Reporting
Findeisen said submission of grades
would be totally voluntary, but he
urged all students to comply with
board requests. "In the majority of
cases," he said, "the student will bene
fit most by supplying as much infor
mation as possible to enhance the pos
sibility of deferment. It is the respon
sibility of the individual registrant to
keep his local board informed of his
status."

The National Service director also
has strongly encouraged "everybody,
without reservation," to take the Se
lective Service Qualifying exams. "It
will be just one more reason for a
board to give a man a deferment," he
said.
A problem of administering the
qualifying test at overseas campuses
has arisen, however. At present, no

provisions have been made for over
seas students to take the tests. Uni
versity officials have met in Washing
ton with several Selective Service of
ficials, including General Hershey, but
no solution has been firmly agreed
upon.
High Draft Call
Meanwhile, the defense department
yesterday issued a call for 34,600 men
in May, the highest monthly quota
since January. All the May draftees
will be assigned to the Army, the Pen
tagon has said.
This month's quota originally was
set at 32,900 but was reduced when
enlistments exceeded expectations.
At Stanford between twenty and
thirty students have been drafted so
far this year. One sophomore, accord
ing to Findeisen, had an A-average
and advanced standing, but his appeal
for deferment was denied.
"We did everything possible to find
out why this student was taken," Fin
deisen laments, "but usually you just
don't get explanations."
