PASADENA (AP) —Folks who re
ported red, blinking, rotating uniden
tified flying objects here were right.
They were unidentified flying objects
—an experiment in gullibility.
"We succeeded beyond our wildest
hopes. We suckered everybody, ex
cept we were found out," exulted Jim
Gould, 20, a student at the California
Institute of Technology.
Gould, and an unidentified number
of fellow students residing in Flem
ing House, a dormitory, admitted to
day that the mysterious objects sight
ed in the night sky Monday were the
fruit of their fertile, inventive minds.
A local newspaper and radio sta
tion, Gould said, "Gobbled everything,
hook, line and sinker."
The students said the objects were
nothing more than plastic balloons
with red flares dangling from rotat
ing blades. The students said they
built airfoils that made the balloons
rotate in the heat of the flares.
The object of the experiment, Gould
said, besides testing the public's gulli
bility, was to prove:
"That these UFOs were launched
by persons of superior intelligence.
There is indeed such intelligent life—
on earth."
The students said they launched
their first baloon last Wednesday
night, with two flares attached. Also
aboard was an aluminum reflector
meant to make the object look 300
feet long on radar.
Police, quoting some of the reports
they heard, said people told of the
UFO in awed voices, saying "It zip
ped along at a fantastic speed, there
was the smell of perfume in the air,
a whistling noise, and white and blue
lights."
Explained Gould: "We could have
made them do fantastic things, like
zip across the sky, but we preferred to
keep the experiment simple. We were
playing it for laughs." The prank was
exposed by a woman employe of Cal
Tech who witnessed the Monday night
launching and who later gave police
the boys' identity. Gould was inter
viewed at his dormitory-
