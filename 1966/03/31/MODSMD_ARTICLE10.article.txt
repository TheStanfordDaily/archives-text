# SSRF To Propose Changes In Girls' Social Regulations
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
Tonight Legislature will consider a
bill which would abolish social regula
tions for all Stanford women except
first-quarter freshmen.
The proposal is sponsored by Stan
ford Sexual Rights Forum President
Jim Sayre and four other LASSU rep
resentatives.
The bill includes a clause stating
that after completion of one quarter of
college work, "there shall be no restric
tions on late leaves or overnights."
The bill also contains a section con
cerning a voluntary sign-out procedure
where women would leave sealed mes
sages "stating whom she is with,
where she expects to be and any other
information she wishes. She shall
mark on the outside the time and date
she wishes the message to be opened
if she has not returned."
The bill stipulates that each living
group would determine its own pro
cedure for opening the messages.
It also provides that the same so
cial regulations which are in effect
would apply to first quarter freshmen
women, but that enforcement of late
leave rules would be on the honor
system.

A survey by the Social Regulations
committee will be forthcoming to re
evaluate the effectiveness and neces
sity for women's social restrictions.
Another resolution to be proposed
by Carl E. Anderson condemns the
Political Union for paying Senator Al
bert Gore an honorarium of $1500 for
a speech delivered at Stanford last
quarter.
"Fifteen hundred dollars," Anderson
said, "is an exorbitant amount for
such a program."
The legislation would provide for
the establishment of a committee to
investigate the practices of the Po
litical Union as to speaker selection
and fees paid out.
In other business, Speaker Jay Ka
dane will give a "state of the Legisla
ture" address, reporting on the prog
ress behind and the business before
LASSU.
Included in the speaker's report will
be a report on the actions of the Com
mittee of Fifteen.
The meeting will begin at 7:30 in
room 320.
