# Teacher Corps Organized To Aid In Slum Classrooms
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
Office of Education estimates
there is a teacher shortage of
at least 100,000 a year arid that
there are about 80,000 teachers
with substandard credentials.
Thus, with a great demand on
existing teachers, schools in
"poverty pockets" such as Har
lem, Appalachia, Watts and
Jackson, Miss., lose out to
wealthier more "respectable sta
tus symbols."
The Teacher Corps will try to
combat this by putting 3,750
men and women in slum schools
by this fall and having 10,000
volunteers in service by 1969.
A spokesman for the Office
of Education said they realized
the Teacher Corps is not the fi
nal answer to the overall lack
of teachers so the program is de
signed to interest college grad
uates in teaching as a career as
well as reach the children in
poverty areas.
The corps is a partnership be
tween the Federal government,
universities and local school
boards to place teachers in areas
not likely to attract talented
teachers.
Appropriations
Expected appropriations for
the Teacher Corps are $3.2 mil

lion below what was originally
requested hut corps officials do
not expect this to seriously af
fect the program in the long
run.
The National Teacher Corps
was created by the Higher Edu
cation Act of 1965. Congress is
now considering a $10 million
Supplemental Teacher Corps
Appropriation with $31 million
requested for the 1967 Teacher
Corps budget.
There will be two types of vol
unteers, both serving two years.
The first is career teachers with
a minimum of five years gen
eral teaching experience or three
years of teaching in poverty
areas. They will lead teams of
one to five teacher interns.
The second group is the teach
er-intern. The requirement for
this group, which will make up
three-fourths of the corps, is a
college degree. The program
does not require experience or a
teaching certificate.
Study While Teaching
The interns will teach only two
or three classes, supplementing
the local teaching staff. The rest
of their time will be spent in
school and community related
activities and graduate study
leading to a master's degree.

Pre-service training will con
sist of three months of study at
a university during which time
the interns will earn some aca
demic credit. The emphasis will
be on the sociology of poverty:
why it exists, the techniques of
teaching the disadvantaged and
communicating with these
groups.
The purpose of this training
is to help the volunteer serve tiot
only as a teacher, but almost to
"take the place of a literate par
ent." The Office of Education
estimates that children in pov
erty areas are often as much as
two years behind when they be
gin kindergarten. They face a
new experience in books, pencil,
paper, unfamiliar rules and
schedules. These cultural handi
caps must be overcome before
the child can even begin to
learn.
Lighted Schoolhouse
Special projects carried on by
Teacher Corps volunteers will
include language (proper Eng
lish) labs, remedial reading, late
study halls, tours to museums,
etc. The concept is one of the
"lighted schoolhouse" — a place
that is open beyond class activi
ty and helps the students under
stand why education is impor
tant.
Selection is a three-fold proc
ess: (1) the application must be
accepted by the National Teach
er Corps in Washington, (2) the
pre-service course must be
passed, and (3) the teacher must
be selected by the local school
board.
The training will be designed
and run by the universities. Pre
service training and graduate
study for the master's degree
will probably, although not defi
nitely, be obtained at the same
university. Office of Education
officials are hoping to train vol
unteers close to the area they
will be serving. In that case,
training and graduate study
would probably be at the same
school.
School districts eligible for
Teacher Corps Volunteers are
those in which the population
earns less than $3,000 a year.
The schools must request the
teachers, place them, and pay
them according to the local
scale. In return, the school sys
tems will be reimbursed by the
federal government for what
they pay corps teachers.
The federal government will
pay for all training—both pre
service and graduate study—for
teacher-interns. It will not pay
for graduate study for the ca
reer teachers, as the Office of
Education is assuming most will
have their master's by this time.
The government will pay for
their pre-service training, how
ever.

Selection is a three-fold proc

pre-service course must be
passed, and (3) the teacher must
be selected by the local school
board.
The training will be designed

service training and graduate
study for the master's degree
will probably, although not defi

School districts eligible for
Teacher Corps Volunteers are
those in which the population

The schools must request the
teachers, place them, and pay
them according to the local
scale. In return, the school sys

federal government for what
they pay corps teachers.
The federal government will
pay for all training—both pre

WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
Office of Education estimates
there is a teacher shortage of
at least 100,000 a year arid that
there are about 80,000 teachers
with substandard credentials.
Thus, with a great demand on
existing teachers, schools in
"poverty pockets" such as Har
lem, Appalachia, Watts and
Jackson, Miss., lose out to
wealthier more "respectable sta
tus symbols."
The Teacher Corps will try to
combat this by putting 3,750
men and women in slum schools
by this fall and having 10,000
volunteers in service by 1969.
A spokesman for the Office
of Education said they realized
the Teacher Corps is not the fi
nal answer to the overall lack
of teachers so the program is de
signed to interest college grad
uates in teaching as a career as
well as reach the children in
poverty areas.
The corps is a partnership be
tween the Federal government,
universities and local school
boards to place teachers in areas
not likely to attract talented
teachers.
Appropriations
Expected appropriations for
the Teacher Corps are $3.2 mil

lion below what was originally
requested hut corps officials do
not expect this to seriously af
fect the program in the long
run.
The National Teacher Corps
was created by the Higher Edu
cation Act of 1965. Congress is
now considering a $10 million
Supplemental Teacher Corps
Appropriation with $31 million
requested for the 1967 Teacher
Corps budget.
There will be two types of vol
unteers, both serving two years.
The first is career teachers with
a minimum of five years gen
eral teaching experience or three
years of teaching in poverty
areas. They will lead teams of
one to five teacher interns.
The second group is the teach
er-intern. The requirement for
this group, which will make up
three-fourths of the corps, is a
college degree. The program
does not require experience or a
teaching certificate.
Study While Teaching
The interns will teach only two
or three classes, supplementing
the local teaching staff. The rest
of their time will be spent in
school and community related
activities and graduate study
leading to a master's degree.

Pre-service training will con
sist of three months of study at
a university during which time
the interns will earn some aca
demic credit. The emphasis will
be on the sociology of poverty:
why it exists, the techniques of
teaching the disadvantaged and
communicating with these
groups.
The purpose of this training
is to help the volunteer serve tiot
only as a teacher, but almost to
"take the place of a literate par
ent." The Office of Education
estimates that children in pov
erty areas are often as much as
two years behind when they be
gin kindergarten. They face a
new experience in books, pencil,
paper, unfamiliar rules and
schedules. These cultural handi
caps must be overcome before
the child can even begin to
learn.
Lighted Schoolhouse
Special projects carried on by
Teacher Corps volunteers will
include language (proper Eng
lish) labs, remedial reading, late
study halls, tours to museums,
etc. The concept is one of the
"lighted schoolhouse" — a place
that is open beyond class activi
ty and helps the students under
stand why education is impor
tant.

Study While Teaching
The interns will teach only two
or three classes, supplementing
the local teaching staff. The rest
of their time will be spent in
school and community related
activities and graduate study
leading to a master's degree.

Pre-service training will con
sist of three months of study at
a university during which time
the interns will earn some aca
demic credit. The emphasis will
be on the sociology of poverty:
why it exists, the techniques of
teaching the disadvantaged and
communicating with these
groups.
The purpose of this training
is to help the volunteer serve tiot
only as a teacher, but almost to
"take the place of a literate par
ent." The Office of Education
estimates that children in pov
erty areas are often as much as
two years behind when they be
gin kindergarten. They face a
new experience in books, pencil,
paper, unfamiliar rules and
schedules. These cultural handi
caps must be overcome before
the child can even begin to
learn.
Lighted Schoolhouse
Special projects carried on by
Teacher Corps volunteers will
include language (proper Eng
lish) labs, remedial reading, late
study halls, tours to museums,
etc. The concept is one of the
"lighted schoolhouse" — a place
that is open beyond class activi
ty and helps the students under
stand why education is impor
tant.
Selection is a three-fold proc
ess: (1) the application must be
accepted by the National Teach
er Corps in Washington, (2) the
pre-service course must be
passed, and (3) the teacher must
be selected by the local school
board.
The training will be designed
and run by the universities. Pre
service training and graduate
study for the master's degree
will probably, although not defi
nitely, be obtained at the same
university. Office of Education
officials are hoping to train vol
unteers close to the area they
will be serving. In that case,
training and graduate study
would probably be at the same
school.
School districts eligible for
Teacher Corps Volunteers are
those in which the population
earns less than $3,000 a year.
The schools must request the
teachers, place them, and pay
them according to the local
scale. In return, the school sys
tems will be reimbursed by the
federal government for what
they pay corps teachers.
The federal government will
pay for all training—both pre
service and graduate study—for
teacher-interns. It will not pay
for graduate study for the ca
reer teachers, as the Office of
Education is assuming most will
have their master's by this time.
The government will pay for
their pre-service training, how
ever.
WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
Office of Education estimates
there is a teacher shortage of
at least 100,000 a year arid that
there are about 80,000 teachers
with substandard credentials.
Thus, with a great demand on
existing teachers, schools in
"poverty pockets" such as Har
lem, Appalachia, Watts and
Jackson, Miss., lose out to
wealthier more "respectable sta
tus symbols."
The Teacher Corps will try to
combat this by putting 3,750
men and women in slum schools
by this fall and having 10,000
volunteers in service by 1969.
A spokesman for the Office
of Education said they realized
the Teacher Corps is not the fi
nal answer to the overall lack
of teachers so the program is de
signed to interest college grad
uates in teaching as a career as
well as reach the children in
poverty areas.
The corps is a partnership be
tween the Federal government,
universities and local school
boards to place teachers in areas
not likely to attract talented
teachers.
Appropriations
Expected appropriations for
the Teacher Corps are $3.2 mil

lion below what was originally
requested hut corps officials do
not expect this to seriously af
fect the program in the long
run.
The National Teacher Corps
was created by the Higher Edu
cation Act of 1965. Congress is
now considering a $10 million
Supplemental Teacher Corps
Appropriation with $31 million
requested for the 1967 Teacher
Corps budget.
There will be two types of vol
unteers, both serving two years.
The first is career teachers with
a minimum of five years gen
eral teaching experience or three
years of teaching in poverty
areas. They will lead teams of
one to five teacher interns.
The second group is the teach
er-intern. The requirement for
this group, which will make up
three-fourths of the corps, is a
college degree. The program
does not require experience or a
teaching certificate.
