# Greek System Under Fire Across U.S.
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS (CPS) — While
fraternity discrimination contin
ues to occupy most of the head
lines, more basic questions con
cerning the purpose and future
of the Greek system are being
raised on different campuses
across the country.
A plan to change rushing pro
cedures at Washington Univer
sity here has refocused attention
to this point. The administration
has told fraternities they will no
longer be able to conduct rush at

the beginning of each semester
because of a new freshman orien
tation program.
Although seemingly a minor
problem — rush is conducted at
many different times of the year
on different campuses — the ac
tion has contributed to "a great
deal of fear and anxiety among
fraternities about their future
here," according to one observer.
Many Greeks feel this is part of
a general plan to eliminate them.
One administration map for the
campus in 1980 apparently shows
classroom buildings where the
fraternity houses are now.
Academic Standards
Washington University's chan
cellor, Thomas Eliot, is seeking
to raise academic standards (a
large fund drive is imminent);
he allegedly believes the campus
academic climate can be im
improved by strengthening the
dormitory system at the ex
pense of fraternities.
An anti-intellectual character
is being charged to fraternities
in other places. A faculty com
mittee at Amherst College came
out with a report last fall which
said in part:
"Few of the fraternities have
any consistent, frequent institu
tional forms beyond the 'faculty
cocktail party' for bringing to
gether work and social life.
Even fewer still have significant
programs of independent activi
ties for exercising the creative,
literary, artistic, or intellectual
abilities of their members. At
least one fraternity is seen by
some of its members as a happy
refuge from the intellectual civil
and moral expectations of the
College and general society. Too
often the exercise of responsi
bility is confined to housekeep
ing, perpetuating the institu
tion through rushing, arranging
for parties, and defending the
fraternity against attack in the
student newspaper. . . ."
Mixed Feelings
Dean of Men William G. Long
of the University of North Caro
lina has mixed feelings about
fraternities, doesn't know wheth
er they will survive and acknowl

edges that the faculty is becom
ing negatively disposed towards
them.
And in a now well-known state
ment, University of California
sociologist John F. Scott pre
dicted last fall that sororities
face extinction. lie contended
that they are too rigidly struc
tured to cope with today's high
ly competitive campus society.
Chancellor Eliot, however,
was not at all dogmatic in a
meeting with fraternity leaders
at Washington. He said that the
administration remained open
minded concerning Greeks, ack
nowledging, at the same time,
that many members of the fac
ulty were more hostile.
Rivalry
The chancellor expressed con
cern over the rivalry between
Greeks and independents on the
campus, terming it potentially

unhealthy. He said that the sys
tem would have to harmonize
its activities more with the rest
of the campus.
At least one fraternity man
agreed. Writing in the student
newspaper, Dennis Brophy indi
cated he thought the system was
being presented with an oppor
tunity for self-analysis.
"For years individual adminis
trators and faculty members
have done little to make us feel
wanted," he wrote. "But have
we really done all we could to
make ourselves a part of the
larger community? Have we
really encouraged each other to
take advantage of all the oppor
tunities on campus to grow as
persons—or have we been busy

justifying ourselves by licking
Easter Seals during Hell Week
and compiling GPA's?
High Pressure Selling
"We say there is more to
school than academies. . . . But
isn't there more to fraternities
than high pressure selling of an
'image' to freshmen who often
don't know what they want, or
how to get it? Isn't there some
thing more to a fraternity than
the Sweetheart's Song and a
pledge pin?
"If there is, then why don't
we spend more time looking for
a better approach and defined
set ol goals, rather than getting
ulcers trying to save a sacred
cow that quite frankly is start
ing to stink up the place?"

dormitory system at the ex
pense of fraternities.
An anti-intellectual character
is being charged to fraternities
in other places. A faculty com
mittee at Amherst College came
out with a report last fall which
said in part:
"Few of the fraternities have
any consistent, frequent institu
tional forms beyond the 'faculty
cocktail party' for bringing to
gether work and social life.
Even fewer still have significant
programs of independent activi
ties for exercising the creative,
literary, artistic, or intellectual
abilities of their members. At
least one fraternity is seen by
some of its members as a happy
refuge from the intellectual civil
and moral expectations of the
College and general society. Too
often the exercise of responsi
bility is confined to housekeep
ing, perpetuating the institu
tion through rushing, arranging
for parties, and defending the
fraternity against attack in the
student newspaper. . . ."
Mixed Feelings
Dean of Men William G. Long
of the University of North Caro
lina has mixed feelings about
fraternities, doesn't know wheth
er they will survive and acknowl

edges that the faculty is becom
ing negatively disposed towards
them.
And in a now well-known state
ment, University of California
sociologist John F. Scott pre
dicted last fall that sororities
face extinction. lie contended
that they are too rigidly struc
tured to cope with today's high
ly competitive campus society.
Chancellor Eliot, however,
was not at all dogmatic in a
meeting with fraternity leaders
at Washington. He said that the
administration remained open
minded concerning Greeks, ack
nowledging, at the same time,
that many members of the fac
ulty were more hostile.
Rivalry
The chancellor expressed con
cern over the rivalry between
Greeks and independents on the
campus, terming it potentially

unhealthy. He said that the sys
tem would have to harmonize
its activities more with the rest
of the campus.
At least one fraternity man
agreed. Writing in the student
newspaper, Dennis Brophy indi
cated he thought the system was
being presented with an oppor
tunity for self-analysis.
"For years individual adminis
trators and faculty members
have done little to make us feel
wanted," he wrote. "But have
we really done all we could to
make ourselves a part of the
larger community? Have we
really encouraged each other to
take advantage of all the oppor
tunities on campus to grow as
persons—or have we been busy

justifying ourselves by licking
Easter Seals during Hell Week
and compiling GPA's?
High Pressure Selling
"We say there is more to
school than academies. . . . But
isn't there more to fraternities
than high pressure selling of an
'image' to freshmen who often
don't know what they want, or
how to get it? Isn't there some
thing more to a fraternity than
the Sweetheart's Song and a
pledge pin?
"If there is, then why don't
we spend more time looking for
a better approach and defined
set ol goals, rather than getting
ulcers trying to save a sacred
cow that quite frankly is start
ing to stink up the place?"
ST. LOUIS (CPS) — While
fraternity discrimination contin
ues to occupy most of the head
lines, more basic questions con
cerning the purpose and future
of the Greek system are being
raised on different campuses
across the country.
A plan to change rushing pro
cedures at Washington Univer
sity here has refocused attention
to this point. The administration
has told fraternities they will no
longer be able to conduct rush at

the beginning of each semester
because of a new freshman orien
tation program.
Although seemingly a minor
problem — rush is conducted at
many different times of the year
on different campuses — the ac
tion has contributed to "a great
deal of fear and anxiety among
fraternities about their future
here," according to one observer.
Many Greeks feel this is part of
a general plan to eliminate them.
One administration map for the
campus in 1980 apparently shows
classroom buildings where the
fraternity houses are now.

And in a now well-known state
ment, University of California
sociologist John F. Scott pre
dicted last fall that sororities
face extinction. lie contended
that they are too rigidly struc
tured to cope with today's high
ly competitive campus society.
Chancellor Eliot, however,
was not at all dogmatic in a
meeting with fraternity leaders
at Washington. He said that the
administration remained open
minded concerning Greeks, ack
nowledging, at the same time,
that many members of the fac
ulty were more hostile.
Rivalry
The chancellor expressed con
cern over the rivalry between
Greeks and independents on the
campus, terming it potentially

unhealthy. He said that the sys
tem would have to harmonize
its activities more with the rest
of the campus.
At least one fraternity man
agreed. Writing in the student
newspaper, Dennis Brophy indi
cated he thought the system was
being presented with an oppor
tunity for self-analysis.
"For years individual adminis
trators and faculty members
have done little to make us feel
wanted," he wrote. "But have
we really done all we could to
make ourselves a part of the
larger community? Have we
really encouraged each other to
take advantage of all the oppor
tunities on campus to grow as
persons—or have we been busy

justifying ourselves by licking
Easter Seals during Hell Week
and compiling GPA's?
High Pressure Selling
"We say there is more to
school than academies. . . . But
isn't there more to fraternities
than high pressure selling of an
'image' to freshmen who often
don't know what they want, or
how to get it? Isn't there some
thing more to a fraternity than
the Sweetheart's Song and a
pledge pin?
"If there is, then why don't
we spend more time looking for
a better approach and defined
set ol goals, rather than getting
ulcers trying to save a sacred
cow that quite frankly is start
ing to stink up the place?"
