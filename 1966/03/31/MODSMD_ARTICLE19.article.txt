An infrared sensing devise to
take "fingerprints" of the warm
earth from airplanes or satellites
and thereby reveal surface min
erals is being developed by a
Stanford scientist in cooperation
with Lockheed engineers.
Geophysics Prof. Ronald J. P.
Lyon described possibilities of
the "remote sensing" apparatus
in a lecture to students and fac
ulty. He pointed out that it is
part of a larger program being
launched by the National Aero
nautics and Space Administra
tion to develop various types of
remote sensors for geological ex
ploration of the moon and plan
ets as well as the earth.
Identification
Rocks and other surface mate
rials emit or reflect electromag
netic radiation in spectral pat
terns that can be used to identify
what materials are present, he
explained, just as fingerprints
identify persons. Such methods
have long been used in labora
tory analysis, but only recently
have they become airborne or
been tried out in earth satellites.
An informed spectrometer in
stalled aboard the Nimbus I sat
ellite, launched in 1964, was in
tended to spot clouds at night by
recording differences in heat
emission. However, it also re
vealed ice distribution and water
temperatures as well as temper
ature differences on land.
Nimbus' spectrometer operat
ed in space at a temperature of
approximately -105 deg. F. The
infrared heat ray sensor planned
by Prof. Lyon will be cooled by
cryogenic systems to below -425
deg. F. Si n c e the earth's night
time heat radiation is in the
neighborhood of 35 deg. F., the
new device will be many times
more sensitive to it.
Extend Senses
"Such devices are merely ex
tensions of our own senses," said
Prof. Lyon. "In the range from
X-rays to radar waves of the elec
tromagnetic spectrum, our sens
ing organs can detect only visi
ble light waves. We see the spec
tral patterns of light as colors,
which tell us something about
the reflecting objects.
"Yet on both sides of the visi
ble spectrum of light are myriads
of invisible 'colors' we can't see,
but which can be seen by our in
struments.

"If we flash an ultraviolet light
at the ground, photomultipliers
can see the reflected spectra of
the short ultraviolet waves. Ra
dar receivers can see reflected
spectra of radar's longer wave
lengths. Other sensors can see
the 'colors' of X rays, and ordi
nary cameras can record light re
flections and some portions of
both infrared and ultraviolet re
flections."
Spectral Problems
The major problem facing sci
entists in this field now is iden
tification of the materials these
spectra represent, he said. In the
infrared range, for example,
Prof. Lyon and his student as
sistants are taking infrared "fin
gerprints" of known minerals at
many sites, using equipment car
ried in a special truck.
"There is a staggering over
abundance of da t a," he said.
"While the fundamentals of the
technique are clear enough and
promise great rewards, the tech
nological job to be done is over
whelming.

"We are desperately short of
competent people to provide the
basic knowledge of how mate
rials in nature react in different
portions of the electromagnetic
spectrum."
