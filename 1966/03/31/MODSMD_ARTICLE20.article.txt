# Front Lawn Off-Limits At Ky. State
## 
### 
FRANKFORT, Ky. (CPS) â€”
Students at Kentucky State Col
lege can no longer sit on the
lawn or any part of the campus
facing the main highway lead
ing to the school because "it
does not promote the public
image."
The new ruling of the school's
executive council was relayed
to the students by Dr. James
McClellan, the dean of students.
Students seen in the off-limits
area will be subject to disciplin
ary action.
Many students charge that
the executive council is con
cerned about is "what some
white citizens of Frankfort will
think if they see Negroes and
whites sitting together on blue
grass soil."
Kentucky State was formerly
the state's Negro college and is
still predomi'natly Negro but has
an increasing enrollment of
white students, particularly
from the Frankfort area.
One student charged the
school administration with "al
ways being concerned about
what the whites will think and
not even considering us as a
student body." Another termed
the administrators "Uncle Toms
in disguise."
Student leaders are worried
about the growing percentage
of students who feel this way
and the increasingly vocal oppo
sition to the administration.
Some students suggest the
new ruling might cause the stu
dent body to become even more
open in its opposition.
