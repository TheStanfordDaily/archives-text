# Work Campers Enter New World At Tule
## 
### 
Talking to people, playing frisboe with
kids, hearing despondent stories about people
feeling they are the lowest order in today's
society, and listening to a talented but de
feated Indian rock-and-roll group all contrib
uted to a broadening experience for the stu
dents at Tule River Indian Reservation over
spring break.
The occasion was a work camp —a voyage
to another culture in order to accomplish
some primitive "social work." As all the six
teen students, mostly freshman, now know,
not very much concrete can be done in the
short period of eight days.
Out of the tensions of the finals rat-race,
they jumped into another world at the Tule
Reservation about 200 miles south of the
Farm. The life there is slow, no one is in a
hurry to go anywhere, and few of the Indians
have anywhere to go.
Only Small Segment
The students came in contact with what is
probably a relatively small segment of the
population of nearly 400. Young children
were constantly around the tribal buildings
where the work campers stayed. Teenagers

apeared in late afternoon to play baseball or
basketball on the flat field of dust at the cen
ter of the reservation.
The men, who do seasonal work crop pick
ing, lumbering, or running cattle, came
around to pass the time drinking, joking, play
ing guitars, and singing. Women were rarely
seen, for they are occupied with large families
(as many as 15 children) and the chickens.
The Stanford campers received a set of im
pressions and friends from a different type
of culture during the week. What they gave
in return is hard to determine.
Ostensibly, they contributed a little labor,
tejuing down an old barn and building a
backstop for the baseball field. The girls held
a nursery school for the younger children.
They planned a pot luck supper and a dance.
Significant Relationship
However, the most significant part of the
project was the relationships formed. As one
camper said, "We went there to see a group
of Indians and came back knowing indivi
duals."
Helping families clean up their yards or
build houses gave some of the boys oppor

tunities to learn more about the reservation
home life. A little competition between the
Indian girls' softball team and an impromtu
band of Stanford boys provided a good me
dium for exchange. (The boys just barely
won.)
There were many individuals. An old man
—only fifty but looking eighty—constantly
drunk and tottering around looking for peo
ple to whom he could tell war stories. A dis
jtinguished looking man, also an alcoholic
could play almost anything on the guitar. An
other man who, sitting inebriated by the
campfire at 4:30 in the morning, told why he
wished he hadn't quit school in the eighth
grade.
Aimless Youths
There was a high school senior who wants
to go to college but has somehow never been
informed of the ways of financing his educa
tion. A shy, smiling little boy hung around
the campers' lodgings, climbing continuously
on people's backs.
Two young men on leave from the marines
chugged around on their motorcycles, talking
of plans to return and settle on the reserva
tion.

The Reservation itself is located in the
mountains near Porterville, California. A
paved road runs down the valley along the
Tule River, with the houses, or rather shacks,
scattered around it. At the end of the road is
the mill where lumber from the reservation's
forests i sprocessed; profits from the enter
prise are divided equally among those who
live on the reservation.
Rusted frames of cars lie overturned in front
of many of the houses. A few cattle and
horses wandered in the hills.
Friends Helped
The work project was organized by Steve
Hurlbut, an Otero sponsor. The American
Friends Service Committee, a Quaker affili
ated organization which specializes in mis
sions to American Indians, aided the group
in providing supplies and advice. Each mem
ber of the group, which included students
from Otero, Roble, Florence Moore, Stern,
the medical school, and off-campus, paid $20
for food.
For the fee, they received a little sun and
companionship, but it was of a different na
ture than that found by their Stanford class
mates on beaches or ski slopes.
