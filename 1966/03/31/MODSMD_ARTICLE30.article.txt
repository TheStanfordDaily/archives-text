# Prof Blasts California Discrimination
## 
### 
A vivid and sometimes poi
gnant picture of discrimination
against Mexican - American in
a California community and its
school system is disclosed in a
recent Stanford doctoral disser
tation by Theodore W. Parsons.
Aptly described as a "compla

cency shocker," the dissertation
has been used to help Western
school teachers study discrim
ination in the classroom and
will be published as a case
study in cultural anthropology.
Parsons, now an assistant pro
fessor of education and cultural
anthropology at Florida State
University, Tallahassee, made a
three-year study of an agricul
tural town in Central California
which he disguises for obvious
reasons under the name "Guada
lupe."
He spent 40 days in personal
observation of the elementary
school where more than half (57
per cent) of the nearly 600 pupils
are Mexican-Americans.
Fully Subordinated
Some examples of how those
of Mexican origin are kept firm
ly subordinated to the "Anglos"

(white Americans of Anglo and
other national origins):
• A teacher, asked why she had
called on "Johnny" to lead five
Mexicans in orderly file out of
a schoolroom, explained: "His
father owns one of the big farms
in the area . . . one day he will
have to know how to handle the
Mexicans."
• Another teacher, following
the general practice of calling
on the Anglos to help Mexican
pupils recite in class, said in
praise of the system: "It draws
them (the Americans) out and
gives them a feeling of impor
tance."
• The President of the Cham
ber of Commerce declared in
praise of the school principal:
"He runs a good scho o 1. We
never have any trouble in our
school. Every kid knows his
place . . . we believe that every
kid has to learn to respect au
thority and his betters."
• The school principal ex
pounded the "grouping" and de
partmentalized reading pro
grams instituted under his ad
ministration: "We thought that
the white children would get
more out of school if they could
work faster and not be slowed
down by the Mexicans. We
thought the Mexican kids would
do better work if they were in
classes geared more to their
level. We thought that maybe
we could give them some special
attention...
"Everybody is happy about the
grouping programs ... The Mexi
can parents have n e v er said
anything, but the kids in school
are doing better ... I guess the
Mexicans are more comfortable
in their own group."
• By admitted subterfuge, the
Chamber of Commerce commit
tee sees to it that the artichoke
festival "queen" is always an An
glo, with the Mexican candidate
in second place as her attendant,
researcher: "We could never
have a Mexican Queen represent
us at the County Fair."
• Two of the three churches do
not accept Mexicans. At the
Catholic church the Mexicans
customarily attend mass at mid
morning and the priest's sermon
to this group is different in con
tent and tone from that given to
the Anglo groups. When both are
in church for special occasions,
the Mexicans sit in the back, or
stand if seating is inadequate.
The Mexicans buy tickets to
church affairs but seldom attend
because the people "aren't friend
ly." The one Mexican family who
showed up at a barbecue sat
alone throughout the afternoon.
• At school graduation, the
Mexicans march in last and sit
at the back of the platform. A
male teacher explained this is
traditional and "makes for a bet
ter looking stage." Also the

Americans, who have all the
parts in the program, can get
more easily to the front. He add
ed:
"Once we did let a Mexican girl
give a little talk of some kind
and all she did was to mumble
around. She had quite an accent,
too. Afterwards we had several
complaints from other parents,
so we haven't done anything like
that since . . . That was about
12 years ago."
• The Mexican cub scout pack
was in high excitement at the
close of one annual town cleanup
scrap drive, when their pile was
highest at the 10 a.m. deadline.
At 10:40 the garbage collector's
large truck arrived and deposited
a big load of trash on the Anglo
cub pack's pile. The Anglo pack
then was awarded the $50 prize.
This time there were protests
and grumbling. The Mexican cub
pack leader told Parsons: "That
guy just had the truck of scrap
ready in case it looked like the
other guys might win. This has
happened before . . . But what
can we do about it? The judges
are always Americans . . . All
they want is to beat us out."
• A light-skinned Mexican
high school graduate promptly
lost the job as bank teller she
had just been engaged to fill
when the manager heard her
speak to an acquaintance in
Spanish. He said he had not real
ized she was Mexican—it was not
bank policy to employ Mexicans.
Stereotype
The school teachers, all Anglo
and for the most part indigenous
to the area, appeared unanimous
in sharing the stereotype of Mcx
ican-Amerlcans as being inferior
in capacity as well as perform
ance, Parsons reports. So firmly
is the pattern in mind, a teacher,
in full view of a group of well
dressed, quietly behaved Mexi
can children, could describe Mex
ican children as noisy and dirty.
Sociometric tests conducted by
Parsons disclosed that even the
Mexican children come to share
the view constantly held up to
them that the Anglos are "smart
er" and their good opinions of
special value. Repeatedly told
they are "dumb," the children be
gin to behave in that pattern.
"In general, Anglo informants
characterized the Mexican villag
ers as being immoral, violent,
and given to fighting, dirty, un
intelligent, improvident, irre
sponsible and lazy," wrote Par
sons.
"Mexican informants often de
scribed Anglos as being unsym
pathetic, aggressive, interested
only in themselves, cold and de
manding . . . Not one of the sev
eral hundred people contacted
during the field investigation
had ever visited a home outside
of his own ethnic group."

Both groups contribute to the
cleavage, the Mexicans cherish
ing their different culture based
on familial relationships, with
the young girls protected from
male companions except those
of their own large family groups.
The ethnic cleavage is sharp and
established early.
Parson's 429-page dissertation
will be published in shorter form
by Holt, Rinehart and Winston
as one of the "Case Studies in
Cultural Anthropology" series
edited by Prof. George D. Spin
dler, executive head of Stanford's
Anthropology Department, and
his wife and academic associate,
department lecturer Louise Spin
dler.
It is the second book on the
subject in the Spindler's series.
"South Texas" by William Mad
sen was published in 1964.
66 Per Cent Urban
Parsons estimates more than
half of the mor.e than 4.5 million
Mexican-Americans in the Unit
ed States live in Texas and Cali
fornia. He cites statistics show
ing that this segment of the pop
ulation, formerly rural and mi
gratory, is now about 66 per
cent urban.
The Parsons dissertation was
produced under the guidance of
Prof. Fannie R. Shaftel of the
Stanford School of Education
and Assoc. Prof. Alan R. Beals
of the Department of Anthropol
ogy-
Mrs. Shaftel directed a three
week training program at Stan
ford last summer for teachers
studying desegregation methods.
Excerpts from the Parsons the
sis were used to help the group
examine their own psychological
barriers to teaching disadvan
taged youngsters from Negro,
Mexican • American, Indian and
migrant worker familiees.
Follow-up Visits
Dr. Shaftel has been making
a series of followup visits to
schools which sent representa

tives to the course in recent
months. She is an active partici
pant in the program sponsored
by the Office of Equal Education
al Opportunities, U. S. Office of
Education. Some 13 teams are
now at work in the field on de
facto segregation in the schools.
Parsons, at Stanford recently
to confer with the Spindlers and
Dr. Shaftel about publication of
his thesis, said he became so en
grossed in the problems of Mex
ican - American relations during
the "Guadalupe" project that he
expects to continue working in
this field indefinitely.
Unlike educators who advocate
enforced integration and total
assimilation of the Mexican-
Americans as the only goal to
seek, he envisons rather "a plur
al society based on mutual re
spect and appreciation," with in
crease in mutual experiences for
Anglo and American children,
and emphasis on tolerance of
ways different from one's own.
'Cold, Hard Look'
He thinks study, thought and
trial should precede uncharted,
wide-scale action.
"We should take a cold, hard
look at some of the things that
are being done," he said. "We
have the anti-poverty program
and the head-start projects under
way without knowing what the
consequences of these activities
are going to be.
"I believe we should learn
more about the lives of people
we're trying to manipulate be
fore plunging blindly ahead."
He proposed the establishment
of a "Community Development
Laboratory," with government
or foundation backing, which
would send task-oriented teams
to study a community, work out
guidelines for improving
changes and then institute these
on a small scale for evaluation
of their effectiveness.
"There are many people will
ing and eager to work in such
on-going programs," he said.

we could give them some special
attention...
"Everybody is happy about the
grouping programs ... The Mexi
can parents have n e v er said
anything, but the kids in school
are doing better ... I guess the
Mexicans are more comfortable
in their own group."
• By admitted subterfuge, the
Chamber of Commerce commit
tee sees to it that the artichoke
festival "queen" is always an An
glo, with the Mexican candidate
in second place as her attendant,
researcher: "We could never
have a Mexican Queen represent
us at the County Fair."
• Two of the three churches do
not accept Mexicans. At the
Catholic church the Mexicans
customarily attend mass at mid
morning and the priest's sermon
to this group is different in con
tent and tone from that given to
the Anglo groups. When both are
in church for special occasions,
the Mexicans sit in the back, or
stand if seating is inadequate.
The Mexicans buy tickets to
church affairs but seldom attend
because the people "aren't friend
ly." The one Mexican family who
showed up at a barbecue sat
alone throughout the afternoon.
• At school graduation, the
Mexicans march in last and sit
at the back of the platform. A
male teacher explained this is
traditional and "makes for a bet
ter looking stage." Also the

Americans, who have all the
parts in the program, can get
more easily to the front. He add
ed:
"Once we did let a Mexican girl
give a little talk of some kind
and all she did was to mumble
around. She had quite an accent,
too. Afterwards we had several
complaints from other parents,
so we haven't done anything like
that since . . . That was about
12 years ago."
• The Mexican cub scout pack
was in high excitement at the
close of one annual town cleanup
scrap drive, when their pile was
highest at the 10 a.m. deadline.
At 10:40 the garbage collector's
large truck arrived and deposited
a big load of trash on the Anglo
cub pack's pile. The Anglo pack
then was awarded the $50 prize.
This time there were protests
and grumbling. The Mexican cub
pack leader told Parsons: "That
guy just had the truck of scrap
ready in case it looked like the
other guys might win. This has
happened before . . . But what
can we do about it? The judges
are always Americans . . . All
they want is to beat us out."
• A light-skinned Mexican
high school graduate promptly
lost the job as bank teller she
had just been engaged to fill
when the manager heard her
speak to an acquaintance in
Spanish. He said he had not real
ized she was Mexican—it was not
bank policy to employ Mexicans.
Stereotype
The school teachers, all Anglo
and for the most part indigenous
to the area, appeared unanimous
in sharing the stereotype of Mcx
ican-Amerlcans as being inferior
in capacity as well as perform
ance, Parsons reports. So firmly
is the pattern in mind, a teacher,
in full view of a group of well
dressed, quietly behaved Mexi
can children, could describe Mex
ican children as noisy and dirty.
Sociometric tests conducted by
Parsons disclosed that even the
Mexican children come to share
the view constantly held up to
them that the Anglos are "smart
er" and their good opinions of
special value. Repeatedly told
they are "dumb," the children be
gin to behave in that pattern.
"In general, Anglo informants
characterized the Mexican villag
ers as being immoral, violent,
and given to fighting, dirty, un
intelligent, improvident, irre
sponsible and lazy," wrote Par
sons.
"Mexican informants often de
scribed Anglos as being unsym
pathetic, aggressive, interested
only in themselves, cold and de
manding . . . Not one of the sev
eral hundred people contacted
during the field investigation
had ever visited a home outside
of his own ethnic group."

Both groups contribute to the
cleavage, the Mexicans cherish
ing their different culture based
on familial relationships, with
the young girls protected from
male companions except those
of their own large family groups.
The ethnic cleavage is sharp and
established early.

66 Per Cent Urban
Parsons estimates more than
half of the mor.e than 4.5 million
Mexican-Americans in the Unit
ed States live in Texas and Cali
fornia. He cites statistics show
ing that this segment of the pop
ulation, formerly rural and mi
gratory, is now about 66 per
cent urban.
The Parsons dissertation was
produced under the guidance of
Prof. Fannie R. Shaftel of the
Stanford School of Education
and Assoc. Prof. Alan R. Beals
of the Department of Anthropol
ogy-
Mrs. Shaftel directed a three
week training program at Stan
ford last summer for teachers
studying desegregation methods.
Excerpts from the Parsons the
sis were used to help the group
examine their own psychological
barriers to teaching disadvan
taged youngsters from Negro,
Mexican • American, Indian and
migrant worker familiees.
Follow-up Visits
Dr. Shaftel has been making
a series of followup visits to
schools which sent representa

tives to the course in recent
months. She is an active partici
pant in the program sponsored
by the Office of Equal Education
al Opportunities, U. S. Office of
Education. Some 13 teams are
now at work in the field on de
facto segregation in the schools.
Parsons, at Stanford recently
to confer with the Spindlers and
Dr. Shaftel about publication of
his thesis, said he became so en
grossed in the problems of Mex
ican - American relations during
the "Guadalupe" project that he
expects to continue working in
this field indefinitely.
Unlike educators who advocate
enforced integration and total
assimilation of the Mexican-
Americans as the only goal to
seek, he envisons rather "a plur
al society based on mutual re
spect and appreciation," with in
crease in mutual experiences for
Anglo and American children,
and emphasis on tolerance of
ways different from one's own.
'Cold, Hard Look'
He thinks study, thought and
trial should precede uncharted,
wide-scale action.
"We should take a cold, hard
look at some of the things that
are being done," he said. "We
have the anti-poverty program
and the head-start projects under
way without knowing what the
consequences of these activities
are going to be.
"I believe we should learn
more about the lives of people
we're trying to manipulate be
fore plunging blindly ahead."
He proposed the establishment
of a "Community Development
Laboratory," with government
or foundation backing, which
would send task-oriented teams
to study a community, work out
guidelines for improving
changes and then institute these
on a small scale for evaluation
of their effectiveness.
"There are many people will
ing and eager to work in such
on-going programs," he said.
A vivid and sometimes poi
gnant picture of discrimination
against Mexican - American in
a California community and its
school system is disclosed in a
recent Stanford doctoral disser
tation by Theodore W. Parsons.
Aptly described as a "compla

cency shocker," the dissertation
has been used to help Western
school teachers study discrim
ination in the classroom and
will be published as a case
study in cultural anthropology.
Parsons, now an assistant pro
fessor of education and cultural
anthropology at Florida State
University, Tallahassee, made a
three-year study of an agricul
tural town in Central California
which he disguises for obvious
reasons under the name "Guada
lupe."
He spent 40 days in personal
observation of the elementary
school where more than half (57
per cent) of the nearly 600 pupils
are Mexican-Americans.
Fully Subordinated
Some examples of how those
of Mexican origin are kept firm
ly subordinated to the "Anglos"

(white Americans of Anglo and
other national origins):
• A teacher, asked why she had
called on "Johnny" to lead five
Mexicans in orderly file out of
a schoolroom, explained: "His
father owns one of the big farms
in the area . . . one day he will
have to know how to handle the
Mexicans."
• Another teacher, following
the general practice of calling
on the Anglos to help Mexican
pupils recite in class, said in
praise of the system: "It draws
them (the Americans) out and
gives them a feeling of impor
tance."
• The President of the Cham
ber of Commerce declared in
praise of the school principal:
"He runs a good scho o 1. We
never have any trouble in our
school. Every kid knows his
place . . . we believe that every
kid has to learn to respect au
thority and his betters."
• The school principal ex
pounded the "grouping" and de
partmentalized reading pro
grams instituted under his ad
ministration: "We thought that
the white children would get
more out of school if they could
work faster and not be slowed
down by the Mexicans. We
thought the Mexican kids would
do better work if they were in
classes geared more to their
level. We thought that maybe
we could give them some special
attention...

Stereotype
The school teachers, all Anglo
and for the most part indigenous
to the area, appeared unanimous
in sharing the stereotype of Mcx
ican-Amerlcans as being inferior
in capacity as well as perform
ance, Parsons reports. So firmly
is the pattern in mind, a teacher,
in full view of a group of well
dressed, quietly behaved Mexi
can children, could describe Mex
ican children as noisy and dirty.
Sociometric tests conducted by
Parsons disclosed that even the
Mexican children come to share
the view constantly held up to
them that the Anglos are "smart
er" and their good opinions of
special value. Repeatedly told
they are "dumb," the children be
gin to behave in that pattern.
"In general, Anglo informants
characterized the Mexican villag
ers as being immoral, violent,
and given to fighting, dirty, un
intelligent, improvident, irre
sponsible and lazy," wrote Par
sons.
"Mexican informants often de
scribed Anglos as being unsym
pathetic, aggressive, interested
only in themselves, cold and de
manding . . . Not one of the sev
eral hundred people contacted
during the field investigation
had ever visited a home outside
of his own ethnic group."

Both groups contribute to the
cleavage, the Mexicans cherish
ing their different culture based
on familial relationships, with
the young girls protected from
male companions except those
of their own large family groups.
The ethnic cleavage is sharp and
established early.

66 Per Cent Urban
Parsons estimates more than
half of the mor.e than 4.5 million
Mexican-Americans in the Unit
ed States live in Texas and Cali
fornia. He cites statistics show
ing that this segment of the pop
ulation, formerly rural and mi

cent urban.

ogy-
Mrs. Shaftel directed a three
week training program at Stan
ford last summer for teachers
studying desegregation methods.
Excerpts from the Parsons the

examine their own psychological
barriers to teaching disadvan

Follow-up Visits
Dr. Shaftel has been making
a series of followup visits to
schools which sent representa

tives to the course in recent
months. She is an active partici
pant in the program sponsored
by the Office of Equal Education
al Opportunities, U. S. Office of
Education. Some 13 teams are
now at work in the field on de
facto segregation in the schools.
Parsons, at Stanford recently
to confer with the Spindlers and
Dr. Shaftel about publication of
his thesis, said he became so en
grossed in the problems of Mex
ican - American relations during
the "Guadalupe" project that he
expects to continue working in
this field indefinitely.
Unlike educators who advocate
enforced integration and total
assimilation of the Mexican-
Americans as the only goal to
seek, he envisons rather "a plur
al society based on mutual re
spect and appreciation," with in
crease in mutual experiences for
Anglo and American children,
and emphasis on tolerance of
ways different from one's own.
'Cold, Hard Look'
He thinks study, thought and
trial should precede uncharted,
wide-scale action.
"We should take a cold, hard
look at some of the things that
are being done," he said. "We
have the anti-poverty program
and the head-start projects under
way without knowing what the
consequences of these activities
are going to be.
"I believe we should learn
more about the lives of people
we're trying to manipulate be
fore plunging blindly ahead."
He proposed the establishment
of a "Community Development
Laboratory," with government
or foundation backing, which
would send task-oriented teams
to study a community, work out
guidelines for improving
changes and then institute these
on a small scale for evaluation
of their effectiveness.
"There are many people will
ing and eager to work in such
on-going programs," he said.
A vivid and sometimes poi
gnant picture of discrimination
against Mexican - American in
a California community and its
school system is disclosed in a
recent Stanford doctoral disser
tation by Theodore W. Parsons.
Aptly described as a "compla

cency shocker," the dissertation
has been used to help Western
school teachers study discrim
ination in the classroom and
will be published as a case
study in cultural anthropology.
Parsons, now an assistant pro
fessor of education and cultural
anthropology at Florida State
University, Tallahassee, made a
three-year study of an agricul
tural town in Central California
which he disguises for obvious
reasons under the name "Guada
lupe."
He spent 40 days in personal
observation of the elementary
school where more than half (57
per cent) of the nearly 600 pupils
are Mexican-Americans.
Fully Subordinated
Some examples of how those
of Mexican origin are kept firm
ly subordinated to the "Anglos"

(white Americans of Anglo and
other national origins):
• A teacher, asked why she had
called on "Johnny" to lead five
Mexicans in orderly file out of
a schoolroom, explained: "His
father owns one of the big farms
in the area . . . one day he will
have to know how to handle the
Mexicans."
• Another teacher, following
the general practice of calling
on the Anglos to help Mexican
pupils recite in class, said in
praise of the system: "It draws
them (the Americans) out and
gives them a feeling of impor
tance."
• The President of the Cham
ber of Commerce declared in
praise of the school principal:
"He runs a good scho o 1. We
never have any trouble in our
school. Every kid knows his
place . . . we believe that every
kid has to learn to respect au
thority and his betters."
• The school principal ex
pounded the "grouping" and de
partmentalized reading pro
grams instituted under his ad
ministration: "We thought that
the white children would get
more out of school if they could
work faster and not be slowed
down by the Mexicans. We
thought the Mexican kids would
do better work if they were in
classes geared more to their
level. We thought that maybe
we could give them some special
attention...
"Everybody is happy about the
grouping programs ... The Mexi
can parents have n e v er said
anything, but the kids in school
are doing better ... I guess the
Mexicans are more comfortable
in their own group."
• By admitted subterfuge, the
Chamber of Commerce commit
tee sees to it that the artichoke
festival "queen" is always an An
glo, with the Mexican candidate
in second place as her attendant,
researcher: "We could never
have a Mexican Queen represent
us at the County Fair."
• Two of the three churches do
not accept Mexicans. At the
Catholic church the Mexicans
customarily attend mass at mid
morning and the priest's sermon
to this group is different in con
tent and tone from that given to
the Anglo groups. When both are
in church for special occasions,
the Mexicans sit in the back, or
stand if seating is inadequate.
The Mexicans buy tickets to
church affairs but seldom attend
because the people "aren't friend
ly." The one Mexican family who
showed up at a barbecue sat
alone throughout the afternoon.
• At school graduation, the
Mexicans march in last and sit
at the back of the platform. A
male teacher explained this is
traditional and "makes for a bet
ter looking stage." Also the

Americans, who have all the
parts in the program, can get
more easily to the front. He add
ed:
"Once we did let a Mexican girl
give a little talk of some kind
and all she did was to mumble
around. She had quite an accent,
too. Afterwards we had several
complaints from other parents,
so we haven't done anything like
that since . . . That was about
12 years ago."
• The Mexican cub scout pack
was in high excitement at the
close of one annual town cleanup
scrap drive, when their pile was
highest at the 10 a.m. deadline.
At 10:40 the garbage collector's
large truck arrived and deposited
a big load of trash on the Anglo
cub pack's pile. The Anglo pack
then was awarded the $50 prize.
This time there were protests
and grumbling. The Mexican cub
pack leader told Parsons: "That
guy just had the truck of scrap
ready in case it looked like the
other guys might win. This has
happened before . . . But what
can we do about it? The judges
are always Americans . . . All
they want is to beat us out."

66 Per Cent Urban
Parsons estimates more than
half of the mor.e than 4.5 million
Mexican-Americans in the Unit
ed States live in Texas and Cali
fornia. He cites statistics show
ing that this segment of the pop
ulation, formerly rural and mi
gratory, is now about 66 per
cent urban.
The Parsons dissertation was
produced under the guidance of
Prof. Fannie R. Shaftel of the
Stanford School of Education
and Assoc. Prof. Alan R. Beals
of the Department of Anthropol
ogy-
Mrs. Shaftel directed a three
week training program at Stan
ford last summer for teachers
studying desegregation methods.
Excerpts from the Parsons the
sis were used to help the group
examine their own psychological
barriers to teaching disadvan
taged youngsters from Negro,
Mexican • American, Indian and
migrant worker familiees.
Follow-up Visits
Dr. Shaftel has been making
a series of followup visits to
schools which sent representa

tives to the course in recent
months. She is an active partici
pant in the program sponsored
by the Office of Equal Education
al Opportunities, U. S. Office of
Education. Some 13 teams are
now at work in the field on de
facto segregation in the schools.
Parsons, at Stanford recently
to confer with the Spindlers and
Dr. Shaftel about publication of
his thesis, said he became so en
grossed in the problems of Mex
ican - American relations during
the "Guadalupe" project that he
expects to continue working in
this field indefinitely.
Unlike educators who advocate
enforced integration and total
assimilation of the Mexican-
Americans as the only goal to
seek, he envisons rather "a plur
al society based on mutual re
spect and appreciation," with in
crease in mutual experiences for
Anglo and American children,
and emphasis on tolerance of
ways different from one's own.
'Cold, Hard Look'
He thinks study, thought and
trial should precede uncharted,
wide-scale action.
"We should take a cold, hard
look at some of the things that
are being done," he said. "We
have the anti-poverty program
and the head-start projects under
way without knowing what the
consequences of these activities
are going to be.
"I believe we should learn
more about the lives of people
we're trying to manipulate be
fore plunging blindly ahead."
He proposed the establishment
of a "Community Development
Laboratory," with government
or foundation backing, which
would send task-oriented teams
to study a community, work out
guidelines for improving
changes and then institute these
on a small scale for evaluation
of their effectiveness.
"There are many people will
ing and eager to work in such
on-going programs," he said.
A vivid and sometimes poi
gnant picture of discrimination
against Mexican - American in
a California community and its
school system is disclosed in a
recent Stanford doctoral disser
tation by Theodore W. Parsons.
Aptly described as a "compla

cency shocker," the dissertation
has been used to help Western
school teachers study discrim
ination in the classroom and
will be published as a case
study in cultural anthropology.
Parsons, now an assistant pro
fessor of education and cultural
anthropology at Florida State
University, Tallahassee, made a
three-year study of an agricul
tural town in Central California
which he disguises for obvious
reasons under the name "Guada
lupe."
He spent 40 days in personal
observation of the elementary
school where more than half (57
per cent) of the nearly 600 pupils
are Mexican-Americans.
Fully Subordinated
Some examples of how those
of Mexican origin are kept firm
ly subordinated to the "Anglos"

(white Americans of Anglo and
other national origins):
• A teacher, asked why she had
called on "Johnny" to lead five
Mexicans in orderly file out of
a schoolroom, explained: "His
father owns one of the big farms
in the area . . . one day he will
have to know how to handle the
Mexicans."
• Another teacher, following
the general practice of calling
on the Anglos to help Mexican
pupils recite in class, said in
praise of the system: "It draws
them (the Americans) out and
gives them a feeling of impor
tance."
• The President of the Cham
ber of Commerce declared in
praise of the school principal:
"He runs a good scho o 1. We
never have any trouble in our
school. Every kid knows his
place . . . we believe that every
kid has to learn to respect au
thority and his betters."
• The school principal ex
pounded the "grouping" and de
partmentalized reading pro
grams instituted under his ad
ministration: "We thought that
the white children would get
more out of school if they could
work faster and not be slowed
down by the Mexicans. We
thought the Mexican kids would
do better work if they were in
classes geared more to their
level. We thought that maybe
we could give them some special
attention...
"Everybody is happy about the
grouping programs ... The Mexi
can parents have n e v er said
anything, but the kids in school
are doing better ... I guess the
Mexicans are more comfortable
in their own group."
• By admitted subterfuge, the
Chamber of Commerce commit
tee sees to it that the artichoke
festival "queen" is always an An
glo, with the Mexican candidate
in second place as her attendant,
researcher: "We could never
have a Mexican Queen represent
us at the County Fair."
• Two of the three churches do
not accept Mexicans. At the
Catholic church the Mexicans
customarily attend mass at mid
morning and the priest's sermon
to this group is different in con
tent and tone from that given to
the Anglo groups. When both are
in church for special occasions,
the Mexicans sit in the back, or
stand if seating is inadequate.
The Mexicans buy tickets to
church affairs but seldom attend
because the people "aren't friend
ly." The one Mexican family who
showed up at a barbecue sat
alone throughout the afternoon.
• At school graduation, the
Mexicans march in last and sit
at the back of the platform. A
male teacher explained this is
traditional and "makes for a bet
ter looking stage." Also the

Americans, who have all the
parts in the program, can get
more easily to the front. He add
ed:
"Once we did let a Mexican girl
give a little talk of some kind
and all she did was to mumble
around. She had quite an accent,
too. Afterwards we had several
complaints from other parents,
so we haven't done anything like
that since . . . That was about
12 years ago."
• The Mexican cub scout pack
was in high excitement at the
close of one annual town cleanup
scrap drive, when their pile was
highest at the 10 a.m. deadline.
At 10:40 the garbage collector's
large truck arrived and deposited
a big load of trash on the Anglo
cub pack's pile. The Anglo pack
then was awarded the $50 prize.
This time there were protests
and grumbling. The Mexican cub
pack leader told Parsons: "That
guy just had the truck of scrap
ready in case it looked like the
other guys might win. This has
happened before . . . But what
can we do about it? The judges
are always Americans . . . All
they want is to beat us out."
• A light-skinned Mexican
high school graduate promptly
lost the job as bank teller she
had just been engaged to fill
when the manager heard her
speak to an acquaintance in
Spanish. He said he had not real
ized she was Mexican—it was not
bank policy to employ Mexicans.
Stereotype
The school teachers, all Anglo
and for the most part indigenous
to the area, appeared unanimous
in sharing the stereotype of Mcx
ican-Amerlcans as being inferior
in capacity as well as perform
ance, Parsons reports. So firmly
is the pattern in mind, a teacher,
in full view of a group of well
dressed, quietly behaved Mexi
can children, could describe Mex
ican children as noisy and dirty.
Sociometric tests conducted by
Parsons disclosed that even the
Mexican children come to share
the view constantly held up to
them that the Anglos are "smart
er" and their good opinions of
special value. Repeatedly told
they are "dumb," the children be
gin to behave in that pattern.
"In general, Anglo informants
characterized the Mexican villag
ers as being immoral, violent,
and given to fighting, dirty, un
intelligent, improvident, irre
sponsible and lazy," wrote Par
sons.
"Mexican informants often de
scribed Anglos as being unsym
pathetic, aggressive, interested
only in themselves, cold and de
manding . . . Not one of the sev
eral hundred people contacted
during the field investigation
had ever visited a home outside
of his own ethnic group."

Both groups contribute to the
cleavage, the Mexicans cherish
ing their different culture based
on familial relationships, with
the young girls protected from
male companions except those
of their own large family groups.
The ethnic cleavage is sharp and
established early.

have the anti-poverty program
and the head-start projects under
way without knowing what the
consequences of these activities
are going to be.
"I believe we should learn
more about the lives of people
we're trying to manipulate be
fore plunging blindly ahead."
He proposed the establishment
of a "Community Development
Laboratory," with government
or foundation backing, which
would send task-oriented teams
to study a community, work out
guidelines for improving
changes and then institute these
on a small scale for evaluation
of their effectiveness.
"There are many people will

on-going programs," he said.
A vivid and sometimes poi
gnant picture of discrimination
against Mexican - American in
a California community and its
school system is disclosed in a
recent Stanford doctoral disser
tation by Theodore W. Parsons.
Aptly described as a "compla

cency shocker," the dissertation
has been used to help Western
school teachers study discrim
ination in the classroom and
will be published as a case
study in cultural anthropology.
Parsons, now an assistant pro
fessor of education and cultural
anthropology at Florida State
University, Tallahassee, made a
three-year study of an agricul
tural town in Central California
which he disguises for obvious
reasons under the name "Guada
lupe."
He spent 40 days in personal
observation of the elementary
school where more than half (57
per cent) of the nearly 600 pupils
are Mexican-Americans.
Fully Subordinated
Some examples of how those
of Mexican origin are kept firm
ly subordinated to the "Anglos"

(white Americans of Anglo and
other national origins):
• A teacher, asked why she had
called on "Johnny" to lead five
Mexicans in orderly file out of
a schoolroom, explained: "His
father owns one of the big farms
in the area . . . one day he will
have to know how to handle the
Mexicans."
• Another teacher, following
the general practice of calling
on the Anglos to help Mexican
pupils recite in class, said in
praise of the system: "It draws
them (the Americans) out and
gives them a feeling of impor
tance."
• The President of the Cham
ber of Commerce declared in
praise of the school principal:
"He runs a good scho o 1. We
never have any trouble in our
school. Every kid knows his
place . . . we believe that every
kid has to learn to respect au
thority and his betters."
• The school principal ex
pounded the "grouping" and de
partmentalized reading pro
grams instituted under his ad
ministration: "We thought that
the white children would get
more out of school if they could
work faster and not be slowed
down by the Mexicans. We
thought the Mexican kids would
do better work if they were in
classes geared more to their
level. We thought that maybe
we could give them some special
attention...
"Everybody is happy about the
grouping programs ... The Mexi
can parents have n e v er said
anything, but the kids in school
are doing better ... I guess the
Mexicans are more comfortable
in their own group."
• By admitted subterfuge, the
Chamber of Commerce commit
tee sees to it that the artichoke
festival "queen" is always an An
glo, with the Mexican candidate
in second place as her attendant,
researcher: "We could never
have a Mexican Queen represent
us at the County Fair."
• Two of the three churches do
not accept Mexicans. At the
Catholic church the Mexicans
customarily attend mass at mid
morning and the priest's sermon
to this group is different in con
tent and tone from that given to
the Anglo groups. When both are
in church for special occasions,
the Mexicans sit in the back, or
stand if seating is inadequate.
The Mexicans buy tickets to
church affairs but seldom attend
because the people "aren't friend
ly." The one Mexican family who
showed up at a barbecue sat
alone throughout the afternoon.
• At school graduation, the
Mexicans march in last and sit
at the back of the platform. A
male teacher explained this is
traditional and "makes for a bet
ter looking stage." Also the

Americans, who have all the
parts in the program, can get
more easily to the front. He add
ed:
"Once we did let a Mexican girl
give a little talk of some kind
and all she did was to mumble
around. She had quite an accent,
too. Afterwards we had several
complaints from other parents,
so we haven't done anything like
that since . . . That was about
12 years ago."
• The Mexican cub scout pack
was in high excitement at the
close of one annual town cleanup
scrap drive, when their pile was
highest at the 10 a.m. deadline.
At 10:40 the garbage collector's
large truck arrived and deposited
a big load of trash on the Anglo
cub pack's pile. The Anglo pack
then was awarded the $50 prize.
This time there were protests
and grumbling. The Mexican cub
pack leader told Parsons: "That
guy just had the truck of scrap
ready in case it looked like the
other guys might win. This has
happened before . . . But what
can we do about it? The judges
are always Americans . . . All
they want is to beat us out."
• A light-skinned Mexican
high school graduate promptly
lost the job as bank teller she
had just been engaged to fill
when the manager heard her
speak to an acquaintance in
Spanish. He said he had not real
ized she was Mexican—it was not
bank policy to employ Mexicans.
Stereotype
The school teachers, all Anglo
and for the most part indigenous
to the area, appeared unanimous
in sharing the stereotype of Mcx
ican-Amerlcans as being inferior
in capacity as well as perform
ance, Parsons reports. So firmly
is the pattern in mind, a teacher,
in full view of a group of well
dressed, quietly behaved Mexi
can children, could describe Mex
ican children as noisy and dirty.
Sociometric tests conducted by
Parsons disclosed that even the
Mexican children come to share
the view constantly held up to
them that the Anglos are "smart
er" and their good opinions of
special value. Repeatedly told
they are "dumb," the children be
gin to behave in that pattern.
"In general, Anglo informants
characterized the Mexican villag
ers as being immoral, violent,
and given to fighting, dirty, un
intelligent, improvident, irre
sponsible and lazy," wrote Par
sons.
"Mexican informants often de
scribed Anglos as being unsym
pathetic, aggressive, interested
only in themselves, cold and de
manding . . . Not one of the sev
eral hundred people contacted
during the field investigation
had ever visited a home outside
of his own ethnic group."

Both groups contribute to the
cleavage, the Mexicans cherish
ing their different culture based
on familial relationships, with
the young girls protected from
male companions except those
of their own large family groups.
The ethnic cleavage is sharp and
established early.
Parson's 429-page dissertation
will be published in shorter form
by Holt, Rinehart and Winston
as one of the "Case Studies in
Cultural Anthropology" series
edited by Prof. George D. Spin
dler, executive head of Stanford's
Anthropology Department, and
his wife and academic associate,
department lecturer Louise Spin
dler.
It is the second book on the
subject in the Spindler's series.
"South Texas" by William Mad
sen was published in 1964.
66 Per Cent Urban
Parsons estimates more than
half of the mor.e than 4.5 million
Mexican-Americans in the Unit
ed States live in Texas and Cali
fornia. He cites statistics show
ing that this segment of the pop
ulation, formerly rural and mi
gratory, is now about 66 per
cent urban.

produced under the guidance of

Stanford School of Education
and Assoc. Prof. Alan R. Beals
of the Department of Anthropol
ogy-
Mrs. Shaftel directed a three
week training program at Stan
ford last summer for teachers
studying desegregation methods.
Excerpts from the Parsons the
sis were used to help the group
examine their own psychological
barriers to teaching disadvan
taged youngsters from Negro,
Mexican • American, Indian and
migrant worker familiees.
Follow-up Visits
Dr. Shaftel has been making
a series of followup visits to
schools which sent representa

tives to the course in recent
months. She is an active partici
pant in the program sponsored
by the Office of Equal Education
al Opportunities, U. S. Office of
Education. Some 13 teams are
now at work in the field on de
facto segregation in the schools.
Parsons, at Stanford recently
to confer with the Spindlers and
Dr. Shaftel about publication of
his thesis, said he became so en
grossed in the problems of Mex
ican - American relations during
the "Guadalupe" project that he
expects to continue working in
this field indefinitely.
Unlike educators who advocate
enforced integration and total
assimilation of the Mexican-
Americans as the only goal to
seek, he envisons rather "a plur
al society based on mutual re
spect and appreciation," with in
crease in mutual experiences for
Anglo and American children,
and emphasis on tolerance of
ways different from one's own.
'Cold, Hard Look'
He thinks study, thought and
trial should precede uncharted,
wide-scale action.
"We should take a cold, hard
look at some of the things that
are being done," he said. "We
have the anti-poverty program
and the head-start projects under
way without knowing what the
consequences of these activities
are going to be.
"I believe we should learn
