Students worried about pass
ing an exam can usually find
previous tests or former stu
dents to tutor them through the
mysteries of English Lit or His
tory 11-A. Now they can apply
the same methods to the draft
deferment test, coming up in
May.
Barron's, a company dealing
in course outlines and sample
test questions, has just issued
"How to Prepare for the Stu
dent Deferment Test" with "all
the facts you need to help you
score higher." Based on the
previous Korean War tests and
standard aptitude tests, the
"cram sheet" offers complete

verbal and mathematical exer
cises as well as sample tests.
New York University is offer
ing a tutoring program to help
liberal arts majors prepare for
the algebra and trigonometry
questions. Clifford Tisser, Tech
nology Council vice president, is
basing the program on previous
test questions released by the
New York Journal American.
The Selective Service in Wash
ington, meanwhile, announced
the standards for those who do
not take the test will be the
same as those used in granting
Korean War deferments.
To qualify for a 2-S classifica
tion, a student must have been
accepted for the next term and

stand in the upper half of his
class of freshmen, the upper
two-thirds of his sophomore
class or the upper three-fourths
of his junior class. Graduate
students must have ranked in
the upper three-fourths of their
senior class.
Undergraduates who take the
test can plan for another stu
dent-oriented year with a score
of 70 or better. It takes a score 112
80 for the graduate student to
breathe easier.
Under these rules, a student
who qualifies should retain his
2-S status as long as he stays in
school and continues to meet the
standards.
