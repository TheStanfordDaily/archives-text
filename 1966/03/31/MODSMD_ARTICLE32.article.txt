# SCULPTURE REVIEW
## Artist Integrates Expression 
### JANIE MORAN 
The sculpture by Robert J.
Mullen, currently on exhibition
at the Stanford Gallery, is truly
contemporary in its integration
of technical and intellectual ex
pression. The sculptor says he
intends to create a work whose
import is in its own existence
rather than the representation
of a specific "message."
Technically he uses the old
cuire perdue method, building
up a wax model on a natural
wood skeleton rather than carv

ing a work from a solid material
as is more common in stone
sculpting. The formation of the
model in this way allows a more
natural evolution of the form
without a preconceived product
in the sculptor's mind.
From this model he forms a
mold from which the bronze it
self is cast.
Derived From Nature
The forms in such works as
Metamorphis are derived from
nature, but they are not used
to represent specific elements.
Mullen does his own finishing
and the patina on the bronze
surface is again based on na
tural colors and relates to the
imagery of the piece.
The recurring thematic forms
of wings and flight are related
in his sculptures to a plane or
horizon in order to emphasize
the contrast between the two
and three dimensional aspects
of the work and to define the
sculptural space in which the
sculpture exists.
Metamorphic
All of these works, because
they have in fact grown, have
a metamorphic quality and a
sense of energy which seems to
create an actual life force in the
sculpture itself.
In doing several works at once
over a long period of time, Mr.
Mullen fels he carries on a dy
namic relationship with his own
work. Consequently each of his
sculptures has evolved into
something having its own iden
tity.
