# SECOND IN EASTER RELAYS
## Track Meets San Jose 
### 
With San Jose State acting
like the national championship
was at stake, Stanford's track
team indeed will have to be at
the best this Saturday when
they meet the Spartans here at
Stanford.
Although the Spartans defeat
ed the Indians in their initial
meeting this season, Stanford
produced their best effort of the
year last weekend in the Easter
Relays at Santa Barbara. The
extra work during spring vaca
tion seemed to pay off for Stan
ford's trackmen.
Stanford's track and field
squad edged out USC and San
Jose State for second place
honors in the Easter Relays, los
ing to a strong UCLA team.
-Jordan Impressed
Coach Payton Jordan noted
that, impressed as he was by
several individual efforts, he
was most satisfied by the overall
high quality of the results
turned in. There were no sub
par performances, though

sprinters Roger Cox and Larry
Questad were not quite up to
their best times.
Captain Bob Stoecker sailed
the discus 184-8, only two feet
back of his NCAA winning toss
of last year, to place behind ex-
Stanfordite Dave Weill, now of
the Indian Track Club. Another
Indian who rose to the strong
competition was pole vaulter
Jim Eshelman who cleared IG-0
and had a near miss at 16-7.
Hampered by an injury last
year, he seems to have regained
the form that marked him as
one of collegiate's best at the
beginning of last year.
Bud Walsh placed in two
events, the high hurdles and the
long jump. Questad took a
fourth in the 100 yard dash. The
relay teams all placed among
the top three. The distance med
ley quartet finished second and
the sprint relays both placed
third.
In the mile relay, which is the
last event this weekend against

San Jose State and could possi
bly decide the winner, Stanford
placed third, mainly because of
the running of sophomore Jim
Ward. Having already run the
fastest leg in the medley relay,
he came back from last place in
this event to battle both UCLA
and San Jose State anchor men
to the tape. His quarter was an
excellent 46.1.
The San Jose Spartans edged
the Indians at the Stanford Re
lays, 103-98, several weeks ago
but the Indians reversed the or
der at Santa Barbara picking up
42 p o in t s to 39 for SJC. Both
coaches look for a close meet.
Each team has weak areas in
which they pin only faint hopes,

but most events could go either
way.
In the high jump. San Jose
State has one authentic 7-footer
and two jumpers ready to give
him company while the Indians
have nobody who can bettor 6-2.
On the other hand, Stanford ap
pears to have substantial edges
in the pole vault, the hurdles,
and the discus. Spartan sprint
ing star Tommy Smith, who has
a 9.6 100 to his credit this year,
might possibly compete in as
many as five events.
The frosh squads of the two
schools will begin competition
one hour before the regular
meet at 12:30 p.m. Led by Mor
rison and Boyce, the Stanford
team appears to be stronger off
of the sparse experience of both
teams.
Spectators are urged to arrive
for the varsity meet as early
as possible in order to facilitate
seating as a crowd of up to
10,000 is expected.


TRACK COACH PlaytOn Jordan is giving sprinter Questad
some last minute advice on the upcoming meet with urchrivals San
Jose. Tommy Smith from San Jose will definitely give Questad the
competition that he needs to reach his top form wliich he has not
attained this season. He lias run the 100 in 9.3.

Questad were not quite up to
their best times.
Captain Bob Stoecker sailed
the discus 184-8, only two feet
back of his NCAA winning toss
of last year, to place behind ex-
Stanfordite Dave Weill, now of
the Indian Track Club. Another
Indian who rose to the strong
competition was pole vaulter
Jim Eshelman who cleared IG-0
and had a near miss at 16-7.
Hampered by an injury last
year, he seems to have regained
the form that marked him as
one of collegiate's best at the
beginning of last year.
Bud Walsh placed in two
events, the high hurdles and the
long jump. Questad took a
fourth in the 100 yard dash. The
relay teams all placed among
the top three. The distance med
ley quartet finished second and
the sprint relays both placed
third.
In the mile relay, which is the
last event this weekend against

San Jose State and could possi
bly decide the winner, Stanford
placed third, mainly because of
the running of sophomore Jim
Ward. Having already run the
fastest leg in the medley relay,
he came back from last place in
this event to battle both UCLA
and San Jose State anchor men
to the tape. His quarter was an
excellent 46.1.
The San Jose Spartans edged
the Indians at the Stanford Re
lays, 103-98, several weeks ago
but the Indians reversed the or
der at Santa Barbara picking up
42 p o in t s to 39 for SJC. Both
coaches look for a close meet.
Each team has weak areas in
which they pin only faint hopes,

but most events could go either
way.
In the high jump. San Jose
State has one authentic 7-footer
and two jumpers ready to give
him company while the Indians
have nobody who can bettor 6-2.
On the other hand, Stanford ap
pears to have substantial edges
in the pole vault, the hurdles,
and the discus. Spartan sprint
ing star Tommy Smith, who has
a 9.6 100 to his credit this year,
might possibly compete in as
many as five events.
The frosh squads of the two
schools will begin competition
one hour before the regular
meet at 12:30 p.m. Led by Mor
rison and Boyce, the Stanford
team appears to be stronger off
of the sparse experience of both
teams.
Spectators are urged to arrive
for the varsity meet as early
as possible in order to facilitate
seating as a crowd of up to
10,000 is expected.
