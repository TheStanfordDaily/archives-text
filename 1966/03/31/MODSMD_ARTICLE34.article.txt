# Freshmen Baseball Squad Compiles Unbeaten Campaign During Vacation
## 
### 
The Stanford Frosh baseball
team ran its record to 14 wins,
no losses, and one tie with five
wins during the first ever road
trip for a Stanford Frosh base
ball team.
The trip took place over
spring break and gave Coach

Ray Young's charges a chance to
prove their superiority over
Southern California rivals.
The only blemish on the
Frosh's record was a 3-3 tie with
USC. The game was called on
acount of darkness after 7 inn
ings.
Ten Men I^eft
The Frosh may have been a
little nervous playing on a
strange field. They left ten men
on base mostly due to poor bunt
ing. The USC frosh left two men
on base by comparison. Rod Po
teete threw for Stanford and in
his seven innings he struck out
13, walked one and gave up four
hits. Unfortunately, the USC's
hits were consecutive in the
third inning to give the Tro
babes their runs.
These four hits are the only
four that Poteete has given up
in the 15 innings he has pitched.
He has 29 strike outs in those 15
innings. Earlier in the season he
was felled by the flu.
Coach Young tried to use as
many players as possible as is
evidenced by the fact that all
the players got into the first
two games against Claremont
and Occidental. The Frosh bomb
barded Claremont, 17-4 and
bounced Occidental, 13-5.
Twenty-five players went on the
trip.
Rose looked Sharp
Pitcher Don Rose who was
suffering from a leg ailment and
was not expected to pitch much,
turned out to be the iron man
of the trip. He pitched 15 inn-

ings, highest total on the staff.
He went nine innings against
Cal Poly of Pomona and won,
3-2. In the six other innings he
pitched he didn't allow a run.
Rose went 2-0 on the trip. His
fellow pitcher Tom Krause had a
similar record.
One of the highlights of the
spring trip was the tremendous
hitting of the squad. The Frosh
hit .301 as a team. The biggest
stick of the road trip was Mark
Marquess, who filled in for in
jured first baseman Bob Galla
gher. Marquess hit .448, scored
10 runs, knocked in 8 runs, and
blasted two triples. He also did
a fine job of fielding.
Thirdbaseman Bob Boone did
his share of the hitting too. He
hit .409, had 6 rbi's and slam
med a homerun.
Hodges and Hoffmeister:
Hitters
In the outfield, Jack Hodges
and Chuck Hoffmeister were
both around the .350 mark.
Hodges added a home run and
5 rbi's while Hoffmeister scored
10 runs and stole 5 bases.
Back into the infield, catchers
Bob Edie and Dennis King took
turns taking the opposition
apart. Edie hit .364. King was
only up ten times, but he made
the most of those at bats. He
got five hits.
Mike Amrnirato showed some
fine form at his second base
spot. He hit .333, had 4 rbi's,
scored 9 runs, hit a home run,
and stole 3 bases. Coach Young
praised the teamwork of Am
rnirato and shortstop Russ
Tweet in the field. Tweet also
knocked out a home run to help
get 6 rbi's.
As you would expect the hit
ting binge the Frosh went on
during their vacation raised the
team batting average 25 points.
The Frosh play a doublehead
er Friday afternoon at 1:30
against San Jose St. The game
will be played on the Frosh
diamond. There will be no ad
mission charged.
Tuesday afternoon, the Stan

ford varsity baseball team un
packed their heavy artillary in
preparation for this weekend's
games against UCLA and UCSB
and in the process of testing
their guns they blasted St.
Mary's, 15-1.
The varsity got 15 hits to go
along with their 15 runs. Third
baseman Hi Lewis hit a grand
slam home run in the sixth to
lead Stanford's big inning. The
Tribe got 7 runs in the sixth.
Mike Shoemaker who nor
mally plays left field was on the
bench with an injury, but need
ing a pinch hitter, coach Dutch
Fehring told Shomaker just to
meet the ball and not to run on
his had leg. Schomaker solved
the problem neatly by hitting
the ball over the fence.
Marty Erck who is replacing
Schomaker also hit a home run.
Pete Middlekauff also came
alive with three hits including
a triple.
Steve Hovley and Dick Swan
each got two hits. Stanford had
nine extra base hits for the
game. St. Mary's had two hits
total.

Stanford met San Jose yesterday
and meets the University (> f Ited
lands today, UCLA on Friday,
and USC on Saturday. The lat
ter two matehes will be away
gam<»s.
The Stanford Frosh baseball
team ran its record to 14 wins,
no losses, and one tie with five
wins during the first ever road
trip for a Stanford Frosh base
ball team.
The trip took place over
spring break and gave Coach

Ray Young's charges a chance to
prove their superiority over
Southern California rivals.
The only blemish on the
Frosh's record was a 3-3 tie with
USC. The game was called on
acount of darkness after 7 inn
ings.
Ten Men I^eft
The Frosh may have been a
little nervous playing on a
strange field. They left ten men
on base mostly due to poor bunt
ing. The USC frosh left two men
on base by comparison. Rod Po
teete threw for Stanford and in
his seven innings he struck out
13, walked one and gave up four
hits. Unfortunately, the USC's
hits were consecutive in the
third inning to give the Tro
babes their runs.
These four hits are the only
four that Poteete has given up
in the 15 innings he has pitched.
He has 29 strike outs in those 15
innings. Earlier in the season he
was felled by the flu.
Coach Young tried to use as
many players as possible as is
evidenced by the fact that all
the players got into the first
two games against Claremont
and Occidental. The Frosh bomb
barded Claremont, 17-4 and
bounced Occidental, 13-5.
Twenty-five players went on the
trip.
Rose looked Sharp
Pitcher Don Rose who was
suffering from a leg ailment and
was not expected to pitch much,
turned out to be the iron man
of the trip. He pitched 15 inn-

ings, highest total on the staff.
He went nine innings against
Cal Poly of Pomona and won,
3-2. In the six other innings he
pitched he didn't allow a run.
Rose went 2-0 on the trip. His
fellow pitcher Tom Krause had a
similar record.
One of the highlights of the
spring trip was the tremendous
hitting of the squad. The Frosh
hit .301 as a team. The biggest
stick of the road trip was Mark
Marquess, who filled in for in
jured first baseman Bob Galla
gher. Marquess hit .448, scored
10 runs, knocked in 8 runs, and
blasted two triples. He also did
a fine job of fielding.
Thirdbaseman Bob Boone did
his share of the hitting too. He
hit .409, had 6 rbi's and slam
med a homerun.
Hodges and Hoffmeister:
Hitters
In the outfield, Jack Hodges
and Chuck Hoffmeister were
both around the .350 mark.
Hodges added a home run and
5 rbi's while Hoffmeister scored
10 runs and stole 5 bases.
Back into the infield, catchers
Bob Edie and Dennis King took
turns taking the opposition
apart. Edie hit .364. King was
only up ten times, but he made
the most of those at bats. He
got five hits.
Mike Amrnirato showed some
fine form at his second base
spot. He hit .333, had 4 rbi's,
scored 9 runs, hit a home run,
and stole 3 bases. Coach Young
praised the teamwork of Am
rnirato and shortstop Russ
Tweet in the field. Tweet also
knocked out a home run to help
get 6 rbi's.
As you would expect the hit
ting binge the Frosh went on
during their vacation raised the
team batting average 25 points.
The Frosh play a doublehead
er Friday afternoon at 1:30
against San Jose St. The game
will be played on the Frosh
diamond. There will be no ad
mission charged.
Tuesday afternoon, the Stan

ford varsity baseball team un
packed their heavy artillary in
preparation for this weekend's
games against UCLA and UCSB
and in the process of testing
their guns they blasted St.
Mary's, 15-1.
The varsity got 15 hits to go
along with their 15 runs. Third
baseman Hi Lewis hit a grand
slam home run in the sixth to
lead Stanford's big inning. The
Tribe got 7 runs in the sixth.
Mike Shoemaker who nor
mally plays left field was on the
bench with an injury, but need
ing a pinch hitter, coach Dutch
Fehring told Shomaker just to
meet the ball and not to run on
his had leg. Schomaker solved
the problem neatly by hitting
the ball over the fence.

Schomaker also hit a home run.

The Stanford Frosh baseball
team ran its record to 14 wins,
no losses, and one tie with five
wins during the first ever road
trip for a Stanford Frosh base
ball team.
The trip took place over
spring break and gave Coach

Ray Young's charges a chance to
prove their superiority over
Southern California rivals.
The only blemish on the
Frosh's record was a 3-3 tie with
USC. The game was called on
acount of darkness after 7 inn
ings.
Ten Men I^eft
The Frosh may have been a
little nervous playing on a
strange field. They left ten men
on base mostly due to poor bunt
ing. The USC frosh left two men
on base by comparison. Rod Po
teete threw for Stanford and in
his seven innings he struck out
13, walked one and gave up four
hits. Unfortunately, the USC's
hits were consecutive in the
third inning to give the Tro
babes their runs.
These four hits are the only
four that Poteete has given up
in the 15 innings he has pitched.
He has 29 strike outs in those 15
innings. Earlier in the season he
was felled by the flu.
Coach Young tried to use as
many players as possible as is
evidenced by the fact that all
the players got into the first
two games against Claremont
and Occidental. The Frosh bomb
barded Claremont, 17-4 and
bounced Occidental, 13-5.
Twenty-five players went on the
trip.
Rose looked Sharp
Pitcher Don Rose who was
suffering from a leg ailment and
was not expected to pitch much,
turned out to be the iron man
of the trip. He pitched 15 inn-

ings, highest total on the staff.
He went nine innings against
Cal Poly of Pomona and won,
3-2. In the six other innings he
pitched he didn't allow a run.
Rose went 2-0 on the trip. His
fellow pitcher Tom Krause had a
similar record.
One of the highlights of the
spring trip was the tremendous
hitting of the squad. The Frosh
hit .301 as a team. The biggest
stick of the road trip was Mark
Marquess, who filled in for in
jured first baseman Bob Galla
gher. Marquess hit .448, scored
10 runs, knocked in 8 runs, and
blasted two triples. He also did
a fine job of fielding.
Thirdbaseman Bob Boone did
his share of the hitting too. He
hit .409, had 6 rbi's and slam
med a homerun.
Hodges and Hoffmeister:
Hitters
In the outfield, Jack Hodges
and Chuck Hoffmeister were
both around the .350 mark.
Hodges added a home run and
5 rbi's while Hoffmeister scored
10 runs and stole 5 bases.
Back into the infield, catchers
Bob Edie and Dennis King took
turns taking the opposition
apart. Edie hit .364. King was
only up ten times, but he made
the most of those at bats. He
got five hits.
Mike Amrnirato showed some
fine form at his second base
spot. He hit .333, had 4 rbi's,
scored 9 runs, hit a home run,
and stole 3 bases. Coach Young
praised the teamwork of Am
rnirato and shortstop Russ
Tweet in the field. Tweet also
knocked out a home run to help
get 6 rbi's.
As you would expect the hit
ting binge the Frosh went on
during their vacation raised the
team batting average 25 points.
The Frosh play a doublehead
er Friday afternoon at 1:30
against San Jose St. The game
will be played on the Frosh
diamond. There will be no ad
mission charged.
