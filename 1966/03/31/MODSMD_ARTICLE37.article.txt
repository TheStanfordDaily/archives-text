# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Who Needs New Liquor Rule? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
A county in Missouri is dry,
except for one small town in its
geographic center which elected
to protect the right of each citi
zen to make the choice to drink
or not to drink. Most of the ad
ults in town work in one of the
several thriving liquor stores,
and the rest keep in good repair
the roads which bring the thirsty
folks from the rest of the county
into town each day. "Everyone is
happy" says the county sheriff.
"The Baptists have prohibition
and the people have their liquor."
So it is at Stanford; anyone
who seriously wishes to drink is
resourceful enough to do so—
the regulations are inffectual in
this regard. What the regula
tions actually achicve is the elim
ination of the promiscuous
drinking and attendant vulgar
displays by individuals and
groups so evident at other uni
versities.
I wonder if we are not happier
without more liberal liquor reg
ulations on campus. Those of us
who wish to drink can do so
readily; those of us who recoil
at beer cans and smashed bottles
in gutters and bushes, raucous
dormitory hall s, and lavatories
reeking with the stench of fresh
vomit have our peace of mind.
PETER THOMPSON
• Negotiation
Editor, The Daily:
Would one of the Stanford
students who claim to "approve
. . . the way the Johnson Admin
istration is handling the situa
tion in Vietnam" and who also
"approve . . . U. S. negotiations
with the Viet Cong (National
Liberation Front) if they were
willing to negotiate" please ex

plain his position? Both the
Johnson Administration and the
so-called government in Saigon
have repeatedly and persistently
refused to negotiate with the Na
tional Liberation Front, assert
ing that they are nothing but a
bunch of "bandits" or merely a
myth.
President Johnson's first call
for "unconditional negotiations"
went out from John s Hopkins
University on April 7, 1965, (the
speech also stated "our objective
is the independence of South
Vietnam" i.e., no possible reuni
fication for Vietnam). The next
day Hanoi responded publicly
with an extremely reasonable
proposal for negotiations, a pro
posal which they have reaf
firmed every month since then.
The Administration has reject
ed this proposal for stated rea
son and one stated reason only,
as made absolutely clear in Sec
retary Rusk's official statement
of February 18, 1966 (which
everybody ought to read). That
stated reason is, in Rusk's words,
the claim that "the National Lib
eration Front is exactly what its
name implies — a Communist
front organization ... an inven
tion of the Communist party of
North Vietnam."
Of course, I don't really sup
pose that any of those Stanford
students would care to take fif
teen minutes to read the irrefut
able documentary evidence that
the Johnson Administration,
which they support, simply will
not participate in the negotia
tions which they also support,
negotiations with the people we
are slaughtering while you are
reading this letter.

to protect the right of each citi
zen to make the choice to drink
or not to drink. Most of the ad
ults in town work in one of the
several thriving liquor stores,
and the rest keep in good repair
the roads which bring the thirsty
folks from the rest of the county
into town each day. "Everyone is
happy" says the county sheriff.
"The Baptists have prohibition
and the people have their liquor."
So it is at Stanford; anyone
who seriously wishes to drink is
resourceful enough to do so—
the regulations are inffectual in
this regard. What the regula
tions actually achicve is the elim
ination of the promiscuous
drinking and attendant vulgar
displays by individuals and
groups so evident at other uni
versities.
I wonder if we are not happier
without more liberal liquor reg
ulations on campus. Those of us
who wish to drink can do so
readily; those of us who recoil
at beer cans and smashed bottles
in gutters and bushes, raucous
dormitory hall s, and lavatories
reeking with the stench of fresh
vomit have our peace of mind.

Would one of the Stanford
students who claim to "approve
. . . the way the Johnson Admin
istration is handling the situa
tion in Vietnam" and who also
"approve . . . U. S. negotiations
with the Viet Cong (National
Liberation Front) if they were
willing to negotiate" please ex

plain his position? Both the
Johnson Administration and the
so-called government in Saigon
have repeatedly and persistently
refused to negotiate with the Na
tional Liberation Front, assert
ing that they are nothing but a
bunch of "bandits" or merely a
myth.
President Johnson's first call
for "unconditional negotiations"
went out from John s Hopkins
University on April 7, 1965, (the
speech also stated "our objective
is the independence of South
Vietnam" i.e., no possible reuni
fication for Vietnam). The next
day Hanoi responded publicly
with an extremely reasonable
proposal for negotiations, a pro
posal which they have reaf
firmed every month since then.
The Administration has reject
ed this proposal for stated rea
son and one stated reason only,
as made absolutely clear in Sec
retary Rusk's official statement
of February 18, 1966 (which
everybody ought to read). That
stated reason is, in Rusk's words,
the claim that "the National Lib
eration Front is exactly what its
name implies — a Communist
front organization ... an inven
tion of the Communist party of
North Vietnam."
Of course, I don't really sup
pose that any of those Stanford
students would care to take fif
teen minutes to read the irrefut
able documentary evidence that
the Johnson Administration,
which they support, simply will
not participate in the negotia
tions which they also support,
negotiations with the people we
are slaughtering while you are
reading this letter.
