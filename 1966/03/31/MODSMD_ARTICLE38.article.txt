# An Open Letter To Storey, Sigma Chi
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is a reply to an open letter to
the faculty which appeared in the Daily Friday, March 4. In
that letter the members of Sigma Chi and residents of Storey
House said that the negligible response to an invitation to a
tea "leads us to consider . . . whether or not the faculty is at
all interested in this type of interaction with the students.
The indications are that they are not.")
The existing lack of communication between students and
faculty is qualitative, not quantitative. Substantial evidence
exists to indicate that an excess of academic, para-academic,
and "formalized" communications prevail. An example of the
latter, in my style of thinking and feeling, would be a "Storey
House Tea."
Let me be frank. When my wife and I read the invitation,
our unanimous, quiet, but sustained response was: Ugh. For
several reasons:
• These affairs are formal, dreary, and tend to evoke the
"best" in clothes and anxiety;
• The time of day, In itself, is formal;
• From a personal standpoint, I detest "teas." (It simply
isn't my cup, nor, at other types of functions, do I need to
be "in my cups." As regards "teas", however, alcohol would
help. At least it would help me).
No letter of this kind is worth a damn without suggestions.
I suggest:
• Informal, buffet dinners or bar-b-ques for which c°at, tie
and dressing-up formality are banned, and where no time
limit is implied or stated.
• Spike the punch. "Russian tea" is rather good.
• Limit the number attending to no more than twelve.
Most on-eampus functions become formalized in direct pro
portion to the number of individuals involved, (if in doubt,
ask those who know about Reg week.)
If the above is vague and unsatisfactory, then solicit four
intrepid individuals from Storey House, four from Sigma Chi,
call me, and we'll arrange something at my house. I will
wait. In vain, I would hope not.

P.S. The least I could have done was to have called and
declined your invitation. I did.
