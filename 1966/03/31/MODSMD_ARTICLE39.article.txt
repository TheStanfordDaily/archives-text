# On The Right
## Watching Kennedy Rise In The East 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
It should be noted that some
time between the fall of 1965
and the spring of 1966, Senator
Teddy Kennedy yielded to his
older brother, who has success
fully effected what the political
scientists call "the problem of
the succession." During 1961 and
much of 1965, the operating as
sumption was that it would fall
to Teddy to inherit his brother's
mantle, that Bobby would never
qualify because of the brutali
zations of his own political ex
perience.
It is, I believe, at this point
manifest that Robert has made
it in his own right, and is no
longer thought of purely as a
political technician, useful only
for organizing the armies, or
poisoning the rivals' soup.
During his lifetime, it was of
course never widely speculated
that any Kennedy other than
John F. would sit on the throne.
The dynastic cracks were mostly
to the efffectc that Jonh-John
would be the next threat.
But on one occasion Mr. Gore
Vidal, the playwright, caused a
considerable sensation. In the
winter of 1962 he published a
piece of speculation in Esquire
Magazine pr o j e c t in g, most
gloomily, the utter inevitability
of Bobby, i.e., after John had run
his two presidential terms. The
article in question, even though
it was honed on personal spite,
caused the political world to
contemplate for the first time
that awesome possibility.
But mostly the professionals
concluded that th o u g h Bobby
was many things, he was not
presidentabili . , . that he was a
little short of the bigtime dimen
sion that people tend to .require
of their presidents either that,
or a perfect embodiment of the
national mood, a Warren Hard
ing. Bobby had neither the great
ness, nor the roots deep enough
in his Party or his nation's
esteem, to succeed to the Presi
dency in the mechanical sense
that the sun succeeds the dawn.
It was the cranky thesis of Mr.
Vidal that the national addiction
to Kennedys exceeded the na
tional reserve concerning Bob

by, and that therefore in 1968,
when John stepped down, Robert
would step up. The article pro
voked considerable alarm both
because il heightened the general
suspicion of Bobby and because
it warned that Bobby would in
deed get us, if we didn't walch
out.
A lot of good Americans took
the pledge on that occasion nevei
to serve as instruments by which

to esculate that awful prospect.
Many of those same Americans
have, by now, renounced that
pledge. What did it?
In Expiation
Unquestionably the tragic
death of the President was pri
marily responsible. It left a na
tion which, somehow in expia
tion, felt it couldn't do enough
for the Kennedys. One result was
Bobby's great ovation, given at

Atlantic City, as if to say to Lyn
don Johnson "You are the boss
and we concede that, but never
suppose that you can occupy the
place your predecessor did." And
his election over the popular Sen
ator Keating a few months later.
But Bobby must take a great
deal of the credit himself. It was
not alone the hagiolatry that sur
rounded his brother that worked
for him. Through his own ef-

forts, he succeeded in acquiring
important and discriminating al
lies, most of them among the
liberal intelligentsia. Arthur
Sehlesinger Jr. can be a power
ful friend, and he has unmistak
ably cast his lot with Bobby.
Half Dozen Senators
Bobby's organizing skill per
mitted him a tight hold on a half
dozen Senators, whom he de
ployed with deftness, constant
testimony to his raw power in
the legislature. He is strong
with the Party not only for the
obvious reason that he is a Ken
nedy, but because he does his
duty, as when last fall he cam
paigned industriously in the lost
cause of Mr. Abraham Bcame.
He is developing a personal
flair, demonstrated by his visit
a fortnight ago to the University
of Mississippi, which greeted
him with tears of joy, even as
Berlin, looking up from the rub
ble, greeted General Eisenhower.
Indestructible
So history worked for Bobby,
and Bobby worked well for Bob
by. There has been a third fac
tor. He is indestructible. He can
say silly things, as he did all over
Latin America, and, somehow,
not be taken as silly.
He can say outrageous things,
as for instance that he would not
object to American blood flow
ing into Vietcong veins, and
when the public winces, he will
issue a torrent of explanations
and modifications (I didn't mean
that I said it, I moan that I said
I didn't say it, is that perfectly
clear—that kind of thing) which
are gratefully and instantly ac
cepted.
He can back the machine, as
he did in New York, and some
how escape the normal conse
quences of the association. He
can propose excruciatingly inap
posite solutions for Vietnam, and
emerge as the forward-looking
thinker.
It is, so far, a winning com
bination Teddy is out. And Hu
bert Humphrey is on the defen
sive. It might even be safe to
say that the country is on the
defensive.
