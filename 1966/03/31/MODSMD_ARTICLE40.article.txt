Congress was incensed last
year with the appearance at
Berkeley of a mimeographed
pamphlet "Ways and Means of
'Beating' and Defeating the
Draft," distributed by the Viet
nam Day Committee.
The pamphlet, a satire on
draft • dodging, first appeared
about six months ago. The fol
lowing are examples of the ad
vice presented in the pamphlet:
—"Be an undesirable. Go for
a couple of weeks without a
shower. Really look dirty. Stink.

Long hair helps. Go in barefoot
with your sandals tied around
your neck.
—"Be gay. Play the homosex
ual bit. Mark 'yes' or don't mark
the 'Homosexual Tendencies' line
on the form. Psychiatrists may
give you the run around but
stick with it. Besides flicking
your wrist, move your body a
little like the chicks do—hold
cigarette delicately, talk melodi
cally, act embarrassed in front
of the other guys when you un
dress. Ask your girl friend to
give you lessons.
—"Arrive high. They'll smell
it, and you won't have to admit
it. If you want to go about the
addiction scene in a really big
way, use a common pin on your
arm for a few weeks in ad
vance."
Sen. Thomas Kuchel (R.-
Calif.) labelled the authors of
the pamphlet "the vicious, ven
omous, and vile leaders of this
infamous movement to attempt
to influence young people of this
country to evade the draft by
fraud and chicanery."
"What has gone on sows the
seeds of treason," he continued.
Investigation
Kuchel also called for an in
vestigation by the Justice De
partment of the Berkeley draft
dodging leaflet.
Representative Hugh Carey
(D-N.Y.) said, "I believe the
time has come not only to wave
the flag, but to wash from the
toes of America this un-Ameri
can case of athlete's foot which
pretends to be part of the con
tagion of freedom."
Among groups which give ad
vice and counseling to potential
conscientious objectors is the
Central Committee for Consci
entious Objectors (CCCO),
which has distributed 10,000
copies of its "Handbook for
Conscientious Objectors" since
November, 1965.
The handbook makes it ap
parent that the course a pros
pective C.O. must follow is ex
hausting and rigorous, and only
the most dedicated pacifists will
eventually gain C.O. status.
C. O. Status
Of these applicants who per
severed through the courts,
about 95 per cent eventually ob
tain a C.O. status, according to
Arlo Tatum, executive secretary
of CCCO.
A student will not lose his 11-S
status if he applies for exemp
tion as a C.O.
Although willingness to com
mit an act of self-defense or lack
of affiliation with a church does
not constitute grounds for a lo
cal board to deny C.O. status,
one must have a belief that is
opposed to all wars.
Scrutiny of one's beliefs is ex
haustively comprehensive. Ques
tions range from "Would you
be willing to use coercion to de
fend this country if it were at
tacked?" to "Under what cir
cumstances, if any, do you be

lieve in the use of force?"
Even members of religious
groups committed to pacifism,
including the Quakers and Je
hovah's Witnesses, sometimes
fail in the struggle through
FBI investigations and cross-ex
amination by the local and ap
peal boards.
Two legal classes of conscien
tious objection exist.
The 1-A-O is for individuals
who object to combatant service
but are willing to serve in Army
units such as the medical corps.
The l-O is for
those who are opposed to all
military service and are thus
assigned to civilian work "con
tributing to the maintenance of
the national health, safety, or in
terest."
If a person who is classified
l-O refuses to comply with his
mandatory work order, he is
subject to prosecution by a U.S.
District Court.
Objections
Catlett listed several common
objections to conscientious ob
jection:
—"The C.0., as he is equated
with the pacifist, is politically
naive and almost immoral. With
organized political power that is
willing to use violence to attain
its end today, he uses his love
for man and neglects the con
cept of political justice.
—"The C.O. would want every
American to hold his position.
If so, what alternatives would
he use to resist aggression? Is
he just hiding behind American
nuclear might to justify his
position?
—"One has to believe and par
ticipate in the military institu
tions in the hope of future world
peace. There is no other alterna
tive."
Non-Oooperator
Paul Salstrom is a non-cooper
ator, an absolutist, a disaffiliate,
an anti-conscriptor. He has spent
33 months of his life in jail for

a belief, a commitment to his
conscience.
At the age of 20, Salstrom re
fused to carry his draft card,
sending it back to his local
board. In consequence, he re
ceived an order to report for in
duction.
Salstrom refused to comply on
the grounds that "any affiliation
with the system is an affiliation
with militarism."
Ho was then arrested and sen
tenced by a Federal District
Court to a three year sentence
in prison. After fasting for the
first 15 days of his sentence in
prison, he was transferred to the
Medical Center for Federal Pris
oners in Springfield, Mo.
Salstrom got a "mandatory
release" after two years of good
conduct.
However, he was re-arrested
and sentenced to an additional
nine months in the Danbury
Correctional Institution after
violating the terms of his re
lease by organizing an anti
draft caravan.
After his release in June, 1965,
he was reclassified 4-F for his
conviction on felony charges.
Paul Salstrom is a case in
point. Ho is an absolutist, whoSe
commitment to conscience sup
ersedes all else, even his regard
for personal safety.
He believes that one's consid
eration of the draft must be set
in "the context of beliefs about
right and wrong . . . for I have
experienced morality as one of
the truly precious aspects of
life.
"But morals cease to be
morals and beliefs to be beliefs
to the extent that they are set
to stew in a pot of random con
cerns about one's personal com
fort or the fate of one's skin."
"It's taking the C.O. position
a step further than those who
take a legal position, alterna
tive service or non-combatant
military duty," he said.

A student will not lose his 11-S
status if he applies for exemp
tion as a C.O.
Although willingness to com
mit an act of self-defense or lack
of affiliation with a church does
not constitute grounds for a lo
cal board to deny C.O. status,
one must have a belief that is
opposed to all wars.
Scrutiny of one's beliefs is ex
haustively comprehensive. Ques
tions range from "Would you
be willing to use coercion to de
fend this country if it were at
tacked?" to "Under what cir
cumstances, if any, do you be

lieve in the use of force?"
Even members of religious
groups committed to pacifism,
including the Quakers and Je
hovah's Witnesses, sometimes
fail in the struggle through
FBI investigations and cross-ex
amination by the local and ap
peal boards.
Two legal classes of conscien
tious objection exist.
The 1-A-O is for individuals
who object to combatant service
but are willing to serve in Army
units such as the medical corps.
The l-O is for
those who are opposed to all
military service and are thus
assigned to civilian work "con
tributing to the maintenance of
the national health, safety, or in
terest."
If a person who is classified
l-O refuses to comply with his
mandatory work order, he is
subject to prosecution by a U.S.
District Court.
Objections
Catlett listed several common
objections to conscientious ob
jection:
—"The C.0., as he is equated
with the pacifist, is politically
naive and almost immoral. With
organized political power that is
willing to use violence to attain
its end today, he uses his love
for man and neglects the con
cept of political justice.
—"The C.O. would want every
American to hold his position.
If so, what alternatives would
he use to resist aggression? Is
he just hiding behind American
nuclear might to justify his
position?
—"One has to believe and par
ticipate in the military institu
tions in the hope of future world
peace. There is no other alterna
tive."
Non-Oooperator
Paul Salstrom is a non-cooper
ator, an absolutist, a disaffiliate,
an anti-conscriptor. He has spent
33 months of his life in jail for

a belief, a commitment to his
conscience.
At the age of 20, Salstrom re
fused to carry his draft card,
sending it back to his local
board. In consequence, he re
ceived an order to report for in
duction.
Salstrom refused to comply on
the grounds that "any affiliation
with the system is an affiliation
with militarism."
Ho was then arrested and sen
tenced by a Federal District
Court to a three year sentence
in prison. After fasting for the
first 15 days of his sentence in
prison, he was transferred to the
Medical Center for Federal Pris
oners in Springfield, Mo.
Salstrom got a "mandatory
release" after two years of good
conduct.
However, he was re-arrested
and sentenced to an additional
nine months in the Danbury
Correctional Institution after
violating the terms of his re
lease by organizing an anti
draft caravan.
After his release in June, 1965,
he was reclassified 4-F for his
conviction on felony charges.
Paul Salstrom is a case in
point. Ho is an absolutist, whoSe
commitment to conscience sup
ersedes all else, even his regard
for personal safety.
He believes that one's consid
eration of the draft must be set
in "the context of beliefs about
right and wrong . . . for I have
experienced morality as one of
the truly precious aspects of
life.
"But morals cease to be
morals and beliefs to be beliefs
to the extent that they are set
to stew in a pot of random con
cerns about one's personal com
fort or the fate of one's skin."
"It's taking the C.O. position
a step further than those who
take a legal position, alterna
tive service or non-combatant
military duty," he said.

The Collegiate Press Service
Congress was incensed last
year with the appearance at
Berkeley of a mimeographed
pamphlet "Ways and Means of
'Beating' and Defeating the
Draft," distributed by the Viet
nam Day Committee.
The pamphlet, a satire on
draft • dodging, first appeared
about six months ago. The fol
lowing are examples of the ad
vice presented in the pamphlet:
—"Be an undesirable. Go for
a couple of weeks without a
shower. Really look dirty. Stink.

Long hair helps. Go in barefoot
with your sandals tied around
your neck.
—"Be gay. Play the homosex
ual bit. Mark 'yes' or don't mark
the 'Homosexual Tendencies' line
on the form. Psychiatrists may
give you the run around but
stick with it. Besides flicking
your wrist, move your body a
little like the chicks do—hold
cigarette delicately, talk melodi
cally, act embarrassed in front
of the other guys when you un
dress. Ask your girl friend to
give you lessons.
—"Arrive high. They'll smell
it, and you won't have to admit
it. If you want to go about the
addiction scene in a really big
way, use a common pin on your
arm for a few weeks in ad
vance."
Sen. Thomas Kuchel (R.-
Calif.) labelled the authors of
the pamphlet "the vicious, ven
omous, and vile leaders of this
infamous movement to attempt
to influence young people of this
country to evade the draft by
fraud and chicanery."
"What has gone on sows the
seeds of treason," he continued.
Investigation
Kuchel also called for an in
vestigation by the Justice De
partment of the Berkeley draft
dodging leaflet.
Representative Hugh Carey
(D-N.Y.) said, "I believe the
time has come not only to wave
the flag, but to wash from the
toes of America this un-Ameri
can case of athlete's foot which
pretends to be part of the con
tagion of freedom."
Among groups which give ad
vice and counseling to potential
conscientious objectors is the
Central Committee for Consci
entious Objectors (CCCO),
which has distributed 10,000
copies of its "Handbook for
Conscientious Objectors" since
November, 1965.
The handbook makes it ap
parent that the course a pros
pective C.O. must follow is ex
hausting and rigorous, and only
the most dedicated pacifists will
eventually gain C.O. status.
C. O. Status
Of these applicants who per
severed through the courts,
about 95 per cent eventually ob
tain a C.O. status, according to

The Collegiate Press Service
Congress was incensed last
year with the appearance at
Berkeley of a mimeographed
pamphlet "Ways and Means of
'Beating' and Defeating the
Draft," distributed by the Viet
nam Day Committee.
The pamphlet, a satire on
draft • dodging, first appeared
about six months ago. The fol
lowing are examples of the ad
vice presented in the pamphlet:
—"Be an undesirable. Go for
a couple of weeks without a
shower. Really look dirty. Stink.

Long hair helps. Go in barefoot
with your sandals tied around
your neck.
—"Be gay. Play the homosex
ual bit. Mark 'yes' or don't mark
the 'Homosexual Tendencies' line
on the form. Psychiatrists may
give you the run around but
stick with it. Besides flicking
your wrist, move your body a
little like the chicks do—hold
cigarette delicately, talk melodi
cally, act embarrassed in front
of the other guys when you un
dress. Ask your girl friend to
give you lessons.
—"Arrive high. They'll smell
it, and you won't have to admit
it. If you want to go about the
addiction scene in a really big
way, use a common pin on your
arm for a few weeks in ad
vance."
Sen. Thomas Kuchel (R.-
Calif.) labelled the authors of
the pamphlet "the vicious, ven
omous, and vile leaders of this
infamous movement to attempt
to influence young people of this
country to evade the draft by
fraud and chicanery."
"What has gone on sows the
seeds of treason," he continued.
Investigation
Kuchel also called for an in
vestigation by the Justice De
partment of the Berkeley draft
dodging leaflet.
Representative Hugh Carey
(D-N.Y.) said, "I believe the
time has come not only to wave
the flag, but to wash from the
toes of America this un-Ameri
can case of athlete's foot which
pretends to be part of the con
tagion of freedom."
Among groups which give ad
vice and counseling to potential
conscientious objectors is the
Central Committee for Consci
entious Objectors (CCCO),
which has distributed 10,000
copies of its "Handbook for
Conscientious Objectors" since
November, 1965.
The handbook makes it ap
parent that the course a pros
pective C.O. must follow is ex
hausting and rigorous, and only
the most dedicated pacifists will
eventually gain C.O. status.
C. O. Status
Of these applicants who per
severed through the courts,
about 95 per cent eventually ob
tain a C.O. status, according to
Arlo Tatum, executive secretary
of CCCO.
A student will not lose his 11-S
status if he applies for exemp
tion as a C.O.
Although willingness to com
mit an act of self-defense or lack
of affiliation with a church does
not constitute grounds for a lo
cal board to deny C.O. status,
one must have a belief that is
opposed to all wars.
Scrutiny of one's beliefs is ex
haustively comprehensive. Ques
tions range from "Would you
be willing to use coercion to de
fend this country if it were at
tacked?" to "Under what cir
cumstances, if any, do you be

lieve in the use of force?"
Even members of religious
groups committed to pacifism,
including the Quakers and Je
hovah's Witnesses, sometimes
fail in the struggle through
FBI investigations and cross-ex
amination by the local and ap
peal boards.
Two legal classes of conscien
tious objection exist.
The 1-A-O is for individuals
who object to combatant service
but are willing to serve in Army
units such as the medical corps.
The l-O is for
those who are opposed to all
military service and are thus
assigned to civilian work "con
tributing to the maintenance of
the national health, safety, or in
terest."
If a person who is classified
l-O refuses to comply with his
mandatory work order, he is
subject to prosecution by a U.S.
District Court.
Objections
Catlett listed several common
objections to conscientious ob
jection:
—"The C.0., as he is equated
with the pacifist, is politically
naive and almost immoral. With
organized political power that is
willing to use violence to attain
its end today, he uses his love
for man and neglects the con
cept of political justice.
—"The C.O. would want every
American to hold his position.
If so, what alternatives would
he use to resist aggression? Is
he just hiding behind American
nuclear might to justify his
position?
—"One has to believe and par
ticipate in the military institu
tions in the hope of future world
peace. There is no other alterna
tive."
Non-Oooperator
Paul Salstrom is a non-cooper
ator, an absolutist, a disaffiliate,
an anti-conscriptor. He has spent
33 months of his life in jail for

a belief, a commitment to his
conscience.
At the age of 20, Salstrom re
fused to carry his draft card,
sending it back to his local
board. In consequence, he re
ceived an order to report for in
duction.
Salstrom refused to comply on
the grounds that "any affiliation
with the system is an affiliation
with militarism."
Ho was then arrested and sen
tenced by a Federal District
Court to a three year sentence
in prison. After fasting for the
first 15 days of his sentence in
prison, he was transferred to the
Medical Center for Federal Pris
oners in Springfield, Mo.

seeds of treason," he continued.
Investigation
Kuchel also called for an in
vestigation by the Justice De
partment of the Berkeley draft
dodging leaflet.
Representative Hugh Carey
(D-N.Y.) said, "I believe the
time has come not only to wave
the flag, but to wash from the
toes of America this un-Ameri
can case of athlete's foot which
pretends to be part of the con
tagion of freedom."
Among groups which give ad
vice and counseling to potential
conscientious objectors is the
Central Committee for Consci
entious Objectors (CCCO),
which has distributed 10,000
copies of its "Handbook for
Conscientious Objectors" since
November, 1965.
The handbook makes it ap
parent that the course a pros
pective C.O. must follow is ex
hausting and rigorous, and only
the most dedicated pacifists will
eventually gain C.O. status.
C. O. Status
Of these applicants who per
severed through the courts,
about 95 per cent eventually ob
tain a C.O. status, according to
Arlo Tatum, executive secretary
of CCCO.
A student will not lose his 11-S
status if he applies for exemp
tion as a C.O.
Although willingness to com
mit an act of self-defense or lack
of affiliation with a church does
not constitute grounds for a lo
cal board to deny C.O. status,
one must have a belief that is
opposed to all wars.
Scrutiny of one's beliefs is ex
haustively comprehensive. Ques
tions range from "Would you
be willing to use coercion to de
fend this country if it were at
tacked?" to "Under what cir
cumstances, if any, do you be

lieve in the use of force?"
Even members of religious
groups committed to pacifism,
including the Quakers and Je
hovah's Witnesses, sometimes
fail in the struggle through
FBI investigations and cross-ex
amination by the local and ap
peal boards.
Two legal classes of conscien
tious objection exist.
The 1-A-O is for individuals
who object to combatant service
but are willing to serve in Army
units such as the medical corps.
The l-O is for
those who are opposed to all
military service and are thus
assigned to civilian work "con
tributing to the maintenance of
the national health, safety, or in
terest."
If a person who is classified
l-O refuses to comply with his
mandatory work order, he is
subject to prosecution by a U.S.
District Court.
Objections
Catlett listed several common
objections to conscientious ob
jection:
—"The C.0., as he is equated
with the pacifist, is politically
naive and almost immoral. With
organized political power that is
willing to use violence to attain
its end today, he uses his love
for man and neglects the con
cept of political justice.
—"The C.O. would want every
American to hold his position.
If so, what alternatives would
he use to resist aggression? Is
he just hiding behind American
nuclear might to justify his
position?
—"One has to believe and par
ticipate in the military institu
tions in the hope of future world
peace. There is no other alterna
tive."
Non-Oooperator
Paul Salstrom is a non-cooper
ator, an absolutist, a disaffiliate,
an anti-conscriptor. He has spent
33 months of his life in jail for

a belief, a commitment to his
conscience.
At the age of 20, Salstrom re
fused to carry his draft card,
sending it back to his local
board. In consequence, he re
ceived an order to report for in
duction.
Salstrom refused to comply on
the grounds that "any affiliation
with the system is an affiliation
with militarism."
Ho was then arrested and sen
tenced by a Federal District
Court to a three year sentence
in prison. After fasting for the
first 15 days of his sentence in
prison, he was transferred to the
Medical Center for Federal Pris
oners in Springfield, Mo.
Salstrom got a "mandatory
release" after two years of good
conduct.
However, he was re-arrested
and sentenced to an additional
nine months in the Danbury
Correctional Institution after
violating the terms of his re
lease by organizing an anti
draft caravan.
After his release in June, 1965,
he was reclassified 4-F for his
conviction on felony charges.
Paul Salstrom is a case in
point. Ho is an absolutist, whoSe
commitment to conscience sup
ersedes all else, even his regard
for personal safety.
He believes that one's consid
eration of the draft must be set
in "the context of beliefs about
right and wrong . . . for I have
experienced morality as one of
the truly precious aspects of
life.
"But morals cease to be
morals and beliefs to be beliefs
to the extent that they are set
to stew in a pot of random con
cerns about one's personal com
fort or the fate of one's skin."
"It's taking the C.O. position
a step further than those who
take a legal position, alterna
tive service or non-combatant
military duty," he said.

second of a series on conscien

By ROGER FRIEDLAND
The Collegiate Press Service
Congress was incensed last
year with the appearance at
Berkeley of a mimeographed
pamphlet "Ways and Means of
'Beating' and Defeating the
Draft," distributed by the Viet
nam Day Committee.
The pamphlet, a satire on
draft • dodging, first appeared
about six months ago. The fol
lowing are examples of the ad
vice presented in the pamphlet:
—"Be an undesirable. Go for
a couple of weeks without a
shower. Really look dirty. Stink.

Long hair helps. Go in barefoot
with your sandals tied around
your neck.
—"Be gay. Play the homosex
ual bit. Mark 'yes' or don't mark
the 'Homosexual Tendencies' line
on the form. Psychiatrists may
give you the run around but
stick with it. Besides flicking
your wrist, move your body a
little like the chicks do—hold
cigarette delicately, talk melodi
cally, act embarrassed in front
of the other guys when you un
dress. Ask your girl friend to
give you lessons.
—"Arrive high. They'll smell
it, and you won't have to admit
it. If you want to go about the
addiction scene in a really big
way, use a common pin on your
arm for a few weeks in ad
vance."
Sen. Thomas Kuchel (R.-
Calif.) labelled the authors of
the pamphlet "the vicious, ven
omous, and vile leaders of this
infamous movement to attempt
to influence young people of this
country to evade the draft by
fraud and chicanery."
"What has gone on sows the
seeds of treason," he continued.
