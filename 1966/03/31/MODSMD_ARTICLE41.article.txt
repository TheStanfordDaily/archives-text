The trouble with early morning classes is that you're too
sleepy. At late morning classes you're too hungry. At early
afternoon classes you're too logy. At late afternoon classes
you're too hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well
face it—there is no good time of day to take a class.
What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy?
1 say no! I say America did not become the hope of man
kind and the world's largest producer of butterfats and tal
low by running away from a fight!
If you're always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then
let's hold classes when you're not too hungry or sleepy:
namely, while you're eating or sleeping.
Classes while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lec
turer lecture while the eaters eat. But watch out for noisy
foods. I mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when every
body is crunching celery or matzo or like that? Serve quiet
stuff—like anchovy paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls
of lamb fat.
Now let us turn to the problem of learning while sleep
ing. First, can it be done?
Yes, it can. Psychologists have proved that the brain is
definitely able to assimilate information during sleep. Take,
for instance, a recent experiment conducted by a leading
Eastern university (Stanford). A small tape recorder was
placed under the pillow of the subject, a freshman named
Wrobert Wright. When Wrobert was fast asleep, the re
corder was turned on. Softly, all through the night, it re
peated three statements in \\ robert's slumbering ear:
1. Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109 and is called
"The Founder of English Eclectic Philosophy."
'2. The banana plant is not a tree but a large perennial
herb.
3. The Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914 at
Sarajevo by a young nationalist named Mjilas Cvetnic,
who has been called "The Trigger of World War I."

When Wrobert awoke in the morning, the psychologists
said to him, "Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109. What
is he called?"
Wrobert promptly answered, "Perennial Herb."
Next they asked him, "What has Mjilas Cvetnik been
called?"
Wrobert replied, "Perennial Serb."
Finally they said, "Is the banana plant a tree?"
"To be honest," said Wrobert, "I don't know too much
about bananas. But if you gents want any information
about razor blades, I'm your man."
"Well," said the psychologists, "can you tell us a blade
that shaves closely and cleanly without nicking, pricking,
scratching, scraping, scoring, gouging, grinding, flaying or
flensing?"
"Yes, I can," said Wrobert. "Personna" Stainless Steel
Blades. Not only does Personna give you a true luxury
shave, but it gives you heaps and gobs and bushels and
barrels of true luxury shaves—each one nearly as truly lux
urious as the first."
"Land's sake!" said the psychologists.
"Moreover," said Wrobert, "Personna is available not
only in the Double Pldge style blade, but also in the Injec
tor style blade."
"Great balls of fire!" said the psychologists.
"So why don't you rush to your dealer and get some
Personnas at once?" said Wrobert.
"We will," said the psychologists, twinkling, "but there
is something we have to do first."
Whereupon they awarded Wrobert an honorary L.L.B.
Lover of Luxury Blades) degree, and then, linking arms,
they sang and danced and bobbed for apples till the camp
fire had turned to embers.
