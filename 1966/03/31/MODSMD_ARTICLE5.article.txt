# Visiting Speaker Analyzes Rodin
## 
### PAM LANG 
"Rodin gave young sculptures op
tions," said Dr. Alfred E. Elsen in
last night's art lecture; this depart
ure from the norm assured his im
portance even with those who doubt
his positive influence.
The University of Indiana professor
of art, a former Stanford visiting pro
fessor, kicked-off this quarter's six
week Wednesday Evening Lecture
Series with an hour-long illustrated
talk exploring "Rodin and the Begin
nings of Modern Sculpture."
He suggested three possible ways to
approach this topic. Agreement with

the critic who called Rodin's Balzar
"the gateway to modern sculpture"
can lead to the "optimistic and most
charitable view" that Rodin is the
most important influence on modern
sculpture.
But "every young sculptor after
1917 reacted against Rodin, trying to
develop a counter-style." A second
view, which Elsen objectively elabor
ated as "the case against Rodin," is
that Rodin is not really a serious in
fluence.
The third position is that the topic
is meaningless and as inpragmatic as
state since there is no such thing as

"modern sculpture," because of the
continuous evolution of the art form.
Rodin's early work was a "very
daring" reaction against mid-nine
teenth century sculpture, which
ideally had "the look of having been
made at another time in another
place."
He believed that the artist should
imitate nature, that "the work of art
was to be the direct result of intense
study, of sight and touch." His was an
art analysis and then synthesis, with
the body as the ideal model .
His aim was "the synchronization of
a very alert eye and a hand that had
at its fingertips the whole history of
art. After 1890 Rodin turned off the
history of art in his fingertips so that
he could approach his subject naiv
ely," avoiding what the Rumanian
sculptor Brancusi called "the tyranny
of the hand."
Elsen alternated his illustrations of
Rodin's work with slides of the work
of other artists, including such paint
er-sculptors as Gaugin and Matisse,
attempting to show how they both
rebelled against and followed Rodin.
Rodin's continuing influence is well
illustrated in one important innova
tion, the idea of a "partial figure."
In his first experiment, he cut the
head off a standing figure, removing
its identity, the concept of the "whole
man," and the Renaissance ideal of
reason. Rodin's development of this
technique made it acceptable for
sculptors to separate parts of the
body and still have a complete work
to be appreciated.
He concluded very seriously:
"Sculpture will always be grateful
to Rodin for having shown sculptors
at the beginning of this century a
meaningful way of continuing their
art into the twentieth century."

He believed that the artist should
imitate nature, that "the work of art
was to be the direct result of intense
study, of sight and touch." His was an
art analysis and then synthesis, with
the body as the ideal model .
His aim was "the synchronization of
a very alert eye and a hand that had
at its fingertips the whole history of
art. After 1890 Rodin turned off the
history of art in his fingertips so that
he could approach his subject naiv
ely," avoiding what the Rumanian
sculptor Brancusi called "the tyranny
of the hand."
Elsen alternated his illustrations of
Rodin's work with slides of the work
of other artists, including such paint
er-sculptors as Gaugin and Matisse,
attempting to show how they both
rebelled against and followed Rodin.
Rodin's continuing influence is well
illustrated in one important innova
tion, the idea of a "partial figure."
In his first experiment, he cut the
head off a standing figure, removing
its identity, the concept of the "whole
man," and the Renaissance ideal of
reason. Rodin's development of this
technique made it acceptable for
sculptors to separate parts of the
body and still have a complete work
to be appreciated.
He concluded very seriously:
"Sculpture will always be grateful
to Rodin for having shown sculptors
at the beginning of this century a
meaningful way of continuing their
art into the twentieth century."
"Rodin gave young sculptures op
tions," said Dr. Alfred E. Elsen in
last night's art lecture; this depart
ure from the norm assured his im
portance even with those who doubt
his positive influence.
The University of Indiana professor
of art, a former Stanford visiting pro
fessor, kicked-off this quarter's six
week Wednesday Evening Lecture
Series with an hour-long illustrated
talk exploring "Rodin and the Begin
nings of Modern Sculpture."
He suggested three possible ways to
approach this topic. Agreement with

the critic who called Rodin's Balzar
"the gateway to modern sculpture"
can lead to the "optimistic and most
charitable view" that Rodin is the
most important influence on modern
sculpture.
But "every young sculptor after
1917 reacted against Rodin, trying to
develop a counter-style." A second
view, which Elsen objectively elabor
ated as "the case against Rodin," is
that Rodin is not really a serious in
fluence.
The third position is that the topic
is meaningless and as inpragmatic as
state since there is no such thing as

"modern sculpture," because of the
continuous evolution of the art form.
Rodin's early work was a "very
daring" reaction against mid-nine
teenth century sculpture, which
ideally had "the look of having been
made at another time in another
place."
