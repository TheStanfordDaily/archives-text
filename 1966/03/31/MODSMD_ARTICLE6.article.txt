# SCPV Endorses Petition For Napalm Referendum
## 
### 
"This is an historic opportunity for
the Peace Movement. It is the first
time that we will be able to exert
direct control over the decisions mak
ing process, it is not a mere symbolic
action."
This is how Professor Bruce Frank
lin described the SCPV's latest at
tempt at stopping the production of
Napalm in Redwood City. The action
is to force the people of Redwood
City to vote on a referendum which
would deny the United Technology
Corporation the use of facilities of
the Port of Redwood City for ship
ping Napalm.
Important Precedent
By placing this issue before the
people of Redwood City, we would
be "setting an important precedent:
that the people of a community have
the right to determine the extent of
their implication in this war." Frank
lin said. "This will also force these
people to think about the war and
to make a decision about it before
they vote on the referendum."
The SCPV is attempting to prevent
UTC from fulfilling its Sll million
contract to produce 100 million
pounds of Napalm-B for the govern
ment. This is a new form of Napalm
which is much more effective than
previous forms.
SCPV Pamphlet
The SCPV has published a pamph
let which explains the nature and uses
of napalm, and the effect of napalm
on the villages of South Vietnam. It
explains that the present contract
for Napalm will use 25 million pounds
of a commercial plastic, called poly
styrene, per month to produce enough
napalm for "50,000 firebombs a
month" for the next seven months.
The present plan, discussed at the
emergency meeting of the SCPV last
night, is to assist a Redwood City
Committee which opposes the pro
duction of Napalm in getting signa
tures on the referendum. Only resi
dents of Redwood City can sign the

petitions and only they can collect
signatures.
Workers Needed
Professor Franklin asked the SCPV
to provide workers who will do the
background work for the Redwood
City residents so that they can be
freed to collect signatures.
The strategy which forces the U.S.
to produce so much Napalm was also
considered at the meeting. According
to members of the SCPV Steering
Committee, the U.S. has failed to
achieve its objectives by other types
of warfare and so is resorting to mass
bombing of hamlets in the country
side with the hope of killing Viet
Cong who might be there. "The very
type of warfare that we're using
shows our real intentions in the war"
a spokesman said.
