# Series To Focus On Radical View
## 
### 
The Socialist Caucus will sponsor
a series of lectures this weekend en
titled "Baran and American Radical
ism Today."
Keith Lowe, a member of the se
ries panning committee, commented,
"The program is not a memorium to
Baran, but rather it is being presented
to keep his work alive."

1949 until his death in 1964. He was
perhaps the only Marxist economist
teaching in a major American univer
sity during that period.
