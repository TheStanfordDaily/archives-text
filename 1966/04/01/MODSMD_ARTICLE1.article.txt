# Senior Colloquia: To Acclaim Or Not To Acclaim?
## 
### MARSHA ROOD 
The fact that every student at Stanford
is required to take a senior colloquium has
caused both vigorous defense and criticism
of the program by faculty and students.
Dr. Robert A. Walker, Director of Gen
eral Studies and a vigorous proponent of
the program, said that the main purpose of
the Senior Colloquia Program as stated in
the Stanford University Bulletin is "... to
stimulate serious thought rather than to im
part information for its own sake." He said
that the Colloquia Program was recom
mended by the Faculty Committee on Cur
riculum in 1965 as an extension of the Hon
ors Humanities colloquia requirement to
all Senior-year AB candidates. The Com

mittee felt that the colloquia would impose
too much of a burden on the BS candidate's
heavy requirements. Walker stated that a
grant of $i(X),000 from the Carnegie Foun
dation provided the initial funds for the
program.
Draw on Past Experience
The colloquia according to Dr. Walker,
are scheduled in the senior year so that stu
dents can draw on the past tliree years of
their education in discussion participation.
The Faculty Committee on Curriculum
specified that the colloquia should not be
in the students major so that he will be
able to broaden his intellectual horizons.
One of the big problems, Walker said, is
to offer enough colloquia so tliat the stu

dents have a reasonable chance of getting
one he wants. This means that a big teach
ing obligation must be met with good pro
fessors. "Many departments feel their pri
mary obligation is to their majors ,and not to
others," Walker commented. "The professors
may have competing demands for their
time in areas of research, advising, and so
forth. Some professors feel less rewarded
because students are less prepared, but this
is not true in all cases."
Ad Hoc Committee
An Ad Hoc Committee on Senior Col
loquia was appointed in 1960 by the Aca
demic Council to study the program. Al
though the report is classified, the general
impression Walker was able to give was
that colloquia lire no more or less popular

than any other courses, that not a very sig
nificant number of professors dislike to
teach them, and that most students wanted
to take them by choice rather than by re
quirement. Another study will be made in
the next two years, lie said.
Dr. Friedrich Strothman, vice chairman
of the Committee on General Studies, said
the program has been a success from the
very beginning. The main advantage point
of the colloquia, he said, is to enable the
student to compete on an equal level in a
subject that is not in his major area of study.
Forced 'Broadening'
Professor Thomas Moser, executive head
of the English Department, is not in favor
of having the colloquia required. lie does
not like the idea that seniors be forced

to "broaden" themselves. Dr. Moser also
ieels that small classes ;ire more important
in the major field than in General Studies,
and that many professors do not find them
to be a rich, intellectual experience. He felt
that the senior year should be the climax
in the major field and time should not be
required to be spent outside the major field.
A propsed LASSU resolution entitled
"Revitalization of Senior Colloquia" ex
presses the value of Colloquia, but also feels
that they should not be required. The reso
lution states, "Present requirements force
many students into colloquia that they do
not want because desirable colloquia are
filled." Tlus resolution has been referred to
the LASSU Education Committee for fur
ther study.

the Senior Colloquia Program as stated in
the Stanford University Bulletin is "... to
stimulate serious thought rather than to im
part information for its own sake." He said
that the Colloquia Program was recom
mended by the Faculty Committee on Cur
riculum in 1965 as an extension of the Hon
ors Humanities colloquia requirement to
all Senior-year AB candidates. The Com

mittee felt that the colloquia would impose
too much of a burden on the BS candidate's
heavy requirements. Walker stated that a
grant of $i(X),000 from the Carnegie Foun
dation provided the initial funds for the
program.
Draw on Past Experience
The colloquia according to Dr. Walker,
are scheduled in the senior year so that stu
dents can draw on the past tliree years of
their education in discussion participation.
The Faculty Committee on Curriculum
specified that the colloquia should not be
in the students major so that he will be
able to broaden his intellectual horizons.
One of the big problems, Walker said, is
to offer enough colloquia so tliat the stu

dents have a reasonable chance of getting
one he wants. This means that a big teach
ing obligation must be met with good pro
fessors. "Many departments feel their pri
mary obligation is to their majors ,and not to
others," Walker commented. "The professors
may have competing demands for their
time in areas of research, advising, and so
forth. Some professors feel less rewarded
because students are less prepared, but this
is not true in all cases."
Ad Hoc Committee
An Ad Hoc Committee on Senior Col
loquia was appointed in 1960 by the Aca
demic Council to study the program. Al
though the report is classified, the general
impression Walker was able to give was
that colloquia lire no more or less popular

than any other courses, that not a very sig
nificant number of professors dislike to
teach them, and that most students wanted
to take them by choice rather than by re
quirement. Another study will be made in
the next two years, lie said.
Dr. Friedrich Strothman, vice chairman
of the Committee on General Studies, said
the program has been a success from the
very beginning. The main advantage point
of the colloquia, he said, is to enable the
student to compete on an equal level in a
subject that is not in his major area of study.
Forced 'Broadening'
Professor Thomas Moser, executive head
of the English Department, is not in favor
of having the colloquia required. lie does
not like the idea that seniors be forced

to "broaden" themselves. Dr. Moser also
ieels that small classes ;ire more important
in the major field than in General Studies,
and that many professors do not find them
to be a rich, intellectual experience. He felt
that the senior year should be the climax
in the major field and time should not be
required to be spent outside the major field.
A propsed LASSU resolution entitled
"Revitalization of Senior Colloquia" ex
presses the value of Colloquia, but also feels
that they should not be required. The reso
lution states, "Present requirements force
many students into colloquia that they do
not want because desirable colloquia are
filled." Tlus resolution has been referred to
the LASSU Education Committee for fur
ther study.
The fact that every student at Stanford
is required to take a senior colloquium has
caused both vigorous defense and criticism
of the program by faculty and students.
Dr. Robert A. Walker, Director of Gen
eral Studies and a vigorous proponent of
the program, said that the main purpose of
the Senior Colloquia Program as stated in

stimulate serious thought rather than to im
