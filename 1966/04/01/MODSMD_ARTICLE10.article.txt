# Kadane Requests More 'Humility'
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
Speaker Jay Kadane called for "a
greater humility and restraint" in
LASSU during a Spring Quarter ad
dress to the Legislature last night.
"There is," he said, "a substantial
portion of the student body dissatis
fied with the Legislature."
Ho said critics objected to the time
spent with "insignificant issues" on
one hand and the "dominant trend to
ward reform" on the other.
Palo Politics
'Granted," he said, "compared to
Indonesia, where students caused a
change in government, or Nigeria,
where students demonstrated because
the military government was planning
to yield power too quickly, Stanford
student politics seem pale."
He pointed out that some students
dislike the attempt to open dialogue
with other parts of the University
community.
"Both groups," he commented,
"unite in the feeling that our preten
sions exceed our performance.
"We should be willing," he said, "to
consider changes in our institution."
Kadane said that there are several
administrative habits "which hinder,
and sometimes make impossible, a
real hearing for students."
Time Horizon
The first of these, reluctance to deal
with isues when they are first raised,
he attributed to the difference in
"time horizon" between four-year stu
dents and faculty and administration.
"Nevertheless," he stated, "I be
lieve there is a tendency to be slow
in coming to grips with problems in
the hope that they will go away."
He also said that the tradition of
secrecy surrounding the actual formu
lation of policy lessened the chances
that students could persuade adminis
trators.
"Finally,"he said, "once an admin
istration decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a 'united front,' a
monolithic reaction to student ques
tions, complaints or disagreements."
Improvements
Kadane said that when the Uni
versity actually came to grips with
a problem, and allowed all parties to
participate in the decisions, the new

policies "are usually a vast improve
ment."
In other business, the Legislature
heard a report from new members of
the Committee of Fifteen, and dis
cussed possible changes in student
appellant procedures.
Political Union
A resolution on Political Union was
not considered because a quorum was
not present.
That legislation, submitted by Carl
Anderson, condemns the Political
Union for paying $1500 for a speech
last quarter by Senator Albert Gore.
It would provide for the establish
ment of a committee to investigate
the practices of the Political Union
as to speaker selection and fees paid
out.
A bill which would in effect abolish
women's regulations was referred to
the Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee. If accepted, it would replace
current by-laws with a voluntary
sign-out system for most women resi
dents.
First-quarter freshmen would be
under existing rules enforced by the
honor system.

with other parts of the University
community.
"Both groups," he commented,
"unite in the feeling that our preten
sions exceed our performance.
"We should be willing," he said, "to
consider changes in our institution."
Kadane said that there are several
administrative habits "which hinder,
and sometimes make impossible, a
real hearing for students."
Time Horizon
The first of these, reluctance to deal
with isues when they are first raised,
he attributed to the difference in
"time horizon" between four-year stu
dents and faculty and administration.
"Nevertheless," he stated, "I be
lieve there is a tendency to be slow
in coming to grips with problems in
the hope that they will go away."
He also said that the tradition of
secrecy surrounding the actual formu
lation of policy lessened the chances
that students could persuade adminis
trators.
"Finally,"he said, "once an admin
istration decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a 'united front,' a
monolithic reaction to student ques
tions, complaints or disagreements."
Improvements
Kadane said that when the Uni
versity actually came to grips with
a problem, and allowed all parties to
participate in the decisions, the new

policies "are usually a vast improve
ment."
In other business, the Legislature
heard a report from new members of
the Committee of Fifteen, and dis
cussed possible changes in student
appellant procedures.
Political Union
A resolution on Political Union was
not considered because a quorum was
not present.
That legislation, submitted by Carl
Anderson, condemns the Political
Union for paying $1500 for a speech
last quarter by Senator Albert Gore.
It would provide for the establish
ment of a committee to investigate
the practices of the Political Union
as to speaker selection and fees paid
out.
A bill which would in effect abolish
women's regulations was referred to
the Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee. If accepted, it would replace
current by-laws with a voluntary
sign-out system for most women resi
dents.
First-quarter freshmen would be
under existing rules enforced by the
honor system.
Speaker Jay Kadane called for "a
greater humility and restraint" in
LASSU during a Spring Quarter ad
dress to the Legislature last night.
"There is," he said, "a substantial
portion of the student body dissatis
fied with the Legislature."
Ho said critics objected to the time
spent with "insignificant issues" on
one hand and the "dominant trend to
ward reform" on the other.
Palo Politics
'Granted," he said, "compared to
Indonesia, where students caused a
change in government, or Nigeria,
where students demonstrated because
the military government was planning
to yield power too quickly, Stanford
student politics seem pale."
He pointed out that some students
