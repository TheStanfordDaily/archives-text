# Leader Advises Different Protest
## 
### 
The time has come for the next
step in the pacifist movement, accord
ing to David Mcßeynolds, field sec
retary of the War Resisters League
at a meeeting at TMU yesterday. Al
though Mcßeynolds salutes the pro
tests against war in Vietnam, he feels
it is time to reexamine them. Demon
strations alone will not stop the war.
The protest groups must not only
voice anger, they must begin to com
municate with the majority of Ameri
cans.
Pacifists, Mcßeynolds maintained,
don't have answers, they have ques
tions. It is not certain non-violence
will work, but at present it appears to
be the only viable choice.
Problem of Communication
The main problem facing the paci
fist movement which Mcßeynolds
sees is how to communicate with the
public. There is an intuitive grasp of
non-violence by most students. The
rest of the public, however, must be
made aware of what it is supporting
by working in the napalm factories,
for example.
According to Mcßeynolds any hope
of a dialogue with the Johnson ad
ministration must be abandoned. The
administration approves of student
dissent, as long as students serve
when they are drafted. Student dis
sent, such as burning draft cards, Mc-
Reynolds sees as an existential com
mitment. According to Mcßeynolds,
what student protest groups should
concern themselves with is informing
and reeducating the public so that it
will be politically unfeasible to wage
war.
