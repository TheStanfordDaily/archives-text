# Sports Editor Finds Diamond On Campus

### ART ROSENZWEIG 
Daily Sports Editor Tom Edi
son located yesterday a large
sized subterranean diamond on
Stanford's campus.
The diamond was found ap
proximately 90 yards south of
the Stanford Stadium and more
than four yards beneath the
surface level of the Earth.
It was largely covered with
chlorophyllaceous material but
its edges are well delineated, and
it is quite symmetrical. Its mea
surements were calculated to be
90' x 90', indeed the largest ever

to be located within the confines
of the university.
Well-Prepared
The diamond was found by
Edison about 5:00 p.m. Edison
happened to be walking in the
vicinity with his pick and shovel
in case a situation arose in
which he would need the tools.
He pointed out that when he

left the DU house yesterday
morning he had no idea of what
the day would bring, and cer
tainly did not imagine that he
would locate a diamond of such
proportions.
Although he had seen dia
monds many times before — on
television for example—he had
never actually discovered one all
by himself.
Not Surprised
Edison was not the least bit
surprised, however, when he lo
cated the diamond. "I knew
where it was all the time," he
claimed mysteriously. Actually,
the diamond was there all the
time, but he wasn't.
Asked what he was planning
to do now that he had located
the diamond, Edison said that
he would return to his house
for dinner and Ihen go to a par
ty. He added that he probably
would not be back to The Daily
offices that evening.
Even though he had known
where the diamond was, he ad
mitted that he was excited about
the occasion, especially because
he got his name and picture in
the newspaper and could now
grab many copies and send them
to all his friends.
April Fools
