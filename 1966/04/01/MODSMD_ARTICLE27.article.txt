# Lax Action Resumes
## 
### HUGH WEST 
Stanford's Laxmen face a solid
team anchored by a former Ail-
American, when they travel to
Peackcock Gap this Saturday
for the initial outing after the
spring layover.
Dick Treadwell, who learned
his lacrosse at Exeter and Yale,

will man the nets for the Gold
and Green and will be flanked
by some of the best defensemen
in the NorCal League.
By comparative scores Peack
cock Gap seems to hold the edge
over the Indians, having held
undefeated league â–  leader Palo
Alto to a 7-4, while Stanford
dropped to the Paly contingent
by a 9-2 count.
Even Tilt Seen
The Stanford-Palo Alto game,
however, was a first game for
both teams, and Stanford Coach
Gene Dickason feels that com
parative scores mean very little
in this case and that the contest
will be even and tough.
The Indians have picked up
several players since the Winter
quarter, including attackmen
Tony King and Pete Eakland,
midfielders Monte Orr and Jerry
Liles, and defensemen Nate
Benchly. They should be run
ning three deep in the midfield,
distinct advantage over the old
er Gappers.
The Stanford team is thriving
under the tutelage of Coach
Dickason, who uses the fact that
he played every position at
Princeton to good advantage.
He looks forward to putting
the team over the .500 mark this
Saturday.
