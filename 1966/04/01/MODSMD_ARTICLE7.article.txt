# Tom Cronin Is Appointed To Two Government Jobs
## 
### 
Stanford research assistant Thomas
Cronin has been named to participate
in the elite White House Fellows Pro
gram, just twelve hours after he was
awarded a Congressional Fellowship.
Both awards would provide for be
hind-the-scenes experience working
with top government officials in
Washington.
The 18 Fellows were chosen from
more than 3,000 college graduates be
tween the ages of 23 and 35. They
act as assistants to White House and
Cabinet officials, and receive stipends
from $7000 to $12,000 yearly.
White House Ceremony
Cronin was given the Fellows
award at a White House ceremony
Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, he was named
to receive a Congressional Fellowship
to work with congressmen in Capitol
Hill committees. The fellowship in
cludes a $6000 minimum salary, with
additional funds available for depen
dents.
Choice of One
As the projects run concurrently
during the coming year, Cronin will
have to choose between the two, but
it is not yet known which he will ac
cept.
Stanford's assistant admissions di
rector, Michal R. Walsh, was selected
to be one of the White House Fellows
last year, and at 23, was the youngest
of the group. He traveled with Secre

tary of Agriculture Orville L. Free
man for international conferences in
Rome and Spain.
Both programs were designed to in
volve college graduates from a variety
of fields including business and aca
demic, in government affairs. Offi
cials established the programs to in
crease "layman" interest in public af
fairs as well as to supplement federal
staffs.
The Fellows program was original
ly suggested by Health, Education,
and Welfare Secretary John W. Gard
ner when he was president of the Car
negie Corporation. Stipends for the
project are provided from a $305,000
Carnegie Grant.
