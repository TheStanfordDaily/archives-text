# Encina Art Collection Triumphs Over Critics
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
Paying tuition at Encina won't be
such a monotonous process for Stan
ford students this quarter. A collec
tion of art instructor Walter Kuhl
man's paintings are being displayed
on the walls of the Cashier's Office.
The showing signifies a new de
velopment in a controversy over the
type of art to be displayed in the Uni

versity's business center. The dispute
reached a high point last quarter
when Joseph Jedd, Student Accounts
Supervisor, felt compelled to remove
a group of modernistic paintings by
local artist Ann Raymond due to com
plaints that the art work which fea
tured many nudes was "offensive."
Dismayed students, teachers, and
artists in the area defended the show
ings on the ground that people should
be exposed to varying forms of art.
Hopefully, they felt, the public would
come to tolerate and eventually ap
preciate difering subjects and new
art concepts.
Compliments
According to Joseph Jedd, this is
exactly what has happened. "People
aren't complaining anymore. I've
heard nothing but compliments. En
cina became famous during the con
troversy and enemies became con
verts," he observed.
"When people are exposed to it,
they eventually respond to it. First,
there is hostility, but the vast major
ity begins to recognize points they
like. They establish criteria; their
ideas are criticized by other people;
and they become more sophisticated."
Unique Chance
Jedd believes that "the artist now
has a unique chance to show his work
to a public who didn't ask for it and
which will voice its opinions loudly"
through the Encina exhibits. He also
stated that many painters in the area
and students are volunteering to show
their work.
The most important reason for the
displays, Jedd said, is that "we want
students to feel like they are in a
modern, progressive school."
