## 
### AL HINEMAN 
The Stanford Jazz Year's final quarter be
gins today with a lecture by noted critic Ira
Gitler and will be highlighted by concerts fea
turing Ray Charles and Miles Davis.
In addition to the larger concerts, the pro
gram of Jazz Casuals hosted by critic and col
umnist Ralph J. Gleason will continue. Alto
saxophonist John Handy will appear this Fri
day in the large lounge at Tresidder, and blues
singer Muddy Waters and his bhies band will
perform at Tresidder April 22 as part of a
rhythm and blues weekend to be climaxed by
the Ray Charles concert.
Jazz Year director Richard Bale says that
other Jazz Casuals will be scheduled depend
ing upon the attendance at the Charles con
cert. "This is a non-profit project," he explains,
"so all the profits from the Ray Charles event
will be used to provide more activities." Pos
sible featured performers at later Casuals in
clude Bill Evans and Wes Montgomery with
the Wynton Kelly Trio.
The lecture series will continue with con
tinue with Gitler's talk today and a summary
lecture by Ralph Gleason May 23, the day fol
lowing the Miles Davis concert, Gleason will
discuss the purposes, directions and achieve
ments of the entire Jazz Year and will also
treat the probable future of jazz and the rela
tionship of the new jazz to other experimental
art forms.
Visual Exploration in TMV
Another large project of the Jazz Year is the
exhibit running from today through April 23
in Tresidder entitled "Visual Explorations of
Jazz." It will present paintings, sculpture, pho

tographs and other visual media through
which artists have attempted to capture vari
ous aspects of jazz. A panel of distinguished
judges, including art critics and jazz experts,
will award prizes to the most successful en
tries.
The large concerts will feature two of
America's most popular and eminent musi
cians. Ray Charles, who will be making one
of his first West Coast appearances in many
months when he brings his orchestra and the
Raelets to Frost Amphitheater April 24, has
a world-wide reputation as arranger, conduc
tor, pianist, organist, and, most significantly,
as a singer in almost all of the idioms of
American music â€” jazz, blues, rock-and-roll,
ballads, and country and western music.
Blind since the age of six, a professional mu
sician since the age of 15, Charles burst onto
the rock-and-roll scene with his first success
ful album in 1957. The album also attracted
the attention of jazz artists, for Charles had
mingled the elements of jazz and gospel mu
sic into his popular recordings. These factors,
together with an affecting quality of "soul"
and intense emotional appeal, have remained
constant in all his music.
Davis' Trumpet Will Blow
Miles Davis, who appears in Memorial Audi
torium May 22, is for many people the jazz
artist. The trumpeter has been on the jazz
scene since the mid-1940's when he jammed
on New York's 52nd Street with all the found
ing fathers of modern jazz: Charlie Parker,
Thelonous Monk, Kenny Clarke and others.
He formed his own grup in the early '30's,
and has retained the quintet or sextet formula

ever since; some alumni of the Miles Davis
groups are John Coltrane, Philly Joe Jones,
Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Hank Mob
ley.
His current group, comprising tenorist
Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, bas
sist Ron Carter and young drumming prodigy
Anthony Williams, is considered by many to
be the finest Davis has ever led.
Handy: Old and New
Altoist John Handy, featured artist at the
first Jazz Casual this Friday, has been long
known to hard core jazz fans and long ignored
