# Indian Trackmen Upset Smith And Co.

### ARLEN HOLTER 
Despite one of the great 440
races of all time by the spectacu
lar Tommy Smith—4s.B seconds
—Payton Jordan's Indians out
dueled Bud Winter's San Jose
Spartans, 82%-62%, before a
sun-baked crowd of 8,000 in
Stanford Stadium.
As the joyous Jordan said, it
was "one of the great dual meets
of Northern California history,"
with the Indians avenging the
loss to the Spartans in the Stan
ford Relays by taking the up
for-grabs events and producing
the "little men" who picked up
the loose points.
Stanford heroes were every
where.
But the keys were Captain
Bob Stoecker, who came up with
a brilliant weight triple for 15
big points, sprinter Larry Que
stad who won the 100, and the
Indian 440 relay team composed

of Roger Cox, Donn Forbes, and
Jim Ward and Questad who up
set the heavily favored Spartans
in the opening event.

led the Stanford yearlings over
their San Jose counterparts 92-
52.
San Jose was supposed to
have the meet wrapped up by
the time the mile relay windup
rolled around, but it was Stan
ford which had gone out of
reach.
That happened when Dave
Deubner, bounced back from a
mile victory, and unheralded

Bruce Johnson ran one-two in
the two miler to put the Indians
over the top in the point column.
Tommy Smith's blistering 440
effort put him third among his
tory's fastest quarter milers.
The only faster times that have
been recorded were Adolph
Plummer and his world record
44.9 and Ulis Williams who had
a 45.2 among several sub 46 sec
ond quarters.
Smith also claimed another
meet standard when he long
jumped 24-9 on his second and
last try and suffered one of his
rare defeats, after his exhaust
ing 440 effort, when teammate
Wayne Hermen beat him in a
21.0 seconds curved 220.
In all, there were five meet
records established. The others
were set by Spartan Craig Fer
gus who triple jumped 50-2 and
teammate Ken Shackelford, who
barely chested the rope ahead
of Indian Bud Walsh in 52.2 sec
onds in the 440 intermediate hur
dles.
Other Indian winners were
Walsh in the 120 high hurdles
and Jim Eshelman in the pole
vault.

he took the baton, Martin overtook his man on this, the number two
leg, and the Indians never relinquished the lead.
