# The 						Coming 'Cause'

### 
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane's admission that
"there is a substantial portion of the student
body dissatisfied with the Legislature" and his
intention to do something about that dissatis
faction come at a most welcome time. We hope
that he and other Legislators will be willing to
think broadly about the problem, perhaps to
the extent of redefining LASSU's apparent pur
pose and giving student government a true di
rection.
Citing the results of the recent student refer
endum on the Committee of Fifteen, Kadane
noted in an address to LASSU Thursday that
one group of critics "dislikes the dominant trend
in the Legislature toward reform," while an
other group "claims that the issues we deal with
are insignificant." The first group, we feel, can
be dismissed, for, if the University is truly mov
ing toward the "edge of greatness," some truly
radical reform in the present structure and na
ture of the University is needed —and arguments
of "moving too fast" only serve to delay un
necessarily this reform.
The second criticism, however, which ad
dresses the question of what direction Stanford's
student government should take, bears some
validity. While it may be true that student over
throw of Indonesia's government may make the
efforts of Stanford politicos look pale, it should
be remembered that the American culture,
rightly or wrongly, assigns the student a much
lower status than does the rest of the world. Only
occasionally are American students able to affect
society —perhaps most recently in stirring a na
tional debate over the war in Vietnam —and
rarely in such cases do the results match the
size of the effort. American students, it is argued,
are learning, and should not be distracted from
the learning process. Consequently, student
government is left with the lesser task of tend
ing the university.
But what of this task? Is it being performed
in a worthwhile and effective manner?
The problem with student government seems
to be that it thrives on causes. Students are im
patient; they want to see changes while they are
still enrolled. The best way to do this, student
government seems to argue, is not by figuring
out the university bureaucracy and seeking
either to modify it or channel grievances into it.
It is rather by building grievances into a cause,
and using it to thrash away at the underbrush.
The Cause goes far to explain student govern
ment as it now is. First, it makes a given year
unpredictable. A Crow-Halverson Report is
published, and it takes control of an entire spring
quarter. The Legislature, with a view to timing,
asserts "sole jurisdiction over student affairs and
conduct." A faculty master is appointed, in an
impossible position: he is caught in the middle
with suggestions from administrators, authority
from a faculty committee, exhortations from
sponsors, and flak from everybody. In the nega
tive, he becomes a cause. Freedom of worship
is restricted on the Stanford campus, and all
sorts of individuals whose belief cannot measure
up with a mustard seed take this cause and
threaten to march forward to the wailing wall.

Which brings us to another result. The Cause
attracts the crusader whose first loyalty is not to
the aggrieved parties in a situation, but to his
own identity with The Cause. This form of com
mitment forsakes the people it seeks to help.
Some of the gladiators in the Union Residence
chariot race said they failed because they could
not get enough support from the women of
Union. Whom did the change affect? The wo
men alone. In their thinking, the Union women
were forgotten in pursuit of the ongoing Cause.
The result is that student government often
seems to know no single direction in which to
thrust. Instead of acting, it often reacts. As Prof.
Philip Rhinelander pointed out in a recent
speech, the fault does not rest entirely with the
students. "The process of depersonalization has
gone so far that those who protest it have been
caught up in it, and they exemplify in their own
attitudes the very tendencies which they decry,"
he said. "The students reflect and respond to
the malaise of their elders." Part of the problem,
in Kadane's words, is the existence of "several
administrative habits which hinder, and some
times make impossible, a real hearing for stu
dents." The University, by refusing to allow its
largest constitu<incy a more significant role in
the community, forces students into a position
where they must become crusaders in order to
protect their own interests. And in their role
as crusaders, the students often forget that the
only legitimate cause is people. Forgotten, too, is
the humanity of their contrived opposition. For
as the fact that administrators are human beings
accounts for their mistakes, it also accounts for
their receptiveness to a rational student view
point.
What student government seems to need, then,
is a direction. As the University pushes on
toward "greatness," the student government con
tinues to toy with the liquor issue, freedom of
worship, and Union Residence. Granted, that
these issues all have import for individuals
within the Stanford community, but they are on
their way to solution —partly because of pres
sure from the students, but perhaps more so be
cause the changing mores of society have begun
to affect both administrators and trustees. Solu
tions to these problems, however, will only pro
vide a foundation upon which to build "great
ness"; in themselves they are almost peripheral.
The issue which will soon become central, we
believe, is Stanford's position as an educational
institution. With a critical faculty, and with a
student government that is willing to ask for
excellence of educational standards, Stanford
may yet move into that great realm beyond.
It is for this reason that we applaud the Legis
lature's establishment of an Education Commis
sion to take a look at Stanford as an academic
institution; it is for this reason that we applaud
the willingness of the Academic Council to take
students onto its committees. But these are only
beginnings. A broad view—the improvement of
the whole University —and a narrow view —
people —will outlast the brief passions of a year
to command lasting respect and influence within
the community for both the Legislature and for
student government.

quarter. The Legislature, with a view to timing,
asserts "sole jurisdiction over student affairs and
conduct." A faculty master is appointed, in an
impossible position: he is caught in the middle
with suggestions from administrators, authority
from a faculty committee, exhortations from
sponsors, and flak from everybody. In the nega
tive, he becomes a cause. Freedom of worship
is restricted on the Stanford campus, and all
sorts of individuals whose belief cannot measure
up with a mustard seed take this cause and
threaten to march forward to the wailing wall.

Which brings us to another result. The Cause
attracts the crusader whose first loyalty is not to
the aggrieved parties in a situation, but to his
own identity with The Cause. This form of com
mitment forsakes the people it seeks to help.
Some of the gladiators in the Union Residence
chariot race said they failed because they could
not get enough support from the women of
Union. Whom did the change affect? The wo
men alone. In their thinking, the Union women
were forgotten in pursuit of the ongoing Cause.
The result is that student government often
seems to know no single direction in which to
thrust. Instead of acting, it often reacts. As Prof.
Philip Rhinelander pointed out in a recent
speech, the fault does not rest entirely with the
students. "The process of depersonalization has
gone so far that those who protest it have been
caught up in it, and they exemplify in their own
attitudes the very tendencies which they decry,"
he said. "The students reflect and respond to
the malaise of their elders." Part of the problem,
in Kadane's words, is the existence of "several
administrative habits which hinder, and some
times make impossible, a real hearing for stu
dents." The University, by refusing to allow its
largest constitu<incy a more significant role in
the community, forces students into a position
where they must become crusaders in order to
protect their own interests. And in their role
as crusaders, the students often forget that the
only legitimate cause is people. Forgotten, too, is
the humanity of their contrived opposition. For
as the fact that administrators are human beings
accounts for their mistakes, it also accounts for
their receptiveness to a rational student view
point.
What student government seems to need, then,
is a direction. As the University pushes on
toward "greatness," the student government con
tinues to toy with the liquor issue, freedom of
worship, and Union Residence. Granted, that
these issues all have import for individuals
within the Stanford community, but they are on
their way to solution —partly because of pres
sure from the students, but perhaps more so be
cause the changing mores of society have begun
to affect both administrators and trustees. Solu
tions to these problems, however, will only pro
vide a foundation upon which to build "great
ness"; in themselves they are almost peripheral.
The issue which will soon become central, we
believe, is Stanford's position as an educational
institution. With a critical faculty, and with a
student government that is willing to ask for
excellence of educational standards, Stanford
may yet move into that great realm beyond.
It is for this reason that we applaud the Legis
lature's establishment of an Education Commis
sion to take a look at Stanford as an academic
institution; it is for this reason that we applaud
the willingness of the Academic Council to take
students onto its committees. But these are only
beginnings. A broad view—the improvement of
the whole University —and a narrow view —
people —will outlast the brief passions of a year
to command lasting respect and influence within
the community for both the Legislature and for
student government.
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane's admission that
"there is a substantial portion of the student
body dissatisfied with the Legislature" and his
intention to do something about that dissatis
faction come at a most welcome time. We hope
that he and other Legislators will be willing to
think broadly about the problem, perhaps to
the extent of redefining LASSU's apparent pur
pose and giving student government a true di
rection.
Citing the results of the recent student refer
endum on the Committee of Fifteen, Kadane
noted in an address to LASSU Thursday that
one group of critics "dislikes the dominant trend
in the Legislature toward reform," while an
other group "claims that the issues we deal with
are insignificant." The first group, we feel, can
be dismissed, for, if the University is truly mov
ing toward the "edge of greatness," some truly
radical reform in the present structure and na
ture of the University is needed —and arguments
of "moving too fast" only serve to delay un
necessarily this reform.
The second criticism, however, which ad
dresses the question of what direction Stanford's
student government should take, bears some
validity. While it may be true that student over
throw of Indonesia's government may make the
efforts of Stanford politicos look pale, it should
be remembered that the American culture,
rightly or wrongly, assigns the student a much
lower status than does the rest of the world. Only
occasionally are American students able to affect
society —perhaps most recently in stirring a na
tional debate over the war in Vietnam —and
rarely in such cases do the results match the
size of the effort. American students, it is argued,
are learning, and should not be distracted from
the learning process. Consequently, student
government is left with the lesser task of tend
ing the university.
But what of this task? Is it being performed
in a worthwhile and effective manner?
The problem with student government seems
to be that it thrives on causes. Students are im
patient; they want to see changes while they are
still enrolled. The best way to do this, student
government seems to argue, is not by figuring
out the university bureaucracy and seeking
either to modify it or channel grievances into it.
It is rather by building grievances into a cause,
and using it to thrash away at the underbrush.
The Cause goes far to explain student govern
ment as it now is. First, it makes a given year
unpredictable. A Crow-Halverson Report is

within the Stanford community, but they are on
their way to solution —partly because of pres
sure from the students, but perhaps more so be
cause the changing mores of society have begun
to affect both administrators and trustees. Solu
tions to these problems, however, will only pro
vide a foundation upon which to build "great
ness"; in themselves they are almost peripheral.
The issue which will soon become central, we
believe, is Stanford's position as an educational
institution. With a critical faculty, and with a
student government that is willing to ask for
excellence of educational standards, Stanford
may yet move into that great realm beyond.
It is for this reason that we applaud the Legis
lature's establishment of an Education Commis
sion to take a look at Stanford as an academic
institution; it is for this reason that we applaud
the willingness of the Academic Council to take
students onto its committees. But these are only
beginnings. A broad view—the improvement of
the whole University —and a narrow view —
people —will outlast the brief passions of a year
to command lasting respect and influence within
the community for both the Legislature and for
student government.
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane's admission that
"there is a substantial portion of the student
body dissatisfied with the Legislature" and his
intention to do something about that dissatis
faction come at a most welcome time. We hope
that he and other Legislators will be willing to
think broadly about the problem, perhaps to
the extent of redefining LASSU's apparent pur
pose and giving student government a true di
rection.
Citing the results of the recent student refer
endum on the Committee of Fifteen, Kadane
noted in an address to LASSU Thursday that
one group of critics "dislikes the dominant trend
in the Legislature toward reform," while an
other group "claims that the issues we deal with
are insignificant." The first group, we feel, can
be dismissed, for, if the University is truly mov
ing toward the "edge of greatness," some truly
radical reform in the present structure and na
ture of the University is needed —and arguments
of "moving too fast" only serve to delay un
necessarily this reform.
The second criticism, however, which ad
dresses the question of what direction Stanford's
student government should take, bears some
validity. While it may be true that student over
throw of Indonesia's government may make the
efforts of Stanford politicos look pale, it should
be remembered that the American culture,
rightly or wrongly, assigns the student a much
lower status than does the rest of the world. Only
occasionally are American students able to affect
society —perhaps most recently in stirring a na
tional debate over the war in Vietnam —and
rarely in such cases do the results match the
size of the effort. American students, it is argued,
are learning, and should not be distracted from
the learning process. Consequently, student
government is left with the lesser task of tend
ing the university.
But what of this task? Is it being performed
in a worthwhile and effective manner?
The problem with student government seems
to be that it thrives on causes. Students are im
patient; they want to see changes while they are
still enrolled. The best way to do this, student
government seems to argue, is not by figuring
out the university bureaucracy and seeking
either to modify it or channel grievances into it.
It is rather by building grievances into a cause,
and using it to thrash away at the underbrush.
The Cause goes far to explain student govern
ment as it now is. First, it makes a given year
unpredictable. A Crow-Halverson Report is
published, and it takes control of an entire spring
quarter. The Legislature, with a view to timing,
asserts "sole jurisdiction over student affairs and
conduct." A faculty master is appointed, in an
impossible position: he is caught in the middle
with suggestions from administrators, authority
from a faculty committee, exhortations from
sponsors, and flak from everybody. In the nega
tive, he becomes a cause. Freedom of worship
is restricted on the Stanford campus, and all
sorts of individuals whose belief cannot measure
up with a mustard seed take this cause and
threaten to march forward to the wailing wall.

Which brings us to another result. The Cause
attracts the crusader whose first loyalty is not to
the aggrieved parties in a situation, but to his
own identity with The Cause. This form of com
mitment forsakes the people it seeks to help.
Some of the gladiators in the Union Residence
chariot race said they failed because they could
not get enough support from the women of
Union. Whom did the change affect? The wo
men alone. In their thinking, the Union women
were forgotten in pursuit of the ongoing Cause.
The result is that student government often
seems to know no single direction in which to
thrust. Instead of acting, it often reacts. As Prof.
Philip Rhinelander pointed out in a recent
speech, the fault does not rest entirely with the
students. "The process of depersonalization has
gone so far that those who protest it have been
caught up in it, and they exemplify in their own
attitudes the very tendencies which they decry,"
he said. "The students reflect and respond to
the malaise of their elders." Part of the problem,
in Kadane's words, is the existence of "several
administrative habits which hinder, and some
times make impossible, a real hearing for stu
dents." The University, by refusing to allow its
largest constitu<incy a more significant role in
the community, forces students into a position
where they must become crusaders in order to
protect their own interests. And in their role
as crusaders, the students often forget that the
only legitimate cause is people. Forgotten, too, is
the humanity of their contrived opposition. For
as the fact that administrators are human beings
accounts for their mistakes, it also accounts for
their receptiveness to a rational student view
point.
What student government seems to need, then,
is a direction. As the University pushes on
toward "greatness," the student government con
tinues to toy with the liquor issue, freedom of
worship, and Union Residence. Granted, that
these issues all have import for individuals
within the Stanford community, but they are on
their way to solution —partly because of pres
sure from the students, but perhaps more so be
cause the changing mores of society have begun
to affect both administrators and trustees. Solu
tions to these problems, however, will only pro
vide a foundation upon which to build "great
