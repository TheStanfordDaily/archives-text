Jazz critic and humorist Ira Gitler will
begin the Spring Quarter program of the
Stanford Jazz Year with a lecture this af
ternoon at 4:15 in the Tresidder large
lounge on "Jazz in the Sixties."
Gitler was one of the earliest regular
contributors to Down Beat magazine and
was formerly its New York Editor. He is
still a frequent contributor to Down Beat
and other jazz publications.

by everyone on the periphery of the music.
Born in Texas, he has been a Bay Area resi
dent most of his life and attended McClymonds
High. He played with Charlie Mingus in New
York in 1958-59, then returned to S.F. and led
a variety of small groups, none of which really
caught on with the public until the current
one.

A skilled improvisor and breathtaking tech
nician, Handy's idiom is based on the roots
of jazz while utilizing the best parts of the
avant garde experiments. His quintet features
drummer Terry Clarke and bassist Don
Thompson, both Canadians, guitarist Jerry
Hahn, who can play anything from blues to
flamenco, and violinist Mike White, also a Mc-
Clymonds graduate. White, who like Handy
keeps one ear on the blues and the other on
the most exciting possibilities of experimental
jazz, threatens to reintroduce the violin into
the basic jazz vocabulary.
The John Handy Quintet scored one of the
most impressive successes of the 1965 Monte
rey Jazz Festival. Ralph Gleason has said, "It's
an exciting group, and one that will make jazz
history."
Waters From the Cotton Fields
Blues singer Muddy Waters will perform
at Tresidder April 22. His group features har
monica player James Cotton and pianist Otis
Spann.
He has appeared at the Newport Folk Fes
tival and the Newport and Down Beat Jazz
Festivals. Like Ray Charles (though the end
result is certainly different), he has fused
folk, blues and jazz elements into a personal
style of tremendous appeal. His most recent
success was his recording of his own composi
tion, "I Got My Mojo Working."
Director Rick Bale says of the Spring Quar
ter activities, "In terms of cultural instruc
tion and entertainment potential, this should
be an exciting ten weeks, and a good way to
wind up the Stanford Jazz Year."
