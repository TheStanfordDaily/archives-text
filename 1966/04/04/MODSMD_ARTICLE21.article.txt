# Kadane's Speech To LASSU
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the speech delivered by
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane to
the Legislature Thursday eve
ning.)
Since we have not met for a
month, and I have not given an
extended report since January, I
decided to take this opportunity
to bring you up to date on prog
ress on various issues of interest
and to comment on what I be
lieve our outstanding problems
are.
First, as has been reported in
The Daily, the Student Affairs
and Services Committee has
completed its recommendations
on liquor. The Committee of Fif
teen considered this report, and
passed the following resolution
unanimously:
WHEREAS the Committee
on Student Affairs and Services
has presented the Committee of
Fifteen a thoughtful report on
Stanford's liquor problem, and
WHEREAS the recommen
dations contained in that re
port go as far as is reasonably
possible toward bringing liquor
policies and practices into har
mony,
BE IT THEREFORE RE
SOLVED that the Committee
of Fifteen enthusiastically ami
unanimously endorses this re
port in full. We respectfully
call to the attention of all mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty that the success of this pro
posed policy will require rigor
ous self-discipline and responsi
ble enforcement to protect the
members of the community
from disorderly conduct.
It was discussed in the last
Board of Trustees meeting and
will be discussed again, I under
stand, at the next meeting. I feel
that the report is a very good
one, and that the proposed pol
icy is one which will be success
ful in practice.
I would like to stress the im
portance of a sensible and ma
ture reaction from the campfus
both to the fact that a change
is being considered and to the
change if it is adopted. In the
past, unfortunate incidents have
ended the possibility for reform;
good sense is especially crucial
to see that this does not happen
again.
Wflbur
On the Wilbur problem, a com
promise was reached which ap
pears to satisfy all parties con
cerned.
The importance of the agree
ment is that it clearly estab
lishes a communitarian form of
government for university resi
dences. The role of the faculty
master is to be to lead, if he
can, but not to "control." This
spirit, which is close to the way
the house system at Harvard
and the college system at Yale
work, is very necessary to the
development of residences as in
tellectual centers. Government
by consent of the governed, by
persuading (and hence by edu
cating) will in time ensure the
two-way communication so im
portant at all levels of the Uni
versity.
We should commend the spon
sors, the faculty master, and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education on reaching this
agreement.
Worship
On the question of the free
dom of groups to worship on
campus, the Board of Trustees
passed an ambiguous statement
which has not yet been clarified.
It may be interpreted to require
groups seeking to worship to do
so only in Memorial Church.
I would hope that eventually
the principle could be estab
lished that any group of facul
ty, students and staff can use
University facilities for any law
ful purpose, subject only to first
come, first-served space avail
ability. Worship need not be an
exception to freedom of assem
bly.
Judiciary, Open Hours
Judicial reform and compen
sation for faculty and staff Da
ly's are still in the Committee
of Fifteen; it is hoped that they
can be finished this quarter.
Open hours is now being dis
cussed before the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
Hopeiully there will be a major
liberalization of those rules.
Also there is a report being
prepared by the Social Regula
tions Committee on the opera
tion of the new rules and sug
gestions for further changes.
There seems to be no question
that the new rules have been a
success in the sense that no new
problems have developed and
fewer violations have occurred.
The impact of Social Regula
tions have been reduced now
to a nuisance for most girls;
they are sufficiently liberal that

very few girls find themselves
restricted by them.
I would hope that eventually
the University community
would come to recognize this
and do away with all regulations
for upper-class women, perhaps
with a voluntary sign-out sys
tem. Although it may not come
this year, soon we must recog
nize de jure what we have al
ready recognized de facto, that
women students are expected to
be responsible for their own be
havior, as the men now are.
University Conimitteeis
The Committee of Fifteen has
begun discussions of the ques
tion of the appointment and role
of students on University com
mittees. Certainly our experi
ence with the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education would in
dicate the desirability of having
students on that committee.
Hopefully arrangements could
be made for the students at
tached to Academic Council com
mittees to sit with vote, and for
the selection procedure for stu
dents on Presidential Advisory
Committees to be reviewed.
Although the Finance Com
mittee is heavily burdened pre
paring next year's budget, I
would hope that it would be pos
sible for the Finance and Bylaws
Committees to consider the pos
sibility of a Constitutional
Amendment to reconsider and
clarify the power and role of the
Financial Director and the Stu
dent Financial Manager.
Finally, I am pleased to re
port that the initial membership
of the Education Commission
has been appointed and that
subcommittees are being formed.
I would hope that the Legisla
ture will give financial support
where that is needed, and that
the Education Commission can
soon begin to advise us on many
of the questions that appear be
fore us.
Student Power
In my last extended report to
you, I said that I had come to
the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student
power in the University, to the
extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the cam
pus and its attendant bad pub
licity for the University.
I wish I could have said that
student power, to the extent that
we have it, is based on our pow
er of persuasion. But there are
several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are
first raised. I am aware that
there is a difference in time
horizon between students, who
are usually here only four years,
and faculty and administrators,
who expect to spend many years
in one place. Nevertheless, I be
lieve there is a tendency to be
slow in coming to grips with
problems in the hope that they
will go away.
Second is a tradition of secre
cy surrounding the actual for
mulation of policy. All too often
doors are closed while policy is
being formulated, and when stu
dents disagree with a policy al
ter it is formulated, what we
hear, and try to argue against,
are the apologies for the policy,
and not its reasons.
Finally, once an administra
tive decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a "united
front," a monolithic reaction to
student questions, complaints or
disagreements. Once a policy is
formulated, little short of open
rebellion will bring a reconsid
eration; the notion that there
might be facts not considered at
the time of the decision was
made, and that the decision itself
may not have been right or just
is not usually considered suffi
cient for reconsideration. And
this is exactly what happened
with the question of the closing
of Union Residence.
Tendencies
These three habits, and they
are tendencies which afflict
most decision-making structures
to a greater or lesser degree,
limit the possibility of student
persuasion on the issues of
greatest concern. We all hope
that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".
Several faculty members and
administration officers have
shown genuine concern for stu
dent opinion in their work with
us. The Committee of Fifteen
is functioning much better now
than was true in the fall quar
ter, and has been useful on sev
eral of the issues I mentioned
earlier. The office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education has
often been responsive in its deal
ings with students.

Hopefully this spirit of coop
eration and interchange will con
tinue and grow. Hopefully the
new Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education will be men
open to new thoughts, men big
enough to change their minds if
they are persuaded and to say
so publicly.
Finally, in all fairness, it
should be said that when the
University has finally come to
grips with a problem, and al
lowed all the parties to partici
pate in the decision, the new
policies are usually a vast im
provement. This is true of
liquor; I hope it will also be true
of open hours and social regula
tions.
Committee of Fifteen
Last quarter was marked by
several Legislature meetings
concerning student representa
tion on the Committee of Fif
teen, culminating in a referen
dum the day after our last meet
ing.
It seems to me there are sev
eral things to be learned from
it. The first concerns the spirit
of the Legislature. In order for
student government to function
well, it must be a cooperative
venture among all the students
concerned. Students must be
willing to serve when they are
called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction
Second, even though the orig
inal sponsors of the petition, and
virtually everyone at the second
meeting, opposed the referen

dum petition and favored the
alternative, the vote did not re
flect the unanimity of that meet
ing.
This can only be taken to
mean that there is a substantial
portion of the student body dis
satisfied with the Legislature.
Were they dissatisfied with their
representatives, they could
change that easily enough.
One group of critics claims
that the issues we deal with are
insignificant. Granted, compared
to Indonesia, where students
caused a change in government,
or Nigeria, where students dem
onstrated because the military
government was planning to
yield power too quickly, student
politics at Stanford seems pale.
Another group, I believe, dis
likes the dominant trend in the
Legislature toward reform and
toward opening dialogue with
other parts of the University
Community.
Both groups, I believe, unite
in feeling that our pretensions
exceed our performance.
Humility and Restraint
Perhaps a greater humility
and restraint is called for.
Perhaps it is trtie that the
Legislature is too large, perhaps
there are other changes called
for in structure and procedure.
I hope that the occasion of the
Speaker election can be used to
reassess these questions and
hopefully to come to a concen
sus on them. Just as we urge an
open and introspective attitude
for the University, we should
be willing to consider changes
in our own institution.

called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction
Second, even though the orig
inal sponsors of the petition, and
virtually everyone at the second
meeting, opposed the referen

dum petition and favored the
alternative, the vote did not re
flect the unanimity of that meet
ing.
This can only be taken to
mean that there is a substantial
portion of the student body dis
satisfied with the Legislature.
Were they dissatisfied with their
representatives, they could
change that easily enough.
One group of critics claims
that the issues we deal with are
insignificant. Granted, compared
to Indonesia, where students
caused a change in government,
or Nigeria, where students dem
onstrated because the military
government was planning to
yield power too quickly, student
politics at Stanford seems pale.
Another group, I believe, dis
likes the dominant trend in the
Legislature toward reform and
toward opening dialogue with
other parts of the University
Community.
Both groups, I believe, unite
in feeling that our pretensions
exceed our performance.
Humility and Restraint
Perhaps a greater humility
and restraint is called for.
Perhaps it is trtie that the
Legislature is too large, perhaps
there are other changes called
for in structure and procedure.
I hope that the occasion of the
Speaker election can be used to
reassess these questions and
hopefully to come to a concen
sus on them. Just as we urge an
open and introspective attitude
for the University, we should
be willing to consider changes
in our own institution.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the speech delivered by
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane to
the Legislature Thursday eve
ning.)
Since we have not met for a
month, and I have not given an
extended report since January, I
decided to take this opportunity
to bring you up to date on prog
ress on various issues of interest
and to comment on what I be
lieve our outstanding problems
are.
First, as has been reported in
The Daily, the Student Affairs
and Services Committee has
completed its recommendations
on liquor. The Committee of Fif
teen considered this report, and
passed the following resolution
unanimously:
WHEREAS the Committee
on Student Affairs and Services
has presented the Committee of
Fifteen a thoughtful report on
Stanford's liquor problem, and
WHEREAS the recommen
dations contained in that re
port go as far as is reasonably
possible toward bringing liquor
policies and practices into har
mony,
BE IT THEREFORE RE
SOLVED that the Committee
of Fifteen enthusiastically ami
unanimously endorses this re
port in full. We respectfully
call to the attention of all mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty that the success of this pro
posed policy will require rigor
ous self-discipline and responsi
ble enforcement to protect the
members of the community
from disorderly conduct.
It was discussed in the last
Board of Trustees meeting and
will be discussed again, I under
stand, at the next meeting. I feel
that the report is a very good
one, and that the proposed pol
icy is one which will be success
ful in practice.
I would like to stress the im
portance of a sensible and ma
ture reaction from the campfus
both to the fact that a change
is being considered and to the
change if it is adopted. In the
past, unfortunate incidents have
ended the possibility for reform;
good sense is especially crucial
to see that this does not happen
again.
Wflbur
On the Wilbur problem, a com
promise was reached which ap
pears to satisfy all parties con
cerned.
The importance of the agree
ment is that it clearly estab
lishes a communitarian form of
government for university resi
dences. The role of the faculty
master is to be to lead, if he
can, but not to "control." This
spirit, which is close to the way
the house system at Harvard
and the college system at Yale
work, is very necessary to the
development of residences as in
tellectual centers. Government
by consent of the governed, by
persuading (and hence by edu
cating) will in time ensure the
two-way communication so im
portant at all levels of the Uni
versity.
We should commend the spon
sors, the faculty master, and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education on reaching this
agreement.
Worship
On the question of the free
dom of groups to worship on
campus, the Board of Trustees
passed an ambiguous statement
which has not yet been clarified.
It may be interpreted to require
groups seeking to worship to do
so only in Memorial Church.
I would hope that eventually
the principle could be estab
lished that any group of facul
ty, students and staff can use
University facilities for any law
ful purpose, subject only to first
come, first-served space avail
ability. Worship need not be an
exception to freedom of assem
bly.
Judiciary, Open Hours
Judicial reform and compen
sation for faculty and staff Da
ly's are still in the Committee
of Fifteen; it is hoped that they
can be finished this quarter.
Open hours is now being dis
cussed before the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
Hopeiully there will be a major
liberalization of those rules.
Also there is a report being
prepared by the Social Regula
tions Committee on the opera
tion of the new rules and sug
gestions for further changes.
There seems to be no question
that the new rules have been a
success in the sense that no new
problems have developed and
fewer violations have occurred.
The impact of Social Regula
tions have been reduced now
to a nuisance for most girls;
they are sufficiently liberal that

very few girls find themselves
restricted by them.
I would hope that eventually
the University community
would come to recognize this
and do away with all regulations
for upper-class women, perhaps
with a voluntary sign-out sys
tem. Although it may not come
this year, soon we must recog
nize de jure what we have al
ready recognized de facto, that
women students are expected to
be responsible for their own be
havior, as the men now are.
University Conimitteeis
The Committee of Fifteen has
begun discussions of the ques
tion of the appointment and role
of students on University com
mittees. Certainly our experi
ence with the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education would in
dicate the desirability of having
students on that committee.
Hopefully arrangements could
be made for the students at
tached to Academic Council com
mittees to sit with vote, and for
the selection procedure for stu
dents on Presidential Advisory
Committees to be reviewed.
Although the Finance Com
mittee is heavily burdened pre
paring next year's budget, I
would hope that it would be pos
sible for the Finance and Bylaws
Committees to consider the pos
sibility of a Constitutional
Amendment to reconsider and
clarify the power and role of the
Financial Director and the Stu
dent Financial Manager.
Finally, I am pleased to re
port that the initial membership
of the Education Commission
has been appointed and that
subcommittees are being formed.
I would hope that the Legisla
ture will give financial support
where that is needed, and that
the Education Commission can
soon begin to advise us on many
of the questions that appear be
fore us.
Student Power
In my last extended report to
you, I said that I had come to
the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student
power in the University, to the
extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the cam
pus and its attendant bad pub
licity for the University.
I wish I could have said that
student power, to the extent that
we have it, is based on our pow
er of persuasion. But there are
several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are
first raised. I am aware that
there is a difference in time
horizon between students, who
are usually here only four years,
and faculty and administrators,
who expect to spend many years
in one place. Nevertheless, I be
lieve there is a tendency to be
slow in coming to grips with
problems in the hope that they
will go away.
Second is a tradition of secre
cy surrounding the actual for
mulation of policy. All too often
doors are closed while policy is
being formulated, and when stu
dents disagree with a policy al
ter it is formulated, what we
hear, and try to argue against,
are the apologies for the policy,
and not its reasons.
Finally, once an administra
tive decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a "united
front," a monolithic reaction to
student questions, complaints or
disagreements. Once a policy is
formulated, little short of open
rebellion will bring a reconsid
eration; the notion that there
might be facts not considered at
the time of the decision was
made, and that the decision itself
may not have been right or just
is not usually considered suffi
cient for reconsideration. And
this is exactly what happened
with the question of the closing
of Union Residence.
Tendencies
These three habits, and they
are tendencies which afflict
most decision-making structures
to a greater or lesser degree,
limit the possibility of student
persuasion on the issues of
greatest concern. We all hope
that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".
Several faculty members and
administration officers have
shown genuine concern for stu
dent opinion in their work with
us. The Committee of Fifteen
is functioning much better now
than was true in the fall quar
ter, and has been useful on sev
eral of the issues I mentioned
earlier. The office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education has
often been responsive in its deal
ings with students.

Hopefully this spirit of coop
eration and interchange will con
tinue and grow. Hopefully the
new Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education will be men
open to new thoughts, men big
enough to change their minds if
they are persuaded and to say
so publicly.
Finally, in all fairness, it
should be said that when the
University has finally come to
grips with a problem, and al
lowed all the parties to partici
pate in the decision, the new
policies are usually a vast im
provement. This is true of
liquor; I hope it will also be true
of open hours and social regula
tions.
Committee of Fifteen
Last quarter was marked by
several Legislature meetings
concerning student representa
tion on the Committee of Fif
teen, culminating in a referen
dum the day after our last meet
ing.
It seems to me there are sev
eral things to be learned from
it. The first concerns the spirit
of the Legislature. In order for
student government to function
well, it must be a cooperative
venture among all the students
concerned. Students must be
willing to serve when they are
called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction

that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".
Several faculty members and
administration officers have
shown genuine concern for stu
dent opinion in their work with
us. The Committee of Fifteen
is functioning much better now
than was true in the fall quar
ter, and has been useful on sev
eral of the issues I mentioned
earlier. The office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education has
often been responsive in its deal
ings with students.

Hopefully this spirit of coop
eration and interchange will con
tinue and grow. Hopefully the
new Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education will be men
open to new thoughts, men big
enough to change their minds if
they are persuaded and to say
so publicly.
Finally, in all fairness, it
should be said that when the
University has finally come to
grips with a problem, and al
lowed all the parties to partici
pate in the decision, the new
policies are usually a vast im
provement. This is true of
liquor; I hope it will also be true
of open hours and social regula
tions.
Committee of Fifteen
Last quarter was marked by
several Legislature meetings
concerning student representa
tion on the Committee of Fif
teen, culminating in a referen
dum the day after our last meet
ing.
It seems to me there are sev
eral things to be learned from
it. The first concerns the spirit
of the Legislature. In order for
student government to function
well, it must be a cooperative
venture among all the students
concerned. Students must be
willing to serve when they are
called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction
Second, even though the orig
inal sponsors of the petition, and
virtually everyone at the second
meeting, opposed the referen

dum petition and favored the
alternative, the vote did not re
flect the unanimity of that meet
ing.
This can only be taken to
mean that there is a substantial
portion of the student body dis
satisfied with the Legislature.
Were they dissatisfied with their
representatives, they could
change that easily enough.
One group of critics claims
that the issues we deal with are
insignificant. Granted, compared
to Indonesia, where students
caused a change in government,
or Nigeria, where students dem
onstrated because the military
government was planning to
yield power too quickly, student
politics at Stanford seems pale.
Another group, I believe, dis
likes the dominant trend in the
Legislature toward reform and
toward opening dialogue with
other parts of the University
Community.
Both groups, I believe, unite
in feeling that our pretensions
exceed our performance.
Humility and Restraint
Perhaps a greater humility
and restraint is called for.
Perhaps it is trtie that the
Legislature is too large, perhaps
there are other changes called
for in structure and procedure.
I hope that the occasion of the
Speaker election can be used to
reassess these questions and
hopefully to come to a concen
sus on them. Just as we urge an
open and introspective attitude
for the University, we should
be willing to consider changes
in our own institution.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the speech delivered by
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane to
the Legislature Thursday eve
ning.)
Since we have not met for a
month, and I have not given an
extended report since January, I
decided to take this opportunity
to bring you up to date on prog
ress on various issues of interest
and to comment on what I be
lieve our outstanding problems
are.
First, as has been reported in
The Daily, the Student Affairs
and Services Committee has
completed its recommendations
on liquor. The Committee of Fif
teen considered this report, and
passed the following resolution
unanimously:
WHEREAS the Committee
on Student Affairs and Services
has presented the Committee of
Fifteen a thoughtful report on
Stanford's liquor problem, and
WHEREAS the recommen
dations contained in that re
port go as far as is reasonably
possible toward bringing liquor
policies and practices into har
mony,
BE IT THEREFORE RE
SOLVED that the Committee
of Fifteen enthusiastically ami
unanimously endorses this re
port in full. We respectfully
call to the attention of all mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty that the success of this pro
posed policy will require rigor
ous self-discipline and responsi
ble enforcement to protect the
members of the community
from disorderly conduct.
It was discussed in the last
Board of Trustees meeting and
will be discussed again, I under
stand, at the next meeting. I feel
that the report is a very good
one, and that the proposed pol
icy is one which will be success
ful in practice.
I would like to stress the im
portance of a sensible and ma
ture reaction from the campfus
both to the fact that a change
is being considered and to the
change if it is adopted. In the
past, unfortunate incidents have
ended the possibility for reform;
good sense is especially crucial
to see that this does not happen
again.
Wflbur
On the Wilbur problem, a com
promise was reached which ap
pears to satisfy all parties con
cerned.
The importance of the agree
ment is that it clearly estab
lishes a communitarian form of
government for university resi
dences. The role of the faculty
master is to be to lead, if he
can, but not to "control." This
spirit, which is close to the way
the house system at Harvard
and the college system at Yale
work, is very necessary to the
development of residences as in
tellectual centers. Government
by consent of the governed, by
persuading (and hence by edu
cating) will in time ensure the
two-way communication so im
portant at all levels of the Uni
versity.
We should commend the spon
sors, the faculty master, and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education on reaching this
agreement.
Worship
On the question of the free
dom of groups to worship on
campus, the Board of Trustees
passed an ambiguous statement
which has not yet been clarified.
It may be interpreted to require
groups seeking to worship to do
so only in Memorial Church.
I would hope that eventually
the principle could be estab
lished that any group of facul
ty, students and staff can use
University facilities for any law
ful purpose, subject only to first
come, first-served space avail
ability. Worship need not be an
exception to freedom of assem
bly.
Judiciary, Open Hours
Judicial reform and compen
sation for faculty and staff Da
ly's are still in the Committee
of Fifteen; it is hoped that they
can be finished this quarter.
Open hours is now being dis
cussed before the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
Hopeiully there will be a major
liberalization of those rules.
Also there is a report being
prepared by the Social Regula
tions Committee on the opera
tion of the new rules and sug
gestions for further changes.
There seems to be no question
that the new rules have been a
success in the sense that no new
problems have developed and
fewer violations have occurred.
The impact of Social Regula
tions have been reduced now
to a nuisance for most girls;
they are sufficiently liberal that

very few girls find themselves
restricted by them.
I would hope that eventually
the University community
would come to recognize this
and do away with all regulations
for upper-class women, perhaps
with a voluntary sign-out sys
tem. Although it may not come
this year, soon we must recog
nize de jure what we have al
ready recognized de facto, that
women students are expected to
be responsible for their own be
havior, as the men now are.
University Conimitteeis
The Committee of Fifteen has
begun discussions of the ques
tion of the appointment and role
of students on University com
mittees. Certainly our experi
ence with the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education would in
dicate the desirability of having
students on that committee.
Hopefully arrangements could
be made for the students at
tached to Academic Council com
mittees to sit with vote, and for
the selection procedure for stu
dents on Presidential Advisory
Committees to be reviewed.
Although the Finance Com
mittee is heavily burdened pre
paring next year's budget, I
would hope that it would be pos
sible for the Finance and Bylaws
Committees to consider the pos
sibility of a Constitutional
Amendment to reconsider and
clarify the power and role of the
Financial Director and the Stu
dent Financial Manager.
Finally, I am pleased to re
port that the initial membership
of the Education Commission
has been appointed and that
subcommittees are being formed.
I would hope that the Legisla
ture will give financial support
where that is needed, and that
the Education Commission can
soon begin to advise us on many
of the questions that appear be
fore us.
Student Power
In my last extended report to
you, I said that I had come to
the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student
power in the University, to the
extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the cam
pus and its attendant bad pub
licity for the University.
I wish I could have said that
student power, to the extent that
we have it, is based on our pow
er of persuasion. But there are
several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are
first raised. I am aware that
there is a difference in time
horizon between students, who
are usually here only four years,
and faculty and administrators,
who expect to spend many years
in one place. Nevertheless, I be
lieve there is a tendency to be
slow in coming to grips with
problems in the hope that they
will go away.
Second is a tradition of secre
cy surrounding the actual for
mulation of policy. All too often
doors are closed while policy is
being formulated, and when stu
dents disagree with a policy al
ter it is formulated, what we
hear, and try to argue against,
are the apologies for the policy,
and not its reasons.
Finally, once an administra
tive decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a "united
front," a monolithic reaction to
student questions, complaints or
disagreements. Once a policy is
formulated, little short of open
rebellion will bring a reconsid
eration; the notion that there
might be facts not considered at
the time of the decision was
made, and that the decision itself
may not have been right or just
is not usually considered suffi
cient for reconsideration. And
this is exactly what happened
with the question of the closing
of Union Residence.
Tendencies
These three habits, and they
are tendencies which afflict
most decision-making structures
to a greater or lesser degree,
limit the possibility of student
persuasion on the issues of
greatest concern. We all hope
that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".

several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are
first raised. I am aware that
there is a difference in time
horizon between students, who
are usually here only four years,
and faculty and administrators,
who expect to spend many years
in one place. Nevertheless, I be
lieve there is a tendency to be
slow in coming to grips with
problems in the hope that they
will go away.
Second is a tradition of secre
cy surrounding the actual for
mulation of policy. All too often
doors are closed while policy is
being formulated, and when stu
dents disagree with a policy al
ter it is formulated, what we
hear, and try to argue against,
are the apologies for the policy,
and not its reasons.
Finally, once an administra
tive decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a "united
front," a monolithic reaction to
student questions, complaints or
disagreements. Once a policy is
formulated, little short of open
rebellion will bring a reconsid
eration; the notion that there
might be facts not considered at
the time of the decision was
made, and that the decision itself
may not have been right or just
is not usually considered suffi
cient for reconsideration. And
this is exactly what happened
with the question of the closing
of Union Residence.
Tendencies
These three habits, and they
are tendencies which afflict
most decision-making structures
to a greater or lesser degree,
limit the possibility of student
persuasion on the issues of
greatest concern. We all hope
that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".
Several faculty members and
administration officers have
shown genuine concern for stu
dent opinion in their work with
us. The Committee of Fifteen
is functioning much better now
than was true in the fall quar
ter, and has been useful on sev
eral of the issues I mentioned
earlier. The office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education has
often been responsive in its deal
ings with students.

Hopefully this spirit of coop
eration and interchange will con
tinue and grow. Hopefully the
new Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education will be men
open to new thoughts, men big
enough to change their minds if
they are persuaded and to say
so publicly.
Finally, in all fairness, it
should be said that when the
University has finally come to
grips with a problem, and al
lowed all the parties to partici
pate in the decision, the new
policies are usually a vast im
provement. This is true of
liquor; I hope it will also be true
of open hours and social regula
tions.
Committee of Fifteen
Last quarter was marked by
several Legislature meetings
concerning student representa
tion on the Committee of Fif
teen, culminating in a referen
dum the day after our last meet
ing.
It seems to me there are sev
eral things to be learned from
it. The first concerns the spirit
of the Legislature. In order for
student government to function
well, it must be a cooperative
venture among all the students
concerned. Students must be
willing to serve when they are
called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction
Second, even though the orig
inal sponsors of the petition, and
virtually everyone at the second
meeting, opposed the referen

dum petition and favored the
alternative, the vote did not re
flect the unanimity of that meet
ing.
This can only be taken to
mean that there is a substantial
portion of the student body dis
satisfied with the Legislature.
Were they dissatisfied with their
representatives, they could
change that easily enough.
One group of critics claims
that the issues we deal with are
insignificant. Granted, compared
to Indonesia, where students
caused a change in government,
or Nigeria, where students dem
onstrated because the military
government was planning to
yield power too quickly, student
politics at Stanford seems pale.
Another group, I believe, dis
likes the dominant trend in the
Legislature toward reform and
toward opening dialogue with
other parts of the University
Community.
Both groups, I believe, unite
in feeling that our pretensions
exceed our performance.
Humility and Restraint
Perhaps a greater humility
and restraint is called for.
Perhaps it is trtie that the
Legislature is too large, perhaps
there are other changes called
for in structure and procedure.
I hope that the occasion of the
Speaker election can be used to
reassess these questions and
hopefully to come to a concen
sus on them. Just as we urge an
open and introspective attitude
for the University, we should
be willing to consider changes
in our own institution.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the speech delivered by
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane to
the Legislature Thursday eve
ning.)
Since we have not met for a
month, and I have not given an
extended report since January, I
decided to take this opportunity
to bring you up to date on prog
ress on various issues of interest
and to comment on what I be
lieve our outstanding problems
are.
First, as has been reported in
The Daily, the Student Affairs
and Services Committee has
completed its recommendations
on liquor. The Committee of Fif
teen considered this report, and
passed the following resolution
unanimously:
WHEREAS the Committee
on Student Affairs and Services
has presented the Committee of
Fifteen a thoughtful report on
Stanford's liquor problem, and
WHEREAS the recommen
dations contained in that re
port go as far as is reasonably
possible toward bringing liquor
policies and practices into har
mony,
BE IT THEREFORE RE
SOLVED that the Committee
of Fifteen enthusiastically ami
unanimously endorses this re
port in full. We respectfully
call to the attention of all mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty that the success of this pro
posed policy will require rigor
ous self-discipline and responsi
ble enforcement to protect the
members of the community
from disorderly conduct.
It was discussed in the last
Board of Trustees meeting and
will be discussed again, I under
stand, at the next meeting. I feel
that the report is a very good
one, and that the proposed pol
icy is one which will be success
ful in practice.
I would like to stress the im
portance of a sensible and ma
ture reaction from the campfus
both to the fact that a change
is being considered and to the
change if it is adopted. In the
past, unfortunate incidents have
ended the possibility for reform;
good sense is especially crucial
to see that this does not happen
again.
Wflbur
On the Wilbur problem, a com
promise was reached which ap
pears to satisfy all parties con
cerned.
The importance of the agree
ment is that it clearly estab
lishes a communitarian form of
government for university resi
dences. The role of the faculty
master is to be to lead, if he
can, but not to "control." This
spirit, which is close to the way
the house system at Harvard
and the college system at Yale
work, is very necessary to the
development of residences as in
tellectual centers. Government
by consent of the governed, by
persuading (and hence by edu
cating) will in time ensure the
two-way communication so im
portant at all levels of the Uni
versity.
We should commend the spon
sors, the faculty master, and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education on reaching this
agreement.
Worship
On the question of the free
dom of groups to worship on
campus, the Board of Trustees
passed an ambiguous statement
which has not yet been clarified.
It may be interpreted to require
groups seeking to worship to do
so only in Memorial Church.
I would hope that eventually
the principle could be estab
lished that any group of facul
ty, students and staff can use
University facilities for any law
ful purpose, subject only to first
come, first-served space avail
ability. Worship need not be an
exception to freedom of assem
bly.
Judiciary, Open Hours
Judicial reform and compen
sation for faculty and staff Da
ly's are still in the Committee
of Fifteen; it is hoped that they
can be finished this quarter.
Open hours is now being dis
cussed before the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
Hopeiully there will be a major
liberalization of those rules.
Also there is a report being
prepared by the Social Regula
tions Committee on the opera
tion of the new rules and sug
gestions for further changes.
There seems to be no question
that the new rules have been a
success in the sense that no new
problems have developed and
fewer violations have occurred.
The impact of Social Regula
tions have been reduced now
to a nuisance for most girls;
they are sufficiently liberal that

very few girls find themselves
restricted by them.
I would hope that eventually
the University community
would come to recognize this
and do away with all regulations
for upper-class women, perhaps
with a voluntary sign-out sys
tem. Although it may not come
this year, soon we must recog
nize de jure what we have al
ready recognized de facto, that
women students are expected to
be responsible for their own be
havior, as the men now are.
University Conimitteeis
The Committee of Fifteen has
begun discussions of the ques
tion of the appointment and role
of students on University com
mittees. Certainly our experi
ence with the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education would in
dicate the desirability of having
students on that committee.
Hopefully arrangements could
be made for the students at
tached to Academic Council com
mittees to sit with vote, and for
the selection procedure for stu
dents on Presidential Advisory
Committees to be reviewed.
Although the Finance Com
mittee is heavily burdened pre
paring next year's budget, I
would hope that it would be pos
sible for the Finance and Bylaws
Committees to consider the pos
sibility of a Constitutional
Amendment to reconsider and
clarify the power and role of the
Financial Director and the Stu
dent Financial Manager.
Finally, I am pleased to re
port that the initial membership
of the Education Commission
has been appointed and that
subcommittees are being formed.
I would hope that the Legisla
ture will give financial support
where that is needed, and that
the Education Commission can
soon begin to advise us on many
of the questions that appear be
fore us.
Student Power
In my last extended report to
you, I said that I had come to
the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student
power in the University, to the
extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the cam
pus and its attendant bad pub
licity for the University.
I wish I could have said that
student power, to the extent that
we have it, is based on our pow
er of persuasion. But there are
several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are

The Committee of Fifteen has
begun discussions of the ques
tion of the appointment and role
of students on University com
mittees. Certainly our experi
ence with the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education would in
dicate the desirability of having
students on that committee.
Hopefully arrangements could
be made for the students at
tached to Academic Council com
mittees to sit with vote, and for
the selection procedure for stu
dents on Presidential Advisory
Committees to be reviewed.
Although the Finance Com
mittee is heavily burdened pre
paring next year's budget, I
would hope that it would be pos
sible for the Finance and Bylaws
Committees to consider the pos
sibility of a Constitutional
Amendment to reconsider and
clarify the power and role of the
Financial Director and the Stu
dent Financial Manager.
Finally, I am pleased to re
port that the initial membership
of the Education Commission
has been appointed and that
subcommittees are being formed.
I would hope that the Legisla
ture will give financial support
where that is needed, and that
the Education Commission can
soon begin to advise us on many
of the questions that appear be
fore us.
Student Power
In my last extended report to
you, I said that I had come to
the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student
power in the University, to the
extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the cam
pus and its attendant bad pub
licity for the University.
I wish I could have said that
student power, to the extent that
we have it, is based on our pow
er of persuasion. But there are
several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are
first raised. I am aware that
there is a difference in time
horizon between students, who
are usually here only four years,
and faculty and administrators,
who expect to spend many years
in one place. Nevertheless, I be
lieve there is a tendency to be
slow in coming to grips with
problems in the hope that they
will go away.
Second is a tradition of secre
cy surrounding the actual for
mulation of policy. All too often
doors are closed while policy is
being formulated, and when stu
dents disagree with a policy al
ter it is formulated, what we
hear, and try to argue against,
are the apologies for the policy,
and not its reasons.
Finally, once an administra
tive decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a "united
front," a monolithic reaction to
student questions, complaints or
disagreements. Once a policy is
formulated, little short of open
rebellion will bring a reconsid
eration; the notion that there
might be facts not considered at
the time of the decision was
made, and that the decision itself
may not have been right or just
is not usually considered suffi
cient for reconsideration. And
this is exactly what happened
with the question of the closing
of Union Residence.
Tendencies
These three habits, and they
are tendencies which afflict
most decision-making structures
to a greater or lesser degree,
limit the possibility of student
persuasion on the issues of
greatest concern. We all hope
that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".
Several faculty members and
administration officers have
shown genuine concern for stu
dent opinion in their work with
us. The Committee of Fifteen
is functioning much better now
than was true in the fall quar
ter, and has been useful on sev
eral of the issues I mentioned
earlier. The office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education has
often been responsive in its deal
ings with students.

Hopefully this spirit of coop
eration and interchange will con
tinue and grow. Hopefully the
new Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education will be men
open to new thoughts, men big
enough to change their minds if
they are persuaded and to say
so publicly.
Finally, in all fairness, it
should be said that when the
University has finally come to
grips with a problem, and al
lowed all the parties to partici
pate in the decision, the new
policies are usually a vast im
provement. This is true of
liquor; I hope it will also be true
of open hours and social regula
tions.
Committee of Fifteen
Last quarter was marked by
several Legislature meetings
concerning student representa
tion on the Committee of Fif
teen, culminating in a referen
dum the day after our last meet
ing.
It seems to me there are sev
eral things to be learned from
it. The first concerns the spirit
of the Legislature. In order for
student government to function
well, it must be a cooperative
venture among all the students
concerned. Students must be
willing to serve when they are
called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction
Second, even though the orig
inal sponsors of the petition, and
virtually everyone at the second
meeting, opposed the referen

dum petition and favored the
alternative, the vote did not re
flect the unanimity of that meet
ing.
This can only be taken to
mean that there is a substantial
portion of the student body dis
satisfied with the Legislature.
Were they dissatisfied with their
representatives, they could
change that easily enough.
One group of critics claims
that the issues we deal with are
insignificant. Granted, compared
to Indonesia, where students
caused a change in government,
or Nigeria, where students dem
onstrated because the military
government was planning to
yield power too quickly, student
politics at Stanford seems pale.
Another group, I believe, dis
likes the dominant trend in the
Legislature toward reform and
toward opening dialogue with
other parts of the University
Community.
Both groups, I believe, unite
in feeling that our pretensions
exceed our performance.
Humility and Restraint
Perhaps a greater humility
and restraint is called for.
Perhaps it is trtie that the
Legislature is too large, perhaps
there are other changes called
for in structure and procedure.
I hope that the occasion of the
Speaker election can be used to
reassess these questions and
hopefully to come to a concen
sus on them. Just as we urge an
open and introspective attitude
for the University, we should
be willing to consider changes
in our own institution.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the speech delivered by
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane to
the Legislature Thursday eve
ning.)
Since we have not met for a
month, and I have not given an
extended report since January, I
decided to take this opportunity
to bring you up to date on prog
ress on various issues of interest
and to comment on what I be
lieve our outstanding problems
are.
First, as has been reported in
The Daily, the Student Affairs
and Services Committee has
completed its recommendations
on liquor. The Committee of Fif
teen considered this report, and
passed the following resolution
unanimously:
WHEREAS the Committee
on Student Affairs and Services
has presented the Committee of
Fifteen a thoughtful report on
Stanford's liquor problem, and
WHEREAS the recommen
dations contained in that re
port go as far as is reasonably
possible toward bringing liquor
policies and practices into har
mony,
BE IT THEREFORE RE
SOLVED that the Committee
of Fifteen enthusiastically ami
unanimously endorses this re
port in full. We respectfully
call to the attention of all mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty that the success of this pro
posed policy will require rigor
ous self-discipline and responsi
ble enforcement to protect the
members of the community
from disorderly conduct.
It was discussed in the last
Board of Trustees meeting and
will be discussed again, I under
stand, at the next meeting. I feel
that the report is a very good
one, and that the proposed pol
icy is one which will be success
ful in practice.
I would like to stress the im
portance of a sensible and ma
ture reaction from the campfus
both to the fact that a change
is being considered and to the
change if it is adopted. In the
past, unfortunate incidents have
ended the possibility for reform;
good sense is especially crucial
to see that this does not happen
again.
Wflbur
On the Wilbur problem, a com
promise was reached which ap
pears to satisfy all parties con
cerned.
The importance of the agree
ment is that it clearly estab
lishes a communitarian form of
government for university resi
dences. The role of the faculty
master is to be to lead, if he
can, but not to "control." This
spirit, which is close to the way
the house system at Harvard
and the college system at Yale
work, is very necessary to the
development of residences as in
tellectual centers. Government
by consent of the governed, by
persuading (and hence by edu
cating) will in time ensure the
two-way communication so im
portant at all levels of the Uni
versity.
We should commend the spon
sors, the faculty master, and
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education on reaching this
agreement.
Worship
On the question of the free
dom of groups to worship on
campus, the Board of Trustees
passed an ambiguous statement
which has not yet been clarified.
It may be interpreted to require
groups seeking to worship to do
so only in Memorial Church.
I would hope that eventually
the principle could be estab
lished that any group of facul
ty, students and staff can use
University facilities for any law
ful purpose, subject only to first
come, first-served space avail
ability. Worship need not be an
exception to freedom of assem
bly.
Judiciary, Open Hours
Judicial reform and compen
sation for faculty and staff Da
ly's are still in the Committee
of Fifteen; it is hoped that they
can be finished this quarter.
Open hours is now being dis
cussed before the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
Hopeiully there will be a major
liberalization of those rules.
Also there is a report being
prepared by the Social Regula
tions Committee on the opera
tion of the new rules and sug
gestions for further changes.
There seems to be no question
that the new rules have been a
success in the sense that no new
problems have developed and
fewer violations have occurred.
The impact of Social Regula
tions have been reduced now
to a nuisance for most girls;
they are sufficiently liberal that

very few girls find themselves
restricted by them.
I would hope that eventually
the University community
would come to recognize this
and do away with all regulations
for upper-class women, perhaps
with a voluntary sign-out sys
tem. Although it may not come
this year, soon we must recog
nize de jure what we have al
ready recognized de facto, that
women students are expected to
be responsible for their own be
havior, as the men now are.

groups seeking to worship to do
so only in Memorial Church.
I would hope that eventually
the principle could be estab
lished that any group of facul
ty, students and staff can use
University facilities for any law
ful purpose, subject only to first
come, first-served space avail
ability. Worship need not be an
exception to freedom of assem
bly.
Judiciary, Open Hours
Judicial reform and compen
sation for faculty and staff Da
ly's are still in the Committee
of Fifteen; it is hoped that they
can be finished this quarter.
Open hours is now being dis
cussed before the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
Hopeiully there will be a major
liberalization of those rules.
Also there is a report being
prepared by the Social Regula
tions Committee on the opera
tion of the new rules and sug
gestions for further changes.
There seems to be no question
that the new rules have been a
success in the sense that no new
problems have developed and
fewer violations have occurred.
The impact of Social Regula
tions have been reduced now
to a nuisance for most girls;
they are sufficiently liberal that

very few girls find themselves
restricted by them.
I would hope that eventually
the University community
would come to recognize this
and do away with all regulations
for upper-class women, perhaps
with a voluntary sign-out sys
tem. Although it may not come
this year, soon we must recog
nize de jure what we have al
ready recognized de facto, that
women students are expected to
be responsible for their own be
havior, as the men now are.
University Conimitteeis
The Committee of Fifteen has
begun discussions of the ques
tion of the appointment and role
of students on University com
mittees. Certainly our experi
ence with the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education would in
dicate the desirability of having
students on that committee.
Hopefully arrangements could
be made for the students at
tached to Academic Council com
mittees to sit with vote, and for
the selection procedure for stu
dents on Presidential Advisory
Committees to be reviewed.
Although the Finance Com
mittee is heavily burdened pre
paring next year's budget, I
would hope that it would be pos
sible for the Finance and Bylaws
Committees to consider the pos
sibility of a Constitutional
Amendment to reconsider and
clarify the power and role of the
Financial Director and the Stu
dent Financial Manager.
Finally, I am pleased to re
port that the initial membership
of the Education Commission
has been appointed and that
subcommittees are being formed.
I would hope that the Legisla
ture will give financial support
where that is needed, and that
the Education Commission can
soon begin to advise us on many
of the questions that appear be
fore us.
Student Power
In my last extended report to
you, I said that I had come to
the conclusion, reluctantly and
with great sorrow, that student
power in the University, to the
extent that we have power, is
based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the cam
pus and its attendant bad pub
licity for the University.
I wish I could have said that
student power, to the extent that
we have it, is based on our pow
er of persuasion. But there are
several administrative habits
which hinder, and sometimes
make impossible, a real hearing
for students.
The first is a reluctance to
deal with issues when they are
first raised. I am aware that
there is a difference in time
horizon between students, who
are usually here only four years,
and faculty and administrators,
who expect to spend many years
in one place. Nevertheless, I be
lieve there is a tendency to be
slow in coming to grips with
problems in the hope that they
will go away.
Second is a tradition of secre
cy surrounding the actual for
mulation of policy. All too often
doors are closed while policy is
being formulated, and when stu
dents disagree with a policy al
ter it is formulated, what we
hear, and try to argue against,
are the apologies for the policy,
and not its reasons.
Finally, once an administra
tive decision is reached, there is
a habit of forming a "united
front," a monolithic reaction to
student questions, complaints or
disagreements. Once a policy is
formulated, little short of open
rebellion will bring a reconsid
eration; the notion that there
might be facts not considered at
the time of the decision was
made, and that the decision itself
may not have been right or just
is not usually considered suffi
cient for reconsideration. And
this is exactly what happened
with the question of the closing
of Union Residence.
Tendencies
These three habits, and they
are tendencies which afflict
most decision-making structures
to a greater or lesser degree,
limit the possibility of student
persuasion on the issues of
greatest concern. We all hope
that the University will heed
Professor Rhinelander's admo
nition "to listen, and I mean
really listen...".
Several faculty members and
administration officers have
shown genuine concern for stu
dent opinion in their work with
us. The Committee of Fifteen
is functioning much better now
than was true in the fall quar
ter, and has been useful on sev
eral of the issues I mentioned
earlier. The office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education has
often been responsive in its deal
ings with students.

Hopefully this spirit of coop
eration and interchange will con
tinue and grow. Hopefully the
new Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education will be men
open to new thoughts, men big
enough to change their minds if
they are persuaded and to say
so publicly.
Finally, in all fairness, it
should be said that when the
University has finally come to
grips with a problem, and al
lowed all the parties to partici
pate in the decision, the new
policies are usually a vast im
provement. This is true of
liquor; I hope it will also be true
of open hours and social regula
tions.
Committee of Fifteen
Last quarter was marked by
several Legislature meetings
concerning student representa
tion on the Committee of Fif
teen, culminating in a referen
dum the day after our last meet
ing.
It seems to me there are sev
eral things to be learned from
it. The first concerns the spirit
of the Legislature. In order for
student government to function
well, it must be a cooperative
venture among all the students
concerned. Students must be
willing to serve when they are
called upon to do so, and to step
down when called upon to do so.
Only to the extent that we work
together to achieve these goals,
can we be effective.
Dissatisfaction
Second, even though the orig
inal sponsors of the petition, and
virtually everyone at the second
meeting, opposed the referen

dum petition and favored the
alternative, the vote did not re
flect the unanimity of that meet
ing.
This can only be taken to
mean that there is a substantial
portion of the student body dis
satisfied with the Legislature.
Were they dissatisfied with their
representatives, they could
change that easily enough.
One group of critics claims
that the issues we deal with are
insignificant. Granted, compared
to Indonesia, where students
caused a change in government,
or Nigeria, where students dem
onstrated because the military
government was planning to
yield power too quickly, student
politics at Stanford seems pale.
Another group, I believe, dis
likes the dominant trend in the
Legislature toward reform and
toward opening dialogue with
other parts of the University
Community.
Both groups, I believe, unite
in feeling that our pretensions
exceed our performance.
Humility and Restraint
Perhaps a greater humility
and restraint is called for.
Perhaps it is trtie that the
Legislature is too large, perhaps
there are other changes called
for in structure and procedure.
I hope that the occasion of the
Speaker election can be used to
reassess these questions and
hopefully to come to a concen
sus on them. Just as we urge an
open and introspective attitude
for the University, we should
be willing to consider changes
in our own institution.
