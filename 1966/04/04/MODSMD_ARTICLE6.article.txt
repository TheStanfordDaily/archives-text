# ALL'S WELL Repertory Triumphs
## 
### JAMES STEIN 
The critics' consensus that "All's
Well That Ends Well" is one of Shake
speare's least satisfactory plays in no
way compromised the delighted ap
proval with which nearly 200 first
nighters greeted the latest production
of the Stanford Repertory Theater in
the Little Theater Thursday.
The play is the story of a marriage.
Helena, in return for saving the king's
life with a medicinal potion, is given
the unwilling hand of Bertram.
Aghast at the match, Bertram vows
never to consummate the marriage
and goes off to the war. Nevertheless,
guileful Helena gets her husband in
the end by posing as another woman
and tricking him to her bed.
The performances gains vitality
through warm interpretations of the
characters and the visual effects of
the comic scenes. Gerald Hiken (as
Lafew) and Paul E. Richards (as Pa
rolles) deserve special recognition for
the success of the production.
Parolles Best
Parolles is the most convincing fig
ure in this production, due not only
to ambiguity in Shakespeare's draw
ing of Helena and Bertram, but also
to the weak portrayals of these two
by Ruth Silviera and John Hellwig.
Parolles is the man for whom the
word "fop" was invented, and Rich
ards plays this cowardly and conceit
ed soldier with vigor. The play's best
scenes occurs when Parolles, blind
folded, is tricked by his comrades into
thinking that he is about to be tor
tured by enemies.

To escape, he defames his friends
in their presence. Sheldon Feldner, as
the "interpreter," does a fine job in
extracting the confessions. Parolles'
horror and despair when he is unblind
folded is a masterpiece.
Special commendation goes also to
Gerald Hiken, who presented Lafew,
a French lord elderly in body but
sprightly of mind and sharp of ton
gue. With unusually graphic expres
sions Hiken caught perffectly Lafew's
abiding contempt for Parolles.
Helena, Bertram Cool
Ruth Silviera, as Helena, was too
harsh for the audience to sympathize
with her, yet not cold enough to evoke
actual dislike.
John Hellwig's Bertram was a
young man not quite sure of himself,
and thus quite readily taken in by
Parolles. But to Bertram, as to Hel
ena, the audience remained cool. The
role is difficult to play convincingly,
and Hellwig was not quite up to it.
The setting of the production in the
pre-World War I Edwardian period
might also be questioned. "I wanted
a period where there were no roman
tic wars, where people died like he
roess because it is with real flesh
and blood that we deal here," writes
Sharp in the program notes.
Yet choosing this particular period
has little but novelty to recommend
it. The war was of no great impor
tance to the play, and no one died,
heroically or otherwise. Though the
Edwardian settings of Robert McFar
land were beautiful and well execut
ed, they did little to enhance the play-
