research for the Government on the

nism: A Challenge to American Pol
icy."
Kangas, moderator, will also give a
short speech on the Studies of the
Communist System, a section of the
Stanford Institute of Political Studies.
He received his B.A. from Ohio Wesle
yan in 1960, his M..A. from MIT in '64,
and has studied at the University of
Helsinki and at Stanford. Here, he has
been a reader for and has taught with
Professor North. Next fall, he plans
to return to Helsinki and then to the
Air Force Academy in January, to
work on his doctorate dissertation.
"Communist System Interaction
with the Developing States, 1954-1962:
A Preliminary Analysis," will be the
topic of Simon's talk. He will discusss
the interaction in three main areas:
economic, legal and military, and so
cio-cultural interaction.
Divided Nations
Stanford graduate Sievers' topic
will be "The Divided Nations: Ger
many, Vietnam, Korea, and China."
Sievers, who majored in International
Relations, is presently a research as
sistant for The Studies of the Commu
nist System. He plans to write his dis

nist System." He will deal primarily

in the Communist party states as de
termined by their developmental lev
els. Following the short talks, there
will be open discussion among the
panel members and the audience.
Balanced Perspective
The Communism series presented
by Tresidder Memorial Union is in
tended to provide "a balanced perspec
tive of Communism" Bruce Maximov,

co-chairman of the series, told the
Daily. He added that to gain such a
worthwhile perspective, students
must arrive at their own conclusions
after "exposure to and assimilation
of information from various sources,
representing different positions."
Because journalism considers Com
munism primarily as a "threat," rath
er than a belief system, Maximov
claims people today have only "half
of the information," and more is need
ed for a balanced judgment. He said
this was true because most informa
tion from debates, and discussions are
reported by the standard news sources.

Balanced Perspective
The Communism series presented
by Tresidder Memorial Union is in
tended to provide "a balanced perspec
tive of Communism" Bruce Maximov,

co-chairman of the series, told the
Daily. He added that to gain such a
worthwhile perspective, students
must arrive at their own conclusions
after "exposure to and assimilation
of information from various sources,
representing different positions."
Because journalism considers Com
munism primarily as a "threat," rath
er than a belief system, Maximov
claims people today have only "half
of the information," and more is need
ed for a balanced judgment. He said
this was true because most informa
tion from debates, and discussions are
reported by the standard news sources.
"Communism: Its Concepts and Its
Challenges" will open its spring series
of programs with a panel of Ph.D can
