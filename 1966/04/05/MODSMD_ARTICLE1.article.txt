### CHRIS HARTE News Editor 
A Stanford graduate student was
named a member of America's "fifth
generation" of astronauts yesterday.
Bruce McCandless 11, a Navy Lieu
tenant who describes himself as a
"scientifically-traincd pilot," is part
of a 19-man team announced in Hous
ton by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
McCandless, 28, received his Mas
ter's in electrical engineering here last
June and will have completed all the

en tried but did not meet the min
imum requirements.
Since the manned space pro
gram began, the United States
already had named 3(5 men as as
tronauts. Three were killed in jet
crashes, two resigned and three
are not on flight status because of
medical disorders.
Officials said they do not con
sider themselves short of pilots,
but admit they do not have a sur
plus as they had when flights
were few and far between. Eigh
teen of the nation's 23 flight
trained astronauts are assigned to
jobs as either prime or backup
crewmen on 1966 space missions.
