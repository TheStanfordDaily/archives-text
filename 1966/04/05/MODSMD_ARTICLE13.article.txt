# SRI To Build Biology Labs
## 
### 
Construction will begin in
April on a new $1,200,000 Life
Sciences research building at
Stanford Research Institute.
Dr. Karl Folkers, President of
SRII, said the 37,000 square foot
building will house research lab
oratories devoted to investiga
tions in pharmacology, biochem
istry and enzymology, viral tu
morigenesis, and bio-behavioral
sciences, under the direction of
Dr. William Skinner, Executive
Director of Life Sciences. -
A grant of $500,000 from the
National Institutes of Health
provided part of the funds for
the new building. The remaining
