PRINCETON, N. J. — Nearly
three-quarters of Princeton Uni
versity's undergraduates have
elected to use the school's new
pass-fail option—a system under
which they take one course for
which they are not graded but
receive a "pass" or "fail."
The Princeton faculty said
that in establishing the option
they hoped to broaden the range
of course choices for undergrad
uates. More than 200 courses,
ranging from modern European
painting to digital computer the
ory, are being taken on an un
graded basis by 2,200 students.
A breakdown by classes re
vealed that 78 per cent of the
seniors, 77 per cent of the jun
iors, and 79 per cent of the sopo
mores elected to use the option
while 65 per cent of the fresh
men participated in the pro
gram.
Four of the five courses select
ed most frequently are in the
arts and literature, the survey
shows. The art and archeology

department, one of the smallest
at Princeton with only 12 de
partmental majors this year,
currently has more students tak
ing courses with the pass-fail op
tion than any other.
A student may take any course
on a pass-fail basis except one
in his major department.
The Princeton experiment is
one of a number now underway.
The California Institute of
Technology faculty voted last
fall to drop grades in freshman
courses to make the transition
between high school and college
smoother. Freshman level cours
es are now evaluated on a pass
fail basis.
A similar pass-iail system for
first and second year students is
being designed at Washington
University in St. Louis.
However, only upperclassmen
at Carleton College in North
field, Minn., are given the pass
fail option.
