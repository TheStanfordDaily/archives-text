# Tuesday Series Offers Jet-Age 'Doubleheader'
## 
### 
Top engineers of the two com
panies competing for the first
contract to build a supersonic
transport will swap stories on
the unique problems of design
ing the faster-than-sound air
liners during the regular Tues
day Evening Series Lecture in
Memorial Auditorium, 8 p.m. to
night.
Richard Heppe, Stanford alum
nus and chief engineer for the
supersonic transport program at
Lockheed - California Co., and
John Swihart, technical integra
tion chief for the same program
at Boeing Co., will head the pro

gram. The chairman-referee will
be Raymond Kelly, retired direc
tor of development for United
Air Lines.
Among other headaches the
two engineers will discuss are
airport noise, sonic booms, pilot
ing problems, and the aerody
namic heating not ordinarily en
countered in the manufacture of
commercial airliners.
Both speakers are engineers
of long experience, Heppe hav
ing been with Lockheed 19 years
and Swihart a veteran who be
gan 16 years ago with the
NACA/NASA Langley Research
Center.
