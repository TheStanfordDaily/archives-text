# SPLIT WITH UCSB
## Indians Blank Unbeaten UCLA 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's baseball team took
two steps forward and one big
one backward in pursuit of their
second consecutive CIBA base
ball championship.
Friday, the Indians slipped by
UCLA, 1-0, giving the Bruins
their first league loss. Saturday,
Stanford had to settle for a split
with UCSB in a doubleheader.
Santa Barbara won the first
game, 5-4, in ten innings. The
Tribe bounced back to win the
second game, 4-1.
By winning two out of three,
Coach Dutch Fehring has evened
out his league record at 4-4.
The four losses put Indian title
hopes in a very precarious posi
tion, though. League leading
USC has only one loss- to Stan
ford —as does UCLA.
Pitcher's Delight
The victory over UCLA was
a pitcher's battle all the way.

Each side got seven hits, hut nei
ther pitcher gave up an earned
run. In the sixth, Stanford pitch
er John Mason singled, went to
third on a couple of miscues by
the Bruins, and scored on a sac
rifice fly by Jim Hibbs.
Centerfielder Steve Hovley
continued his hitting ways as he
got four hits in four at bats.
If he had been up at the right
time perhaps Stanford wouldn't
have left ten men on base. UCLA
left six stranded.
John Mason went all the way
on the mound.
Stanford outhit UCSB 12 hits
to seven in the first game Sat
urday but two Santa Barbara
runs in the top of the tenth did
the Indians in.
Santa Barbara got their runs
in the tenth without the aid of
a hit. Stanford throwers walked
three men, hit a batter, and
threw a wild pitch to let in two

runs. Frank Duffy tried to put
the Tribe back into the ball
game with a lead off home run
in the bottom of the tenth, but
his was the only run Stanford
could muster.
Leftfielder Marty Erek and
third baseman Hi Lewis hit back
to back doubles in the bottom
of the ninth to tie the game and
send it into overtime. The score
at the time was 3-3.
Single Runs
Stanford scored single runs in
the sixth and eighth also.
A walk, a wild pitch, a sacri
fice, and a single by John Hibbs
scored a run in the sixth.
Ron Yett got aboard with a
single in the eighth, advanced
on Frank Duffy's single and
scored when Pete Middlekauff
pounded out a double.
Steve Hovley kept his hot bat
going with three hits in five at
bats. Duffy and Hibbs both got
two hits in their five at bats.
The second game was a seven
inning affair and the Tribe won
it running away. After four in
nings the score was 1-1. Then
Stanford scored one run in the
fifth and two runs in the sixth
to win, 4-1.
Terry Docken went all the
way on the mound for Stanford.
He allowed five hits and had the
Gauchos completely in hand all
the way.
Stanford scored first with a
singleton run in the first inning.

Frank Duffy singled, advanced
to second on a single by Steve
Hovley, and scored when the
second baseman threw away Jim
Hibbs' double play ball.
Docken Walks
Pitcher Terry Dockon walked
to lead off the fifth. Yett flied
out, Duffy singled, and Hovley
walked to load up the bases.
Hibbs came up and he hit a
slow bounder to the shortstop
who fumbled the ball just
enough so that Docken was able
to beat the throw to the plate.
No one else scored, however,
when Erck and Lewis both flied
out to center.
Stanford's two other runs
came in the sixth. Middlekauff
singled down the right field line
and went to second when the
rightfielder hobbled the ball. He
advanced to third on a fielder's
choice and scored on a bloop sin
gle to left by Yett. Yett scored
the second run after he got to
third on a single by Duffy and
a walk to Hovley.
Stanford's next game is today
against S a n Fernando Valley
State. The game will be played
in Sunken Diamond at 3:00 p.m.

when Erck and Lewis both flied
out to center.

two steps forward and one big
one backward in pursuit of their

out, Duffy singled, and Hovley
walked to load up the bases.
Hibbs came up and he hit a
slow bounder to the shortstop
who fumbled the ball just
enough so that Docken was able
to beat the throw to the plate.
No one else scored, however,
when Erck and Lewis both flied
out to center.
Stanford's two other runs
came in the sixth. Middlekauff
singled down the right field line
and went to second when the
rightfielder hobbled the ball. He
advanced to third on a fielder's
choice and scored on a bloop sin
gle to left by Yett. Yett scored
the second run after he got to
third on a single by Duffy and
a walk to Hovley.
Stanford's next game is today
against S a n Fernando Valley
State. The game will be played
in Sunken Diamond at 3:00 p.m.

LARRY QUESTAD, leads the way in last weekend's track and field
meet against San Jose State. Questad, who has gained national
prominence, scored impressively against the Spartans in aiding
Stanford's upset victory.
Stanford's baseball team took
two steps forward and one big
one backward in pursuit of their
second consecutive CIBA base
ball championship.
Friday, the Indians slipped by
UCLA, 1-0, giving the Bruins
their first league loss. Saturday,
Stanford had to settle for a split
with UCSB in a doubleheader.
Santa Barbara won the first
game, 5-4, in ten innings. The
Tribe bounced back to win the
second game, 4-1.
By winning two out of three,
Coach Dutch Fehring has evened
out his league record at 4-4.
The four losses put Indian title
hopes in a very precarious posi
tion, though. League leading
USC has only one loss- to Stan
ford —as does UCLA.
