SPACE CENTER, Houston,
Tex. (AP) — The United States
bolstered its astronaut corps to
50 today by naming 19 new space
men, thus supplying manpower
for flights to the moon and be
yond.
Faced with a rapid-fire pace of
flights, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration select
ed the largest group of astronauts
ever picked.
The newest team will begin
training in early May. It includes
seven officers from the Air Force,
six from the Navy, two from the
."Marine Corps, and four civilians.
Officials picked the 19 from 351
men and women who applied be
fore Dec. 1 last year after a call
was issued for 15 new astronauts
Sept. 10.
The space agency said six worn-

course requirements for his Ph.D. by
June of this year.
His Navy record and heritage are
equally impressive—he graduated sec
ond in his class from Annapolis in
1958, and both hs father and grand
father received the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
He applied for the program last
fall when NASA put out a call for
volunteers for a new group of pilot
astronauts. Notifcd last Wednesday
that ho had been selected, he said he
was "very pleasantly surprised," but
that he had not done anything un
usual to celebrate.
Mrs. McCandless talked over her
husband's plans with him when he
first applied for the program, and

counseled him to "Go ahead."
The only person who seemed wor
ried about McCandless was his faculty
advier, Prof. Oscar Buneman of the
Department of Electrical Engineering.

Describing the new astronaut as
"one of our star pupils," Buneman
said "We want to hang on to this man
—we don't want to lose him in outer
snace."

McCandless himself had no fears
about getting lost, saying it wouldn't
be "overly difficult" to adjust to the
space program.
"I'll have a great deal of ground
flight time in the excellent space
flight simulators in Houston," he said,
"and I don't think docking and ren
dezvous will be too different from fly
ing in formation."
He won't get a chance to fly a space
mission for at least two years, be
cause basic training requires 18
months and it takes at least 6 more
to prepare for a specific flight.
The only time he has ever had
trouble was in 1961 when he was
landing a single seat F-4D on the car
rier Forrestal. When a fatigue crack
developed and his tail assembly ep*
arated from the aircraft he bolted
back up, but his fuel afterburner
caught fire, and he had to eject at
800 feet. He has over 1400 flight
hours in jets.
McaCndless' biggest worry right
now is far removed from any prob
lems in adjusting to space program
or space itself. Throwing out a ques
tion of his own to the reporters who
had been interrogating him for half
an hour, he asked "Do any of you
know how to sell a house?"
Toughest question of the day came
from a KZSU newsman who wanted
to know what McCandless thought
about UFO's, and whether or not he
expected to see any while in space.

The spaceman was forced to take the
fifth amendment.
He lives in Mountain View with his
wife, Berniee, his 4Vz -year-old son
Bruce 111, and his 2Vi-year-old daugh
ter Tracy.


Bruce McCandless, a 1965 Stanford
graduate, was chosen yesterday as
an astronaut by the National Aero
nautics and Space Administration.
