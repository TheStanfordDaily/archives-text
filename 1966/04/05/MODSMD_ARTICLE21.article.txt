# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## The 						Role Of The Three Estates In An Educational Community 
### WILLIAM S. MACKENZIE ASSU President 
(Editor's note: This is the first in a leisurely
series of articles dealing with I'ducation at Stan
ford. Seniors Jeff Wattles and David Cornbergf,
who have organized the series, maintain that "edu
cation is not understood at Stanford and that it
cannot be understood either by supposing that
every j>ossible viewpoint has been entertained, or
by holding public meetings and demonstrations."
Thus, their intent is to challenge their readers to
"show real, personal concern for academic depth
and quality, whether in study or in University
life."
This first article, written by ASSII President
Sandy Mackenzie, addresses the relationship be
tween the structure of the University and its
educational policy. Other articles will discuss lib
eralism, indoctrination, tradition, objectivity,
alienation, and other subjects as they relate to
education. The Daily invites comment from the
Stanford community, in the form of letters or
columns, in the hope of stimulating debate over
education at Stanford.
The opinions expressed in the series are those
of the writers, and do not necessarily reflect the
opinions of either the organizers of the series
or t he editors.)

A University is an educational environment
which is the on-going creation of its membersâ€”
all its members.
It should bo a place where the expression of
diverse viewpoints is encouraged, especially in
(he formation of educational policy and pro
grams:. Too often at Stanford formulation of edu
cational policy affecting the entire community is
considered the prerogative of its administrators
to the neglect of its students and faculty.
Strength Within
Mr. John Gardner has maintained that to pre
serve its autonomy in American society, the uni
versity must strengthen itself within to be able
to resist increasing pressures from outside agen
cies which would have it exist to service their
needs. To achieve true status as a university,
Stanford must develop both an integrity and a
coherence to its internal structure.
That is not to imply that a solution is to be
found merely by more clearly delineating author
ity structures. Rather, a system is needed which
will elicit and consider many points of view at
all levels of decision making.
There is a singular spirit of learning and edu
cation which is found in every great university.
This spirit is grounded in a genuine sense of com
munity and academic inquiry.
We lack both this community and this spirit
at Stanford.
At present, Stanford resembles as much an
uneasy system of alliances between isolated de
partments and agencies as it resembles an intel
lectual community. The burden of creating and
preserving a spirit of community at Stanford is
one that we have failed to take up.
Less Active
The faculty have long had access to the deci
sionmaking centers of the university, but have
been less active here than could be desired. In
pursuing their primary concerns of teaching and
research, they may tend to overlook the impor
tant matters of university structure and academ
ic policy, matters which have crucial relevance
to their professional work.
Stanford has suffered as a result of their lack
of attention or concern here. Presumably it would

be desirable to have a continuing dialogue on
such questions as how a proper balance between
teaching and research can be preserved in the
university.
The committees of the Academic Council tend
to be sluggish in their movements and reluctant
to pose fundamental questions. They seem more
prone to ratify decisions made by administra
tors than to spend the time and energy needed
to be a creative force in developing policy and
procedure.
It. is more the acquiescence than the participa
tion of the faculty that is provided for in these
committees. Those individuals or groups within
the faculty who wish to innovate or experiment
within the university seem to get the support of
Stanford's administrators only if a similar pro
gram has met with success at some other uni
versity.
The Students
And what of the students? At Stanford the
student finds himself confronted with a barely
comprehensible maze of regulations and require
ments. He lives in a society which pre-judges his
ability to make a worthwhile contribution.
He is greeted not with the challenge of devel
oping his own ideas and standards, but with a ple
thora of arbitrary and restrictive regulations. He
is indulgently reminded that it is a privilege and
not a right to be "down on The Farm."
In this society the students are all too often
seen as children, for whom all decisions are made
by some paternal authority. In such a society, it
is the radical who suggests that viewpoints and
opinions of students (as expressed by the stu
dents themselves) should be entertained before
decisions are reached.
This enforced filial piety results in a moratori
um on decision-making during the college years.
I suggest that this is not the best way to educate
an individual or to prepare him to enter the world
beyond the university.
What ought to be the role of the administra
tion in the university? The university becomes
the servant of the administration and our so
ciety is out of joint.
Where the administrators provide the financial
support for the university and serve as a mecha
nism to improve, coordinate, and support new
and existing programs, they are serving a vital
function. Where they serve only to preserve the
status quo or to quiet those who would rock the
boat, as too often they seem to do at Stanford,
their efforts are self-defeating.
To Begin To Bother
I submit to the entire Stanford community,
whether it be a community of scholars, an alli
ance of departments, of a macabre nexus of pow
er and authority, that we begin to bother about
the community.
We ought, for example, to begin to be con
cerned that many decisions which affect all mem
bers of the community are made by only a few.
It is the unfortunate result of this situation
that an open exchange of ideas rarely takes place
among departments, and hardly ever between
students and administrators.
We must begin to confront a situation in which
important decisions affecting policy, programs
and personnel are arrived at after the considera
tion of only a limited number of points of view.
It is our responsibility to attempt to determine
by what methods we can best insure that all view
points will be considered in the making of edu
cational policy at Stanford.
