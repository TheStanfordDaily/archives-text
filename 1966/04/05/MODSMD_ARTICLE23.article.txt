## An Expedition Of Senators Discovers A New Country 
### Art Buchwald 
One of the most astounding
discoveries in history was made
the other day when a group of
American State Department peo
ple found a new country named
Red China. For years there had
been rumors that there was a
country in the Far East with a
population of 800,000,000 people.
Yet no one in the United States
would believe it.
Expedition
But an expedition of Senators
led by Marco Fulbright came
across it accidentally while look
ing for a new route to North
Vietnam.
When the existence of Red
China was reported, a meeting
of all the top policy people in
the State Department was
called.
"If this is true," said one of
the Assistant Secretaries, "that
means the world is round."
"Hogwash," said another Sec
retary. "We all know there is a
country called China already,
so how could there be another
China? Look at our maps. China
is right here in the Formosa
Strait."
"That's right," a Secretary
said. "And our maps are all up
to date."
I,and Mass
"What's that large land mass
across the water from it?" some
one asked.
"It's marked 'unexplored.' "
"Perhaps that's where Red
China is."
"I'm an old China hand, and
I say there is no place called Red
China. The only China is locat
ed on the island of Formosa."
"What proof do we have that
there really is a country with
800,000,000 people in it, except
for the word of a few disgrun
tled Senators?" an Under Secre
tary demanded. "They're only
trying to discredit our foreign
policy anyway."
"There is no proof," a Far
East expert said, "except the
West Germans have announced
they plan to build a $150,000,000
steel mill there. I don't think
they'd put in that kind of money
if the country didn't exist."
Cloud Cover
The Secretary of State spoke
up. "That is a point. The only
thing I can't understand is how
we could have missed it all Ihese
years."
"Perhaps there is a cloud cov
er over it all the time," some
one suggested.
"Does the CIA have anything
on it?"
"No, sir. They're as much in
the dark as we are. The French,

the British, and the Canadians
have all reported that they be
lieve there is a Red China, but
the Russians now claim it isn't
there."
The old China hand spoke up.
"Mr. Secretary, I believe we're
only looking for trouble by fol
lowing up the rumor. We al
ready have a China. It's our
kind of China. Another China
would only mean trouble."
"But," said one of the other
men, "if the reports are true
that this land mass contains
800,000,000 people, won't we
have to deal with it sooner or
later? I think we should an
nounce that we don't believe
there is a Red China, but if
there is, we intend to contain
it, but not isolate it."
Forced Admittance
The Secretary of State said,
"That's a good phrase, 'contain
ment but not isolation.' I think
I'll use it in my next press con
ference. Our only problem is
that if we admit there is such
a place we might be forced to
admit her into the United Na
tions."
"Precisely, sir," a Secretary
spoke out. "Besides we've told
the American people for 17
years that there is no Red China.
If we admit there is a Red China
now, we would only confuse
them."
One of the advisors said, "Sev
enteen years ago the American
people didn't believe in flying
saucers, either. Perhaps we
could announce the existence of
Red China and flying saucers
at the same time."
