BALTIMORE (CPS) â€”John's
Hopkins University must be
pretty confused at this point.
When students requested a
meeting with administrators to
"promote understanding of pres
ent administration policies, for
mulate possible alternatives to
those policies and comprehend
the consequences of these altern
atives," they met with over
whelming response.
University President Milton S.
Eisenhower not only decided to
attend, but brought along five
deans, the registrar, the athletic
department chairman and the
school's head librarian.
Thirty-five students showed
up.
