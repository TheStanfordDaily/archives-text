# Your Guide to Some Jobs That Need Doing—In Asia, Africa, Latin America
## PEACE CORPS WORLD: 1966 FIFTH BIRTHDAY Brash Idea for Waging Peace Comes of Age 
### 
Derided in its infancy as a futile
attempt at international goodwill,
the Peace Corps observes its fifth
birthday this spring as an estab
lished force for world change that
has succeeded beyond .he dreams of
many of its supporters.
Testimonials to the increasing
potency of its globe-circling opera
tions come in a variety of ways,
among them:
■ Once ridiculed by detractors as
"Kennedy's Kiddie Corps," the
brash young organization has be
come the most widely copied organi
zation of its kind in the world.
Thirty nations in Europe, Latin
America. Asia and Africa have
created international or national
voluntary service agencies modeled
after the Peace Corps.
■ About 10,200 Volunteers are
now at work in 46 emerging na
tions, and the demand for them has
long exceeded the supply. As a re
sult, the requests of more than 20
nations for Volunteers have had to
be turned down.
Another measure of its effective

ness is that the Peace Corps, which
struggled in its early years to prove
that Americans could live abroad
without supermarkets, is now talk
ing about nation-building.
Nation-Building in Africa
This concept is seen most readily
in Africa, where in six nations more
than one-half of all high-school
teachers with college degrees are
Peace Corps Volunteers. In Nigeria
one out of three students — or
more than 50,000 a year — are
taught by Volunteers. In Malawi the
work of fewer than 200 Volunteer
teachers has enabled the government
to trip'e secondary school enroll
ment from 2.500 to 7.600.
In Latin America, Volunteers are
bringing a significant number of
people into a real relationship with
their own governments for the first
time. A Peace Corps educational tel
evision project in Colombia is mak
ing a deep impact on remote areas
and, in the process, revolutionizing
that nation's public education sys
tem.
In Chile, a credit union movement

spurred by Volunteer efforts is, ac
cording to one observer, "blooming
like wildflowers." Moderate interest
loans are now available for the first
time in many areas there.
Peace Corps health programs are
making life longer and more enjoy
able for large numbers of peoples
in the developing world. While
nurses and public health workers
have been attracted to Peace Corps
service from the beginning, doctors
have always been in short supply.
Doctor's Project
A breakthrough came in the sum
mer of 1965, when 17 doctors were
trained as a group in North Caro
lina and assigned to posts in seven
nations of Asia and Africa. It was
the largest group of Volunteer doc
tors ever trained together for service
overseas. The Peace Corps, in an
unprecedented move, allowed them
to take along their dependents. Ulti
mately, Peace Corps Director Sar
gent Shriver says, the agency's
overseas medical program should in
clude "at least 500 doctors."
But as the Peace Corps enters its
sixth year, it appears that the agency
may have its most important effects
on the United States itself — effects
transmitted through the returned
Volunteer.
18,000 Returned Volunteers
In a letter to a friend, a former
Peace Corpsnian once wrote: "The
thing about the Peace Corps is that
it doesn't end for you after two
years." In expressing a desire for
continued service and involvement,
this Volunteer was speaking for
most returned Peace Corpsmen.
As of January 1, 1966, more than
18,000 persons had received Peace
Corps training and more than 6,000
had succcsfully completed two years
of service as Volunteers. It is esti
mated that this number will reach
50,000 by 1970 and 200,000 by
1980.
Already the effect of returned
Volunteers is being felt in the na
tion's War on Poverty. More than
100 of them currently are engaged
in the U.S. Office of Economic Op
portunity anti-poverty program.
PCV Role Misunderstood
Despite the good showing, the
role of the Volunteer overseas is
often misunderstood. This is due in
part to the fact that the role is
unique, whether the Volunteer is
working in community development
in Latin America or teaching sixth
graders in Africa.
Overseas the Volunteer has loyal
ties both to his host country and to
the United States. He is a spokes
man for America and yet quite in
dependent. He works on his own;

sarium near Santo Domingo after last year's coup in the Dominican
Republic. At height of fighting she worked as hospital orderly

nized and given safe passage by both sides during the fighting.

some of which have not yet been formalized in text books.

ceed, then he must succeed. In ef

No 'ideological Guidelines"
As Peace Corps Deputy Director
Warren W. Wiggins says. "We do
not furnish ideological guidelines for
Volunteers. The Volunteer is an
American citizen whom we train,
place and supply."
The Volunteer overseas may help
build a bridge, teach school or or
ganize a cooperative, important
tasks in a developing nation. But
such work is not the fundamental
reason why a Volunteer is sent
abroad.
People in the developing world
are pushed down by malnutrition,
poverty, illiteracy and an inability
to take part in the management of
their own affairs. They need hope,
and that is what the Volunteer is
trained to provide. He does it by
imparting the knowledge, skills, at
titudes and values that combine to
create ability and desire to solve
problems.

■ About 10,200 Volunteers are
now at work in 46 emerging na
tions, and the demand for them has
long exceeded the supply. As a re
sult, the requests of more than 20
nations for Volunteers have had to
be turned down.
Another measure of its effective

ness is that the Peace Corps, which
struggled in its early years to prove
that Americans could live abroad
without supermarkets, is now talk
ing about nation-building.
Nation-Building in Africa
This concept is seen most readily
in Africa, where in six nations more
than one-half of all high-school
teachers with college degrees are
Peace Corps Volunteers. In Nigeria
one out of three students — or
more than 50,000 a year — are
taught by Volunteers. In Malawi the
work of fewer than 200 Volunteer
teachers has enabled the government
to trip'e secondary school enroll
ment from 2.500 to 7.600.
In Latin America, Volunteers are
bringing a significant number of
people into a real relationship with
their own governments for the first
time. A Peace Corps educational tel
evision project in Colombia is mak
ing a deep impact on remote areas
and, in the process, revolutionizing
that nation's public education sys
tem.
In Chile, a credit union movement

spurred by Volunteer efforts is, ac
cording to one observer, "blooming
like wildflowers." Moderate interest
loans are now available for the first
time in many areas there.
Peace Corps health programs are
making life longer and more enjoy
able for large numbers of peoples
in the developing world. While
nurses and public health workers
have been attracted to Peace Corps
service from the beginning, doctors
have always been in short supply.
Doctor's Project
A breakthrough came in the sum
mer of 1965, when 17 doctors were
trained as a group in North Caro
lina and assigned to posts in seven
nations of Asia and Africa. It was
the largest group of Volunteer doc
tors ever trained together for service
overseas. The Peace Corps, in an
unprecedented move, allowed them
to take along their dependents. Ulti
mately, Peace Corps Director Sar
gent Shriver says, the agency's
overseas medical program should in
clude "at least 500 doctors."
But as the Peace Corps enters its
sixth year, it appears that the agency
may have its most important effects
on the United States itself — effects
transmitted through the returned
Volunteer.
18,000 Returned Volunteers
In a letter to a friend, a former
Peace Corpsnian once wrote: "The
thing about the Peace Corps is that
it doesn't end for you after two
years." In expressing a desire for
continued service and involvement,
this Volunteer was speaking for
most returned Peace Corpsmen.
As of January 1, 1966, more than
18,000 persons had received Peace
Corps training and more than 6,000
had succcsfully completed two years
of service as Volunteers. It is esti
mated that this number will reach
50,000 by 1970 and 200,000 by
1980.
Already the effect of returned
Volunteers is being felt in the na
tion's War on Poverty. More than
100 of them currently are engaged
in the U.S. Office of Economic Op
portunity anti-poverty program.
PCV Role Misunderstood
Despite the good showing, the
role of the Volunteer overseas is
often misunderstood. This is due in
part to the fact that the role is
unique, whether the Volunteer is
working in community development
in Latin America or teaching sixth
graders in Africa.
Overseas the Volunteer has loyal
ties both to his host country and to
the United States. He is a spokes
man for America and yet quite in
dependent. He works on his own;

work of fewer than 200 Volunteer
teachers has enabled the government
to trip'e secondary school enroll
ment from 2.500 to 7.600.
In Latin America, Volunteers are
bringing a significant number of
people into a real relationship with
their own governments for the first
time. A Peace Corps educational tel
evision project in Colombia is mak
ing a deep impact on remote areas
and, in the process, revolutionizing
that nation's public education sys

In Chile, a credit union movement

spurred by Volunteer efforts is, ac

like wildflowers." Moderate interest
loans are now available for the first
time in many areas there.
Peace Corps health programs are
making life longer and more enjoy

nurses and public health workers

service from the beginning, doctors
have always been in short supply.
Doctor's Project
A breakthrough came in the sum
mer of 1965, when 17 doctors were
trained as a group in North Caro
lina and assigned to posts in seven
nations of Asia and Africa. It was
the largest group of Volunteer doc
tors ever trained together for service
overseas. The Peace Corps, in an
unprecedented move, allowed them
to take along their dependents. Ulti
mately, Peace Corps Director Sar
gent Shriver says, the agency's
overseas medical program should in
clude "at least 500 doctors."
But as the Peace Corps enters its
sixth year, it appears that the agency
may have its most important effects
on the United States itself — effects
transmitted through the returned
Volunteer.
18,000 Returned Volunteers
In a letter to a friend, a former
Peace Corpsnian once wrote: "The
thing about the Peace Corps is that
it doesn't end for you after two
years." In expressing a desire for
continued service and involvement,
this Volunteer was speaking for
most returned Peace Corpsmen.
As of January 1, 1966, more than
18,000 persons had received Peace
Corps training and more than 6,000
had succcsfully completed two years
of service as Volunteers. It is esti
mated that this number will reach
50,000 by 1970 and 200,000 by
1980.
Already the effect of returned
Volunteers is being felt in the na
tion's War on Poverty. More than
100 of them currently are engaged
in the U.S. Office of Economic Op
portunity anti-poverty program.
PCV Role Misunderstood
Despite the good showing, the
role of the Volunteer overseas is
often misunderstood. This is due in
part to the fact that the role is
unique, whether the Volunteer is
working in community development
in Latin America or teaching sixth
graders in Africa.
Overseas the Volunteer has loyal
ties both to his host country and to
the United States. He is a spokes
man for America and yet quite in
dependent. He works on his own;

The Volunteer overseas may help
build a bridge, teach school or or
ganize a cooperative, important
tasks in a developing nation. But
such work is not the fundamental
reason why a Volunteer is sent
abroad.
People in the developing world
are pushed down by malnutrition,
poverty, illiteracy and an inability
to take part in the management of
their own affairs. They need hope,
and that is what the Volunteer is
trained to provide. He does it by
imparting the knowledge, skills, at
titudes and values that combine to
create ability and desire to solve
problems.
Derided in its infancy as a futile
attempt at international goodwill,
the Peace Corps observes its fifth
birthday this spring as an estab

has succeeded beyond .he dreams of
many of its supporters.
Testimonials to the increasing
potency of its globe-circling opera
tions come in a variety of ways,
among them:
■ Once ridiculed by detractors as
"Kennedy's Kiddie Corps," the
brash young organization has be
come the most widely copied organi
zation of its kind in the world.
Thirty nations in Europe, Latin
America. Asia and Africa have
created international or national
voluntary service agencies modeled
after the Peace Corps.
■ About 10,200 Volunteers are
now at work in 46 emerging na
tions, and the demand for them has
long exceeded the supply. As a re
sult, the requests of more than 20
nations for Volunteers have had to
be turned down.
Another measure of its effective

ness is that the Peace Corps, which
struggled in its early years to prove
that Americans could live abroad
without supermarkets, is now talk
ing about nation-building.
Nation-Building in Africa
This concept is seen most readily
in Africa, where in six nations more
than one-half of all high-school
teachers with college degrees are
Peace Corps Volunteers. In Nigeria
one out of three students — or
more than 50,000 a year — are
taught by Volunteers. In Malawi the
