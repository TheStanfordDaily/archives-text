In an era of the non-university, the Peace Corps has the non-
Volunteer. The "image" Volunteer seems to exist only in the mind
of the public; Peace Corpsmen find such consensus misleading if not
mythological. What a Volunteer does and what overseas experience
does to him are widely varying and completely individual matters.
It is impossible to say "this is what it's like." At best, a description
of the Peace Corps Forest comes from a collection of viewpoints
from the individual Volunteer Trees:

"l claim we joined the Peace

for themselves; that only the people
can identify the problems that are
basic for them, and that the only
lasting solutions are those that peo

high flown ideals and occasionally
shatter them. It becomes a feat
to concentrate on existing. But
ideals really don't get lost . . . they
turn up when an awfully bad kid
finally shapes up or an insolent
teenage girl hugs you and says
'thanks.' If I'm still here next
year, it will be because there is a
challenge, a reason."
