# THE 						INDIVIDUAL
## Iconoclasts: Trees Do Not A Forest Create 
### 
In an era of the non-university, the Peace Corps has the non-
Volunteer. The "image" Volunteer seems to exist only in the mind
of the public; Peace Corpsmen find such consensus misleading if not
mythological. What a Volunteer does and what overseas experience
does to him are widely varying and completely individual matters.
It is impossible to say "this is what it's like." At best, a description
of the Peace Corps Forest comes from a collection of viewpoints
from the individual Volunteer Trees:

"l claim we joined the Peace
Corps because it represented a new
form of action ... a belief in the
dignity and worth of individual
human beings against all that would
oppress them; a faith that the right
decisions are those that people make
for themselves; that only the people
can identify the problems that are
basic for them, and that the only
lasting solutions are those that peo
ple work out for themselves."
—Cieorße Johnson, Princeton, 1959,
Tanzania
"It's my world and I am responsi
ble for it and therefore I wanted
to become involved — Not just to
sit behind a desk in the states, make
money and go skiing on weekends."
—Kill Cull, University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, 1963, Malaysia
"I'm sure that my goals — those
first thoughts — have changed at
least fifty times. I say changed, but
I mean shifted, or grown, or 'ma
tured' . . . modified by realism over
coming idealism. Experience, adap
tation. and realization hammer away
high flown ideals and occasionally
shatter them. It becomes a feat
to concentrate on existing. But
ideals really don't get lost . . . they
turn up when an awfully bad kid
finally shapes up or an insolent
teenage girl hugs you and says
'thanks.' If I'm still here next
year, it will be because there is a
challenge, a reason."
—Carol Fincran, Southeastern Col
lege, 1964, Venezuela
"I live in a picturesque bamboo
mat house I built myself. I buy
my water from a picturesque boy
with a burro loaded down with
water cans. I read and write under
a kerosene lantern, sleep on a cot
and cook on a camp stove. But
there comes the day when all this
suddenly becomes furiously frustrat
ing and you want like crazy just to
get out and go home."
—Tom Carter. Portland State Col
lege, Peru
"This is the hardest thing I've ever
done. Absolutely nothing is famil
iar and I often feel totally alone —
the physical difficulties actually help,
as they take my mind off myself and
the feeling of suddenly being cut off
from the rest of the world. You
cannot imagine the gulf between
East and West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected
to bridge it with a smile and a
handshake."
—Patricia MacDermott, Manhattan
ville. Philippines

"Our original excitement and en
thusiasm have been somewhat temp
ered by a year here. We have come
to realize that change comes so
slowly that progress, if it comes at
all, seems imperceptible. The eager
ness is replaced by colder ways of
looking at the world, and the youth
ful vigor and idealism become hard
ened with a day-to-day job. We
can never again become the peo
ple we were before we came to
Africa. But then, we would not
want to."
—Hayward Allen, University of Col
orado, 1960, Ethiopia
"What we need is a philosophy —
not of high adventure a la Conrad
or St. Exupery — but of dullness;
a philosophy which will satisfy our
craving for accomplishment and a
certain nobility while we are faced
with tedium, fatigue and the desire
to sit down and dream."
—John Hatch. Queens College,
Ivory Coast

"I do not wish to imply that we
'won them over': indeed, I think
they won us over in the final an
alysis. It's just that the intransigence
of our preconceptions of ourselves
and others generally dissolved into
a kind of affectionate confusion."
—David Schickele, Swarthmore,
1958, Nigeria
"This is probably the most beau
tiful place on earth . . . But after
you've been here a while you find
something much more beautiful than
rice paddies and groves of rubber
trees ... It is a very basic joy with
life that I wish I could take back
and inject into America."'
—Da>id Roseborough. University of
lulsa. 1962. Malaysia
"We are the sons and daughters of
America. But we are also sons and
daughters of 1.000 towns and vil
lages around the world."

In an era of the non-university, the Peace Corps has the non-
Volunteer. The "image" Volunteer seems to exist only in the mind
of the public; Peace Corpsmen find such consensus misleading if not
mythological. What a Volunteer does and what overseas experience
does to him are widely varying and completely individual matters.
It is impossible to say "this is what it's like." At best, a description
of the Peace Corps Forest comes from a collection of viewpoints
from the individual Volunteer Trees:

"l claim we joined the Peace
Corps because it represented a new
form of action ... a belief in the
dignity and worth of individual
human beings against all that would
oppress them; a faith that the right
decisions are those that people make
for themselves; that only the people
can identify the problems that are
basic for them, and that the only
lasting solutions are those that peo
ple work out for themselves."

"It's my world and I am responsi

"I'm sure that my goals — those
first thoughts — have changed at
least fifty times. I say changed, but
I mean shifted, or grown, or 'ma
tured' . . . modified by realism over
coming idealism. Experience, adap
tation. and realization hammer away
high flown ideals and occasionally
shatter them. It becomes a feat
to concentrate on existing. But
ideals really don't get lost . . . they
turn up when an awfully bad kid
finally shapes up or an insolent
teenage girl hugs you and says
'thanks.' If I'm still here next
year, it will be because there is a
challenge, a reason."

"I live in a picturesque bamboo
mat house I built myself. I buy
my water from a picturesque boy
with a burro loaded down with
water cans. I read and write under
a kerosene lantern, sleep on a cot
and cook on a camp stove. But
there comes the day when all this
suddenly becomes furiously frustrat

get out and go home."

"This is the hardest thing I've ever
done. Absolutely nothing is famil

the physical difficulties actually help,
as they take my mind off myself and
the feeling of suddenly being cut off

cannot imagine the gulf between
East and West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected
to bridge it with a smile and a

—Patricia MacDermott, Manhattan

"Our original excitement and en
thusiasm have been somewhat temp
ered by a year here. We have come
to realize that change comes so
slowly that progress, if it comes at
all, seems imperceptible. The eager
ness is replaced by colder ways of

water cans. I read and write under
a kerosene lantern, sleep on a cot
and cook on a camp stove. But
there comes the day when all this
suddenly becomes furiously frustrat

get out and go home."

"This is the hardest thing I've ever
done. Absolutely nothing is famil
iar and I often feel totally alone —
the physical difficulties actually help,
as they take my mind off myself and
the feeling of suddenly being cut off
from the rest of the world. You
cannot imagine the gulf between
East and West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected
to bridge it with a smile and a
handshake."
—Patricia MacDermott, Manhattan

"Our original excitement and en
thusiasm have been somewhat temp
ered by a year here. We have come
to realize that change comes so
slowly that progress, if it comes at
all, seems imperceptible. The eager
ness is replaced by colder ways of
looking at the world, and the youth
ful vigor and idealism become hard
ened with a day-to-day job. We
can never again become the peo
ple we were before we came to
Africa. But then, we would not
want to."
—Hayward Allen, University of Col
orado, 1960, Ethiopia
"What we need is a philosophy —
not of high adventure a la Conrad
or St. Exupery — but of dullness;
a philosophy which will satisfy our
craving for accomplishment and a
certain nobility while we are faced
with tedium, fatigue and the desire
to sit down and dream."
—John Hatch. Queens College,

"I do not wish to imply that we
'won them over': indeed, I think
they won us over in the final an
alysis. It's just that the intransigence
of our preconceptions of ourselves
and others generally dissolved into
a kind of affectionate confusion."
—David Schickele, Swarthmore,
1958, Nigeria
"This is probably the most beau
tiful place on earth . . . But after
you've been here a while you find
something much more beautiful than
rice paddies and groves of rubber
trees ... It is a very basic joy with
life that I wish I could take back
and inject into America."'

In an era of the non-university, the Peace Corps has the non-
Volunteer. The "image" Volunteer seems to exist only in the mind
of the public; Peace Corpsmen find such consensus misleading if not
mythological. What a Volunteer does and what overseas experience
does to him are widely varying and completely individual matters.
It is impossible to say "this is what it's like." At best, a description
of the Peace Corps Forest comes from a collection of viewpoints
from the individual Volunteer Trees:

"l claim we joined the Peace
Corps because it represented a new
form of action ... a belief in the
dignity and worth of individual
human beings against all that would
oppress them; a faith that the right
decisions are those that people make
for themselves; that only the people
can identify the problems that are
basic for them, and that the only
lasting solutions are those that peo
ple work out for themselves."
—Cieorße Johnson, Princeton, 1959,
Tanzania
"It's my world and I am responsi
ble for it and therefore I wanted
to become involved — Not just to
sit behind a desk in the states, make
money and go skiing on weekends."
—Kill Cull, University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, 1963, Malaysia
"I'm sure that my goals — those
first thoughts — have changed at
least fifty times. I say changed, but
I mean shifted, or grown, or 'ma
tured' . . . modified by realism over
coming idealism. Experience, adap
tation. and realization hammer away
high flown ideals and occasionally
shatter them. It becomes a feat
to concentrate on existing. But
ideals really don't get lost . . . they
turn up when an awfully bad kid
finally shapes up or an insolent
teenage girl hugs you and says
'thanks.' If I'm still here next
year, it will be because there is a
challenge, a reason."
—Carol Fincran, Southeastern Col
lege, 1964, Venezuela
