# TRADITION: 'They Laughed When We Sat Down at the World'
## 
### 
At 2 a.m. on October 14, 1960,
on the steps of the University of
Michigan's Student Union Building
in Ann Arbor, history's lightning
struck sparks that were to become
visible around the world.
Today an engraved plaque on a
front wall of the building calls atten
tion to the fact that at that time
and place John F. Kennedy first
publicly mentioned the idea of a
Peace Corps and defined its aims.
Kennedy, then nearing the end of
his successful candidacy for Presi
dent, had just flown into Michigan
from New York. As his motorcade
made its way from the airport to
Ann Arbor, it became evident that
a large crowd of students had waited
up to see and hear him. The caravan
was greeted at the university by an
audience estimated at 10,000.
Speaking extemporaneously from
the steps of the Student Union,
Kennedy asked:
"How many of you are willing to
spend 10 years in Africa or Latin
America or Asia working for the
U.S. and working for freedom? How
many of you (who) are going to be
doctors are willing to spend your
days in Ghana? ... On your willing
ness to do that, not merely to serve
one or two years in the service, but
on your willingness to contribute
part of your life to this country, I
think, will depend the answer
whether we as a free society can
compete."
Impetus for the formation of a

national, secular organization of
volunteers devoted to overseas serv
ice came from several quarters.
Vice President Hubert H. Humph
rey, then a senator from Minnesota,
had given the idea an early boost
by submitting a Peace Corps bill in
the summer of 1960. But it was not
until a speech in San Francisco dur
ing the waning days of the presiden
tial campaign — November 2.
that John F. Kennedy sounded
the note that reverberated through
the American mind.
Kennedy's campaign pledge to
send "the best Americans we can
get to speak for our country abroad"
caused an instantaneous stir across
the nation. Mail cascaded into
Washinaton. One of the first things

the new President Kennedy did after
taking office was to direct his
brother-in-law Sargent Shriver to
determine whether foreign govern
ments were interested in receiving
Volunteers.
Organizational work went ahead
quickly after reports came back
from Asia and Africa that Volun
teers, in surprisingly large numbers,
would be welcome. The Peace Corps
was established by Executive Order
on March 1, 1961.
The idea was not without its
critics. As one agency executive puts
it. "They laughed when we sat down
at the world to play . . And like
the famed advertising slogan about
the man who surprised one and all
with his new found talent at the
piano, some of the Peace Corps
most vocal critics became avid
boosters.
Final legislation providing for a
permanent organization was signed
by President Kennedy on September
22, 1961.
The legislation appropriated $32
million to run the agency in its first
full fiscal year—July 1. 1961, through
June 30, 1962 (the budget is now
$115 million). At the same time
Congress added to the basic Peace
Corps Act these three goals:
1. To help the people of develop
ing nations meet their needs for
trained manpower.
2. To help promote a better un
derstanding of other peoples on the
part of the American people.

3. To help promote a better un
derstanding of the American people
on the part of the peoples served.
In mid-1961 Lyndon B. Johnson,
then Vice President, was named the
first chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, which is
made up of outstanding Americans
who meet twice a year to review
Peace Corps programs and policies.
He held the post until January 26,
1965, when he named Vice Presi
dent Humphrey as his successor on
the council, assuring continued Ad
ministration support of the Peace
Corps.
On August 30, 1961, the first
group of Volunteers to go abroad
arrived in Ghana. At the end of

1961 there were 614 Volunteers in
13 countries.
In some nations, the arriving Vol
unteers were greeted with shouts of
"Go home. Yankees." Such taunts
usually have been replaced by the
request, "Send us some more Peace
Corps Volunteers."
In nations long cynical about the
motives of the great world powers,
the Peace Corps approach was re
freshing.
By June 1962, more than 1.000
Volunteers were at work in 15 coun
tries, and nearly 3,000 were in train
ing. Agreements for Volunteers had
been reached with 37 countries.
By June 30, 1963, there were
about 4.000 Volunteers overseas in
more than 40 countries, with an
other 2.000 in training. A year later
more than 6,000 were at work over
seas and another 4,000 were in
training. In three years the Peace
Corps had evolved from a promising
idea to a considerable force for
assistance and incentive in 44 devel
oping countries.
In some nations the Peace Corps
has been responsible for the very
changes that now require it to ex
pand even further. In others, natural
evolution has enlarged Peace Corps
responsibilities. The Corps now has
more than 12.000 Volunteers. To
meet its growing responsibilities, it
hopes to have about 15.000 by the
end of the year.
The waiting list of nations re
questing Volunteers now exceeds 20.


EARLY SUPPORTER — President Johnson, seen here welcoming Volunteers at White
House ceremony, was first chairman of Peace Corps National Advisory Council (post
now held by Vice President Humphrey) .With President above are, from left, Californ

Miss Brown returned from Philippines to join unique Peace Corps teaching project at
Cardozo High School in Washington, D. C. Miss Orth helped build a school in Medellin,
Colombia. Citizens named the school after her and held a fiesta in her honor.

Corps Act these three goals:
1. To help the people of develop
ing nations meet their needs for
trained manpower.
2. To help promote a better un
derstanding of other peoples on the
part of the American people.

3. To help promote a better un

on the part of the peoples served.
In mid-1961 Lyndon B. Johnson,
then Vice President, was named the
first chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, which is
made up of outstanding Americans
who meet twice a year to review
Peace Corps programs and policies.
He held the post until January 26,
1965, when he named Vice Presi
dent Humphrey as his successor on
the council, assuring continued Ad
ministration support of the Peace
Corps.
On August 30, 1961, the first
group of Volunteers to go abroad
arrived in Ghana. At the end of

1961 there were 614 Volunteers in
13 countries.
In some nations, the arriving Vol
unteers were greeted with shouts of
"Go home. Yankees." Such taunts
usually have been replaced by the
request, "Send us some more Peace
Corps Volunteers."
In nations long cynical about the
motives of the great world powers,
the Peace Corps approach was re
freshing.
By June 1962, more than 1.000
Volunteers were at work in 15 coun
tries, and nearly 3,000 were in train
ing. Agreements for Volunteers had
been reached with 37 countries.
By June 30, 1963, there were
about 4.000 Volunteers overseas in
more than 40 countries, with an
other 2.000 in training. A year later
more than 6,000 were at work over
seas and another 4,000 were in
training. In three years the Peace
Corps had evolved from a promising
idea to a considerable force for
assistance and incentive in 44 devel
oping countries.
In some nations the Peace Corps
has been responsible for the very
changes that now require it to ex
pand even further. In others, natural
evolution has enlarged Peace Corps
responsibilities. The Corps now has
more than 12.000 Volunteers. To
meet its growing responsibilities, it
hopes to have about 15.000 by the
end of the year.
The waiting list of nations re
questing Volunteers now exceeds 20.

At 2 a.m. on October 14, 1960,
on the steps of the University of
Michigan's Student Union Building
in Ann Arbor, history's lightning
struck sparks that were to become
visible around the world.
Today an engraved plaque on a
front wall of the building calls atten
tion to the fact that at that time
and place John F. Kennedy first
publicly mentioned the idea of a
Peace Corps and defined its aims.
Kennedy, then nearing the end of
his successful candidacy for Presi
dent, had just flown into Michigan
from New York. As his motorcade
made its way from the airport to
Ann Arbor, it became evident that
a large crowd of students had waited
up to see and hear him. The caravan
was greeted at the university by an
audience estimated at 10,000.
Speaking extemporaneously from
the steps of the Student Union,
Kennedy asked:
"How many of you are willing to
spend 10 years in Africa or Latin
America or Asia working for the
U.S. and working for freedom? How
many of you (who) are going to be
doctors are willing to spend your
days in Ghana? ... On your willing
ness to do that, not merely to serve
one or two years in the service, but
on your willingness to contribute
part of your life to this country, I
think, will depend the answer
whether we as a free society can
compete."
Impetus for the formation of a

national, secular organization of
volunteers devoted to overseas serv
ice came from several quarters.
Vice President Hubert H. Humph
rey, then a senator from Minnesota,
had given the idea an early boost
by submitting a Peace Corps bill in
the summer of 1960. But it was not
until a speech in San Francisco dur
ing the waning days of the presiden
tial campaign — November 2.
that John F. Kennedy sounded
the note that reverberated through
the American mind.
Kennedy's campaign pledge to
send "the best Americans we can
get to speak for our country abroad"
caused an instantaneous stir across
the nation. Mail cascaded into
Washinaton. One of the first things

the new President Kennedy did after
taking office was to direct his
brother-in-law Sargent Shriver to
determine whether foreign govern
ments were interested in receiving
Volunteers.
Organizational work went ahead
quickly after reports came back
from Asia and Africa that Volun
teers, in surprisingly large numbers,
would be welcome. The Peace Corps
was established by Executive Order
on March 1, 1961.
The idea was not without its
critics. As one agency executive puts
it. "They laughed when we sat down
at the world to play . . And like
the famed advertising slogan about
the man who surprised one and all
with his new found talent at the
piano, some of the Peace Corps
most vocal critics became avid
boosters.
Final legislation providing for a
permanent organization was signed
by President Kennedy on September
22, 1961.
The legislation appropriated $32
million to run the agency in its first
full fiscal year—July 1. 1961, through
June 30, 1962 (the budget is now
$115 million). At the same time
Congress added to the basic Peace

At 2 a.m. on October 14, 1960,
on the steps of the University of
Michigan's Student Union Building
in Ann Arbor, history's lightning
struck sparks that were to become
visible around the world.
Today an engraved plaque on a
front wall of the building calls atten
tion to the fact that at that time
and place John F. Kennedy first
publicly mentioned the idea of a
Peace Corps and defined its aims.
Kennedy, then nearing the end of
his successful candidacy for Presi
dent, had just flown into Michigan
from New York. As his motorcade
made its way from the airport to
Ann Arbor, it became evident that
a large crowd of students had waited
up to see and hear him. The caravan
was greeted at the university by an
audience estimated at 10,000.
Speaking extemporaneously from
the steps of the Student Union,
Kennedy asked:
"How many of you are willing to
spend 10 years in Africa or Latin
America or Asia working for the
U.S. and working for freedom? How
many of you (who) are going to be
doctors are willing to spend your
days in Ghana? ... On your willing
ness to do that, not merely to serve
one or two years in the service, but
on your willingness to contribute
part of your life to this country, I
think, will depend the answer
whether we as a free society can
compete."
Impetus for the formation of a

national, secular organization of
volunteers devoted to overseas serv
ice came from several quarters.
Vice President Hubert H. Humph
rey, then a senator from Minnesota,
had given the idea an early boost
by submitting a Peace Corps bill in
the summer of 1960. But it was not
until a speech in San Francisco dur
ing the waning days of the presiden
tial campaign — November 2.
that John F. Kennedy sounded
the note that reverberated through
the American mind.
Kennedy's campaign pledge to
send "the best Americans we can
get to speak for our country abroad"
caused an instantaneous stir across
the nation. Mail cascaded into
Washinaton. One of the first things

the new President Kennedy did after
taking office was to direct his
brother-in-law Sargent Shriver to
determine whether foreign govern
ments were interested in receiving
Volunteers.
Organizational work went ahead
quickly after reports came back
from Asia and Africa that Volun
teers, in surprisingly large numbers,
would be welcome. The Peace Corps
was established by Executive Order
on March 1, 1961.
The idea was not without its
critics. As one agency executive puts
it. "They laughed when we sat down
at the world to play . . And like
the famed advertising slogan about
the man who surprised one and all
with his new found talent at the
piano, some of the Peace Corps
most vocal critics became avid
boosters.
Final legislation providing for a
permanent organization was signed
by President Kennedy on September
22, 1961.
The legislation appropriated $32
million to run the agency in its first
full fiscal year—July 1. 1961, through
June 30, 1962 (the budget is now
$115 million). At the same time
Congress added to the basic Peace
Corps Act these three goals:
1. To help the people of develop
ing nations meet their needs for
trained manpower.
2. To help promote a better un
derstanding of other peoples on the
part of the American people.

3. To help promote a better un
derstanding of the American people
on the part of the peoples served.
In mid-1961 Lyndon B. Johnson,
then Vice President, was named the
first chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, which is
made up of outstanding Americans
who meet twice a year to review
Peace Corps programs and policies.
He held the post until January 26,
1965, when he named Vice Presi
dent Humphrey as his successor on
the council, assuring continued Ad
ministration support of the Peace
Corps.
On August 30, 1961, the first
group of Volunteers to go abroad
arrived in Ghana. At the end of

1961 there were 614 Volunteers in
13 countries.
In some nations, the arriving Vol
unteers were greeted with shouts of
"Go home. Yankees." Such taunts
usually have been replaced by the
request, "Send us some more Peace
Corps Volunteers."
In nations long cynical about the
motives of the great world powers,
the Peace Corps approach was re
freshing.
By June 1962, more than 1.000
Volunteers were at work in 15 coun
tries, and nearly 3,000 were in train
ing. Agreements for Volunteers had
been reached with 37 countries.
By June 30, 1963, there were
about 4.000 Volunteers overseas in
more than 40 countries, with an
other 2.000 in training. A year later
more than 6,000 were at work over
seas and another 4,000 were in
training. In three years the Peace
Corps had evolved from a promising
idea to a considerable force for
assistance and incentive in 44 devel
oping countries.
In some nations the Peace Corps
has been responsible for the very
changes that now require it to ex
pand even further. In others, natural
evolution has enlarged Peace Corps
responsibilities. The Corps now has
more than 12.000 Volunteers. To
meet its growing responsibilities, it
hopes to have about 15.000 by the
end of the year.
The waiting list of nations re
questing Volunteers now exceeds 20.

the man who surprised one and all
with his new found talent at the
piano, some of the Peace Corps
most vocal critics became avid
boosters.
Final legislation providing for a
permanent organization was signed
by President Kennedy on September
22, 1961.
The legislation appropriated $32
million to run the agency in its first
full fiscal year—July 1. 1961, through
June 30, 1962 (the budget is now
$115 million). At the same time
Congress added to the basic Peace
Corps Act these three goals:
1. To help the people of develop
ing nations meet their needs for
trained manpower.
2. To help promote a better un
derstanding of other peoples on the
part of the American people.

3. To help promote a better un
derstanding of the American people
on the part of the peoples served.
In mid-1961 Lyndon B. Johnson,
then Vice President, was named the
first chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, which is
made up of outstanding Americans
who meet twice a year to review
Peace Corps programs and policies.
He held the post until January 26,
1965, when he named Vice Presi
dent Humphrey as his successor on
the council, assuring continued Ad
ministration support of the Peace
Corps.
On August 30, 1961, the first
group of Volunteers to go abroad
arrived in Ghana. At the end of

1961 there were 614 Volunteers in
13 countries.
In some nations, the arriving Vol
unteers were greeted with shouts of
"Go home. Yankees." Such taunts
usually have been replaced by the
request, "Send us some more Peace
Corps Volunteers."
In nations long cynical about the
motives of the great world powers,
the Peace Corps approach was re
freshing.
By June 1962, more than 1.000
Volunteers were at work in 15 coun
tries, and nearly 3,000 were in train
ing. Agreements for Volunteers had
been reached with 37 countries.
By June 30, 1963, there were
about 4.000 Volunteers overseas in
more than 40 countries, with an
other 2.000 in training. A year later
more than 6,000 were at work over
seas and another 4,000 were in
training. In three years the Peace
Corps had evolved from a promising
idea to a considerable force for
assistance and incentive in 44 devel
oping countries.
In some nations the Peace Corps
has been responsible for the very
changes that now require it to ex
pand even further. In others, natural
evolution has enlarged Peace Corps
responsibilities. The Corps now has
more than 12.000 Volunteers. To
meet its growing responsibilities, it
hopes to have about 15.000 by the
end of the year.
The waiting list of nations re
questing Volunteers now exceeds 20.

VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY
Submitted First PC Bill
At 2 a.m. on October 14, 1960,
on the steps of the University of
Michigan's Student Union Building
in Ann Arbor, history's lightning
struck sparks that were to become
visible around the world.
Today an engraved plaque on a
front wall of the building calls atten
tion to the fact that at that time
and place John F. Kennedy first
publicly mentioned the idea of a
Peace Corps and defined its aims.
Kennedy, then nearing the end of
his successful candidacy for Presi
dent, had just flown into Michigan
from New York. As his motorcade
made its way from the airport to
Ann Arbor, it became evident that
a large crowd of students had waited
up to see and hear him. The caravan
was greeted at the university by an
audience estimated at 10,000.
Speaking extemporaneously from
the steps of the Student Union,
Kennedy asked:
"How many of you are willing to
spend 10 years in Africa or Latin
America or Asia working for the
U.S. and working for freedom? How
many of you (who) are going to be
doctors are willing to spend your
days in Ghana? ... On your willing
ness to do that, not merely to serve
one or two years in the service, but
on your willingness to contribute
part of your life to this country, I
think, will depend the answer
whether we as a free society can
compete."
Impetus for the formation of a

national, secular organization of
volunteers devoted to overseas serv
ice came from several quarters.
Vice President Hubert H. Humph
rey, then a senator from Minnesota,
had given the idea an early boost
by submitting a Peace Corps bill in
the summer of 1960. But it was not
until a speech in San Francisco dur
ing the waning days of the presiden
tial campaign — November 2.
that John F. Kennedy sounded
the note that reverberated through
the American mind.
Kennedy's campaign pledge to
send "the best Americans we can
get to speak for our country abroad"
caused an instantaneous stir across
the nation. Mail cascaded into
Washinaton. One of the first things

the new President Kennedy did after
taking office was to direct his
brother-in-law Sargent Shriver to
determine whether foreign govern
ments were interested in receiving
Volunteers.
Organizational work went ahead
quickly after reports came back
from Asia and Africa that Volun
teers, in surprisingly large numbers,
would be welcome. The Peace Corps
was established by Executive Order
on March 1, 1961.
The idea was not without its
critics. As one agency executive puts
it. "They laughed when we sat down
at the world to play . . And like
the famed advertising slogan about
the man who surprised one and all
with his new found talent at the
piano, some of the Peace Corps
most vocal critics became avid
boosters.
