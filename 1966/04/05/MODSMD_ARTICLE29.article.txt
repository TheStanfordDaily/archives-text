# EDUCATION: How to Melt Freud's Ice Cap
## 
### 
What we found wrong with a lot
of early Peace Corps training, based
on reports from returned Volun
teers, was that it contained "too
many lectures, too much one-way
instruction and too little direct
experience."
That statement by Harris Wof
ford, Peace Corps Associate Di
rector for Planning, Evaluation and
Research, marks the main thrust of
a new Education Task Force.
It's purpose: to make Peace Corps
training more like the overseas real
ity and less like a mere extension
of classroom education.
"Freedom and responsibility are
what Volunteers generally find over
seas," notes Wofford, who heads the
Task Force. "But for some of the
most unstructured jobs in the world
we have put together some of the
most structured training programs."
He says Freud's description of
child-rearing has applied to much
of Peace Corps training: "We train
them for the tropics and send them
to the polar ice cap."
The Education Task Force is de
signing new 1966 programs that
will concentrate on starting proc

esses of learning that will con
tinue overseas, instead of trying
to cram facts into Volunteers' heads
during statewide classroom sessions.
The Task Force has recommended
that even more of the training take

place outside the college campus, in
radically unfamiliar environments:
shims or rural areas or Job Corps
camps, or in other cultures such as
Puetto Rico, or in the foreign coun
tries themselves.

Many ingredients of these pro
grams have already been success
fully demonstrated:
■ at the Peace Corps' own train
ing centers in Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands;

■ in an experimental program at
St. John's College at Annapolis
where the seminar was the main
form of instruction and field exper
ience was provided through six
weeks on kihhut:in\ in Israel;
■ in a program at the University
of Wisconsin largely designed and
run by former Volunteers from
India.
The Peace Corps' new Advance
Training program is a special area
for innovation. (See story at left.)
Another idea promoted by the
Task Force is that of accreditation
of Peace Corps service as part of a
university education.
Five-year B. A. programs, which
include two years of Peace Corps
service, have been instituted at the
University of Western Michigan
and Franconia (N. H) College
Credit towards a master's degree in
education is being given by Michi
gan State University to Volunteers
uho teach in Nigeria, and the Uni
versity of Missouri will give credit
towards a master's degree in com
munity development for Volunteers
in Peru.

of Peace Corps training: "We train
them for the tropics and send them
to the polar ice cap."
The Education Task Force is de
signing new 1966 programs that
will concentrate on starting proc

esses of learning that will con
tinue overseas, instead of trying
to cram facts into Volunteers' heads
during statewide classroom sessions.
The Task Force has recommended
that even more of the training take

place outside the college campus, in
radically unfamiliar environments:
shims or rural areas or Job Corps
camps, or in other cultures such as
Puetto Rico, or in the foreign coun
tries themselves.

Many ingredients of these pro
grams have already been success
fully demonstrated:
■ at the Peace Corps' own train
ing centers in Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands;

■ in an experimental program at
St. John's College at Annapolis
where the seminar was the main
form of instruction and field exper
ience was provided through six
weeks on kihhut:in\ in Israel;
■ in a program at the University
of Wisconsin largely designed and
run by former Volunteers from
India.
The Peace Corps' new Advance
Training program is a special area
for innovation. (See story at left.)
Another idea promoted by the
Task Force is that of accreditation
of Peace Corps service as part of a
university education.
Five-year B. A. programs, which
include two years of Peace Corps
service, have been instituted at the
University of Western Michigan
and Franconia (N. H) College
Credit towards a master's degree in
education is being given by Michi
gan State University to Volunteers
uho teach in Nigeria, and the Uni
versity of Missouri will give credit
towards a master's degree in com
munity development for Volunteers
in Peru.
What we found wrong with a lot
of early Peace Corps training, based
on reports from returned Volun
teers, was that it contained "too
many lectures, too much one-way
instruction and too little direct
experience."
That statement by Harris Wof
ford, Peace Corps Associate Di
rector for Planning, Evaluation and
Research, marks the main thrust of
a new Education Task Force.
It's purpose: to make Peace Corps
training more like the overseas real
ity and less like a mere extension
of classroom education.
"Freedom and responsibility are
what Volunteers generally find over
seas," notes Wofford, who heads the
Task Force. "But for some of the
most unstructured jobs in the world
we have put together some of the
most structured training programs."
He says Freud's description of
child-rearing has applied to much
of Peace Corps training: "We train
them for the tropics and send them
to the polar ice cap."
