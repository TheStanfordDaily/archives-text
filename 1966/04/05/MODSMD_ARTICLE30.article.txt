# Junior Year Program Enlarged for '66
## 
### 
The Peace Corps is expanding its
training program for college juniors.
Jules Pagano. Peace Corps training
operations director, has announced
that 1.000 juniors will begin the
Advance Training Program this
summer.
The program enables future Vol
unteers to integrate Peace Corps
training and their senior year of
college, with benefits on both sides,
"it gives us 15 months to prepare
the Volunteer for his assignment in
stead of the normal three." Pagano
said.
The ATP was begun in the sum
mer of 1964. when 200 college
juniors entered training for assign

ments that began in September 1965.
They trained the first summer at
United States universities, continued
their preparation independently dur
ing their senior year of school and
completed training in special field
programs the summer of 1965.
The Peace Corps has a loan fund
for A I P enrollees to he'p cover the
loss of income otherwise gained
from summer employment. Trainees
may borrow up to $600 at low
interest rates to pay expenses during
their final year in school.
ATP was developed as a solution
to the increasing difficulty of pre
paring Volunteers for certain assign
ments. Some Peace Corps Volun

teers must learn two languages to
handle their work effectively, such
as teachers bound for French-speak
ing Africa where various African
languages are spoken as well as the
official French.
Some ATP enrollees trained for
West Africa at Dartmouth College
in the summer of 1964. The next
summer they trained in Quebec
Province. Canada, where they lived
with French-speaking families and
practice-taught French-speaking stu
dents.
Juniors qualified to enter AIP
next summer will train for assign
mcnts in 16 countries.
