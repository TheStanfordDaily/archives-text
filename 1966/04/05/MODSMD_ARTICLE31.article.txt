# MAKING OF A PCV
## Field Experience Supplements Classroom Training 
### 
Eight young hikers gained na
tional attention the hard way shortly
before Christmas, 1965, in a way
that accidentally spotlighted the ef
fectiveness of Peace Corps Volun
teer (PCV) selection and training.
The eight trainees reaped head
lines by getting lost in the Manzano
Mountains of central New Mexico.
But, as later stories were to report,
they kept their heads and good
humor.
Late in the fifth day of a sched
uled four-day hike in sub-freezing
weather, they were found none the
worse for wear in rugged mountain
side terrain. According to Dr. David
Benedetti, head of the Peace Corps
training center at the University of
New Mexico, they had beaten the
elements because "these are bright
and resourceful people."
The trainees, four men and four
women, were the object of a mas
sive one day and night air and
ground search as rain and snow
hid their trail on a training hike
from Belen, N.M., to Manzano, a
desert town southeast of Albu
querque.
"We were disappointed. We
wanted to get to the other side of
the mountain so badly," sighed Jane
Whitmore, 25, after she and the
other trainees were finally sighted
by a search party.
"We Coped With It"
"The purpose of the hike was
to see how we would react under
stress," she said. "Well, we coped
with it. At night we sat around
the fire and sang Christmas carols.
And the scenery was just beautiful."
From this heads-up attitude, it is

easy to see how these candidates for
a Peace Corps project in Chile were
invited to training, the last stop
before going overseas.
If a Peace Corps applicant makes
it through the preliminary selec
tion process, he is invited to a 13-
week training program at one of
more than 100 American universities
or colleges where his special Peace
Corps curriculum will include:
■ Language training — total "im
mersion" in an intensive program of
up to 300 hours that leads to early
conversational ability. Previous
knowledge of the language is not
a requirement.
■ Technical studies — skills needed
for the type of work he will per
form.
■ Area studies — background in the
culture in which he will work.
■ American studies — refresher
courses in U. S. history, geography,
institutions.
■ World affairs — background in
current events.
■ Health — training in which the
Volunteer learns to protect himself
and also aquires educational tech
niques to improve health conditions
in the host country.
Volunteers whose assignments
overseas call for strenuous physical
conditioning are given additional
training for outdoor living which
may include hiking, rock-climbing,
swimming and map reading. Pro
ficiency in these activities, however,
is not required. While such train
ing was recommended for future
community development workers in
the mountains of Chile, for example.

it would not necessarily be required
for someone planning to teach Eng
lish in an urban setting.
Rated By Peers
The selection process continues
throughout training. Each trainee
receives a thorough medical check
up, a psychiatric screening and a
full background investigation. He is
judged by each of his instructors
and rated by his peers.
-On the basis of all available in
formation. the overall suitability of
each trainee is continually evaluated
during training and at the end of the
training period. About three out
of four trainees are sworn in as
Peace Corps Volunteers.
"In the beginning, training was
preparation for Peace Corps service:
now it is a part of Peace Corps
service," says Jules Pagano. acting
director of the Division of Univer
sity Relations and Training.
"Learned Through Experience"
"We used to try to cram people
with as much information as pos
sible, plus all the language and
physical training we could manage,
and hope the exposure would pre
pare them for their service overseas.
We learned through experience that
this was not enough. The transi
tion between preparation and actual
doing was not adequate — some
times not even relevent.
"As a result, we have tried to
integrate all the components of the
training program into real-life ex
periences in the field, based on the
needs of specific projects and coun
tries," Pagano explained. "The
training period has been expanded
to 13 weeks with at least three

of those weeks devoted to actual
field assignments such as work
ing in the slums of New York
or Puerto Rico, practice teaching
on Indian reservations or doing
community development in the Vir
gin Islands."
Another change in the training
program is greater concern with the
total learning process, he said.
"We are trying to make every
thing in the program relevant to
the Peace Corps experience." he
pointed out. "Training is now more
generally educational, rather than
just 'how to.' More attention is
being paid to attitudes and sensi
tivities in preparing trainees for
their cross-cultural experiences."

As the training programs become
less academic, colleges and universi
ties are cooperating enthusiastically
in providing the kind of preparation
the Peace Corps needs, Pagano said.
"To do this we are using off-campus
facilities related to expected country
experience." Dartmouth training
programs for French-speaking Af
rica. for example, now go on to
Quebec for practical field experi
ence." (See story on Junior Year
Program, page 2.)
As might be expected, this tran
sition in training procedures also
has jumped the cost of Peace Corps
training from 52.400 per Volunteer
to $2,700. Pagano said, but he be
lieves the results will be worth it.


LOST AND FOUND — Four of eight trainees lost briefly in New Mexico
mountains walk back to camp. Hike's purpose was to see how group
would react under stress. "We coped," said Jane Whitmore, second from
left, of Manhasset, N. Y. (American Univ.). With her are, from left, Linda
West, Hurst, Texas (Univ. of Texas and SMU); Judy Johnson, Pleasant
ville, N. Y. (Swarthmore College); and Sue Selbin, St. Paul (Univ. of
Minnesota).
