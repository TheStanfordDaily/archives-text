# IMPACT: Can You Measure PC Effect?
## 
### 
Does the Peace Corps have a
measurable effect on a country?
The first attempt at answering
that difficult question has been made
by a team of anthropologists from
Cornell University who have just
turned in the first scientific study of
the impact of Volunteers assigned to
communities in the Peruvian Andes.
The results of this scientific study
fill a 329-page report which details
two years of on-the-spot research in
15 communities where Volunteers
were active in community develop
ment work, using as a control five
other villages where no Volunteers
had been assigned.
General conclusion of the study:
Peace Corpsmen do make a differ
ence. Among the findings is that
Peace Corps communities progressed
at a rate some 2.8 times faster than
those communities without Volun
teers.
Peace Corps Director Sargent
Shriver views the report as being of
"great practical and historical sig
nificance."
"For the first time we have ob
jective, scientific validation of the
successes Volunteers are registering
in the field of community develop
ment. It is hard, demanding work in
isolated areas under sometimes diffi
cult and frustrating conditions, but
the report shows that the Volunteers
have been successful even beyond
our initial hopes."
Self-Help Program
He said that about one third of
all Volunteers and more than half
of the 4,000 now in Latin America,
are engaged in community develop
ment work, i.e., teaching democracy
on a community level, encouraging
people to work together to solve
their own problems.
The subjects were 50 Peace
Corpsmen, the first Volunteers in
the Andes. They operated in com
munities located in spectacular
mountain country at extreme alti
tudes (some as high as 13.000 feet),
inhabited bv the Indian descend

ants of the Inca civilization, inter
spersed in the larger towns and
cities by mestizos, Peruvians of
mixed Spanish and Indian blood.
Dr. Henry F. Dobyns. one of the
Cornell research team leaders, de
scribing the report's findings, said
that in the field of community de
velopment "results are normally
computed over the course of dec
ades . . . these Volunteers produced
measurable results in two years.
Some would consider this progress
incredible."
Tales of Two Villages
The study, however, is a human

as well as a scientific document, and
it reports candidly on the Peace
Corps' failures as well as its suc
cesses.
The authors (Dr. Dobyns, Dr.
Allan R Holmberg. chairman of the
Cornell anthropology department
and Dr. Paul L. Doughty, now on
the Indiana University faculty) tell
the story of ho'w Peace Corpsmen
were expelled from the village of
Vicos by a vote of its Indian inhabi
tants. and how some of the Volun
teers were then specifically asked to
return to the village.
Also related is the story of the

community of Chijnaya where one
Volunteer successfully transplanted
an entire Indian community whose
homes had been lost to floods.
Peace Corps Institutes Changes
Research such as the Cornell/
Peru report is not an exercise
in vanity as far as the Peace Corps
is concerned. Frank Mankiewicz.
Latin American regional director of
the Corps, said the Cornell team's
observations and recommendations
resulted in immediate changes in the
Peace Corps' operations in Latin
America even before their final re
port was completed.

Preliminary reports led to a mark
ed increase in language training, im
proved relations between the Vol
unteers and Peruvian institutions
with which they worked, and modi
fications of the Peace Corps' train
ing and overseas operations.
Community Development Pioneers
Mankiewicz, who describes the
study as a "landmark" in community
development research, points out
that the 50 Volunteers who were
the principal subjects of the study
were among the first Peace Corps
community development workers.
"They operated almost without prec
edent or textbook in a difficult cul
ture among people to whom even
Spanish was an acquired language.
"That they did so well is remark
able; but. as importantly, we have
been able to benefit from their mis
takes."
Mankiewicz said he believes one
of the most important contributions
Peace Corps Volunteers such as the
Peruvian group make is their role
as "witnesses to the condition of the
poor among whom they live,
prompting the community at large to
pay attention to the needs of the
poor."
Among numerous other conclu
sions of the Cornell report:
■ Volunteers form one of the most
effective channels for U.S. assist
ance.
■ Volunteers are most successful
when they work effectively with
both local community action organi
zations or other institutions, such
as AID. involved in technical assist
ance.
■ Volunteers contribute significantly
to basic long-term socio-economic
development in the Peruvian Andes,
creating and strengthening organiza
tions so that they can continue to
solve local problems even after
the last Volunteer has departed.

Cornell University who have just
turned in the first scientific study of
the impact of Volunteers assigned to
communities in the Peruvian Andes.
The results of this scientific study
fill a 329-page report which details
two years of on-the-spot research in
15 communities where Volunteers
were active in community develop
ment work, using as a control five
other villages where no Volunteers
had been assigned.
General conclusion of the study:
Peace Corpsmen do make a differ
ence. Among the findings is that
Peace Corps communities progressed
at a rate some 2.8 times faster than
those communities without Volun
teers.
Peace Corps Director Sargent
Shriver views the report as being of
"great practical and historical sig
nificance."
"For the first time we have ob
jective, scientific validation of the
successes Volunteers are registering
in the field of community develop
ment. It is hard, demanding work in
isolated areas under sometimes diffi
cult and frustrating conditions, but
the report shows that the Volunteers
have been successful even beyond
our initial hopes."
Self-Help Program
He said that about one third of
all Volunteers and more than half
of the 4,000 now in Latin America,
are engaged in community develop
ment work, i.e., teaching democracy
on a community level, encouraging
people to work together to solve
their own problems.
The subjects were 50 Peace
Corpsmen, the first Volunteers in
the Andes. They operated in com
munities located in spectacular
mountain country at extreme alti
tudes (some as high as 13.000 feet),
inhabited bv the Indian descend

ants of the Inca civilization, inter
spersed in the larger towns and
cities by mestizos, Peruvians of
mixed Spanish and Indian blood.
Dr. Henry F. Dobyns. one of the
Cornell research team leaders, de
scribing the report's findings, said
that in the field of community de
velopment "results are normally
computed over the course of dec
ades . . . these Volunteers produced
measurable results in two years.
Some would consider this progress
incredible."
Tales of Two Villages
The study, however, is a human

as well as a scientific document, and
it reports candidly on the Peace
Corps' failures as well as its suc
cesses.
The authors (Dr. Dobyns, Dr.
Allan R Holmberg. chairman of the
Cornell anthropology department
and Dr. Paul L. Doughty, now on
the Indiana University faculty) tell
the story of ho'w Peace Corpsmen
were expelled from the village of
Vicos by a vote of its Indian inhabi
tants. and how some of the Volun
teers were then specifically asked to
return to the village.
Also related is the story of the

community of Chijnaya where one
Volunteer successfully transplanted
an entire Indian community whose
homes had been lost to floods.
Peace Corps Institutes Changes
Research such as the Cornell/
Peru report is not an exercise
in vanity as far as the Peace Corps
is concerned. Frank Mankiewicz.
Latin American regional director of
the Corps, said the Cornell team's
observations and recommendations
resulted in immediate changes in the
Peace Corps' operations in Latin
America even before their final re
port was completed.

Preliminary reports led to a mark
ed increase in language training, im
proved relations between the Vol
unteers and Peruvian institutions
with which they worked, and modi
fications of the Peace Corps' train
ing and overseas operations.
Community Development Pioneers
Mankiewicz, who describes the
study as a "landmark" in community
development research, points out
that the 50 Volunteers who were
the principal subjects of the study
were among the first Peace Corps
community development workers.
"They operated almost without prec
edent or textbook in a difficult cul
ture among people to whom even
Spanish was an acquired language.
"That they did so well is remark
able; but. as importantly, we have
been able to benefit from their mis
takes."
Mankiewicz said he believes one
of the most important contributions
Peace Corps Volunteers such as the
Peruvian group make is their role
as "witnesses to the condition of the
poor among whom they live,
prompting the community at large to
pay attention to the needs of the
poor."
Among numerous other conclu
sions of the Cornell report:
■ Volunteers form one of the most
effective channels for U.S. assist
ance.
■ Volunteers are most successful
when they work effectively with
both local community action organi
zations or other institutions, such
as AID. involved in technical assist
ance.
■ Volunteers contribute significantly
to basic long-term socio-economic
development in the Peruvian Andes,
creating and strengthening organiza
tions so that they can continue to
solve local problems even after
the last Volunteer has departed.

fill a 329-page report which details
two years of on-the-spot research in
15 communities where Volunteers
were active in community develop
ment work, using as a control five
other villages where no Volunteers
had been assigned.
General conclusion of the study:
Peace Corpsmen do make a differ
ence. Among the findings is that
Peace Corps communities progressed
at a rate some 2.8 times faster than
those communities without Volun
teers.
Peace Corps Director Sargent
Shriver views the report as being of
"great practical and historical sig
nificance."
"For the first time we have ob
jective, scientific validation of the
successes Volunteers are registering
in the field of community develop
ment. It is hard, demanding work in
isolated areas under sometimes diffi
cult and frustrating conditions, but
the report shows that the Volunteers
have been successful even beyond
our initial hopes."
Self-Help Program
He said that about one third of
all Volunteers and more than half
of the 4,000 now in Latin America,
are engaged in community develop
ment work, i.e., teaching democracy
on a community level, encouraging
people to work together to solve
their own problems.
The subjects were 50 Peace
Corpsmen, the first Volunteers in
the Andes. They operated in com
munities located in spectacular
mountain country at extreme alti
tudes (some as high as 13.000 feet),
inhabited bv the Indian descend

ants of the Inca civilization, inter
spersed in the larger towns and
cities by mestizos, Peruvians of
mixed Spanish and Indian blood.
Dr. Henry F. Dobyns. one of the
Cornell research team leaders, de
scribing the report's findings, said
that in the field of community de
velopment "results are normally
computed over the course of dec
ades . . . these Volunteers produced
measurable results in two years.
Some would consider this progress
incredible."
Tales of Two Villages
The study, however, is a human

as well as a scientific document, and
it reports candidly on the Peace
Corps' failures as well as its suc
cesses.
The authors (Dr. Dobyns, Dr.
Allan R Holmberg. chairman of the
Cornell anthropology department
and Dr. Paul L. Doughty, now on
the Indiana University faculty) tell
the story of ho'w Peace Corpsmen
were expelled from the village of
Vicos by a vote of its Indian inhabi
tants. and how some of the Volun
teers were then specifically asked to
return to the village.
Also related is the story of the

community of Chijnaya where one
Volunteer successfully transplanted
an entire Indian community whose
homes had been lost to floods.
Peace Corps Institutes Changes
Research such as the Cornell/
Peru report is not an exercise
in vanity as far as the Peace Corps
is concerned. Frank Mankiewicz.
Latin American regional director of
the Corps, said the Cornell team's
observations and recommendations
resulted in immediate changes in the
Peace Corps' operations in Latin
America even before their final re
port was completed.

Preliminary reports led to a mark
ed increase in language training, im
proved relations between the Vol
unteers and Peruvian institutions
with which they worked, and modi
fications of the Peace Corps' train
ing and overseas operations.
Community Development Pioneers
Mankiewicz, who describes the
study as a "landmark" in community
development research, points out
that the 50 Volunteers who were
the principal subjects of the study
were among the first Peace Corps
community development workers.
"They operated almost without prec
edent or textbook in a difficult cul
ture among people to whom even
Spanish was an acquired language.
"That they did so well is remark
able; but. as importantly, we have
been able to benefit from their mis
takes."
Mankiewicz said he believes one
of the most important contributions
Peace Corps Volunteers such as the
Peruvian group make is their role
as "witnesses to the condition of the
poor among whom they live,
prompting the community at large to
pay attention to the needs of the
poor."
Among numerous other conclu
sions of the Cornell report:
■ Volunteers form one of the most
effective channels for U.S. assist
ance.
■ Volunteers are most successful
when they work effectively with
both local community action organi
zations or other institutions, such
as AID. involved in technical assist
ance.
■ Volunteers contribute significantly
to basic long-term socio-economic
development in the Peruvian Andes,
creating and strengthening organiza
tions so that they can continue to
solve local problems even after
the last Volunteer has departed.

Does the Peace Corps have a

The first attempt at answering
that difficult question has been made
by a team of anthropologists from

the impact of Volunteers assigned to
