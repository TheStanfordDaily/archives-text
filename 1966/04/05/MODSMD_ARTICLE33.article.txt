# TEACHING AND HEALING IN THE FAR EAST
## 'When you Learn to Laugh at the Same Things, Then You're Home'

Sab ah, Malaysia
Sabah lies some 700 miles southeast
of Saigon, on the other side of the
South China sea. An island state in
Malaysia, it occupies 29.000 square
miles of northern Borneo.
Half a million indigenous peoples
called Muruts. Dusuns, Bruneis. Bajaus
and Kedayans live there, as do 100,000
Chinese who form the bulk of the
commercial community. Western civili
zation. blown ashore by the winds of
the British Empire a century ago, main
tains a foothold on the coast. Only re
cently has the interior — protected by
mountainous jungle, leeches, more than
400 species of snake, wild pigs, mon
keys, birds and butterflies — begun to
buckle under the bulldozers and books
of the 20th century.
Sabah is also the home of 100 Peace

Corps Volunteers, among them Ron
Kuhl. a graduate of the University of
West Virginia, and Beth Halkola, who
received a B.S. in nursing from Michi
gan State University.
Ron is a teacher; Beth is a nurse.
Both work in the interior sealed off from
the coast by the dense jungle of the
Crocker Mountains Their post, Tam
bunan, is a town of 1,000 people. Some
10,000 people farm the surrounding
countryside, where the careful geome
try of the wet rice paddy is dominant.
That their work is both difficult and
serious hive tiught Ron and Beth net
to take themselves seriously. "You dis
cover what you need anywhere is to
be content," Be'h said. "It takes time,
but you learn to communicate. When
you learn to laugh at the same things
as the people here . . . then you are
home."


ACTING IT OUT —Boy: "Here is the blue pen." Girl: "Please."
Ron: "No, it's 'thank you.' Let's try it again." And again.
And again. Ron teaches 40 English classes a week.


THINK TALK —"I try to get my pupils to think independently."


OFF HOURS — Ron spends much of his free time
studying Malay and testing it in conversation at the
local Kedai (general store) over a glass of
thick coffee. He also goes fishing, does his
own laundry.


AFTERNOONS —"I go on home visits. I pack my medicines into a shoulder
bag and take off across the rice paddies." The predominant diseases Beth
faces are malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia and intestinal parasites.


MORNINGS — "Sometimes there are 80 mothers
squatting patiently in the sun under parchment
parasols." Beth covers eight clinics in
villages surrounding Tambunan. She travels
by Land Rover where roads permit; often
they don't, and she must walk.


HOME — Like Ron, Beth was assigned a
clean, modern government house. Tropical
sun makes naps during noonday heat
imperative.


SUNDAY AFTERNOON —"We often take walks on Sundays. We
compare notes . . let off steam. Speak American."
