# ELUSIVE DEFINITION IN LATIN AMERICA
## Community Development: Its Name May Be Mud 
### William krohley 
Recife. Brazil
Sooner or later someone is certain
to puzzle out a formal definition
of urban community development.
Out of his garret and into the sun
he'll come bandving his sheet of
convoluted prose onl\ to be greeted
with a recent erasure in Webster's
New Collegiate. Exactly what he'll
find where urban community devel
opment once stood is hard to say —
perhaps something like "better burg
breeding" or "coached community
commotion" or any one of a thou
sand possible locutions which would
shed an aura of respectability on an
undertaking whose very nature sug
gests a lurking, sleight-of-hand
presence.
In short, to define a phrase which
expresses the workings of an idea
in the hands of hundreds or per
haps thousands of people is to ig
nore one of its most salient features
— mysterious happenings — and
commit it to an orthodox fate.
Brasilia Teimosa is a barrio of
Recife in the northeast of Brazil
with a population of about 10,000.

B. A. in philosophy from the
University of Rochester in June,
1964.

One of its perennial problems is
the ruin of its roads during the
four-month rainy season. During
this period from May to August
the rain becomes a way of life, often
falling continuously for several days.
Fishing becomes sporadic, and all
but indoor workers are forced to
sit and do little but watch the steady
downpour turn the sand and dirt
roads into rivers of mud which set
tle in low spots and are churned
into black muck by traffic.
Jim Lail (Lexington, Ky.) and I
talked with many of the local
citizens about the roads and found
a real desire to get something done.
Several informal meetings were held
to discuss the problem, and it was
decided to see what a group of
residents could do working in con
junction with the city government.
The people were willing to perform
necessary labor if the government
would supply the equipment needed.
The planning took about six
weeks, and what started as a small
group of 10 men turned into a
nebulous affair involving suddenly
revived organizations dedicated to
desenvolviment das ruas (street de
velopment), an unlimited supply of
idea men. well-wishers, and skep
tics, and the prompt attention of
an incumbent councilman running
for re-election who arrived with
trucks and work crews and began
spreading sand with a flourish.
This latter measure worked well
on the less-travelled streets where

the sand wasn't pushed out of the
holes and off the street by traffic,
but the more widely used streets
and intersections remained impas
sable. The situation worsened daily
as the families living on these streets
shovelled away the few remaining
high spots to build dams to keep
mud out of their homes.
Somehow the mud had to be
drained and the particular stretch
of road leveled and then covered
with a packed layer of sand. We
worked with some of the families
concerned and suggested that they
petition the city for a small bull
dozer which could work in the
narrow streets. The city didn't
have one.
There were, of course, a number
of firms in the city which sold just
the machine needed. Money was
no object; there wasn't any. So
maybe we could borrow a bulldozer
and advertise some company's prod
uct. We thought it was a good idea.
Most of the firms didn't.
After a series of conversations
with incredulous salesmen which
usually ended in helpful directions
to the offices of nearby competitors,
we finally got a machine and a
driver who would come out to Bra
silia on the first rainless Sunday.
The men lived on the job site, so
getting them together was no prob
lem. But it always rained on Sun
day. One Sunday in mid-June, how
ever. Brasilia Teimosa reposed under
clear skies; it was not raining. It was

urban community development time.
First: drain the mud before the
arrival of the bulldozer. There was
one family which had a front yard
large enough to dig a drainage pit
in. The dona da casa (woman of
the house) thought it would be all
right.
The hole was dug along with a
trench to the mud; the trench was
opened and the mud began to flow.
Enter don da casa: "What is going
on here?" It was obvious. His yard
was being filled with black mud.
He had been away, out of touch;
and thus the logic of urban-com
munity development was a complete
mystery to him. The ensuing con
fusion ended the moment the mud
ceased to flow; what can one say
to a yardful of mud?
The project proceeded and was
eventually completed as the dozer
came to level the road, and the
councilman came to dump two
truckloads of sand for the workers
to spread and tamp. The drained
mud dried in the sun and was
covered with sand and urban com
munity development gained another
adherent. Sunday came to a close.
The workers congratulated them
selves on a job well done, the coun
cilman busily shook hands, and the
Peace Corps Volunteers went for
a beer.
The following Sunday, we would
tackle the next stretch of road, rain
permitting. It didn't.
