# AFRICAN PROBLEM: THE GENERALIST
## Undefined Person Meets An Undefined Project 
### Louis Rapoport 
Masingbe, Sierra Leone
During my childhood, the thought
occurred to me that I didn't know
how to do anything. But some
how. my shoelaces always got tied,
my bed got made, and 1 survived
in this practical world.
Then 1 went to the university,
where I took subjects like Scandi
navian literature, history of his
torians, modern Slavic literature,
and philosophy of literature.
When I joined the Peace Corps.
I was classified as a "generalist."
As a man who could do absolutely
nothing of a practical nature, I was
slightly amazed when I met my fel
low trainees for the Peace Corps
"R.C.A." program in Sierra Leone
(I honestly thought that 1 would be
working with computers or televi
sion sets before 1 learned the initials
meant "rural community action") —
carpenters, masons, geologists, an
architect —people you read about in
books, unreal people, people who
can (shudder) do things.
I tried to fake my way by drop
ping words like "hammer," "ce
ment," and '"wrench." But somehow,
my clever plan failed, and I feared
and trembled on Selection Eve. But

you're sincere.
In Sierra Leone. 1 was given a
road project in Bombaii district.
I Kriolized (after Krio. the English
derived lingua franca of the coun

try) my technical words—amma.
c'ment. 'spana—dropped them ex
pertly and waited for cheers and
applause from my workers. Mean
while. I read something called. "How
to Build a Bridge," and I built one
(I'm still laughing).

When a new Peace Corps program
was proposed—chiefdom develop
ment instead of specific construction
projects—l was asked to begin a
pilot program for the Northern
Province. The director of the
CARE-Peace Corps rural develop

ment program patted me on the
back (after feeding me) and told
me to go out and develop a chief
dom. It's easy to see why I wa«,
chosen for this mission: no one
really knows what community de
velopment entails, and who is bet
ter qualified for an undefined pro)
ect than an undefined person?
I packed my bags and moved to
Masingbe. a town of about 2300
people and headquarters of kunike
Chiefdom. Immediately after my
arrival. I went to the highest point
in the town to survey my new home:
the huts of mud. wattle, and bur
lap; the fragrance of lilac, franpi
pani, and purple-tassled (lowers fill
ing the heavy air — ah. sweet life.
While I was gone my house was
robbed.
In the weeks that followed I
worked hard, dropping new words
such as "co-operative." "social cen
ter," "adult education." "dispensary."
and so on. I even pretended to know
the Temne equivalents: kaw opaneli.
nsetli na kawol, karan ka na baki,
nscth nim atui . . .
The number of projects I have
going is ridiculous, and I would
have to be a Renaissance Man to
handle them all. But I have bluffed
my way; and my ingenious word
dropping scheme has convinced at
least some people that I am pos
sessed of virtue, that I am a true
"generalist" (that is to say. generalh
good in everything). And just as
my shoelaces got tied, my projects
somehow, will be completed.
