How? Where? When? Why?
Peace Corps campus recruiters an
swer thousands of questions about
qualifications, assignments, selection,
training and a thousand other facets
of the programs.
Here are answers to the most
frequently posed questions.
Q. Is the Peace Corps successful?
A. The best measure of success
is the fact that host countries ask
us back. The response of the
46 countries where Volunteers are
at work has been overwhelming:
Nearly every country has requested
more Volunteers than are available.
Requests by 20 other nations for

Volunteers have had to be turned
down for lack of Volunteers to fill
them.
Q. Does a Volunteer have a choice
as to where he is sent?
A. Yes. He may indicate prefer
ences on the questionnaire. However,
a person's skills and background
are matched with requirements, and
he may not be offered an assignment
in his first-choice country. And he,
in turn, may decline the invitation
and request another more to his
liking.
Q, To what extent does a person
commit himself when he fills out an

application and takes the test? Can
he change his mind?
A. A person is free to change his
mind at any time. Completing the
application procedure indicates an
interest in the Peace Corps to which
the agency will respond.
Q. How much do you get paid?
A. F.ach Volunter is provided
with an allowance large enough to
permit him to live at the same level
as those with whom he will work.
Each Volunteer also gets a read
justment allowance of $75 per
month (before taxes) which is given
to him at the end of service.

Q. What are the qualifications and
standards for Peace Corps service?
A. The basic qualifications are
brief: you must be an American citi
zen, at least 18 years old, without
dependents under 18, and available
for a two-year term of service. You
need not know a language. Most
people, for instance, don't know
Urdu, which we teach you if you're
headed for West Pakistan. The
standards are quite high. More than
150,000 people have applied for the
Peace Corps and only about 18,000
have been sent abroad.
Q. How long after applying do
you find out if you are accepted?

A. You will be notified within
six weeks if you are to be invited

do not actually become a Peace

and what jobs are available?
A. The Peace Corps has Volun
teers working at some 300 jobs, in
cluding community development,
teaching, accounting, recreation,
public health, heavy equipment
maintenance and agriculture. Your
enthusiasm and energy are as impor
