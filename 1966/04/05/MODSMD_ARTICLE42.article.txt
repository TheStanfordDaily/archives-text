# CHANGING DIRECTIONS
## Most Volunteers Alter Career Plans While Overseas 
### 
The Peace Corps has a "pro
found effect" on the career choice
of Volunteers, says Robert Cal
vert, director of the organization's
Career Information Service.
Studies of the first 5.000 returned
Volunteers show that more than
half of them changed their voca
tional plans while in the Peace
Corps. Two out of three of the
Volunteers who entered the Peace
Corps with no long-range vocational
goals decided on one while overseas,
according to the studies.
Part.cularly significant, Calvert
says, has been the shift toward inter
national careers. Only 8% of the
5,000 Volunteers were interested in
long-range careers overseas when
they entered the Peace Corps. But

almost one-third had this aim when
they completed service, he says.
Statistically, the activities of the
5,000 returned Volunteers are
broken down this way:
■ 39'( have continued their educa
tion.
■ 15% work for the Federal, state
or local government.
■ 15% teach either in the United
States or abroad.
■ 8% work with a social service
agency (more than 100 returned
Volunteers are now taking part in
the Office of F.conomic Opportun
ity's War on Poverty; more than
10%; of these are serving as VISTA
Volunteers).
■ I 1% are in business and industry,
either in this country or abroad.

The remaining 12% includes
many who are traveling before start
ing their careers. Some older re
turned Volunteers have retired. A
number of the women surveyed have
married and forsaken career goals
for the role of housewife.
A separate study of more than
2,000 returned Volunteers indicates
that nearly one-third were interested
in teaching at all levels. The same
study shows that the number inter
ested in careers in government had
doubled — to 20% — since they
entered the Peace Corps.
More than 6.000 persons have
successfully completed service as
Peace Corps Volunteers. It is esti
mated that at least 50,000 will have
completed service by 1970.
