# DRAFT: DEFERMENT BUT NO EXEMPTIONS
## 
### 
Pcace Corps service does not
fulfill military obligations, al
though Volunteers are deferred
during their term of service.
While service in the Peace
Corps has been determined by
Ihc Selective Service System to
be in the national interest, a
Volunteer must obtain a defer
ment from his local draft board
just as a student does. Immed
iately after accepting an invi
tation to join the Peace Corps,
the prospective Volunteer will
receive forms to send to his
draft board.
A Peace Corps deferment does
not exempt a Volunteer from
future draft requirements. Nor
does it mean that he cannot
qualify for further deferments
after completion of service.
Members of armed forces re
serve unils must have com
pleted their active duty before
applying to the Peace Corps.
Any remaining weekly drill or
summer camp obligations after
active duty are postponed while
a member of the reserve is
overseas.
