# Changes Spotted In Red Attitudes
## 
### PEGGY PRICE 
Attitude changes in and among
communist countries was the domi
nant theme of three speeches at Tres
idder last night.
The talks were given by doctoral
candidates in the Stanford Studies of
the Communist System, a section of
the Stanford Institute of Political
Studies.
As part of the continuing weekly
lecture series discussing Communism
in the modern world. Bruce Sievers
spoke on "The Divided Nations: Ger
many, Vietnam, Korea, and China,"
Maurice Simon on "Communist Sys
tem Interaction with the Developing
States, 1954-1962," and Dennis Pirages
on "Socio-Economic Development and
Political Changes in the Communist
System." Jack Kangers, a fellow
Ph.D. candidate, moderated the pro
gram.
"The major focus of international
attention since World War II has been
on the divided nations," said Sievers
in the opening talk, "but although this
topic has been widely discussed, there
has been no systematic analysis of it."
Systematic Analysis
Sievers undertook a systematic
analysis of the four countries by look
ing at social ties between the two

halves. In each case he found that
the halves identified with their new
international system, either Commu
nist or Western, with fervor.
"Trade with members of their re
spective international system is
over 75 per cent," Sievers said, "and
social communications have dropped
off between the halves." In attitude,
however, Sievers found that concern
over the other side stayed the same
or increased in recent years. In 1952,
25 per cent of the people in Germany
thought that reunification was the
most crucial foreign policy objective,
while today 48 per cent believe it is.
This seeming contradiction of "for
getting the other half" yet expressing
a growing concern for it Sievers ex
plained as the struggle for national
identity.
"National identity is fundamental,"
Sievers explained, "and when it is
shaken, a new identity becomes all im
portant. Thus the peoDle will easily
adhere to the principle of a new gov
ernmental form."
The growing interest in reunifica
tion Sievers believes shows that the
"high affiliation with their interna
tional systems is on a superficial bas
is" where the divided natioons are
concerned, and that the "crisis of iden
tity is still going on."
Communist Interaction
In his speech Maurice Simon looked
at the interaction among developing
states and the communistic block, and
proposed in the future to look at the
attitude of the developing states to
see if the attitudes are more or less
favorable to Communism depending
on the amount of interaction the na
tions had with the Communist block.
By interaction Simon meant trade
programs, foreign aid, and technical
aid, which he implied were the Com
munist's response to the foreign aid
programs of the West.
"Interaction between Communism
and the underdeveloped states began
after Stalin's death," Simon said, "and
between 1954 and 1962 increased
greatly. Simon analyzed Communist
aid to 26 countries and found most of
the aid was given by the wealthy
European nations, Russia, Czechoslo
vakia, East Germany, and Poland, in
that order.
On the receiving end Simon has
found that six nations interacted the
most with the Communist block, and
that attitude of the Communists to
ward these six nations was the most
favorable.
Economic Growth
In the concluding speech of the eve
ning Dennis Pirages looked at the ef
fects of economic growth on the lib
ralization of the political and domes
tic policies Of the communist coun
tries.
Beginning with two hypotheses that
either the rate of liberalization should
approximately equal economic growth
or that if there is no liberalization
and inadequate political communica
tion among the people the economic
growth would stagnate, Pirages found
the latter to be true.
"The economic development is high
est in East Germany and Czechoslo
vakia," Pirages saicf, "While accord
ing to my indicators of liberalization,
they are among the least liberal of
the Communist countries. This proves
my first hypothesis incorrect. How
ever, in respect to economic growth,
East Germany and Czechoslovakia
have the lowest rate of all the com
munist block. This I attribute to the
cohesion of the government and the
vague communication among the
masses and the elites."
