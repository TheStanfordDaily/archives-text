• Saigon Thinks KySafe
WASHINGTON—Saigon's ambassa
dor to Washington says he does not
think the political unrest in South
Vietnam is strong enough to oust
the government of Premier Nguyen
Cao Ky.
And he considers unlikely any U. S.
withdrawal because of the rioting that
has taken on an increasing anti-Amer
ican tone.
Ambassador Vu Van Thai expressed
these views today in an interview. He
said:
"What you see now is a manifes
tation of the extremist political wing.
"You have still the bulk of the mod
erates on both sides—the Buddhists
and the Catholics.
"It is my own feeling that the ex
treme wing does not have enough ap
peal with the public to topple the mili
tary regime."
On Capitol Hill, Sen. George D.
Aiken, R-Vt., said it is possible that
South Vietnamese critics of Premier
Ky have decided he is "an American
tool."

• Saigon Thinks KySafe
WASHINGTON—Saigon's ambassa
dor to Washington says he does not
think the political unrest in South
Vietnam is strong enough to oust
the government of Premier Nguyen
Cao Ky.
And he considers unlikely any U. S.
withdrawal because of the rioting that
has taken on an increasing anti-Amer
ican tone.
Ambassador Vu Van Thai expressed
these views today in an interview. He
said:
"What you see now is a manifes
tation of the extremist political wing.
"You have still the bulk of the mod
erates on both sides—the Buddhists
and the Catholics.
"It is my own feeling that the ex
treme wing does not have enough ap
peal with the public to topple the mili
tary regime."
On Capitol Hill, Sen. George D.
Aiken, R-Vt., said it is possible that
South Vietnamese critics of Premier
Ky have decided he is "an American
tool."
