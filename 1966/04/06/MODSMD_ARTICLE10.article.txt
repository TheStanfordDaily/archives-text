# Old Technology Versus New Jets

### ROBERT E. STONE 
"It isn't the problems that we are
aware of that we worry about, it is
the unknowns that keep us up late
at night."
In these words last night's Tuesday
Evening Series presented technical or
ganizations two talks on the engineer
ing, design, and operational difficul
ties which are being encountered in
the development of a supersonic
transport (SST).
Presented to the gathered engineers
and representatives of the various
sponsoring organizations were two
men who, in the words of the pro
gram's moderator Raymond Kelly,
"are most eminently qualified to talk
about SST's."
They were Richard Heppe, chief
engineer for the supersonic transport
program of Lockheed-California Co.,
and John Swihart, technical integra
tion chief for the same program at
Boeing Co.
Basic Knowledge
Heppe began his talk by mentioning
that he was assuming a basic knowl
edge on the audience's part in rela
tion to SST's. He pointed out that
while Lockheed and Boeing were do
ing the work on the aircraft, that the
decisions about its production were
being handled by the F.A.A., the Pres
ident, and a special advisory commit
tee.
He went on to say that the SST was
being designed to meet specific mini
mum standards which were necessary
for a variety of reasons. Among these,
he listed a cruising speed of Mach 2.7
(1800 MPH), a capacity of about 250
passengers, a maximum gross weight
of 500,000 pounds, the ability of with
standing an environment with temper
atures in the neighborhood of 450 de
grees.
Problems
Some of the problems which Heppe
mentioned included wiring, instru
ments, sealants, engine oil, hydraulic
system, tires, and air conditioning. He
pointed out that many of these prob
lems were brought about by the en
tirely different environment in which
this plane will have to perform. High
temperatures and low pressures in
flight were attributed to many of the
difficulties.
Heppe also mentioned that in-flight
problems were not the only ones that
had to be overcome. He gave as exam
ples the possibility of an SST having
to sit on the ground overnight in Alas
ka at 60 degrees below zero, and the
necessity of keeping the time needed
to service the plane after a flight to a
minimum. "The plane won't make
money sitting on the ground."
As agreed upon in advance, Heppe
gave no information on the operation
al problems which were expected to
confront those men designing the
SST. Swihart discussed these prob
lems in technical details.
Two Major Problems
Swihart pointed out that the two
major problems were controlling sonic
boom and guaranteeing passenger
comfort. With a series of slides depict
ing graphs and charts he attempted to

show what caused sonic boom and
demonstrated that the sonic boom
caused by the SST could be consider
ably less than that caused by conven
tional aircraft.
He went on to say that the prob
lem of eliminating sonic boom alto
gether was being turned over to the
NASA-Ames Research Center in
Mountain View.
The project date for the completion
of operational SST's is the first of the
year, with the expected in-service date
early in 1974. Heppe said that hope
fully all the bugs would have been
worked out of the planes by that time.
Confident
Both speakers were confident that
not only would SST's be in service by
that date, but that they would also
provide economical, safe, and rapid
transportation.
Both were adamant in their belief
that SST's were going to be the planes
of the future, and were extremely con
fident that all the problems could be
worked out with time.
Heppe said, "We are going to pro
duce a plane which a pilot can sit
down in and feel confident that it will
respond in a mariner to which he is ac
customed."
"It isn't the problems that we are
aware of that we worry about, it is
the unknowns that keep us up late
at night."

and John Swihart, technical integra
tion chief for the same program at
Boeing Co.
Basic Knowledge
Heppe began his talk by mentioning
that he was assuming a basic knowl
edge on the audience's part in rela
tion to SST's. He pointed out that
while Lockheed and Boeing were do
ing the work on the aircraft, that the
decisions about its production were
being handled by the F.A.A., the Pres
ident, and a special advisory commit
tee.
He went on to say that the SST was
being designed to meet specific mini
mum standards which were necessary
for a variety of reasons. Among these,
he listed a cruising speed of Mach 2.7
(1800 MPH), a capacity of about 250
passengers, a maximum gross weight
of 500,000 pounds, the ability of with
standing an environment with temper
atures in the neighborhood of 450 de
grees.
Problems
Some of the problems which Heppe
mentioned included wiring, instru
ments, sealants, engine oil, hydraulic
system, tires, and air conditioning. He
pointed out that many of these prob
lems were brought about by the en
tirely different environment in which
this plane will have to perform. High
temperatures and low pressures in
flight were attributed to many of the
difficulties.
Heppe also mentioned that in-flight
problems were not the only ones that
had to be overcome. He gave as exam
ples the possibility of an SST having
to sit on the ground overnight in Alas
ka at 60 degrees below zero, and the
necessity of keeping the time needed
to service the plane after a flight to a
minimum. "The plane won't make
money sitting on the ground."
As agreed upon in advance, Heppe
gave no information on the operation
al problems which were expected to
confront those men designing the
SST. Swihart discussed these prob
lems in technical details.
Two Major Problems
Swihart pointed out that the two
major problems were controlling sonic
boom and guaranteeing passenger
comfort. With a series of slides depict
ing graphs and charts he attempted to

show what caused sonic boom and
demonstrated that the sonic boom
caused by the SST could be consider
ably less than that caused by conven
tional aircraft.
He went on to say that the prob
lem of eliminating sonic boom alto
gether was being turned over to the
NASA-Ames Research Center in
Mountain View.
The project date for the completion
of operational SST's is the first of the
year, with the expected in-service date
early in 1974. Heppe said that hope
fully all the bugs would have been
worked out of the planes by that time.
Confident
Both speakers were confident that
not only would SST's be in service by
that date, but that they would also
provide economical, safe, and rapid
transportation.
Both were adamant in their belief
that SST's were going to be the planes
of the future, and were extremely con
fident that all the problems could be
worked out with time.
Heppe said, "We are going to pro
duce a plane which a pilot can sit
down in and feel confident that it will
respond in a mariner to which he is ac
customed."
"It isn't the problems that we are
aware of that we worry about, it is
the unknowns that keep us up late
at night."
In these words last night's Tuesday
Evening Series presented technical or
ganizations two talks on the engineer
ing, design, and operational difficul
ties which are being encountered in
the development of a supersonic
transport (SST).
Presented to the gathered engineers
and representatives of the various
sponsoring organizations were two
men who, in the words of the pro
gram's moderator Raymond Kelly,
"are most eminently qualified to talk
about SST's."
