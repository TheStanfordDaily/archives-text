# Educators Examine University Morality
## 
### 
CHICAGO (CPS) — What
should be the University's role
in guiding student morality?
This question was among those
bothering educators at the Na
tional Conference of the Asso
ciation for Higher Education,
held here in March.
Two speakers challenged the
wisdom of administration at
tempts to impose rules on stu
dents.
Fred M. Hechinger, education
editor of the New York Times,
suggested a "community of
scholars" needs to have rules,
but they should probably be
set by the students themselves.
Students in today's affluent
society are demanding more at
tention for themselves as stu
dents and asking more auton
omy for their personal lives,
Hechinger said. The students'
quest for maturity, he pointed
out, involves both direct partici
pation in university affairs and
intellectual permissiveness.
The idea the university should
play the role of a parent (in
loco parentis) was even more
strongly rejected by Helen New
lis, Dean of Students at the Uni
versity of Rochester.
"The student must be free to
question the existing order and
to test new all it u d es," she
urged. While the university does
have a role in helping students
establish values for themselves,
it must itself be liberated from
conventional attitudes which
inhibit inguenity and imagina
tion, she said.
This applies both to moral at
titudes on such questions as sex
ual practices and to over-valu
ing grades against individual ex
pression and imagination, she
argued.

In response to Mrs. Newlis' re
marks, Miriam Sheldon, Dean of
Women at the University of Illi
nois, cited a need for such re
strictions as hour limitations for
women's dorms.
"Male students between 18
and 22 will use every device they
can . . . Freshman girls will date
practically anybody, from fresh
man boys to married instruc
tors, in some cases," she said.
The discussion after Hechin
ger's talk showed general agree
ment on the "moral revolution"
among young people these days.
Hechinger pointed to a study
showing one out of six teenage
girls in Connecticut are preg
nant and unwed. A member of
the audience responded that the
ratio was even higher in New
York State.

CHICAGO (CPS) — What
should be the University's role
in guiding student morality?
This question was among those
bothering educators at the Na
tional Conference of the Asso
ciation for Higher Education,
held here in March.
Two speakers challenged the
wisdom of administration at
tempts to impose rules on stu
dents.
Fred M. Hechinger, education
editor of the New York Times,
suggested a "community of
scholars" needs to have rules,
but they should probably be
set by the students themselves.
Students in today's affluent
society are demanding more at
tention for themselves as stu
dents and asking more auton
omy for their personal lives,
Hechinger said. The students'
quest for maturity, he pointed
out, involves both direct partici
pation in university affairs and
intellectual permissiveness.
The idea the university should
play the role of a parent (in
loco parentis) was even more
strongly rejected by Helen New
lis, Dean of Students at the Uni
versity of Rochester.
"The student must be free to
question the existing order and
to test new all it u d es," she
urged. While the university does
have a role in helping students
establish values for themselves,
it must itself be liberated from
conventional attitudes which
inhibit inguenity and imagina
tion, she said.
This applies both to moral at
titudes on such questions as sex
ual practices and to over-valu
ing grades against individual ex
pression and imagination, she
argued.

In response to Mrs. Newlis' re
marks, Miriam Sheldon, Dean of
Women at the University of Illi
nois, cited a need for such re
strictions as hour limitations for
women's dorms.
"Male students between 18
and 22 will use every device they
can . . . Freshman girls will date
practically anybody, from fresh
man boys to married instruc
tors, in some cases," she said.
The discussion after Hechin
ger's talk showed general agree
ment on the "moral revolution"
among young people these days.
