## Piercing The 'Greek' Rush Veneer: A Second Look At The Fraternities 
### DAVE CALFEE 
Now that the competitive pressures of rush
have subsided and those who will cast their
lot have done so, it is probably a good time to
examine fraternities—a time when criticism
can't be construed as propoganda aimed at sev
ering the arterial supply of 'new blood' rush
ing into these houses.
Aside from initiation activities which are
clearly contrary to California anti-hazing stat
utes, but officially unrecognized by the Uni
versity administration, rush is the aspect of
fraternity life most deserving attack.
Among the most able apologies for fraternal
life are the numerous statements about the
right of members to choose those individuals
with whom they choose to live —a plea which
supposedly carries additional weight when we
consider the tradition-bound obligations
(gentlemen's agreements not withstanding) to
the National and the occult aspects of 'brother
hood.' Rush then is billed as the only effective
way to maintain the sacred rights of choice
and assure a purity of the species. But what
is rush really?
Dings And Nuggets
How many times are people dinged because
"they didn't show me anything," or snapped
up as "nuggets" and passed into the secret
circle of brotherhood because they are good
men"? How many freshmen put their trust
in a system which refers to them behind
closed doors as "not nucleus material—but
definitely an electron" when deciding which
men to bid first, or a system which bandies
names around at a casual ding session classi
fying people as "Av, Neg, or Plus" while re
membering nothing more about the people
involved than a necktie, a hometown, or a few
imagined tailfeathers?
What is most amazing is that through all
this, people can claim with a straight face to
be making a reasoned and meaningful selec
tion of the men they choose to live with. It
seems that the elusive positive aspects of such
a superficial screening as the present rush
and ding procedure are far outweighed by the
psychological damage to those who aren't
chosen and who actually believe there is some

sort of valid selection based on criteria to
which they just don't measure up.
Just Like A Dorm
Discounting the effectiveness of a selection
system which allegedly weeds out incompat
ible and presumably nonconforming elements,
the advantages most often cited for fraternal
living include the maturing experiences of
close association with a variety of diverse
characters, the rewards of cooperation, and
the confidence acquired through functioning
in a variety of challenging soical situations.
All this sounds suspiciously like an ideal dorm.
Just what are the differences?
First, there is the myth of a social superior
ity and the acquired savoir-faire which comes
through participation in a rich and well bal
anced social calendar: toga parties, roman
orgies, hill parties, beach parties, rush func
tions, and of course, the IFC Ball. Maybe this
change of theme around the basic structure
of a well-liquored rock-and-roll party does pro
vide the much cherished diversity of social
experience.
Assemble En Masse!
Lack of participation and group unity is
another disadvantage of dorm living often
cited by fraternal apologists. How often, for
instance, does a whole dorm show the initia
tive to assemble en masse and watch a brother
parade around Mem Claw in his jockey shorts,
or hitch a ride home from Skyline during a
non-existent 'hell week.' Such cooperation in
a dormitory is rare indeed, but fraternities
can manage this and other feats in a seem
ingly endless succession. These spectacles of
brotherly spirit are indeed enviable, though
unmatched.
The myth of integration into the academic
community which often gains credence
through references to elaborate faculty associ
ate and advisor programs was only too trans
parent in last quarter's Letters to the Editor.
Such heroic pioneering steps are hardly to be
paralleled by the established faculty contact
programs now in existence at those backward
university dormitories.

vantages of fraternal living?

Just Like A Dorm
Discounting the effectiveness of a selection
system which allegedly weeds out incompat
ible and presumably nonconforming elements,
the advantages most often cited for fraternal
living include the maturing experiences of
close association with a variety of diverse
characters, the rewards of cooperation, and
the confidence acquired through functioning
in a variety of challenging soical situations.
All this sounds suspiciously like an ideal dorm.
Just what are the differences?
First, there is the myth of a social superior
ity and the acquired savoir-faire which comes
through participation in a rich and well bal
anced social calendar: toga parties, roman
orgies, hill parties, beach parties, rush func
tions, and of course, the IFC Ball. Maybe this
change of theme around the basic structure
of a well-liquored rock-and-roll party does pro
vide the much cherished diversity of social
experience.
Assemble En Masse!
Lack of participation and group unity is
another disadvantage of dorm living often
cited by fraternal apologists. How often, for
instance, does a whole dorm show the initia
tive to assemble en masse and watch a brother
parade around Mem Claw in his jockey shorts,
or hitch a ride home from Skyline during a
non-existent 'hell week.' Such cooperation in
a dormitory is rare indeed, but fraternities
can manage this and other feats in a seem
ingly endless succession. These spectacles of
brotherly spirit are indeed enviable, though
unmatched.
The myth of integration into the academic
community which often gains credence
through references to elaborate faculty associ
ate and advisor programs was only too trans
parent in last quarter's Letters to the Editor.
Such heroic pioneering steps are hardly to be
paralleled by the established faculty contact
programs now in existence at those backward
university dormitories.
Need more be said about the enormous ad
vantages of fraternal living?

This is the first in a series of Daily
Forums designed to present op
posing views on topies of general
interest to the campus. In the wake
of rush, today's Forum focuses on
Stanford's fraternity system. Rob
Freeman, President of the Inter
fraternity Council, presents the
affirmative case for the Greek
system. Dave Calfee, a de-activated
Kappa Sig, takes issue with the
rush systems and some of the ad
vantages of "fraternity life.'*
Now that the competitive pressures of rush
have subsided and those who will cast their
lot have done so, it is probably a good time to
examine fraternities—a time when criticism
can't be construed as propoganda aimed at sev
ering the arterial supply of 'new blood' rush
ing into these houses.
Aside from initiation activities which are
clearly contrary to California anti-hazing stat
utes, but officially unrecognized by the Uni
versity administration, rush is the aspect of
fraternity life most deserving attack.
Among the most able apologies for fraternal
life are the numerous statements about the
right of members to choose those individuals
with whom they choose to live —a plea which
supposedly carries additional weight when we
consider the tradition-bound obligations
(gentlemen's agreements not withstanding) to
the National and the occult aspects of 'brother
hood.' Rush then is billed as the only effective
way to maintain the sacred rights of choice
and assure a purity of the species. But what
is rush really?
Dings And Nuggets
How many times are people dinged because
"they didn't show me anything," or snapped
up as "nuggets" and passed into the secret
circle of brotherhood because they are good
men"? How many freshmen put their trust
in a system which refers to them behind
closed doors as "not nucleus material—but
definitely an electron" when deciding which
men to bid first, or a system which bandies
names around at a casual ding session classi
fying people as "Av, Neg, or Plus" while re
membering nothing more about the people
involved than a necktie, a hometown, or a few
imagined tailfeathers?
What is most amazing is that through all
this, people can claim with a straight face to
be making a reasoned and meaningful selec
tion of the men they choose to live with. It
seems that the elusive positive aspects of such
a superficial screening as the present rush
and ding procedure are far outweighed by the
psychological damage to those who aren't
chosen and who actually believe there is some

sort of valid selection based on criteria to
which they just don't measure up.
