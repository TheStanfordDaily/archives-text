# Symphony, Chorus To Concertize
## 
### 
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" will
be presented by the Stanford Chorus
on tour with the San Francisco Sym
phony and San Francisco Boys Choir
in concerts this week.
The series opens at Foothill College
tonight. A second performance is
scheduled for Thursday night at Pitts
burg Creative Arts Building, and the
final presentataion will be Saturday
night at San Francisco Civic Audi
torium.
The Stanford Chorus, prepared by
Prof. Harold C. Schmidt of the Music
Department, has rehearsed with Sym
phony Conductor Josef Krips.
The 185 member chorus has been
undergoing intense rehearsals since
the beginning of Winter Quarter, in
cluding three sessions under Krips.
The Chorus has also been invited
by the San Francisco Symphony to
present Haydn's "Creation" as the
final concert in the regular symphony
season, on M a y 18, 19, and 20.
For many years, the Chorus has
been invited to present programs
jointly with the Symphony. The
chorus has been directed by Monteux
and Krips, and last year sang the "Mo
zart Requeim."
Prof. Schmidt is "ecstatic" about
the way students have responded to
the demands of such a highly skilled
art form. He compares the choral
works of the great composers to opera
in difficulty.
Schmidt believes 3000 students have
sung in the Chorus over the last two
decades, and feels that this participa
tion is "keeping alive the musical
heritage of the past."
In addition to its work with the
Symphony, the Chorus has given con
certs over radio stations, in a series
sponsored by the Music Department.
This Sunday, at Memorial Church,
the University Choir, assisted by
brass, will perform music by Bach,
"This Day Which the Lord Hath
Made, Let Us Rejoice in It," by Wil
liam Byrd, and an "Easter Hallelujah"
by Valpius.
Additional lectures in the series will
focus upon 18th century Venetian art,
the styles of Bologna, Italy, in the
same period, art in Ghana and Africa,
and the collecting of art works. The
weekly lecturees are complimentary
to the public.
