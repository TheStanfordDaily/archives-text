# The 						Fraternities
## Stanford Fraternities Offer 'Total Education,' Varied Social Experience 
### ROB FREEMAN 
There have been many criticisms leveled at
fraternities in reccnt years. It has been said
that fraternities actively discourage academ
ics, that they condone archaic hazing proce
dures and that they generally destroy a mem
ber's intellectual horizons. While these charges
might hold for certain fraternities, the exam
pies are atypical and certainly do not in any
way apply to the fraternity system at Stan
ford.
Fraternities at Stanford differ from the na
tional model in many important ways. Just as
Stanford itself strives to differ from most
educational institutions, so do Stanford's fra
ternities seek to escape from the negative as
pects of the Greek image.
In some houses, obeisance to national fra
ternity ritual and hierarchy is still in vogue,
in most houses, however, the chapter conducts
itself independent of outside pressure. In ac
cordance with California law and Stanford
tradition, most University chapters have di
vested themselves of hazing and severe initi
ations, replacing them with work weeks and
constructive pledge projects.
No Total Commitment
The independence which Stanford's fraterni
ties reflect in their relationships to their na
tional models is reflected also in the way in
which they treat their members. On some
campuses, fraternities expect total commit
ment to house functions and group philoso
phy, forcing a student to subjugate his own
ideas to that of the house.
At Stanford, there is no such forceable mold
ing of a house member—fraternities here rec
ognize that while a house can provide a valu
able portion of a man's undergraduate edu
cation, it can by definition be only a part of
his university experience.
Because of this realization, a Stanford fra
ternity man is not censured for having inter
ests which transcend his specific living group.

Perhaps the most telling criticism of frater
nities is that they do not encourage high
grades. This is to some extent true, in that
I know of few houses who actively criticize
their members for receiving poor grades. The
key to the problem is not that fraternities do
not encourage high grades, but that they do
not censure a member who is in grade trouble.
Fraternities seem to take the attitude that
academic pressure and criticism for failure
are present enough at Stanford without their
adding to the student's problems by criticiz
ing his grades.
A fraternity is one of the few places a stu
dent can go after succumbing to the curve
and not be hit by both isolation and self-de
rision. Fraternity members do not scorn or
ignore either success or failure.
Eliminate Pressure
If a man is depressed, there is usually a
fraternity brother who is available to com
miserate with him. This fact does not aid
performance in a pressure academic situation,
instead it enables a student to escape from
Stanford's all-pervasive pressure.
The question is whether or not the elimina
tion of some of Stanford's pressure, and con
sequently the impetus it provides, is detri
mental to the student's development. If such
a concession to the reality of Stanford's needs
constitutes a black mark on the face of the
fraternity system, then it is time for Stanford
to re-evaluate the pressures of its grading sys
em and the intense competition imposed upon
many members of the student community.
While small differences exist between the
grade points of various living choices, the
fraternity man's total education is second to
none. Freed from the overbearing pressures
of the Stanford system, and exposed to a wid
er variety of social experience, the fraternity
man arrives at a more complete and realistic
outlook towards the purpose of university
life.

Stanford itself strives to differ from most
educational institutions, so do Stanford's fra
ternities seek to escape from the negative as
pects of the Greek image.
In some houses, obeisance to national fra
ternity ritual and hierarchy is still in vogue,
in most houses, however, the chapter conducts
itself independent of outside pressure. In ac
cordance with California law and Stanford
tradition, most University chapters have di
vested themselves of hazing and severe initi
ations, replacing them with work weeks and
constructive pledge projects.
No Total Commitment
The independence which Stanford's fraterni
ties reflect in their relationships to their na
tional models is reflected also in the way in
which they treat their members. On some
campuses, fraternities expect total commit
ment to house functions and group philoso
phy, forcing a student to subjugate his own
ideas to that of the house.
At Stanford, there is no such forceable mold
ing of a house member—fraternities here rec
ognize that while a house can provide a valu
able portion of a man's undergraduate edu
cation, it can by definition be only a part of
his university experience.
Because of this realization, a Stanford fra
ternity man is not censured for having inter
ests which transcend his specific living group.

Perhaps the most telling criticism of frater
nities is that they do not encourage high
grades. This is to some extent true, in that
I know of few houses who actively criticize
their members for receiving poor grades. The
key to the problem is not that fraternities do
not encourage high grades, but that they do
not censure a member who is in grade trouble.
Fraternities seem to take the attitude that
academic pressure and criticism for failure
are present enough at Stanford without their
adding to the student's problems by criticiz
ing his grades.
A fraternity is one of the few places a stu
dent can go after succumbing to the curve
and not be hit by both isolation and self-de
rision. Fraternity members do not scorn or
ignore either success or failure.
Eliminate Pressure
If a man is depressed, there is usually a
fraternity brother who is available to com
miserate with him. This fact does not aid
performance in a pressure academic situation,
instead it enables a student to escape from
Stanford's all-pervasive pressure.
The question is whether or not the elimina
tion of some of Stanford's pressure, and con
sequently the impetus it provides, is detri
mental to the student's development. If such
a concession to the reality of Stanford's needs
constitutes a black mark on the face of the
fraternity system, then it is time for Stanford
to re-evaluate the pressures of its grading sys
em and the intense competition imposed upon
many members of the student community.
While small differences exist between the
grade points of various living choices, the
fraternity man's total education is second to
none. Freed from the overbearing pressures
of the Stanford system, and exposed to a wid
er variety of social experience, the fraternity
man arrives at a more complete and realistic
outlook towards the purpose of university
life.
There have been many criticisms leveled at
fraternities in reccnt years. It has been said
that fraternities actively discourage academ
ics, that they condone archaic hazing proce
dures and that they generally destroy a mem
ber's intellectual horizons. While these charges
might hold for certain fraternities, the exam
pies are atypical and certainly do not in any
way apply to the fraternity system at Stan
ford.
