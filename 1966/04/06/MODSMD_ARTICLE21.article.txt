# Dean Finds No 'Easy' Answer To Frosh Dilemma
## 
### JOHN E. HANSON 
Last week a member of Stanford's
current freshman class entered my
office, introduced himself, draped his
t>'4" frame over an armchair, and ad
mitted in some exasperation, "I'm
confused about fraternities." In the
following half-hour he indicated that
his father and older brother had sug
gested that he'd like a fraternity, that
his sponsor had told him that the
rushing experience would clarify the
situation and help him make his de
cision.
He was rushing, and enjoying it,
but he could detect in the houses he'd
visited neither the appeal he'd been
hoping for nor the artifice his sponsor
had warned him of. Worse, he felt,
was the fact that his indecision
seemed to be increasing rather than
decreasing as the acceptance date
grew nearer. What he wanted of me,
although he didn't ask in so many
words, was an easy answer and a
list of the three best fraternities.
No 'Easy' Answer
Obviously, there is no "easy answer,"
and no such list exists per se. On the
other hand, every rushee has experi
enced the indecision felt by my lanky
example. Both the import and the
impact of the pledging decision are
far-reaching, however, and I cite the
above example as evidence that not
all that is known about fraternities is
either objective or very well commu
nicated. To the extent that The Daily
has requested a statement on fraterni

ties to run with some pro and con
positions, I submit the following as
personal observations of fraternities
today. I would hope that it be consid
ered neither "official" (which it defi
nitely is not) nor a balance of pro and
con (which it also is not) but as a
loosely - constructed framework
against whtch affirmative and nega
tive arguments might be reflected.
The traditional criticims of frater
nities—hazing, racial and religious
discrimination, and indifferent scho
larship—seem to me to be for the
most part outdated. Where such criti
cisms may still be appropriate to a
given chapter or number of chapters,
there is overwhelming evidence that
valid criticism of fraternities in gen
eral cannot be made.
The National Interfraternity Con
ference, National offices of individual
fraternities, local IFC's, and institu
tions of higher learning have all
passed strong legislation concerning
hazing, serving not only to prevent
the tragic results from such practices
as "paddling" and liver-swallowing,
but also to introduce a more mature
and germane concept of initiation into
an organization.
While no doubt many of the transi
tions from Hell Week to Help Week
have been made as much for publicity
purposes as for other reasons, I have
been greatly impressed by the ef
fects made by fraternities, at Stanford
and elsewhere, to examine initiatory
and disciplinary measures and to
come up with new and creative ap

proaches to both the meaning and
practices appropriate to group living.
If the "hell" in initiation week has
not been changed to "help" in every
instance, it has at least been reduced
to "heck," and fraternities are find
ing themselves the stronger for it. To
day's college freshman simply doesn't
seem to buy the "Mickey Mouse" that
earlier generations at least put up
with.
A Traditional Criticism
A second traditional criticism of fra
ternities, that they detract from the
academic progress of their members,

than non-members at the same insti
tutions; on the average 71 per cent
graduate as compared with 50 per
cent for non-members. It is obvious
that so broad a study contains a num
ber of exceptions, and it is impossible
to determine in what degree the re
sults are due to selectivity factors,
scholastic emphasis, physical environ
ment, "happiness," or whatever.
It is difficult to argue, however, in
light of these findings, that fraterni
ties detract from the scholastic prog
ress of their members. Even in terms
of Grade Point Averages, long an

is also one which is increasingly diffi
cult to support, at least in terms of
the few empirical measurements we
have. A widely-publicized study by
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare recently revealed that
"fraternity and sorority membership
was clearly associated with " a per
sistence to graduate." The study indi
cated that institutions with no recog
nized fraternities had a significantly
lower rate of graduation than schools
with them, and that fraternity mem
bers had better persistence records

Achilles heel of more than one Greek,
latest figures show that 50..6 per cent
of all fraternity chapters ranked
above the all-men's averages on their
respective campuses. Stanford frater
nities compare less favorably in this
respect, with six chapters exceeding
the all-men's average last term, but
any fault found in a 2.15 chapter, for
instance, would probably not apply
to one with a 2.82. And it would be
hard, indeed, to fault the academic
environment of the Stanford chapter
that recently produced two Rhodes,

two Marshall, and two Danforth schol
ars out of a single class, regardless of
that classe's potential.
Slow, Painful Process
The discrimination issue has re
ceived a great deal of attention in
the press in recent years, and it is not
my purpose here to re hash so famili
ar and recent a controversy. Suffice it
to say that the racial and religious
integration of many fraternities has
been a slow and painful process. Gov
ernmental and institutional pressures
have played a large role in this inte
gration, but the greatest progress
has been made by the undergraduate
chapters themselves, acting in liberal
concert with the momentum of their
generation in persuading, pleading,
and sometimes forcing change upon
national organizations whose leader
ship has been less attuned to the
moral and social tenor of the 1960'5.
Stanford fraternities have been the
vanguard of the movement toward lo
cal autonomy in pledging, and their
successes have been notable.
That most fraternity men find some
thing in their undergraduate experi
ence that is meaningful seems unde
niable. Many are critical of certain
practices, past and present, but such
criticism is often of the constructive
type which leads to reform rather
than the simple taking of pot shots
at a slowly moving target. Positive
or negative, the fraternity alumnus
feels strongly about his former chap
ter. and it generally represents his
strongest tie with his alma mater.

That fraternities augment an allegi
ance to alma mater is demonstrated
by their high percentages represented
in alumni activities and financial sup
port. One university found that as
high as 90 per cent of its alumni gifts
came from 6 per cent of its alumni
who were fraternity men.
I have not dwelled upon the many
smaller shortcomings of fraternities
today — not because there aren't
enough, but because I believe them to
be outgrowths of factors not limited
to fraternal groups alone. My feelings
on this have perhaps been best ex
pressed by Charles Proteus Stein
mentz, the German-born genius who
probably did more than any other
use.
'A Most Powerful Influence'
In a paper entitled "The Purpose
and Meaning of College Fraternities,"
Steinmetz wrote: . . . "There is noth
ing in the conception, and in the na
ture of the college fraternity which is
opposed to democratic ideas, to sim
ple and moral life, and to scholarship;
but the fraternity, based on the family
idea, should be a most powerful influ
ence towards all that is desirable in
college life."
If fraternities fall short of their po
tential, therefore, I would maintain
that it is adolescent shortsightedness
and institutional neglect that are to
blame—not anything inherent in the
concept of meaningful fraternal asso
ciation. And these, I believe, can be
minimized within the present bounds
of University educational philosophy.

tential, therefore, I would maintain
that it is adolescent shortsightedness
and institutional neglect that are to
blame—not anything inherent in the
concept of meaningful fraternal asso
ciation. And these, I believe, can be
minimized within the present bounds
of University educational philosophy.
Last week a member of Stanford's
current freshman class entered my
office, introduced himself, draped his
t>'4" frame over an armchair, and ad
mitted in some exasperation, "I'm
confused about fraternities." In the
following half-hour he indicated that
his father and older brother had sug
gested that he'd like a fraternity, that
his sponsor had told him that the
rushing experience would clarify the
situation and help him make his de
cision.
He was rushing, and enjoying it,
but he could detect in the houses he'd
visited neither the appeal he'd been
hoping for nor the artifice his sponsor
had warned him of. Worse, he felt,
was the fact that his indecision
seemed to be increasing rather than
decreasing as the acceptance date
grew nearer. What he wanted of me,
although he didn't ask in so many
words, was an easy answer and a
list of the three best fraternities.
No 'Easy' Answer
Obviously, there is no "easy answer,"
and no such list exists per se. On the
other hand, every rushee has experi
enced the indecision felt by my lanky
example. Both the import and the
impact of the pledging decision are
far-reaching, however, and I cite the
above example as evidence that not
all that is known about fraternities is
either objective or very well commu
nicated. To the extent that The Daily
has requested a statement on fraterni

ties to run with some pro and con
positions, I submit the following as
personal observations of fraternities
today. I would hope that it be consid
ered neither "official" (which it defi
nitely is not) nor a balance of pro and
con (which it also is not) but as a
loosely - constructed framework
against whtch affirmative and nega
tive arguments might be reflected.
The traditional criticims of frater
nities—hazing, racial and religious
discrimination, and indifferent scho
larship—seem to me to be for the
most part outdated. Where such criti
cisms may still be appropriate to a
given chapter or number of chapters,
there is overwhelming evidence that
valid criticism of fraternities in gen
eral cannot be made.
The National Interfraternity Con
ference, National offices of individual
fraternities, local IFC's, and institu
tions of higher learning have all
passed strong legislation concerning
hazing, serving not only to prevent
the tragic results from such practices
as "paddling" and liver-swallowing,
but also to introduce a more mature
and germane concept of initiation into
an organization.
While no doubt many of the transi
tions from Hell Week to Help Week
have been made as much for publicity
purposes as for other reasons, I have
been greatly impressed by the ef
fects made by fraternities, at Stanford
and elsewhere, to examine initiatory
and disciplinary measures and to
come up with new and creative ap

proaches to both the meaning and
practices appropriate to group living.
If the "hell" in initiation week has
not been changed to "help" in every
instance, it has at least been reduced
to "heck," and fraternities are find
ing themselves the stronger for it. To
day's college freshman simply doesn't
seem to buy the "Mickey Mouse" that
earlier generations at least put up
with.
A Traditional Criticism
A second traditional criticism of fra
ternities, that they detract from the
academic progress of their members,

than non-members at the same insti
tutions; on the average 71 per cent
graduate as compared with 50 per
cent for non-members. It is obvious
that so broad a study contains a num
ber of exceptions, and it is impossible
to determine in what degree the re
sults are due to selectivity factors,
scholastic emphasis, physical environ
ment, "happiness," or whatever.
It is difficult to argue, however, in
light of these findings, that fraterni
ties detract from the scholastic prog
ress of their members. Even in terms
of Grade Point Averages, long an

is also one which is increasingly diffi
cult to support, at least in terms of
the few empirical measurements we
have. A widely-publicized study by
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare recently revealed that
"fraternity and sorority membership
was clearly associated with " a per
sistence to graduate." The study indi
cated that institutions with no recog
nized fraternities had a significantly
lower rate of graduation than schools
with them, and that fraternity mem
bers had better persistence records

Achilles heel of more than one Greek,
latest figures show that 50..6 per cent
of all fraternity chapters ranked
above the all-men's averages on their
respective campuses. Stanford frater
nities compare less favorably in this
respect, with six chapters exceeding
the all-men's average last term, but
any fault found in a 2.15 chapter, for
instance, would probably not apply
to one with a 2.82. And it would be
hard, indeed, to fault the academic
environment of the Stanford chapter
that recently produced two Rhodes,

two Marshall, and two Danforth schol
ars out of a single class, regardless of
that classe's potential.
Slow, Painful Process
The discrimination issue has re
ceived a great deal of attention in
the press in recent years, and it is not
my purpose here to re hash so famili
ar and recent a controversy. Suffice it
to say that the racial and religious
integration of many fraternities has
been a slow and painful process. Gov
ernmental and institutional pressures
have played a large role in this inte
gration, but the greatest progress
has been made by the undergraduate
chapters themselves, acting in liberal
concert with the momentum of their
generation in persuading, pleading,
and sometimes forcing change upon
national organizations whose leader
ship has been less attuned to the
moral and social tenor of the 1960'5.
Stanford fraternities have been the
vanguard of the movement toward lo
cal autonomy in pledging, and their
successes have been notable.
That most fraternity men find some
thing in their undergraduate experi
ence that is meaningful seems unde
niable. Many are critical of certain
practices, past and present, but such
criticism is often of the constructive
type which leads to reform rather
than the simple taking of pot shots
at a slowly moving target. Positive
or negative, the fraternity alumnus
feels strongly about his former chap
ter. and it generally represents his
strongest tie with his alma mater.

That fraternities augment an allegi
ance to alma mater is demonstrated
by their high percentages represented
in alumni activities and financial sup
port. One university found that as
high as 90 per cent of its alumni gifts
came from 6 per cent of its alumni
who were fraternity men.
I have not dwelled upon the many
smaller shortcomings of fraternities
today — not because there aren't
enough, but because I believe them to
be outgrowths of factors not limited
to fraternal groups alone. My feelings
on this have perhaps been best ex
pressed by Charles Proteus Stein
mentz, the German-born genius who
probably did more than any other
use.

opposed to democratic ideas, to sim
ple and moral life, and to scholarship;

idea, should be a most powerful influ

college life."
If fraternities fall short of their po
tential, therefore, I would maintain
that it is adolescent shortsightedness
and institutional neglect that are to

Last week a member of Stanford's
current freshman class entered my
office, introduced himself, draped his
t>'4" frame over an armchair, and ad
mitted in some exasperation, "I'm
confused about fraternities." In the
following half-hour he indicated that
his father and older brother had sug
gested that he'd like a fraternity, that
his sponsor had told him that the
rushing experience would clarify the
situation and help him make his de
cision.
He was rushing, and enjoying it,
but he could detect in the houses he'd
visited neither the appeal he'd been
hoping for nor the artifice his sponsor
had warned him of. Worse, he felt,
was the fact that his indecision
seemed to be increasing rather than
decreasing as the acceptance date
grew nearer. What he wanted of me,
although he didn't ask in so many
words, was an easy answer and a
list of the three best fraternities.
No 'Easy' Answer
Obviously, there is no "easy answer,"
and no such list exists per se. On the
other hand, every rushee has experi
enced the indecision felt by my lanky
example. Both the import and the
impact of the pledging decision are
far-reaching, however, and I cite the
above example as evidence that not
all that is known about fraternities is
either objective or very well commu
nicated. To the extent that The Daily
has requested a statement on fraterni

ties to run with some pro and con
positions, I submit the following as
personal observations of fraternities
today. I would hope that it be consid
ered neither "official" (which it defi
nitely is not) nor a balance of pro and
con (which it also is not) but as a
loosely - constructed framework
against whtch affirmative and nega
tive arguments might be reflected.
The traditional criticims of frater
nities—hazing, racial and religious
discrimination, and indifferent scho
larship—seem to me to be for the
most part outdated. Where such criti
cisms may still be appropriate to a
given chapter or number of chapters,
there is overwhelming evidence that
valid criticism of fraternities in gen
eral cannot be made.
The National Interfraternity Con
ference, National offices of individual
fraternities, local IFC's, and institu
tions of higher learning have all
passed strong legislation concerning
hazing, serving not only to prevent
the tragic results from such practices
as "paddling" and liver-swallowing,
but also to introduce a more mature
and germane concept of initiation into
an organization.
While no doubt many of the transi
tions from Hell Week to Help Week
have been made as much for publicity
purposes as for other reasons, I have
been greatly impressed by the ef
fects made by fraternities, at Stanford
and elsewhere, to examine initiatory
and disciplinary measures and to
come up with new and creative ap

proaches to both the meaning and
practices appropriate to group living.
If the "hell" in initiation week has
not been changed to "help" in every
instance, it has at least been reduced
to "heck," and fraternities are find
ing themselves the stronger for it. To
day's college freshman simply doesn't
seem to buy the "Mickey Mouse" that
earlier generations at least put up
with.
A Traditional Criticism
A second traditional criticism of fra
ternities, that they detract from the
academic progress of their members,

than non-members at the same insti
tutions; on the average 71 per cent
graduate as compared with 50 per
cent for non-members. It is obvious
that so broad a study contains a num
ber of exceptions, and it is impossible
to determine in what degree the re
sults are due to selectivity factors,
scholastic emphasis, physical environ
ment, "happiness," or whatever.
It is difficult to argue, however, in
light of these findings, that fraterni
ties detract from the scholastic prog
ress of their members. Even in terms
of Grade Point Averages, long an

is also one which is increasingly diffi
cult to support, at least in terms of
the few empirical measurements we
have. A widely-publicized study by
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare recently revealed that
"fraternity and sorority membership
was clearly associated with " a per
sistence to graduate." The study indi
cated that institutions with no recog
nized fraternities had a significantly
lower rate of graduation than schools
with them, and that fraternity mem
bers had better persistence records

Achilles heel of more than one Greek,
latest figures show that 50..6 per cent
of all fraternity chapters ranked
above the all-men's averages on their
respective campuses. Stanford frater
nities compare less favorably in this
respect, with six chapters exceeding
the all-men's average last term, but
any fault found in a 2.15 chapter, for
instance, would probably not apply
to one with a 2.82. And it would be
hard, indeed, to fault the academic
environment of the Stanford chapter
that recently produced two Rhodes,

two Marshall, and two Danforth schol
ars out of a single class, regardless of
that classe's potential.
Slow, Painful Process
The discrimination issue has re
ceived a great deal of attention in
the press in recent years, and it is not
my purpose here to re hash so famili
ar and recent a controversy. Suffice it
to say that the racial and religious
integration of many fraternities has
been a slow and painful process. Gov
ernmental and institutional pressures
have played a large role in this inte
gration, but the greatest progress
has been made by the undergraduate
chapters themselves, acting in liberal
concert with the momentum of their
generation in persuading, pleading,
and sometimes forcing change upon
national organizations whose leader
ship has been less attuned to the
moral and social tenor of the 1960'5.
Stanford fraternities have been the
vanguard of the movement toward lo
cal autonomy in pledging, and their
successes have been notable.
That most fraternity men find some
thing in their undergraduate experi
ence that is meaningful seems unde
niable. Many are critical of certain
practices, past and present, but such
criticism is often of the constructive
type which leads to reform rather
than the simple taking of pot shots
at a slowly moving target. Positive
or negative, the fraternity alumnus
feels strongly about his former chap
ter. and it generally represents his
strongest tie with his alma mater.

That fraternities augment an allegi
ance to alma mater is demonstrated
by their high percentages represented
in alumni activities and financial sup
port. One university found that as
high as 90 per cent of its alumni gifts
came from 6 per cent of its alumni
who were fraternity men.
I have not dwelled upon the many
smaller shortcomings of fraternities
today — not because there aren't
enough, but because I believe them to
be outgrowths of factors not limited
to fraternal groups alone. My feelings
on this have perhaps been best ex
pressed by Charles Proteus Stein
mentz, the German-born genius who
probably did more than any other
use.

Last week a member of Stanford's
current freshman class entered my
office, introduced himself, draped his
t>'4" frame over an armchair, and ad
mitted in some exasperation, "I'm
confused about fraternities." In the
following half-hour he indicated that
his father and older brother had sug
gested that he'd like a fraternity, that
his sponsor had told him that the
rushing experience would clarify the
situation and help him make his de
cision.
He was rushing, and enjoying it,
but he could detect in the houses he'd
visited neither the appeal he'd been
hoping for nor the artifice his sponsor
had warned him of. Worse, he felt,
was the fact that his indecision
seemed to be increasing rather than
decreasing as the acceptance date
grew nearer. What he wanted of me,
although he didn't ask in so many
words, was an easy answer and a
list of the three best fraternities.
No 'Easy' Answer
Obviously, there is no "easy answer,"
and no such list exists per se. On the
other hand, every rushee has experi
enced the indecision felt by my lanky
example. Both the import and the
impact of the pledging decision are
far-reaching, however, and I cite the
above example as evidence that not
all that is known about fraternities is
either objective or very well commu
nicated. To the extent that The Daily
has requested a statement on fraterni

ties to run with some pro and con
positions, I submit the following as
personal observations of fraternities
today. I would hope that it be consid
ered neither "official" (which it defi
nitely is not) nor a balance of pro and
con (which it also is not) but as a
loosely - constructed framework
against whtch affirmative and nega
tive arguments might be reflected.
The traditional criticims of frater
nities—hazing, racial and religious
discrimination, and indifferent scho
larship—seem to me to be for the
most part outdated. Where such criti
cisms may still be appropriate to a
given chapter or number of chapters,
there is overwhelming evidence that
valid criticism of fraternities in gen
eral cannot be made.
The National Interfraternity Con
ference, National offices of individual
fraternities, local IFC's, and institu
tions of higher learning have all
passed strong legislation concerning
hazing, serving not only to prevent
the tragic results from such practices
as "paddling" and liver-swallowing,
but also to introduce a more mature
and germane concept of initiation into
an organization.
While no doubt many of the transi
tions from Hell Week to Help Week
have been made as much for publicity
purposes as for other reasons, I have
been greatly impressed by the ef
fects made by fraternities, at Stanford
and elsewhere, to examine initiatory
and disciplinary measures and to
come up with new and creative ap

proaches to both the meaning and
practices appropriate to group living.
If the "hell" in initiation week has
not been changed to "help" in every
instance, it has at least been reduced
to "heck," and fraternities are find
ing themselves the stronger for it. To
day's college freshman simply doesn't
seem to buy the "Mickey Mouse" that
earlier generations at least put up
with.
A Traditional Criticism
A second traditional criticism of fra
ternities, that they detract from the
academic progress of their members,

than non-members at the same insti
tutions; on the average 71 per cent
graduate as compared with 50 per
cent for non-members. It is obvious
that so broad a study contains a num
ber of exceptions, and it is impossible
to determine in what degree the re
sults are due to selectivity factors,
scholastic emphasis, physical environ
ment, "happiness," or whatever.
It is difficult to argue, however, in
light of these findings, that fraterni
ties detract from the scholastic prog
ress of their members. Even in terms
of Grade Point Averages, long an

is also one which is increasingly diffi
cult to support, at least in terms of
the few empirical measurements we
have. A widely-publicized study by
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare recently revealed that
"fraternity and sorority membership
was clearly associated with " a per
sistence to graduate." The study indi
cated that institutions with no recog
nized fraternities had a significantly
lower rate of graduation than schools
with them, and that fraternity mem
bers had better persistence records

Achilles heel of more than one Greek,
latest figures show that 50..6 per cent
of all fraternity chapters ranked
above the all-men's averages on their
respective campuses. Stanford frater
nities compare less favorably in this
respect, with six chapters exceeding
the all-men's average last term, but
any fault found in a 2.15 chapter, for
instance, would probably not apply
to one with a 2.82. And it would be
hard, indeed, to fault the academic
environment of the Stanford chapter
that recently produced two Rhodes,

two Marshall, and two Danforth schol
ars out of a single class, regardless of
that classe's potential.
Slow, Painful Process
The discrimination issue has re
ceived a great deal of attention in
the press in recent years, and it is not
my purpose here to re hash so famili
ar and recent a controversy. Suffice it
to say that the racial and religious
integration of many fraternities has
been a slow and painful process. Gov
ernmental and institutional pressures
have played a large role in this inte
gration, but the greatest progress
has been made by the undergraduate
chapters themselves, acting in liberal
concert with the momentum of their
generation in persuading, pleading,
and sometimes forcing change upon
national organizations whose leader
ship has been less attuned to the
moral and social tenor of the 1960'5.
Stanford fraternities have been the
vanguard of the movement toward lo
cal autonomy in pledging, and their
successes have been notable.
That most fraternity men find some
thing in their undergraduate experi
ence that is meaningful seems unde
niable. Many are critical of certain
practices, past and present, but such
criticism is often of the constructive
type which leads to reform rather
than the simple taking of pot shots
at a slowly moving target. Positive
or negative, the fraternity alumnus
feels strongly about his former chap
ter. and it generally represents his
strongest tie with his alma mater.

That fraternities augment an allegi
ance to alma mater is demonstrated
by their high percentages represented
in alumni activities and financial sup
port. One university found that as
high as 90 per cent of its alumni gifts
came from 6 per cent of its alumni
who were fraternity men.
I have not dwelled upon the many
smaller shortcomings of fraternities
today — not because there aren't
enough, but because I believe them to
be outgrowths of factors not limited
to fraternal groups alone. My feelings
on this have perhaps been best ex
pressed by Charles Proteus Stein
mentz, the German-born genius who
probably did more than any other
use.
