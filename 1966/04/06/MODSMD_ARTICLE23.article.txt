LITTLE ROCK, Ark—ln 1925
the nation's attention turned to
a sleepy Tennessee town where
a local high school teacher was
being tried under a new state
law that outlawed teaching evo
lution in state schools.
The "Monkey Trial" is to be
relived again this week in Ar
kansas where a group of educa
tors is battling to remove one of
the nation's three remaining
state laws against teaching evo
lution.
In 1925 the trial of John
Scopes attracted international
attention and no less a figure
than three-time presidential can
didate William Jennings Bryan
volunteered to lead the prosecu
tion. The defense was headed by
Clarence Darrow of Chicago,
generally conceded to be the na
tion's top criminal trial lawyer
at that time.
Dayton, Tenn., was trans
formed into a side show and
crowds milled in the street and
on the courthouse step as Dar
row put Bryan on the stand as
an expert on the Bible.
Aside from the national atten
tion and the famous names, the
Arkansas suit has most of the
ingredients of the Scopes case.
The suit, filed by Susan Ep
person, 24, a biology teacher at
Little Rock Central High School
challenges the law on constitu
tional grounds in that it infrin
ges upon freedom of speech.
The Arkansas Education Asso
ciation, which solicited Mrs. Ep
person's participation, says the
law is an affront to a teacher's
integrity and ability, and an im
pediment to complete education.
The law was adopted in a
statewide election 38 years ago,
only months after John Scopes
was convicted of violating the
Tennessee Law. In a rare public
appearance, Scopes, now in re
tirement in Shreveport, La., is
sued a statement supporting the
AEA and calling the law a
"shackle on moral development
and a roadblock to intellectual
honesty."
The law provides a $500 fine
and possible dismissal for any
teacher discussing evolution in
a public school. The theory is
discussed, but rather guardedly,
many teachers admit.
Although the legal question is
ever the constitutionality of the
law, heated debate at pretrial
hearings has yielded companion
issues:
(1) Does the law inhibit intel
lectual freedom?
(2) Is the law a bulwark against
atheism?
(3) To what extent may a state
control the teachings in its
public chools?
Bruce Bennett, the state's at
torney general, says he will de
fend the law with "all the vigor
appropriate to a statewide ex
pression of the will of the peo
ple."

a sleepy Tennessee town where
a local high school teacher was
being tried under a new state
law that outlawed teaching evo
lution in state schools.
The "Monkey Trial" is to be
relived again this week in Ar
kansas where a group of educa
tors is battling to remove one of
the nation's three remaining
state laws against teaching evo
lution.
In 1925 the trial of John
Scopes attracted international
attention and no less a figure
than three-time presidential can
didate William Jennings Bryan
volunteered to lead the prosecu
tion. The defense was headed by
Clarence Darrow of Chicago,
generally conceded to be the na
tion's top criminal trial lawyer
at that time.
Dayton, Tenn., was trans
formed into a side show and
crowds milled in the street and
on the courthouse step as Dar
row put Bryan on the stand as
an expert on the Bible.
Aside from the national atten
tion and the famous names, the
Arkansas suit has most of the
ingredients of the Scopes case.
The suit, filed by Susan Ep
person, 24, a biology teacher at
Little Rock Central High School
challenges the law on constitu
tional grounds in that it infrin
ges upon freedom of speech.
The Arkansas Education Asso
ciation, which solicited Mrs. Ep
person's participation, says the
law is an affront to a teacher's
integrity and ability, and an im
pediment to complete education.
The law was adopted in a
statewide election 38 years ago,
only months after John Scopes
was convicted of violating the
Tennessee Law. In a rare public
appearance, Scopes, now in re
tirement in Shreveport, La., is
sued a statement supporting the
AEA and calling the law a
"shackle on moral development
and a roadblock to intellectual
honesty."
The law provides a $500 fine
and possible dismissal for any
teacher discussing evolution in
a public school. The theory is
discussed, but rather guardedly,
many teachers admit.
Although the legal question is
ever the constitutionality of the
law, heated debate at pretrial
hearings has yielded companion
issues:
(1) Does the law inhibit intel
lectual freedom?
(2) Is the law a bulwark against
atheism?
(3) To what extent may a state
control the teachings in its
public chools?
Bruce Bennett, the state's at
torney general, says he will de
fend the law with "all the vigor
appropriate to a statewide ex
pression of the will of the peo
ple."
