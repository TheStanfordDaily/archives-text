# Catholic Priest To Speak On Social Forces
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The priest widely thought to be
the mysterious Xavier Rynne will give
a lecture on "Cultural Forces and
the Ecumenical Council's Theology"
tonight at 7:45 in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
He is Father Francis X. Murphy,
Roman Catholic theologian and expert
at the recently-concluded second Vati
can Council.
Although he denies categorically
that he is Xavier Rynne, many think
him to be primarily responsible for
the series of articles on the Council
which have appeared in the New
Yorker magazine under that byline
during the last four years.
The articles, the first of which ap
peared shortly after the Council
opened in October, 1962, were largely
responsible for breaking both the veil
of secrecy around Council proceedings
and for destroying the image of the
Church as a monolith.
By detailing the gossip and maneu
verings of the Council, the articles
opened the workings of the Council to
public knowledge and eliminated the
traditional image that the Church
had unanimity of opinion.
The articles also served a purpose
for the American bishops who for the
first time became aware through Xa
vier Rynne of the opposition to the
Council from conservative Roman pre
lates.
Father Murphy, as a Council peri
tus or expert, "was seen everywhere
in Rome during the Council, almost
as if he were three people," says Stan
ford religion professor Michael Novak
who will introduce Father Murphy
tonight.
"He knew people and had the con
tacts; it was almost as if he knew
what was going on the day before it
happened," states Novak. "The Rynne
articles taught the Church the impor
tance of a free press."
Father Murphy is professor of pa
tristic moral theology at the Lateran
University in Rome. He has written
extensively on the Council for Exten
sion magazine, the Washington Post,
and the Long Island Newsday.
He is staff editor for The Now Cath
olic Encyclopedia and of a twelve-vol
ume series on the history of ecumeni
cal councils.
