# This Is The Times That Tries Men 's Souls

The Palo Alto Times seems to be a little con
fused over the relationship between custom and
law.
In an editorial last week titled "Let booze
flow on The Farm?—No!", the Times philoso
phized that while it may be nice that Stanford
is reviewing its policy on student use of liquor
on campus, any change would be undesirable.
"Students nowadays direct their resentment
strongly at anything they consider to smack of
hypocrisy," the Times philosophized. "So when
a rule is broken by a large number of collegians
the cry arises that it'd be more honest and prac
tical to repeal the rule." We suggest that the
Times take a look at Webster's, which begins its
definition of "law" by calling it"the binding
custom or practice of a community . In a
free society, law, including Stanford's policy on
alcoholic beverages, is meant to be the servant
of its people, and not their master; it is meant
to reflect the interests of the majority, while at
the same time protecting the rights of the
minorities. And so, when better than three
fourths of a community consciously and consist
ently breaks a law, and when that breaking of it
has fewer deleterious effects that the law itself,
then it would, we can't help but believe, "be
more honest and practical to repeal the rule."
"While the rules exist they exert influence
—even on the disobedient," the Times continued.
Yes, the rules do exert an influence—they force
students to drive off campus to drink, and to
risk their lives on the return trip; they force stu
dents to sneak bottles up to their rooms in musty

laundry bags; and perhaps most destructively,
they cause students to feel a certain alienation
toward a University authority structure that,
unlike the greater society, will not treat them
like adults at the age of 21.
• "Also to be considered is respect for the law,"
the Times mused on, without realizing that the
present law breeds contempt, not respect. Stan
ford's administration has admitted more than
once that its present liquor policy is unenforce
able, chiefly because students do not respect it.
The proposed new policy, which students helped
formulate, has already received the endorse
ment of student body officers and seems to have
been met with a warm reception within the stu
dent body as a whole. In short, if approved by
the Board of Trustees, it would have the back
ing of the people which it affects. Moreover, in
the words of Stanford's Student Affairs and
Sendees Committee, such a policy would "in
crease students' respect for the University's pol
icies governing other aspects of student life."
The Times ends with a rib-tickling plea for
the continued good name of Stanford's neigh
bor. "The strictures on use of intoxicants set
by Sen. and Mrs. Stanford elevated the com
munity tone of Palo Alto as well as that on cam
pus," the Times notes. Well, Stanford has
changed a little since the 1890's. We were hop
ing that Palo Alto had also progressed to the
point where it could take care of itself without
the campus's moral guidance. The Times appar
ently doesn't think so.
