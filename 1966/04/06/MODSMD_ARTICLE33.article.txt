# Take A Chappie Out To Lunch
## 
### 
It's a confusing state of affairs when the
campus humor magazine sinks below the stu
dent legislature in the area of student-pro
duced entertainment.
Such, however, seems to be the present un
fortunate situation. The Chaparral, once a four
times-a-year publication that ranked among the
top ten college humor magazines, has raised its
head but once this year—and even then only
to issue forth a feeble and humorless protest
against the Vietnam war that read like a cross
between I. F. Stones Weekly and a Dick Tracy
comic book. Sophisticated college humor, it
seems, is dying—at least at Stanford.
The vacuum left by the Chaparral is such that
even the Dean of Students reportedly is worried
about it. He has suggested, facetiously, that if
only the Chappies could struggle forth with one
more issue, he could again ban the magazine,
and the Chaparral, as a campus cause eelebre,
would be revitalized.
The magazine's problems, however, seem to
run deeper than a simple lack of controversy

around itself. In the past, when its pages weren't
filled with sex, the Chaparral was a valuable
outlet for satirical protests against absurd situ
ations and regulations both within and without
the University. But now, in the age of student
activism, the better minds and sharper cynics
are opting to vent their discontent through more
direct channels. The Chaparral, with its staff
now depleted to three, is suffering.
A drive for more staff members is presently
being conducted by the remaining staff. We
wish them luck. But we would suggest that they
not stop there. They might take a look at recent
copies of the Harvard Lampoon and the MIT
Voo Doo, among other college humor magazines,
and consider the possibility of taking advantage
of recent student protest by commenting upon it,
rather than falling as an unintentional victim
to it. With a little more perspective and with a
few more Chappies sneaking around the Storke
Building, the Chaparral hopefully would again
become a viable segment of the Stanford com
munity.
