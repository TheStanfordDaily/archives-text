# Gruber Speaks
## The 						ASSURF Candidacy Is Thrown Up For Grabs 
### Steve Gruber 
Many people have asked me if
I intend to run for student body
president again. Previously, I
have had to answer everyone, "I
will announce my intentions
when the first snows hit the
foothills."
It didn't snow on the foothills
this year.
And I may not be a candidate.
Time
The trouble is that even being
a candidate of the Steve Gruber
image takes time.
And you know that I wouldn't
give five minutes to the ASSU.
Therefore, I am in the market
for a sophomore who is willing
to run for student body presi
dent this year.
He should subscribe to the
adage, "The typewriter is might
ier than the sword." He should
be more than a little ugly, both
in his personal appearance and
dress. He should be able to spot
a naked emperor, even if his
name is LASSU.
Deadline
If such a sophomore exists, I
want him to take out a petition
immediately. We are working
against a deadline. All petitions
must be filed tomorrow.
Remember that you must have
a vice - presidential r un n n g
mate. You may obtain your peti
tion in the ASSU office and you
need only 15 signatures per pe
tition.
Allow me to enumerate the
benefits of being a candidate in
my image.
First, if you run a decent cam
paign and get a few laughs, you
have a good chance of becoming
a "Legend in Your Own Time."
However, if you run a campaign
like the Phantom did for cheer-

leader, it would be best to never
admit it.
Faults
Second, you may be able to
point out some of the more
glaring faults of the ASSU. The
chances that anyone will listen
to you are 11,031 to 1. If we add
in faculty and staff, the chances
are more like 25,000 to 1.
Third, there is alway a certain
pleasure in playing power poli
tics with the ASSU boys and
girls.
When I first ran in 1964, the
concept of an RF candidate was
only vaguely defined. In the
past, RF candidates had been
dogs, racoons, or monkeys en
tered in a student body race at
some institution like the Uni
versity of Florida or Santa Bar
bara.
Fallen Idol
Sure, Stanford had Armin Ro
sencrantz in 1962, but he be
trayed the image by doing a
good job as president.
I defined the RF concept,
racked up 282 votes, and caused
the biggest voting scandal in
ASSU history.
Roger Magnuson and George
Soule, his vice-presidential can
didate, carried the concept a lit
tle further last year, gaining 460
votes. Magnuson was able to
pull off a huge rally in White
Plaza and open broad new vis
tas in the RF concept.
Incidently, Magnuson and
Soule have never met each oth
er.
Sophomores, the opportunity
is there if you want it. I am
willing to surrender my chance
to run this year if a suitable
candidate presents himself to
me.
But, if there is no suitable
candidate . . .
