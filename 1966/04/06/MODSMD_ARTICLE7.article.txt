# Handy To Blow His Mighty Sax
## 
### 
Alto saxophonist John Handy will
perform with his quintet at the first
Spring Quarter Jazz Casual at 4 p. m.
Friday in the large lounge at Tresid
der.
Critic and syndicated column Ralph
Gleason will host the two-hour concert
and discussion with Handy. Gleason
has remarked of the quintet that "it's
an exciting group and one that will
make jazz history."
Handy, a long-time Bay Area resi
dent and graduate of McClymonds
High School, won acclaim among jazz
devotees for his work in 1958-59 with
the groups of Charlie Mingus. He then
returned to the Bay Area and has
since led several bands, none of which
really caught the public's attention
until the current one.
His present quintet — which was
afforded the most enthusiastic re
sponse of any band at the 1965 Mon
terey Jazz Festival, according to many
observers — features drummer Terry
Clarke, and bassist Don Thompson,

both Canadians, guitarist Jerry Hahn,
also a San Francisco resident, and vio
linist Mike White, a fellow graduate
of McClymonds.
Although all five are exceptional
soloists, the group generates excite
ment primarily through the playing
of Handy and White. Both possess ex
ceptional technique and rely upon
the great emotional content of their

playing, and both are grounded firm
ly in the basic jazz idiom and at the
same time are eager explorers of the
possibilities of experimental jazz.
Admission to the Jazz Casual is $1,
and is limited to members of the Stan
ford community. Tickets for the Han
dy concert and for the Muddy Waters
appearance April 22 are on sale at
the Tresidder box office.
