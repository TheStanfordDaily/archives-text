# Campus Greets Modern Infirmary With Cowell Center Inaugural
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
The first co-ed dorm on the Stan
ford campus opened last week, but no
one is anxious to live there. It's a 38-
bed hospital, part of the new Cowell
Health Center located on Campus
Drive opposite Wilbur Hall.
The Center replaces the old facili
ties in the Women's Gym as well as
the convalescent home, Alpine House.
It includes doctor's offices, a psychi
atric wing, an immunization center,
and an X-ray lab.
In contrast to the dingy brown
wall, scuffed floors, and rows of hard
benches at the Women's Gym, the
new Center features flourescent light
ing, comfortably upholstered chairs
and sofas, and deep pile carpets.
"I almost enjoy being sick," com
mented one sophomore.
Out-Patient Treatment
The change is apparent as soon as
a student steps in the front door. He
enters a carpeted lounge, where a

receptionist directs him to the proper
room.
If he has a cut or bruise that re
quires immediate aid, he goes to the
out-patient clinic, where it is treated
by a doctor or nurse. The clinic also
includes facilities for continued treat
ment, such as an ultraviolet lamp and
a whirlpool bath.
For those who recover, there is a
cast room, where casts can be cut off
after the broken bone has healed.
If the student has to be seen by a
doctor, he is referred to one of the
staff. He may request an appoint
ment with a specific doctor, or be
assigned to whoever happens to be
free at the time.
Study Alcoves
The Center has twelve physicians
on its staff, as well as two full-time
psychiatrists, a psychiatric social
worker, and an orthopedic specialist.
In addition, various specialists have
office hours in the Center.
Students who have appointments

with a doctor no longer wait together
in a long corridor. Instead, there are
individual alcoves outside doctor's
offices with comfortable chairs and
current issues of magazines. "It's a
great place for homework," one fresh
man remarked.
Those whose illnesses require them
to stay in bed are housed on the third
floor of the Center. They stay in
semi-private rooms, two men or two
women in each. Food is provided by
the Palo Alto - Stanford Hospital. It
arrives at the Health Center frozen
and is defrosted and heated in 30
seconds by a special radar oven.
Men and women who are able to
get out of bed have access to four
carpeted lounges at the four corners
of the building. One of them has a
phone and television set; another is
a "Lunch and Games room;" a third
is a "quiet study room." The Center
is still waiting for someone to donate
a hi-fi set for the fourth lounge.
One freshman, lounging in bath

robe and slippers in the TV room, ad
mitted, "It's a lot more comfortable
here than in Wilbur." A co-ed beside
him was busy talking on the tele
phone and not available for comment.
Two of the most visited rooms in
the Center are located in the base
ment: the immunization center and
the X-ray lab. The immunization cen
ter will dispense vaccines and in
jections for those attending the for
eign campuses. The X-ray lab, which
is not yet operational, will give chest
X-rays, thus saving new students the
trip to the Palo Alto Clinic.
Also in the basement is a brightly
lit room which will be used by the
psychiatric section for group therapy
sessions.
The Health Center was built with
a grant from the Cowell Foundation.
Visiting hours for meeting patients
who are staying in the Health Cen
ter are from 2-4 in the afternoon and
from 7-9 in the evenings.
