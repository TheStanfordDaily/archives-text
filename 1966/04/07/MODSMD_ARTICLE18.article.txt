# Biz School Set To Grow With New Building
## 
### BILL WERTZ Associate Editor 
While carpenters and electricians rush to
complete the new $5.5 million home of Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business, untypical
ly dressed business school students in coats
and tics are sweating it out In five small, tern
porary locations around the campus.
When completed early in July, the new
building next to Memorial Auditorium will
consolidate all teaching and research activi
ties under one roof and will permit a gradual
expansion of enrollment from 425 to 650
M.B.A. students and from 55 to 100 Ph.D.
candidates.
This expansion will ease but not eliminate
the problems resulting from the burgeoning
number of applications that Stanford's busi
ness school, along with graduate schools all
over the country, is now receiving.
A public that has accepted the fact that a
high school graduate cannot be assured ad
mission to the undergraduate college of his
choice, says Business School Admissions Di
rector Nathaniel C. Allyn, must now realize
that the same is true for the major graduate
schools.
High Rejection Rate
"We were forced to reject more applicants
for this academic year than the total who ap
plied in 1960," Allyn says.
Broadly speaking, the Business School is
engaged in five major educational activities:
a masters program; a Ph.D. program; inde
pendent research activities of the faculty; a
variety of management development pro
grams; and a number of international activi
ties.
The two-year M.B.A. program emphasizes
the interplay between "scientific" and "art
ful" elements in competent management. The
practice of management, according to the
theory now being taught, involves both the
application of knowledge to the solution of
business problems and the realization of these
solutions through positive actions.
The "scientific" element of management
competence, therefore, is familiarity with the
facts and figures of the different disciplines
needed to solve the problem. And, since solu
tions are most productive that lead to deci
sion and action, the second, "artful," element
is the use of judgment, wisdom and experi
ence in the application of knowledge to prob
lems.
Dual Concept
To tearh this dual concept of managerial
competence, the Stanford School of Business
uses traditional methods of instruction such
as lecturers, seminars, field trips, group proj
ects and independent research, but places
heavy reliance on another method of instruc
tion—the case method.
Since people in management positions must

secure results with and through people, the
business school feels the case method of study
is an efficient means of developing the pow
ers of analysis and judgment essential to a
manager.
Each case represents an authentic manage
ment problem, and students working cooper
atively and competitively appraise possible
solutions to the problem posed through the
same procedures that would be used in a man
agerial situation.
Practice in group discussion is stressed not
only in the case method of study, but through
out the curriculum, and students are forced

constantly to express, depend and modify
their positions.
Since much of any manager's work is rou
tine, according to Associate Dean James E.
Howell, the case method system is able to
give students the equivalent of many years of
actual experience in a short period of time.
A full course of study during the first year
of the M.B.A. program is five courses each
quarter. First year students take such courses
as Business Economics, Management Ac
counting, Organizational Behavior and Mar
keting Management.
Second year students take only one busi

ness policy course, integrating what they
have learned during their first year, then are
free to choose among such electives as Re
tail Store Management, Urban Real Estate
Management, Data Processing and Transpor
tation policy.
Related Courses Uurged
"We also urge our students to take related
courses such as economics, political science
or even engineering outside of the business
school," says William C. Hannemann, Assist
ant Dean for Student Affairs.
"The last thing we want to do," Hannemann
says, "is to turn out narrow specialists who
are competent in only one field."
According to Dean Howell, Business School
graduates are very much in demand in the
business world and usually manage to land
top positions.
"Each year," Howell says, "there are as
many companies recruiting as we have gradu
ates, and some of these firms would take five
or ten people if we had them available."
The doctoral program at Stanford's School
of Business is operated quite independently of
the Masters program. It is designed to be
especially appropriate for students who have
had no previous graduate education. Students
can qualify for the M.B.A. degree during the
course of their studies for a Ph.D., but it is
not required.
A student entering with only a Bachelor's
degree normally completes all his require
ments except his dissertation by the end of
his third year in the program. Students who
already have a Masters degree usually finish
by the end of the second year.
The business school is also involved in a
number of different management development
programs, some offered during the summer,
and some taught on a nine-month basis.
These programs are offered to businessmen
who are returning to school to study new con
cepts and develop new information in their
field.
Stanford-Sloan Program
The Stanford-Sloan program, now in its
eighth year, is probably the best known of
these programs.
Financed by a grant from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation, which also financed a wing
in the new business school building, the Stan
ford-Sloan program is a nine - month, full-time
program for 30- to 40-ycar-old businessmen.

A similar program, the Executive Develop
ment Program, is offered for eight weeks in
the summer and is now entering its 15th year.
Also offered in the summer is a four-week
Transportation Management Program for
traffic and transportation executives. United
States Armed Forces have sent many officers
to participate in this program.
A pioneer program at Stanford in 1962 is
the International Center for the Advance
ment of Management Education. This pro
gram gathers businessmen and teachers from
developing countries all around the world for
an eight-month program designed to improve
the economy of the developing countries by
improving business education and business
practice.
For the first time in July all these programs
will be together in one building, and it is
hoped by business school officials that all
will benefit from the contact.

ford's Graduate School of Business, untypical
ly dressed business school students in coats
and tics are sweating it out In five small, tern
porary locations around the campus.
When completed early in July, the new
building next to Memorial Auditorium will
consolidate all teaching and research activi
ties under one roof and will permit a gradual
expansion of enrollment from 425 to 650
M.B.A. students and from 55 to 100 Ph.D.
candidates.
This expansion will ease but not eliminate
the problems resulting from the burgeoning
number of applications that Stanford's busi
ness school, along with graduate schools all
over the country, is now receiving.
A public that has accepted the fact that a
high school graduate cannot be assured ad
mission to the undergraduate college of his
choice, says Business School Admissions Di
rector Nathaniel C. Allyn, must now realize
that the same is true for the major graduate
schools.
High Rejection Rate
"We were forced to reject more applicants
for this academic year than the total who ap
plied in 1960," Allyn says.
Broadly speaking, the Business School is
engaged in five major educational activities:
a masters program; a Ph.D. program; inde
pendent research activities of the faculty; a
variety of management development pro
grams; and a number of international activi
ties.
The two-year M.B.A. program emphasizes
the interplay between "scientific" and "art
ful" elements in competent management. The
practice of management, according to the
theory now being taught, involves both the
application of knowledge to the solution of
business problems and the realization of these
solutions through positive actions.
The "scientific" element of management
competence, therefore, is familiarity with the
facts and figures of the different disciplines
needed to solve the problem. And, since solu
tions are most productive that lead to deci
sion and action, the second, "artful," element
is the use of judgment, wisdom and experi
ence in the application of knowledge to prob
lems.
Dual Concept
To tearh this dual concept of managerial
competence, the Stanford School of Business
uses traditional methods of instruction such
as lecturers, seminars, field trips, group proj
ects and independent research, but places
heavy reliance on another method of instruc
tion—the case method.
Since people in management positions must

secure results with and through people, the
business school feels the case method of study
is an efficient means of developing the pow
ers of analysis and judgment essential to a
manager.
Each case represents an authentic manage
ment problem, and students working cooper
atively and competitively appraise possible
solutions to the problem posed through the
same procedures that would be used in a man
agerial situation.
Practice in group discussion is stressed not
only in the case method of study, but through
out the curriculum, and students are forced

constantly to express, depend and modify
their positions.
Since much of any manager's work is rou
tine, according to Associate Dean James E.
Howell, the case method system is able to
give students the equivalent of many years of
actual experience in a short period of time.
A full course of study during the first year
of the M.B.A. program is five courses each
quarter. First year students take such courses
as Business Economics, Management Ac
counting, Organizational Behavior and Mar
keting Management.
Second year students take only one busi

ness policy course, integrating what they
have learned during their first year, then are
free to choose among such electives as Re
tail Store Management, Urban Real Estate
Management, Data Processing and Transpor
tation policy.
Related Courses Uurged
"We also urge our students to take related
courses such as economics, political science
or even engineering outside of the business
school," says William C. Hannemann, Assist
ant Dean for Student Affairs.
"The last thing we want to do," Hannemann
says, "is to turn out narrow specialists who
are competent in only one field."
According to Dean Howell, Business School
graduates are very much in demand in the
business world and usually manage to land
top positions.
"Each year," Howell says, "there are as
many companies recruiting as we have gradu
ates, and some of these firms would take five
or ten people if we had them available."
The doctoral program at Stanford's School
of Business is operated quite independently of
the Masters program. It is designed to be
especially appropriate for students who have
had no previous graduate education. Students
can qualify for the M.B.A. degree during the
course of their studies for a Ph.D., but it is
not required.
A student entering with only a Bachelor's
degree normally completes all his require
ments except his dissertation by the end of
his third year in the program. Students who
already have a Masters degree usually finish
by the end of the second year.
The business school is also involved in a
number of different management development
programs, some offered during the summer,
and some taught on a nine-month basis.
These programs are offered to businessmen
who are returning to school to study new con
cepts and develop new information in their
field.
Stanford-Sloan Program
The Stanford-Sloan program, now in its
eighth year, is probably the best known of
these programs.
Financed by a grant from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation, which also financed a wing
in the new business school building, the Stan
ford-Sloan program is a nine - month, full-time
program for 30- to 40-ycar-old businessmen.

A similar program, the Executive Develop
ment Program, is offered for eight weeks in
the summer and is now entering its 15th year.
Also offered in the summer is a four-week
Transportation Management Program for
traffic and transportation executives. United
States Armed Forces have sent many officers
to participate in this program.
A pioneer program at Stanford in 1962 is
the International Center for the Advance
ment of Management Education. This pro
gram gathers businessmen and teachers from
developing countries all around the world for
an eight-month program designed to improve
the economy of the developing countries by
improving business education and business
practice.
For the first time in July all these programs
will be together in one building, and it is
hoped by business school officials that all
will benefit from the contact.

and tics are sweating it out In five small, tern
porary locations around the campus.
When completed early in July, the new
building next to Memorial Auditorium will
consolidate all teaching and research activi
ties under one roof and will permit a gradual
expansion of enrollment from 425 to 650
M.B.A. students and from 55 to 100 Ph.D.
candidates.
This expansion will ease but not eliminate
the problems resulting from the burgeoning
number of applications that Stanford's busi
ness school, along with graduate schools all
over the country, is now receiving.
A public that has accepted the fact that a
high school graduate cannot be assured ad
mission to the undergraduate college of his
choice, says Business School Admissions Di
rector Nathaniel C. Allyn, must now realize
that the same is true for the major graduate
schools.
High Rejection Rate
"We were forced to reject more applicants
for this academic year than the total who ap
plied in 1960," Allyn says.
Broadly speaking, the Business School is
engaged in five major educational activities:
a masters program; a Ph.D. program; inde
pendent research activities of the faculty; a
variety of management development pro
grams; and a number of international activi
ties.
The two-year M.B.A. program emphasizes
the interplay between "scientific" and "art
ful" elements in competent management. The
practice of management, according to the
theory now being taught, involves both the
application of knowledge to the solution of
business problems and the realization of these
solutions through positive actions.
The "scientific" element of management
competence, therefore, is familiarity with the
facts and figures of the different disciplines
needed to solve the problem. And, since solu
tions are most productive that lead to deci
sion and action, the second, "artful," element
is the use of judgment, wisdom and experi
ence in the application of knowledge to prob
lems.
Dual Concept
To tearh this dual concept of managerial
competence, the Stanford School of Business
uses traditional methods of instruction such
as lecturers, seminars, field trips, group proj
ects and independent research, but places
heavy reliance on another method of instruc
tion—the case method.
Since people in management positions must

secure results with and through people, the
business school feels the case method of study
is an efficient means of developing the pow
ers of analysis and judgment essential to a
manager.
Each case represents an authentic manage
ment problem, and students working cooper
atively and competitively appraise possible
solutions to the problem posed through the
same procedures that would be used in a man
agerial situation.
Practice in group discussion is stressed not
only in the case method of study, but through
out the curriculum, and students are forced

constantly to express, depend and modify
their positions.
Since much of any manager's work is rou
tine, according to Associate Dean James E.
Howell, the case method system is able to
give students the equivalent of many years of
actual experience in a short period of time.
A full course of study during the first year
of the M.B.A. program is five courses each
quarter. First year students take such courses
as Business Economics, Management Ac
counting, Organizational Behavior and Mar
keting Management.
Second year students take only one busi

ness policy course, integrating what they
have learned during their first year, then are
free to choose among such electives as Re
tail Store Management, Urban Real Estate
Management, Data Processing and Transpor
tation policy.
Related Courses Uurged
"We also urge our students to take related
courses such as economics, political science
or even engineering outside of the business
school," says William C. Hannemann, Assist
ant Dean for Student Affairs.
"The last thing we want to do," Hannemann
says, "is to turn out narrow specialists who
are competent in only one field."
According to Dean Howell, Business School
graduates are very much in demand in the
business world and usually manage to land
top positions.
"Each year," Howell says, "there are as
many companies recruiting as we have gradu
ates, and some of these firms would take five
or ten people if we had them available."
The doctoral program at Stanford's School
of Business is operated quite independently of
the Masters program. It is designed to be
especially appropriate for students who have
had no previous graduate education. Students
can qualify for the M.B.A. degree during the
course of their studies for a Ph.D., but it is
not required.
A student entering with only a Bachelor's
degree normally completes all his require
ments except his dissertation by the end of
his third year in the program. Students who
already have a Masters degree usually finish
by the end of the second year.
The business school is also involved in a
number of different management development
programs, some offered during the summer,
and some taught on a nine-month basis.
These programs are offered to businessmen
who are returning to school to study new con
cepts and develop new information in their
field.
Stanford-Sloan Program
The Stanford-Sloan program, now in its
eighth year, is probably the best known of
these programs.
Financed by a grant from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation, which also financed a wing
in the new business school building, the Stan
ford-Sloan program is a nine - month, full-time
program for 30- to 40-ycar-old businessmen.

A similar program, the Executive Develop
ment Program, is offered for eight weeks in
the summer and is now entering its 15th year.
Also offered in the summer is a four-week
Transportation Management Program for
traffic and transportation executives. United
States Armed Forces have sent many officers
to participate in this program.
A pioneer program at Stanford in 1962 is
the International Center for the Advance
ment of Management Education. This pro
gram gathers businessmen and teachers from
developing countries all around the world for
an eight-month program designed to improve
the economy of the developing countries by
improving business education and business
practice.
For the first time in July all these programs
will be together in one building, and it is
hoped by business school officials that all
will benefit from the contact.
