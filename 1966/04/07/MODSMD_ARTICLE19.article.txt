Business students study late into the evening in the
Jackson Library of Business located in the old school's
main building on the front of Quad. The library will
move across the street to the new School of Business
building during the summer as to be ready for the

return of its users dining Autumn Quarter. The library
is one of many branches of Stanford's Mam Library,
which is also due for a move in the not-too-distant fu
ture.
