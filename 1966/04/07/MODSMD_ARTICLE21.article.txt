# High-Speed Computer To Hit Campus In '67
## 
### 
A major advance in computer
technology called "time-shar
ing" will arrive on campus next
year.
Delivery of the time-sharing
equipment, an IBM 360/67 com
puter system, is scheduled for
the spring of 1967. It should be in
full operation by early summer.
The IBM 360/67 will have five
times the capacity and memory
of the Stanford Computation
Center's present IBM 7090. It
will be able to do a million in
formation manipulations per
second.
Individual Use
But most important will be its
ability to work directly with its
users, seated at as many as 200
remote typewriters in offices,
laboratories, and even homes.
With typewriter-to-computer
connections over ordinary tele
phone lines, it will seem to each
user that the computer is work
ing for him alone. Actually,

many others may be using it
simultaneously. And each user
will be able to take his time
without holding up others.
Because computers function
a million to 10 million times
faster than man, current prac
tice is to "batch" 'problems be
fore running them one at a time
through the machine. This
avoids having the machine,
which can execute hundreds of
thousands of characters of in
structions per second, stand
idly by waiting for a user who
can't give more than a dozen
or so instructions per minute.
Idle Time
Instead of this, the new sys
tern will be able to spend a few
hundredths of a second on first
one and then another, spreading
itself around among many
users. There will be little or no
waiting for one's turn on the
machine, and less waste of the
machine in idle time.
The Computation Center's
IBM 7090 will be phased out by
the fall of 1967 and sold, accord
ing to Prof. Edward A. Feigen
baum, the director. The Center's
Burroughs B-5500 computer will
probably continue in use until
June 1968.
The IBM 360/67's multi-mil
lion-dollar cost will be covered
by Stanford funds, grants from
the National Science Founda
tion, hourly use charges, gifts
and other sources.
About 3,000 members or one
fourth of the Stanford comunity
are now using the computers,
Prof. Feigenbaum estimates.
This includes a turnover of
about 1,000 new student users
every year, replacing as many
who graduate.

simultaneously. And each user
will be able to take his time
without holding up others.
Because computers function
a million to 10 million times
faster than man, current prac
tice is to "batch" 'problems be
fore running them one at a time
through the machine. This
avoids having the machine,
which can execute hundreds of
thousands of characters of in
structions per second, stand
idly by waiting for a user who
can't give more than a dozen
or so instructions per minute.
Idle Time
Instead of this, the new sys
tern will be able to spend a few
hundredths of a second on first
one and then another, spreading
itself around among many
users. There will be little or no
waiting for one's turn on the
machine, and less waste of the
machine in idle time.
The Computation Center's
IBM 7090 will be phased out by
the fall of 1967 and sold, accord
ing to Prof. Edward A. Feigen
baum, the director. The Center's
Burroughs B-5500 computer will
probably continue in use until
June 1968.
The IBM 360/67's multi-mil
lion-dollar cost will be covered
by Stanford funds, grants from
the National Science Founda
tion, hourly use charges, gifts
and other sources.
About 3,000 members or one
fourth of the Stanford comunity
are now using the computers,
Prof. Feigenbaum estimates.
This includes a turnover of
about 1,000 new student users
every year, replacing as many
who graduate.
A major advance in computer
technology called "time-shar
ing" will arrive on campus next
year.
Delivery of the time-sharing
equipment, an IBM 360/67 com
puter system, is scheduled for
the spring of 1967. It should be in
full operation by early summer.
The IBM 360/67 will have five
times the capacity and memory
of the Stanford Computation
Center's present IBM 7090. It
will be able to do a million in
formation manipulations per
second.
Individual Use
But most important will be its
ability to work directly with its
users, seated at as many as 200
remote typewriters in offices,
laboratories, and even homes.
With typewriter-to-computer
connections over ordinary tele
phone lines, it will seem to each
user that the computer is work
ing for him alone. Actually,

many others may be using it
simultaneously. And each user
will be able to take his time
