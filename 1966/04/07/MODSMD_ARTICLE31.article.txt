A quick glance at Stanford's track and field results compared to
other AAWU contenders reveals Stanford with the top spot in only
two events, the long jump and the 440-relay. However, the Indians
have produced some fine early-season events that have captured
second place in the battle of statistics four times and third place

three times.
Stanford travels up to Oregon
State this Saturday. Compared
to other AAWU performances
Oregon State has fairly impres
sive marks in the shotput, jave
lin, long jump, and triple jump.
