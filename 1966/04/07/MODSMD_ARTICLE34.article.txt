(Editor's note: The following was written from a
Collegiate Press Service interview with St. Clair
Drake, a widely recognized authority on Ghana
who was a visiting professor of sociology at Stan
ford earlier this year. Professor Drake was chair
man of the Anthropology Department of the Uni
versity of Ghana from 1958 to 1961 and first met
Kwame Nkrumah in London in 1947.)

Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah has taken an unusu
ally severe boating from the press and Washing
ton, according to the man said to know more
about Ghanaian affairs than any other American.
Roosevelt University Professor St. Clair Drake
said recently that the ousted African dictator is
often puzzled by the American attitude toward his
efforts in Ghana.
Drake related that Nkrumah once said, "I don't
understand America. I was in England when Cle
ment socialized the Bank of England, the mines,
and the medical profession, and the U. S. paid for
it. They gave Tito $2 billion to build communism
in Yugoslavia and when the black man says he is
building African socialism, they attack him as a
Soviet puppet and a dangerous red."
Applying Marx
"Although Nkrumah thought Africans should
apply Marx to Africa," Drake commented, "he
never wanted it to become a part of the interna
tional communist movement.
"Even so, the U. S. has always had a suspicion
that Nkrumah's interest was to bring Ghana
into the communist orbit.
"The record will show," he pointed out, "that
in Ghana there has been a consistent policy of
non-alignment and concern for peaceful settle
ment of international problems. There is not yet
one public speech on record in which Nkrumah
has ever attacked the U. S.
"But," he added, "the tendency to ridicule him
by the American press, the failure to take him
seriously, and the attempts to impute personal
motives where serious ideological issues are con
cerned has resulted in a hardening of Nkrumah's
attitude toward the U. S."
Outside Help
As a result, Nkrumah suspects that non-Afri
cans gave encouragement if not actual financial
support and advice to leaders of a recent coup
d'etat that overthrew him.
"I am sure that Nkrumah is convinced the CIA
is behind it," Drake stated. "Nkrumah has felt
ever since his protege Patrice Lumumba was
murdered that Americans were determined to
break up any attempts to form an all-African,
militant socialist movement.
"As a matter of fact, we do have evidence that
someone was financing the opposition because
of the extensive traveling they've done as mem
bers of the exile apparatus."
But though on one hand Nkrumah felt opposi
tion from Americans, he was troubled on the
other by his countrymen's contempt for his
American college education.
Nkrumah actually made considerable prog
ress, both internal and external during his years
as a dictator, according to Professor Drake.
"He greatly furthered the physical improve
ment of the country through building programs
and support for the expansion of the education
al program."

Statistics on Ghana indicate that the number
of primary school children doubled during the
first five years of independence; the number of
high school students tripled during the last ten
years and two universities were established.
Despite these gains, the professor pointed out,
Ghana is still probably 80 per cent illiterate.
In addition to expansion of educational facili
ties, Nkrumah developed better roads, hospitals
and a seaport.
"With respect to external affairs," commented
Drake, "no person has contributed more to the
movement for independence throughout Africa
than Nkrumah. This may have been his undo
ing."
"It would be difficult," he continued, "to as
sess the extent of his popularity at the time of
the coup. I was there all summer, and while
there was considerable grumbling about occa
sional shortages of commodities, I thought this
was normal griping and not opposition to the
regime.
"I doubt whether lack of resistance as seemed
evident during the coup is an index of the feel
ings of the people," he added. "All coups in Af
rica have been accepted by the people. There is
no history of resistance to coups in general and
no history of resistance to authority when an
African is in power.
"It will be interesting to see what will happen
if Nkrumah tries to reestablish his power," he
added.
Nkrumah has said he is going to make an at
tempt to regain his position and has called upon
the outside world not to recognize the coup.
Traditional Methods
"Nkrumah has been invited to Guinea," said
Drake, "to set up a base for infiltrating Ghana.
He will probably use traditional methods: estab
lishing an underground, and using the radio to
build a small, dedicated band of adherents to his
party.
"If violence is considered necessary," Nkrumah
will use it,"he predicted. "Nkrumah will take
any means necessary to regain power. There
could be a period of sabotage and guerilla war
fare."
Drake indicated that the military leaders who
now hold the country will eventually be forced
to imitate Nkrumah's procedures for meeting
governmental problems.
"They will face the same social, economic
and political problems," he commented, "and
my guess is that they can't handle them any dif
ferently."
Despite the premier's decisions to imprison
political opponents Drake claims Nkrumah was
not a truly despotic dictator.
"A one party state can be either democratic
or undemocratic, depending on the way it oper
ates," he explained. "To begin with, Ghana was
among the last of the African states to install
a one party system.
"There were at least four blocks within the
party whose points of view found expression.
Nkrumah had to make decisions in terms of the
balance of strength among the factions in the
party—what he thought the traffic would bear.
"This is very difficult from arbitrary personal
decisions, as opposed, for instance, to the situa
tion in Liberia. Nkrumah, Drake concluded, "was
not a personal dictator."

of the extensive traveling they've done as mem
bers of the exile apparatus."
But though on one hand Nkrumah felt opposi
tion from Americans, he was troubled on the
other by his countrymen's contempt for his
American college education.
Nkrumah actually made considerable prog
ress, both internal and external during his years
as a dictator, according to Professor Drake.
"He greatly furthered the physical improve
ment of the country through building programs
and support for the expansion of the education
al program."

Statistics on Ghana indicate that the number
of primary school children doubled during the
first five years of independence; the number of
high school students tripled during the last ten
years and two universities were established.
Despite these gains, the professor pointed out,
Ghana is still probably 80 per cent illiterate.
In addition to expansion of educational facili
ties, Nkrumah developed better roads, hospitals
and a seaport.
"With respect to external affairs," commented
Drake, "no person has contributed more to the
movement for independence throughout Africa
than Nkrumah. This may have been his undo
ing."
"It would be difficult," he continued, "to as
sess the extent of his popularity at the time of
the coup. I was there all summer, and while
there was considerable grumbling about occa
sional shortages of commodities, I thought this
was normal griping and not opposition to the
regime.
"I doubt whether lack of resistance as seemed
evident during the coup is an index of the feel
ings of the people," he added. "All coups in Af
rica have been accepted by the people. There is
no history of resistance to coups in general and
no history of resistance to authority when an
African is in power.
"It will be interesting to see what will happen
if Nkrumah tries to reestablish his power," he
added.
Nkrumah has said he is going to make an at
tempt to regain his position and has called upon
the outside world not to recognize the coup.
Traditional Methods
"Nkrumah has been invited to Guinea," said
Drake, "to set up a base for infiltrating Ghana.
He will probably use traditional methods: estab
lishing an underground, and using the radio to
build a small, dedicated band of adherents to his
party.
"If violence is considered necessary," Nkrumah
will use it,"he predicted. "Nkrumah will take
any means necessary to regain power. There
could be a period of sabotage and guerilla war
fare."
Drake indicated that the military leaders who
now hold the country will eventually be forced
to imitate Nkrumah's procedures for meeting
governmental problems.
"They will face the same social, economic
and political problems," he commented, "and
my guess is that they can't handle them any dif
ferently."
Despite the premier's decisions to imprison
political opponents Drake claims Nkrumah was
not a truly despotic dictator.
"A one party state can be either democratic
or undemocratic, depending on the way it oper
ates," he explained. "To begin with, Ghana was
among the last of the African states to install
a one party system.
"There were at least four blocks within the
party whose points of view found expression.
Nkrumah had to make decisions in terms of the
balance of strength among the factions in the
party—what he thought the traffic would bear.
"This is very difficult from arbitrary personal
decisions, as opposed, for instance, to the situa
tion in Liberia. Nkrumah, Drake concluded, "was
not a personal dictator."

Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah has taken an unusu
ally severe boating from the press and Washing
ton, according to the man said to know more
about Ghanaian affairs than any other American.
Roosevelt University Professor St. Clair Drake
said recently that the ousted African dictator is
often puzzled by the American attitude toward his
efforts in Ghana.
Drake related that Nkrumah once said, "I don't
understand America. I was in England when Cle
ment socialized the Bank of England, the mines,
and the medical profession, and the U. S. paid for
it. They gave Tito $2 billion to build communism
in Yugoslavia and when the black man says he is
building African socialism, they attack him as a
Soviet puppet and a dangerous red."
Applying Marx
"Although Nkrumah thought Africans should
apply Marx to Africa," Drake commented, "he
never wanted it to become a part of the interna
tional communist movement.
"Even so, the U. S. has always had a suspicion
that Nkrumah's interest was to bring Ghana
into the communist orbit.
"The record will show," he pointed out, "that
in Ghana there has been a consistent policy of
non-alignment and concern for peaceful settle
ment of international problems. There is not yet
one public speech on record in which Nkrumah
has ever attacked the U. S.
"But," he added, "the tendency to ridicule him
by the American press, the failure to take him
seriously, and the attempts to impute personal
motives where serious ideological issues are con
cerned has resulted in a hardening of Nkrumah's
attitude toward the U. S."
Outside Help
As a result, Nkrumah suspects that non-Afri
cans gave encouragement if not actual financial
support and advice to leaders of a recent coup
d'etat that overthrew him.
"I am sure that Nkrumah is convinced the CIA
is behind it," Drake stated. "Nkrumah has felt
ever since his protege Patrice Lumumba was
murdered that Americans were determined to
break up any attempts to form an all-African,
militant socialist movement.
"As a matter of fact, we do have evidence that
someone was financing the opposition because

Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah has taken an unusu
ally severe boating from the press and Washing
ton, according to the man said to know more
about Ghanaian affairs than any other American.
Roosevelt University Professor St. Clair Drake
said recently that the ousted African dictator is
often puzzled by the American attitude toward his
efforts in Ghana.
Drake related that Nkrumah once said, "I don't
understand America. I was in England when Cle
ment socialized the Bank of England, the mines,
and the medical profession, and the U. S. paid for
it. They gave Tito $2 billion to build communism
in Yugoslavia and when the black man says he is
building African socialism, they attack him as a
Soviet puppet and a dangerous red."
Applying Marx
"Although Nkrumah thought Africans should
apply Marx to Africa," Drake commented, "he
never wanted it to become a part of the interna
tional communist movement.
"Even so, the U. S. has always had a suspicion
that Nkrumah's interest was to bring Ghana
into the communist orbit.
"The record will show," he pointed out, "that
in Ghana there has been a consistent policy of
non-alignment and concern for peaceful settle
ment of international problems. There is not yet
one public speech on record in which Nkrumah
has ever attacked the U. S.
"But," he added, "the tendency to ridicule him
by the American press, the failure to take him
seriously, and the attempts to impute personal
motives where serious ideological issues are con
cerned has resulted in a hardening of Nkrumah's
attitude toward the U. S."
Outside Help
As a result, Nkrumah suspects that non-Afri
cans gave encouragement if not actual financial
support and advice to leaders of a recent coup
d'etat that overthrew him.
"I am sure that Nkrumah is convinced the CIA
is behind it," Drake stated. "Nkrumah has felt
ever since his protege Patrice Lumumba was
murdered that Americans were determined to
break up any attempts to form an all-African,
militant socialist movement.
"As a matter of fact, we do have evidence that
someone was financing the opposition because
of the extensive traveling they've done as mem
bers of the exile apparatus."
But though on one hand Nkrumah felt opposi
tion from Americans, he was troubled on the
other by his countrymen's contempt for his
American college education.
Nkrumah actually made considerable prog
ress, both internal and external during his years
as a dictator, according to Professor Drake.
"He greatly furthered the physical improve
ment of the country through building programs
and support for the expansion of the education
al program."

Statistics on Ghana indicate that the number
of primary school children doubled during the
first five years of independence; the number of
high school students tripled during the last ten
years and two universities were established.
Despite these gains, the professor pointed out,
Ghana is still probably 80 per cent illiterate.
In addition to expansion of educational facili
ties, Nkrumah developed better roads, hospitals
and a seaport.
"With respect to external affairs," commented
Drake, "no person has contributed more to the
movement for independence throughout Africa
than Nkrumah. This may have been his undo
ing."
"It would be difficult," he continued, "to as
sess the extent of his popularity at the time of
the coup. I was there all summer, and while
there was considerable grumbling about occa
sional shortages of commodities, I thought this
was normal griping and not opposition to the
regime.
"I doubt whether lack of resistance as seemed
evident during the coup is an index of the feel
ings of the people," he added. "All coups in Af
rica have been accepted by the people. There is
no history of resistance to coups in general and
no history of resistance to authority when an
African is in power.
"It will be interesting to see what will happen
if Nkrumah tries to reestablish his power," he
added.
Nkrumah has said he is going to make an at
tempt to regain his position and has called upon
the outside world not to recognize the coup.
Traditional Methods
"Nkrumah has been invited to Guinea," said
Drake, "to set up a base for infiltrating Ghana.
He will probably use traditional methods: estab
lishing an underground, and using the radio to
build a small, dedicated band of adherents to his
party.
"If violence is considered necessary," Nkrumah
will use it,"he predicted. "Nkrumah will take
any means necessary to regain power. There
could be a period of sabotage and guerilla war
fare."
Drake indicated that the military leaders who
now hold the country will eventually be forced
to imitate Nkrumah's procedures for meeting
governmental problems.
"They will face the same social, economic
and political problems," he commented, "and
my guess is that they can't handle them any dif
ferently."
