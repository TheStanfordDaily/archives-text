# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Men Should Have Draw System Too 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a residential university,
Stanford fails. Although there
are many words, there is little
thought and less action. Mr. Cal
fee and Mr. Freeman (The
Dally, April 6) perpetuate the
dribble which passes for dia
logue at this institution. Both
tenaciously hold to their institu
tions, yet both institutions are
inadequate.
I ask Mr. Freeman to sit with
me in a freshman dorm during
rush and listen and watch a
freshman break down and ery
over a fraternity. I ask Mr.
Freeman to live among fresh
men for six months and then
attend a rush meeting and
watch helplessly as fine men are
judged by their inferiors by any
number of superficial criterion.
In short, a university which
aspires to excellence has no
room for selective rush. It slan
ders intelligence.
What has Mr. Calfee to offer?
Anticeptic dorms. Mr. Calfee
should watch the relief in the
eyes of the freshmen as they
emerge from their neo-penal
surroundings to enter the world
outside. I too, would be willing
to put up with superficiality to
escape the bleakness of Wilbur.
Neither Mr. Calfee's dehuman
izing dorms, nor Mr. Freeman's
Stanford of the early 1950's pre
sent an adequate answer to the
problem of living at a residen
tial university. I would like to
see both men make an honest
effort to improve living at Stan
ford by eliminating both rush
and dorms, replacing them with

a draw system for the fratern
ity houses.

• Rush Dinged
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to focus on one small
but significant aspect of the con
tinuing controversy over the
presence of fraternities at Stan
ford.
Beneath the fog of arguments
and pseudo-arguments, both pro
and con, on the question of the
value of fraternities as an insti
tution lies one irrefutable fact:
Dave Calfee is painfully accur
ate in The Daily, April 6, when
he describes the vicious nature
of the selection process that pre
cedes the offering, or withhold
ing, of the fraternity bid.
Although it takes a subtler
form than a fist in the teeth or
a knee in the groin, there is a
fundamental brutality about the
fraternity (and eating club?)
rushing system which everyone
who cares to think about it
must recognize. Both the rushee
and the rusher are caught up in
a dynamic which does violence
to them both. And it is irrele
vant to argue that in some
cases, once this ordeal is com
pleted, this group or that makes
some kind of "positive" contri
bution to the University com
munity.
I am aware that violence of
one form or another seems to
be an inextricable element in the
structure of human existence.
But the civilized individual ex

presses his commitment to the
ideal of humane behavior by
making a conscientious effort to
reduce the range and force of
its operation, whenever and
wherever possible.
The essential question before
us is whether or not the Uni
versity community, which pre
sumably is dedicated at least in
part to the elevation of human
consciousness and to the forma
tion of character, ought to
tacitly condone the kind of ac
tivity embodied in the rushing
system. There are those who
would answer with an emphatic
"No." I am one of these.
PETER B. DAHL
• Reality?
Editor, The Daily:
March 29, the first day of
classes and the opening of that
pleasant time when Spring re
freshes the University, I turned
to my Daily. I use the possessive
beeause that organ is by and for
the Stanford student and we feel
a kinship with the paper which
may be lacking with other read
ing matter. Unfortunately I was
forced by virtue of the Editorial
Page to confine my attention to
courses and clouds.
In particular, I should like
you to recall some paragraphs
from Mr. Lippmann's column as
well as from the editorial. In the
first we read: "The President
will find all too soon that his
problem is not how to get the
better of Sen. Fulbright or even
Gen. De Ctaulle, but of how to
master the realities which they

are talking about." In The Daily,
however, there ts another reality
under scrutiny: "A change in
Stanford's anachronistic liquor
policy would not transform the
University into a Bacchanal
drinking den. Rather, it would
simply be a recognition of real
ity."
Now I have never once seen
Mr. Lippmann discuss the pro
posal that New York raise its
drinking age to 19%, which
would affect far more people
than a change at Stanford,
especially if State law were to
be observed. It is the responsi
bility of those enabled to articu
late their views to discriminate
the trivial from the important,
the provincial from the catholic;
The Daily's understanding of
reality is far more vain and nar
row than the journalist's.
The final words of the editor
ial are perhaps most insulting.
Does The Daily actually hope
"somewhat futilely, that the
greater society, and especially
the public press will make an
effort to see . . . into the real
need and true desirability of a
modernization of Stanford's li
quor policy?" What kind of so
ciety would, as it were, pick its
teeth, when surely it may re
quire major surgery. Do we
dare hope that The Daily will
see beyond liquor to the prob
lems and issues which ought to
confront the thinking individual.
I have several suggestions
whose value I leave it to you to
judge. First, there is a difficulty
in finding rest rooms near his
tory corner and this, at times, is
most distressing. Second, the ad

dition of coffee vending ma
chines around math corner
would save a long, tiring, walk
to the Union.
Finally, The Daily should be
come conscious of the difference
between liquor and discussion of
liquor. Most are aware of this,
since as "anyone well knows . . .
students already imbibe." Hence
it is almost impossible to be
come intoxicated on our news
paper. To avoid this frustrating
fact, I propose The Daily print
pornography, since that would
both raise the question of free
dom of the press as well as pro
viding vicarious excitement on
those pleasant spring mornings.
JOEL KUGELMASS
(Editor's note: There are
many levels of reality, Mr.
Kugelmass, and those that
ought to confront "the thinking
individual" unfortunately aren't
sufficient in themselves to sup
port a civilized existence. For
instance, an end to the war in
Vietnam will not bring an end
to all hypocrisy.
By our plea for public under
standing, we meant only that
the outside media might examine
the situation at Stanford be
fore faulting it. (Such, however,
hasn't been the case: witness the
Palo Alto Times.) No tooth-pick
ing was intended.
Mr. Kugelmass' spring morn
ings might go better if he keeps
his head up in the clouds, and
thus avoids the problems of the
world around him.)

I am aware that violence of
one form or another seems to

PETER B. DAHL
• Reality?
Editor, The Daily:
March 29, the first day of
classes and the opening of that
pleasant time when Spring re
freshes the University, I turned
to my Daily. I use the possessive
beeause that organ is by and for
the Stanford student and we feel
a kinship with the paper which
may be lacking with other read
ing matter. Unfortunately I was
forced by virtue of the Editorial
Page to confine my attention to
courses and clouds.
In particular, I should like
you to recall some paragraphs
from Mr. Lippmann's column as
well as from the editorial. In the
first we read: "The President
will find all too soon that his
problem is not how to get the
better of Sen. Fulbright or even
Gen. De Ctaulle, but of how to
master the realities which they

are talking about." In The Daily,
however, there ts another reality
under scrutiny: "A change in
Stanford's anachronistic liquor
policy would not transform the
University into a Bacchanal
drinking den. Rather, it would
simply be a recognition of real
ity."
Now I have never once seen
Mr. Lippmann discuss the pro
posal that New York raise its
drinking age to 19%, which
would affect far more people
than a change at Stanford,
especially if State law were to
be observed. It is the responsi
bility of those enabled to articu
late their views to discriminate
the trivial from the important,
the provincial from the catholic;
The Daily's understanding of
reality is far more vain and nar
row than the journalist's.
The final words of the editor
ial are perhaps most insulting.
Does The Daily actually hope
"somewhat futilely, that the
greater society, and especially
the public press will make an
effort to see . . . into the real
need and true desirability of a
modernization of Stanford's li
quor policy?" What kind of so
ciety would, as it were, pick its
teeth, when surely it may re
quire major surgery. Do we
dare hope that The Daily will
see beyond liquor to the prob
lems and issues which ought to
confront the thinking individual.
I have several suggestions
whose value I leave it to you to
judge. First, there is a difficulty
in finding rest rooms near his
tory corner and this, at times, is
most distressing. Second, the ad

dition of coffee vending ma
chines around math corner
would save a long, tiring, walk
to the Union.
Finally, The Daily should be
come conscious of the difference
between liquor and discussion of
liquor. Most are aware of this,
since as "anyone well knows . . .
students already imbibe." Hence
it is almost impossible to be
come intoxicated on our news
paper. To avoid this frustrating
fact, I propose The Daily print
pornography, since that would
both raise the question of free
dom of the press as well as pro
viding vicarious excitement on
those pleasant spring mornings.
JOEL KUGELMASS
(Editor's note: There are
many levels of reality, Mr.
Kugelmass, and those that
ought to confront "the thinking
individual" unfortunately aren't
sufficient in themselves to sup
port a civilized existence. For
instance, an end to the war in
Vietnam will not bring an end
to all hypocrisy.
By our plea for public under
standing, we meant only that
the outside media might examine
the situation at Stanford be
fore faulting it. (Such, however,
hasn't been the case: witness the
Palo Alto Times.) No tooth-pick
ing was intended.
Mr. Kugelmass' spring morn
ings might go better if he keeps
his head up in the clouds, and
thus avoids the problems of the
world around him.)
Editor, The Daily:
As a residential university,
Stanford fails. Although there
are many words, there is little
thought and less action. Mr. Cal
fee and Mr. Freeman (The
Dally, April 6) perpetuate the
dribble which passes for dia
logue at this institution. Both
tenaciously hold to their institu
tions, yet both institutions are
inadequate.
I ask Mr. Freeman to sit with
me in a freshman dorm during
rush and listen and watch a
freshman break down and ery
over a fraternity. I ask Mr.
Freeman to live among fresh
men for six months and then
attend a rush meeting and
watch helplessly as fine men are
judged by their inferiors by any
number of superficial criterion.
In short, a university which
aspires to excellence has no
room for selective rush. It slan
ders intelligence.
What has Mr. Calfee to offer?
Anticeptic dorms. Mr. Calfee
should watch the relief in the
eyes of the freshmen as they
emerge from their neo-penal
surroundings to enter the world
outside. I too, would be willing
to put up with superficiality to
escape the bleakness of Wilbur.
Neither Mr. Calfee's dehuman
izing dorms, nor Mr. Freeman's
Stanford of the early 1950's pre
sent an adequate answer to the
problem of living at a residen
tial university. I would like to
see both men make an honest
effort to improve living at Stan
ford by eliminating both rush
and dorms, replacing them with

a draw system for the fratern
ity houses.

• Rush Dinged
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to focus on one small
but significant aspect of the con
tinuing controversy over the
presence of fraternities at Stan
ford.
Beneath the fog of arguments
and pseudo-arguments, both pro
and con, on the question of the
value of fraternities as an insti
tution lies one irrefutable fact:
Dave Calfee is painfully accur
ate in The Daily, April 6, when
he describes the vicious nature
of the selection process that pre
cedes the offering, or withhold
ing, of the fraternity bid.
Although it takes a subtler
form than a fist in the teeth or
a knee in the groin, there is a
fundamental brutality about the
fraternity (and eating club?)
rushing system which everyone
who cares to think about it
must recognize. Both the rushee
and the rusher are caught up in
a dynamic which does violence
to them both. And it is irrele
vant to argue that in some
cases, once this ordeal is com
pleted, this group or that makes
some kind of "positive" contri
bution to the University com
munity.
I am aware that violence of
one form or another seems to

see beyond liquor to the prob

I have several suggestions
whose value I leave it to you to
judge. First, there is a difficulty
in finding rest rooms near his
tory corner and this, at times, is
most distressing. Second, the ad

would save a long, tiring, walk
to the Union.
Finally, The Daily should be
come conscious of the difference
between liquor and discussion of
liquor. Most are aware of this,
since as "anyone well knows . . .
students already imbibe." Hence
it is almost impossible to be
come intoxicated on our news
paper. To avoid this frustrating
fact, I propose The Daily print
pornography, since that would
both raise the question of free
dom of the press as well as pro
viding vicarious excitement on
those pleasant spring mornings.

(Editor's note: There are
many levels of reality, Mr.
Kugelmass, and those that
ought to confront "the thinking
individual" unfortunately aren't
sufficient in themselves to sup
port a civilized existence. For
instance, an end to the war in
Vietnam will not bring an end
to all hypocrisy.
By our plea for public under
standing, we meant only that
the outside media might examine
the situation at Stanford be
fore faulting it. (Such, however,
hasn't been the case: witness the
Palo Alto Times.) No tooth-pick
ing was intended.
Mr. Kugelmass' spring morn
ings might go better if he keeps
his head up in the clouds, and
thus avoids the problems of the
world around him.)
Editor, The Daily:
As a residential university,
Stanford fails. Although there
are many words, there is little
thought and less action. Mr. Cal
fee and Mr. Freeman (The
Dally, April 6) perpetuate the
dribble which passes for dia
logue at this institution. Both
tenaciously hold to their institu
tions, yet both institutions are
inadequate.
I ask Mr. Freeman to sit with
me in a freshman dorm during
rush and listen and watch a
freshman break down and ery
over a fraternity. I ask Mr.
Freeman to live among fresh
men for six months and then
attend a rush meeting and
watch helplessly as fine men are
judged by their inferiors by any
number of superficial criterion.
In short, a university which
aspires to excellence has no
room for selective rush. It slan
ders intelligence.
What has Mr. Calfee to offer?
Anticeptic dorms. Mr. Calfee
should watch the relief in the
eyes of the freshmen as they
emerge from their neo-penal
surroundings to enter the world
outside. I too, would be willing
to put up with superficiality to
escape the bleakness of Wilbur.
Neither Mr. Calfee's dehuman
izing dorms, nor Mr. Freeman's
Stanford of the early 1950's pre
sent an adequate answer to the
problem of living at a residen
tial university. I would like to
see both men make an honest
effort to improve living at Stan
ford by eliminating both rush
and dorms, replacing them with

a draw system for the fratern
ity houses.

• Rush Dinged
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to focus on one small
but significant aspect of the con
tinuing controversy over the
presence of fraternities at Stan
ford.
Beneath the fog of arguments
and pseudo-arguments, both pro
and con, on the question of the
value of fraternities as an insti
tution lies one irrefutable fact:
Dave Calfee is painfully accur
ate in The Daily, April 6, when
he describes the vicious nature
of the selection process that pre
cedes the offering, or withhold
ing, of the fraternity bid.
Although it takes a subtler
form than a fist in the teeth or
a knee in the groin, there is a
fundamental brutality about the
fraternity (and eating club?)
rushing system which everyone
who cares to think about it
must recognize. Both the rushee
and the rusher are caught up in
a dynamic which does violence
to them both. And it is irrele
vant to argue that in some
cases, once this ordeal is com
pleted, this group or that makes
some kind of "positive" contri
bution to the University com
munity.
I am aware that violence of
one form or another seems to
be an inextricable element in the
structure of human existence.
But the civilized individual ex

presses his commitment to the
ideal of humane behavior by
making a conscientious effort to
reduce the range and force of
its operation, whenever and
wherever possible.
The essential question before
us is whether or not the Uni
versity community, which pre
sumably is dedicated at least in
part to the elevation of human
consciousness and to the forma
tion of character, ought to
tacitly condone the kind of ac
tivity embodied in the rushing
system. There are those who
would answer with an emphatic
"No." I am one of these.
PETER B. DAHL
• Reality?
Editor, The Daily:
March 29, the first day of
classes and the opening of that
pleasant time when Spring re
freshes the University, I turned
to my Daily. I use the possessive
beeause that organ is by and for
the Stanford student and we feel
a kinship with the paper which
may be lacking with other read
ing matter. Unfortunately I was
forced by virtue of the Editorial
Page to confine my attention to
courses and clouds.
In particular, I should like
you to recall some paragraphs
from Mr. Lippmann's column as
well as from the editorial. In the
first we read: "The President
will find all too soon that his
problem is not how to get the
better of Sen. Fulbright or even
Gen. De Ctaulle, but of how to
master the realities which they

are talking about." In The Daily,
however, there ts another reality
under scrutiny: "A change in
Stanford's anachronistic liquor
policy would not transform the
University into a Bacchanal
drinking den. Rather, it would
simply be a recognition of real
ity."
Now I have never once seen
Mr. Lippmann discuss the pro
posal that New York raise its
drinking age to 19%, which
would affect far more people
than a change at Stanford,
especially if State law were to
be observed. It is the responsi
bility of those enabled to articu
late their views to discriminate
the trivial from the important,
the provincial from the catholic;
The Daily's understanding of
reality is far more vain and nar
row than the journalist's.
The final words of the editor
ial are perhaps most insulting.
Does The Daily actually hope
"somewhat futilely, that the
greater society, and especially
the public press will make an
effort to see . . . into the real
need and true desirability of a
modernization of Stanford's li
quor policy?" What kind of so
ciety would, as it were, pick its
teeth, when surely it may re
quire major surgery. Do we
dare hope that The Daily will
see beyond liquor to the prob
lems and issues which ought to
confront the thinking individual.

to put up with superficiality to
escape the bleakness of Wilbur.
Neither Mr. Calfee's dehuman
izing dorms, nor Mr. Freeman's
Stanford of the early 1950's pre
sent an adequate answer to the
problem of living at a residen
tial university. I would like to
see both men make an honest
effort to improve living at Stan
ford by eliminating both rush
and dorms, replacing them with

a draw system for the fratern
ity houses.

• Rush Dinged
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to focus on one small
but significant aspect of the con
tinuing controversy over the
presence of fraternities at Stan
ford.
Beneath the fog of arguments
and pseudo-arguments, both pro
and con, on the question of the
value of fraternities as an insti
tution lies one irrefutable fact:
Dave Calfee is painfully accur
ate in The Daily, April 6, when
he describes the vicious nature
of the selection process that pre
cedes the offering, or withhold
ing, of the fraternity bid.
Although it takes a subtler
form than a fist in the teeth or
a knee in the groin, there is a
fundamental brutality about the
fraternity (and eating club?)
rushing system which everyone
who cares to think about it
must recognize. Both the rushee
and the rusher are caught up in
a dynamic which does violence
to them both. And it is irrele
vant to argue that in some
cases, once this ordeal is com
pleted, this group or that makes
some kind of "positive" contri
bution to the University com
munity.
I am aware that violence of
one form or another seems to
be an inextricable element in the
structure of human existence.
But the civilized individual ex

presses his commitment to the
ideal of humane behavior by
making a conscientious effort to
reduce the range and force of
its operation, whenever and
wherever possible.
The essential question before
us is whether or not the Uni
versity community, which pre
sumably is dedicated at least in
part to the elevation of human
consciousness and to the forma
tion of character, ought to
tacitly condone the kind of ac
tivity embodied in the rushing
system. There are those who
would answer with an emphatic
"No." I am one of these.

• Reality?
Editor, The Daily:
March 29, the first day of
classes and the opening of that
pleasant time when Spring re
freshes the University, I turned
to my Daily. I use the possessive
beeause that organ is by and for
the Stanford student and we feel
a kinship with the paper which
may be lacking with other read
ing matter. Unfortunately I was
forced by virtue of the Editorial
Page to confine my attention to
courses and clouds.
In particular, I should like
you to recall some paragraphs
from Mr. Lippmann's column as
well as from the editorial. In the
first we read: "The President
will find all too soon that his
problem is not how to get the
better of Sen. Fulbright or even
Gen. De Ctaulle, but of how to
master the realities which they

are talking about." In The Daily,
however, there ts another reality
under scrutiny: "A change in
Stanford's anachronistic liquor
policy would not transform the
University into a Bacchanal
drinking den. Rather, it would
simply be a recognition of real
ity."
Now I have never once seen
Mr. Lippmann discuss the pro
posal that New York raise its
drinking age to 19%, which
would affect far more people
than a change at Stanford,
especially if State law were to
be observed. It is the responsi
bility of those enabled to articu
late their views to discriminate
the trivial from the important,
the provincial from the catholic;
The Daily's understanding of
reality is far more vain and nar
row than the journalist's.
The final words of the editor
ial are perhaps most insulting.
Does The Daily actually hope
"somewhat futilely, that the
greater society, and especially
the public press will make an
effort to see . . . into the real
need and true desirability of a
modernization of Stanford's li
quor policy?" What kind of so
ciety would, as it were, pick its
teeth, when surely it may re
quire major surgery. Do we
dare hope that The Daily will
see beyond liquor to the prob
lems and issues which ought to
confront the thinking individual.
I have several suggestions
whose value I leave it to you to
judge. First, there is a difficulty
in finding rest rooms near his
tory corner and this, at times, is
most distressing. Second, the ad

dition of coffee vending ma
chines around math corner
would save a long, tiring, walk
to the Union.
Finally, The Daily should be
come conscious of the difference
between liquor and discussion of
liquor. Most are aware of this,
since as "anyone well knows . . .
students already imbibe." Hence
it is almost impossible to be
come intoxicated on our news
paper. To avoid this frustrating
fact, I propose The Daily print
pornography, since that would
both raise the question of free
dom of the press as well as pro
viding vicarious excitement on
those pleasant spring mornings.
JOEL KUGELMASS
(Editor's note: There are
many levels of reality, Mr.
Kugelmass, and those that
ought to confront "the thinking
individual" unfortunately aren't
sufficient in themselves to sup
port a civilized existence. For
instance, an end to the war in
Vietnam will not bring an end
to all hypocrisy.
By our plea for public under
standing, we meant only that
the outside media might examine
the situation at Stanford be
fore faulting it. (Such, however,
hasn't been the case: witness the
Palo Alto Times.) No tooth-pick
ing was intended.
Mr. Kugelmass' spring morn
ings might go better if he keeps
his head up in the clouds, and
thus avoids the problems of the
world around him.)
Editor, The Daily:
As a residential university,
Stanford fails. Although there
are many words, there is little
thought and less action. Mr. Cal
fee and Mr. Freeman (The
Dally, April 6) perpetuate the
dribble which passes for dia
logue at this institution. Both
tenaciously hold to their institu
tions, yet both institutions are
inadequate.
I ask Mr. Freeman to sit with
me in a freshman dorm during
rush and listen and watch a
freshman break down and ery
over a fraternity. I ask Mr.
Freeman to live among fresh
men for six months and then
attend a rush meeting and
watch helplessly as fine men are
judged by their inferiors by any
number of superficial criterion.
In short, a university which
aspires to excellence has no
room for selective rush. It slan
ders intelligence.
What has Mr. Calfee to offer?
Anticeptic dorms. Mr. Calfee
should watch the relief in the
eyes of the freshmen as they
emerge from their neo-penal
surroundings to enter the world
outside. I too, would be willing
to put up with superficiality to
escape the bleakness of Wilbur.
Neither Mr. Calfee's dehuman
izing dorms, nor Mr. Freeman's
Stanford of the early 1950's pre
sent an adequate answer to the
problem of living at a residen
tial university. I would like to
