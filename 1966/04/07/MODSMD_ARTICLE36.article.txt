## Politics In Britain And Here 
### Walter Lippmann 
While Harold Wilson's victory
is not at all comparable in size
to President Johnson's victory
in 1964, it raises some of the
same questions. The most inter
esting, perhaps, is how long the
middle ground between the ex
tremes can be held by the tactic
of obscuring the critical and vi
tal issues.
License
Mr. Wilson's position is frag
ile in that it is a license to find
the remedy for the stagnation of
the British economy without its
being a mandate to carry out
any specific remedy. There is
implied in Mr. Wilson's mandate
the assumption that the labor
government will not try to solve
the economic problem whether
by a big deflation, bringing with
it large unemployment, or by

devaluing the pound sterling.
Nor does Mr. Wilson take office
on the basis of any agreed for
eign policy, be it in Europe or
east of Suez.
Mr. Wilson, like Mr. Johnson,
has won a great reputation as a
political tactician. But he is like
ly to find, as Mr. Johnson is be
ginning to find, that it takes
more than ingenious tactics to
make or to hold together a last
ing consensus.
Similarities
Politically speaking, Mr. Wil
son and Mr. Johnson have in
common the fact that in both
countries the opposition party is
divided and in disarray. Presi
dent Johnson's huge majority in
1964 was in very considerable
measure a vote to reject Barry
Goldwater. Although the polls

continue to give the President a
popular support of around 60%,
it is patent that there has been
a breakdown of Democratic
unity as it appeared in 1964.
The Democratic Party has be
come deeply divided over the
Vietnamese war, and on the is
sue of the war the President is,
in fact, relying for moral sup
port upon a coalition with the
Republican old guard.
When we look at the Presi
dent's vehement supporters, as
Sens. Russell Long, Richard
Russell, Everett Dirksen and
Bert Hickenlooper, we see here
there has come to lift again the
coalition of Southern Democrats
and conservative Republicans
which ruled Congress until the
landslide of 1964.
That such a revival is indeed

occurring is attested to by the
growing pressure on the Presi
dent to submerge the Johnson
welfare program (the Great So
ciety) in order to pay for the
Vietnamese war without in
creasing taxes. The old guard
Republicans may thus be able
to cripple the Democratic re
forms, which they decree, in re
turn for giving the President a
support in the war which he can
not find in his own party.
We may say, I think, that the
British election was indecisive
in that, despite Mr. Wilson's
rather large majority in the
House of Commons, there is no
working consensus behind him
either in domestic or in foreign
affairs. When Mr. Johnson was
elected, on the other hand, he
had an effective consensus be
hind him. He has since lost it
not only in foreign affairs, but
also in domestic affairs.
The consensus of 1964 is being
replaced by the old bipartisan
coalition of the right which was
dominant under President Ei
senhower, which did so much
to frustrate President Kennedy.
Breakdown
If we ask ourselves what has
caused the breakdown of the
Johnson consensus of 1964, I
think we must remember first
that the consensus was formed
during the election campaign of
1964. The Johnson position
rested on a commitment to de
vote his administration primari
ly to the solution of the long
neglected internal problems of
our changing society.
This commitment implied that
in foreign affairs the Johnson
administration would shun the
jingoism of Barry Goldwater
and would play a quiet role
avoiding the interventions of the
postwar period.
The Johnson consensus of
1964 has been broken by the
abandonment of the commit
ments of 1964, indeed by a re
versal of the commitments —
the decision to fight an Ameri
can war in Vietnam and the
subordination of the commit
ment to deal with our domestic
problems as secondary to the
war.
All of which goes to show that
a consensus does not r*>st on
blurring and fudging the issues,
but on reaching clear under
standing on the great issues.
