## General Nixon vs. Poverty 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Mr. Richard Nixon has issued
a statement on the poverty pro
gram, and those conservatives
who looked forward eagerly to
seeing it will be disappointed. It
has about it an air of triviality,
concentrating its criticisms for
the most part on the bureau
cratic excesses of the existing
program.
Heaven knows these are many

and indefensible, but it is just
possible that Mr. Nixon's failure
to reach beyond them reflects
the intellectual impoverishment
of the Republican Party.
Mr. Nixon made one striking
point in his manifesto, namely,
that unless we succeed in fight
ing inflation we shall hardly
succeed in fighting poverty. The
reductions in purchasing power,

especially hard on older people
who live on pensions, far exceed
the projected benefits from the
patchwork poverty program.
Inflation not only corrodes the
people's savings, but dampens
the instinct to thrift, which in
stinct is among the major pro
pellants that drive men up from
poverty. The spendthrift, infla
tionary society actively wor
sens the plight of the poor and
passively induces that disconso
lation which is the worst enemy
of the poor.
Shortcoming
Mr. Nixon went on to point
out the shortcomings typical of
federal welfare programs. The
poverty program is definitely In
politics, Mr. Nixon observed,
and we should extend the pro
visions of the Hatch Act to pov
erty workers, denying them,
even as civil service workers are
denied, the privilege of making
politics while on the federal pay
roll.
We should indeed depress the
extraordinary salaries of some
of poverty's generals, which
here and there exceed the sala
ries of the mayors of the cities
they encamp in. And yes, by all
means, we should have what Mr.
Nixon calls a "Committee on the
Conduct of the War" to oversee
the administration of the pro
gram, plug the leaks, discourage
wastes, etc., etc.
What Mr. Nixon did not touch
on was the question whether we
truly understaand poverty, and if
so, whether the federal govern
ment is equipped to do other
than to administer to a single
aspect of the problem. Mr. Ir
ving Kristol of New York, a re
nowned liberal editor and com
mentator, has observed that,
read in a certain way, the rhe
toric on the subject encourages
the conclusion that poverty is a
statistical segment, say the low
est one-third, or the lowest one
fifth, of the population; and
therefore by definition "pover
ty" will never cease to exist.
(By today's standards — under
$3,000 yearly income — over
50% of all Americans in the
exuberant year of 1929 were
poor.) In fact, in purely mate
rial terms the poverty problem
is largely being taken care of by
our superbly efficient economic
system faster than the federal

government could ever manage
it.
Residual Problem
Even so, there is a grave resi
dual problem. There is aliena
tion. There is moral listlessness,
a lack of self-discipline, a dere
lict mentality. "The poo r,"
writes the journalist and author
Paul Jacobs, "are not so much
physical as psychological pau
pers." "Poverty," says the econ
omist Henry Wallich, "seems to
be primarily a social condition."
And it is the same old heresy
which distinguishes this cen
tury, to suppose that govern
ment can do everything: put an
end to loneliness, infuse a pur
pose into wayward lives, stir the
moral imagination. Yes, govern
ment is a great money-collector,
and an even greater money
spender—and money most cer
tainly figures in the problem
even of psychological paupery.
But it is by no means obvious
that the ethos the poverty pro
gram so sorely needs to develop
will be generated by the existing
programs.
What is needed is a true and
searching alternative. Mr. Nixon
has endorsed the idea of tax de
ductions for industrial firms
which will train the unskilled.
That is in the right direction.
But a solid alternative to gov
ernment-directed poverty pro
grams, short of those that re
quire emergency material help,
should be suggested by Repub
lican leaders.
Gunghoism
Mr. Nixon certainly qualifies
as a Republican leader, but he
should be encouraged to drop
the cant about poverty, the
gunghoism which is a substitue
for true criticism. "By adopting
(my) proposals," he writes, "we
can reverse the tide of defeat
and put the nation back on the
road to victory in the one war
in which all Americans agree
there can be no appeasement
and no surrender."
This American disagrees.
There will have to be appease
ment, and even surrender on oc
casion, because poverty is not
an enemy that can be disposed
of the way a Vietcong guerrilla
can be. The first contribution to
a sane discussion of the prob
lem would require junking the
phony military terminology.
What say, General Nixon?
