# Manet Combines Best Of Both Historical, Genre Traditions
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
The controversy over Manet is im
pressive, almost monumental. His
early compositions were labelled
"strange," "experiments," even "in
competent."
Professor Gerald Ackerman of the
Stanford Art and Architecture faculty
traced this controversy last night for
a near capacity crowd in the Physics
Lecture Hall as he spoke on "Manet
and Gerome."
Later scholars have discovered cer
tain traditional elements in Manet's
style that tone down his revolution
ary reputation. "It is difficult for us
to judge this artist. We are blinded
because we know what a great
painter he became," Ackerman ex
plained.
Manet was born in 1832, painting

during a period when artists were
torn between the realism movement
of their contemporaries and the per
fection inherent in the nature of their
craft. He studied the works of the
ancient masters, yet he was always
attracted toward free painting, labor
ing to record what he saw in the
world around him.
During the 1860's, the charge that
artists had copied figures from old
masters was almost criminal, Acker
man continued. Manet was accused
both of emulating past masterpieces
and of violating the popular rules of
perspective and composition.
His painting ,"Lunch on the Grass,"
showing a nude model accompanied
by two fully-dressed gentlemen, could
be compared with an earlier work by
Raphael and another by Marcantonio
Raimondi. Yet even this distinguished
lineage could not soothe his shocked
audiences who viewed the relaxed
young lady posed next to the clothed
figures in an outdoor setting.
Perhaps the most puzzling of
Manet's works in Ackerman's view is
his "Dead Toreador." With appropri
ate slides, the lecturer illustrated the
history of this work. An expert on
19th Century painting, Ackerman in
troduced the creations of Jean Leon
Gerome and showed their influence
on Manet, especially in regard to "The
Dead Toreador."
Gerome's "Death of Caesar" with
its foreshortened torso probably the
work that inspired Manet's Toredor,
Ackerman surmised. He pointed to
other similarities in the two men's
styles, and though he has yet to dis
cover any written proof of their
friendship, he felt that the two mas
ters must have had a close personal
relationship.
He concluded his remarks with the
slide of Manet's "Lunch in the Studio"
pointing out that this painting illu
strates Manet's integration of the his
torical and the realistic. He gave the
dignity of the past to the genre
scenes of his day.

both of emulating past masterpieces
and of violating the popular rules of
perspective and composition.
His painting ,"Lunch on the Grass,"
showing a nude model accompanied
by two fully-dressed gentlemen, could
be compared with an earlier work by
Raphael and another by Marcantonio
Raimondi. Yet even this distinguished
lineage could not soothe his shocked
audiences who viewed the relaxed
young lady posed next to the clothed
figures in an outdoor setting.
Perhaps the most puzzling of
Manet's works in Ackerman's view is
his "Dead Toreador." With appropri
ate slides, the lecturer illustrated the
history of this work. An expert on
19th Century painting, Ackerman in
troduced the creations of Jean Leon
Gerome and showed their influence
on Manet, especially in regard to "The
Dead Toreador."
Gerome's "Death of Caesar" with
its foreshortened torso probably the
work that inspired Manet's Toredor,
Ackerman surmised. He pointed to
other similarities in the two men's
styles, and though he has yet to dis
cover any written proof of their
friendship, he felt that the two mas
ters must have had a close personal
relationship.
He concluded his remarks with the
slide of Manet's "Lunch in the Studio"
pointing out that this painting illu
strates Manet's integration of the his
torical and the realistic. He gave the
dignity of the past to the genre
scenes of his day.
The controversy over Manet is im
pressive, almost monumental. His
early compositions were labelled
"strange," "experiments," even "in
competent."
Professor Gerald Ackerman of the
Stanford Art and Architecture faculty
traced this controversy last night for
a near capacity crowd in the Physics
Lecture Hall as he spoke on "Manet
and Gerome."
Later scholars have discovered cer
tain traditional elements in Manet's
style that tone down his revolution
ary reputation. "It is difficult for us
to judge this artist. We are blinded
because we know what a great
painter he became," Ackerman ex
plained.
Manet was born in 1832, painting

during a period when artists were
torn between the realism movement
of their contemporaries and the per
fection inherent in the nature of their
craft. He studied the works of the
ancient masters, yet he was always
attracted toward free painting, labor
ing to record what he saw in the
world around him.
During the 1860's, the charge that
artists had copied figures from old
masters was almost criminal, Acker
man continued. Manet was accused
both of emulating past masterpieces
and of violating the popular rules of
perspective and composition.
