# Timid Students Plague TMU
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
For thousands of years philosoph
ers have been mulling over the prob
lem of a just distribution of the finer
things in life.
But Tresidder Union has a distribu
tion problem which has stumped a
host of efficiency experts, a Stanford
Nobel prize winner, and most likely
any philosopher who has tried to or
der a T-Burger during noon rush.
Just how do you get a T-Burger
without waiting for a milienium and
without abandoning etiquette?
That was the question a group of
students from the Industrial Engi
neering Department set out to an

swer last quarter as part of a class
project.
Plausible Suggestions
Professor Robert Hemmes asked
his IE 100 students to investigate
the workings of the Food Square,
evaluate the operation, and make
some plausible suggestions that
might improve service.
Director of the Food Service Carl
Split gave the group free run of the
operation for a day. With stop watch
and pencil in hand students clocked
the chefs and recorded ordering pat
tern during a typical rush period.
Later key employees were inter
viewed by the group.
Although the Food Square is han
dling more than twice its capacity,
the study found the main problem
was the timid customer and not the
speed of the Tresidder employees.
Gentlemanly Lines
Warned only by small signs on the
beams in the middle of the Food
Square, many students and faculty
are unaware of the "scramble sys
tem" which is the key to the overall
efficiency of the service. Regimented
in so many other ways, customers
often form gentlemanly lines, when
according to "scramble system" they
ought to be proceeding egalitarianism.
The group found students were
even more timid at the grill where
orders are placed for the famous T-
Burger and other viands of the short
order variety. When the scramble sys
tem is working smoothly there is
a constant flow of the burgers being
prepared during the rush hour. Ideal
ly customers can just pick up T-Bur
gcrs and proceed to the next station
without waiting.

"If you were brave enough, you
could just walk right up and grab a
burger," Jim Chestnut, a member of
the study group told The Daily. But
too many customers simply cast
sheepish looks at their neighbor as
if to say "Is it yours?"
Despite student criticism, the Tres
idder Food Square is far more effi
cient than its customers realize. An
nually, a team of efficiency experts
surveys the operation. Changes are
made regularly, but they are the sort
that students do not see, such as dou
bling the coffee dispersers and im
proving the carbonated drinks.
When it comes to ordering a bur
ger, Chester Berry, Director of Tres
idder Union is proud to say his Food
Square is the fastest on the Penin
sula. Several years ago, Berry con
ducted a comparative shopping tour
with twenty Stanford students.
Hamburger Houses
Berry's group put Kirks, the 'O',
and several other local hamburger
houses to the time test. Students
were amazed at Tresidder time per
formance after the tour.
A Tresidder customer should be
able to get in and out of the Food
Square in less than four minutes, ac
cording to Berry. "I can make it
through the square in one minute,
but then I don't care what I have
for lunch," the Tresidder Director
chuckled.
It is distribution and not the pro
duction side of the Food Square that
posses the most probables, Berry not
ed. If some people are shy, there is
a brasher segment of the Tresidder
clientele which is tempted by the
scramble system.

Hamburger Houses
Berry's group put Kirks, the 'O',
and several other local hamburger
houses to the time test. Students
were amazed at Tresidder time per
formance after the tour.
A Tresidder customer should be
able to get in and out of the Food
Square in less than four minutes, ac
cording to Berry. "I can make it
through the square in one minute,
but then I don't care what I have
for lunch," the Tresidder Director
chuckled.
It is distribution and not the pro
duction side of the Food Square that
posses the most probables, Berry not
ed. If some people are shy, there is
a brasher segment of the Tresidder
clientele which is tempted by the
scramble system.
For thousands of years philosoph
ers have been mulling over the prob
lem of a just distribution of the finer
things in life.
But Tresidder Union has a distribu
tion problem which has stumped a
host of efficiency experts, a Stanford
Nobel prize winner, and most likely
any philosopher who has tried to or
der a T-Burger during noon rush.
Just how do you get a T-Burger
without waiting for a milienium and
without abandoning etiquette?
That was the question a group of
students from the Industrial Engi
neering Department set out to an

swer last quarter as part of a class
project.
Plausible Suggestions
Professor Robert Hemmes asked
his IE 100 students to investigate
the workings of the Food Square,
evaluate the operation, and make
some plausible suggestions that
might improve service.
Director of the Food Service Carl
Split gave the group free run of the
operation for a day. With stop watch
and pencil in hand students clocked
the chefs and recorded ordering pat
tern during a typical rush period.
Later key employees were inter
viewed by the group.
Although the Food Square is han
dling more than twice its capacity,
the study found the main problem
was the timid customer and not the
speed of the Tresidder employees.
Gentlemanly Lines
Warned only by small signs on the
beams in the middle of the Food
Square, many students and faculty
are unaware of the "scramble sys
tem" which is the key to the overall
efficiency of the service. Regimented
in so many other ways, customers
often form gentlemanly lines, when
according to "scramble system" they
ought to be proceeding egalitarianism.
The group found students were
even more timid at the grill where
orders are placed for the famous T-
Burger and other viands of the short
order variety. When the scramble sys
tem is working smoothly there is
a constant flow of the burgers being
prepared during the rush hour. Ideal
ly customers can just pick up T-Bur
gcrs and proceed to the next station
without waiting.

"If you were brave enough, you
could just walk right up and grab a
burger," Jim Chestnut, a member of
the study group told The Daily. But
too many customers simply cast
sheepish looks at their neighbor as
if to say "Is it yours?"
Despite student criticism, the Tres
idder Food Square is far more effi
cient than its customers realize. An
nually, a team of efficiency experts
surveys the operation. Changes are
made regularly, but they are the sort
that students do not see, such as dou
bling the coffee dispersers and im
proving the carbonated drinks.
When it comes to ordering a bur
ger, Chester Berry, Director of Tres
idder Union is proud to say his Food
Square is the fastest on the Penin
sula. Several years ago, Berry con
ducted a comparative shopping tour
with twenty Stanford students.
