# Pre-Reg To Get 'Personal' Touch
## 
### VICTOR OWEN 
Freshman prc-registration activities
next fall will emphasize a more per
sonal approach with programs to pro
vide a number of opportunities for
individual choice, according to Kit
Anderton, co-chairman of the Pre-Reg
Committee.
The individual attention, he added,
will hopefully decrease the pressured
feeling that the freshman often sertses
as such massive, traditional programs
as the concerts or sports days.
More contact with "responsible"
upper-classmen is another aspect of
the program. The Committee itself
will attempt to be a more personable
group.
Discussion Groups
Among the planned innovations are
voluntary discussion groups after
the Thursday night symposium.
They will meet in private homes
with faculty and university staff to
discuss higher education and what
exactly the freshmen are looking for
in their education.
Other discussion groups on Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday nights will in
vestigate other topics. Instead, there
will be a program to provide small

discussion groups with various pro
fessors and departments on a wide
variety of topics.
The idea is to provide the incoming
freshman with smaller and more in
timate meetings with the faculty and
members of his own class, rather
than the circus-ring effect of the
class-wide and campus-wide functions.
Integration Plan
Reflected in this program is the
plan to integrate the freshman into
the Stanford community. The Com
mittee hopes for more contact with
upper-classmen and faculty. As Me
linda Sewell, co-chairman of the Com
mittee said, the "major emphasis is
on making the freshman feel more
like a Stanford student than simply
a Stanford freshman."
An important change has been
made in the advising program. Stu
dent associates, sponsors, and pre
reg committee will be briefed on the
same information as the faculty ad
visors to supplement their guidance
and to prepare them better to answer
the questions directed at them about
course requirements and curriculum.
The student associates are planning

to publish a booklet with their names,
addresses, dining halls, and majors
so that they can be available and be
contacted to inform and to advise the
freshmen.
How To Study
During one of the morning speech
sessions there will be a panel of up
perclassmen to discuss various as
pects of the freshman year and its
problems. The panel will consider
such things as how to study, how to
take notes from lectures and how to
take finals.
A joint male-female session will be
devoted to an explanation of the
Fundamental Standard, the Honor
Code, and the social regulations. This
is especially for the freshmen men to
understand the regulations under
which their dates must operate and
the consequences of breaking the
rules.
While adding several new programs
the Committee has also attempted
to improve some o ft he older ones
For instance, there are plans for more
specific organization of the activities
on Sport's Day. The psychological
tests have been moved to alternate
davs with registration.

tests have been moved to alternate
davs with registration.
Freshman prc-registration activities
next fall will emphasize a more per
sonal approach with programs to pro
vide a number of opportunities for
individual choice, according to Kit
Anderton, co-chairman of the Pre-Reg
Committee.
The individual attention, he added,
will hopefully decrease the pressured
feeling that the freshman often sertses
as such massive, traditional programs
as the concerts or sports days.
More contact with "responsible"
upper-classmen is another aspect of
the program. The Committee itself
will attempt to be a more personable
group.
Discussion Groups
Among the planned innovations are
voluntary discussion groups after
the Thursday night symposium.
They will meet in private homes
with faculty and university staff to
discuss higher education and what
exactly the freshmen are looking for
in their education.
Other discussion groups on Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday nights will in
vestigate other topics. Instead, there
will be a program to provide small

discussion groups with various pro
fessors and departments on a wide
variety of topics.
The idea is to provide the incoming
freshman with smaller and more in
timate meetings with the faculty and
members of his own class, rather
than the circus-ring effect of the
class-wide and campus-wide functions.
Integration Plan
Reflected in this program is the
plan to integrate the freshman into
the Stanford community. The Com
mittee hopes for more contact with
upper-classmen and faculty. As Me
linda Sewell, co-chairman of the Com
mittee said, the "major emphasis is
on making the freshman feel more
like a Stanford student than simply
a Stanford freshman."
An important change has been
made in the advising program. Stu
dent associates, sponsors, and pre
reg committee will be briefed on the
same information as the faculty ad
visors to supplement their guidance
and to prepare them better to answer
the questions directed at them about
course requirements and curriculum.
The student associates are planning

to publish a booklet with their names,
addresses, dining halls, and majors
so that they can be available and be
contacted to inform and to advise the
freshmen.
How To Study
During one of the morning speech
sessions there will be a panel of up
perclassmen to discuss various as
pects of the freshman year and its
problems. The panel will consider
such things as how to study, how to
take notes from lectures and how to
take finals.
A joint male-female session will be
devoted to an explanation of the
Fundamental Standard, the Honor
Code, and the social regulations. This
is especially for the freshmen men to
understand the regulations under
which their dates must operate and
the consequences of breaking the
rules.
While adding several new programs
the Committee has also attempted
to improve some o ft he older ones
For instance, there are plans for more
specific organization of the activities
on Sport's Day. The psychological
tests have been moved to alternate
davs with registration.
