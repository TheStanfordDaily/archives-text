# AT LASSU TONIGHT:
## Social Regs Set For Reappraisal 
### 
A resolution asking for a special
advisory election to explore the atti
tudes of Stanford women toward pres
ent social regulations will be intro
duced to the legislature this evening.
Women would be asked to indicate
what type of regulations would be
most valid in light of their university
experience, without so alienating par
ents that they would forbid Stanford
attendance. Choices would include no
social regulations, social regulations
for first quarter freshmen only, so
cial regulations for all freshmen, so
cial regulations for all women under
21, or the present system.
According to the resolution intro
duced by Martin Gerry and Bob Klein,
the votes of freedom would be polled
separately from other results.
Three bills will be introduced prior
to consideration by committees.
The first, sponsored by Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, would change the wording of
the By-Laws concerning the Manage
ment Internship Program. The pro
gram Director, appointed at the end
of every year, would be under the di
rect supervision of the Student Fi

nance Manager and would be required
to make written reports to him.
The bill also defines the function of
the program, to secure internship
positions in industrial management
for Stanford students.
Steve Worley is sponsoring the
next bill, asking a $200 appropriation
to buy two portable, electric mega
phones for the coaches to use to com
municate with the crew team.
The final bill would delete the part
of the By-Laws that permits only one
fund raising drive per quarter. This
change was necessitated when the
Con Home drive and a fund raising
drive by the Arnold Air Society both
fell in Spring quarter.
Legislature will be asked to ap
prove the appointment of the new Un
ion Board, selected March 31. The sev
en prospective members include Rick
Bale, Mike Collins, Ron Garrison, Sue
Horst, Ewa Kujaski, Mimi Sherman,
and Doug Sorenson.
Legislature will also continue dis
cussion of Carl Anderson's proposal
that Poli Union be ccnsured for pay
ing Senator Gore $1500 for a speech
and that a committee be formed to
investigate Poli Union methods of
speaker selection and fees paid out.
The resolution was introduced at last
week's meeting.
The meeting will be held in Room
320 at 7:30.

for first quarter freshmen only, so
cial regulations for all freshmen, so
cial regulations for all women under

According to the resolution intro
duced by Martin Gerry and Bob Klein,
the votes of freedom would be polled
separately from other results.
Three bills will be introduced prior
to consideration by committees.
The first, sponsored by Sandy Mac-
Kenzie, would change the wording of
the By-Laws concerning the Manage
ment Internship Program. The pro
gram Director, appointed at the end
of every year, would be under the di
rect supervision of the Student Fi

nance Manager and would be required
to make written reports to him.
The bill also defines the function of
the program, to secure internship
positions in industrial management
for Stanford students.
Steve Worley is sponsoring the
next bill, asking a $200 appropriation
to buy two portable, electric mega
phones for the coaches to use to com
municate with the crew team.
The final bill would delete the part
of the By-Laws that permits only one
fund raising drive per quarter. This
change was necessitated when the
Con Home drive and a fund raising
drive by the Arnold Air Society both
fell in Spring quarter.
Legislature will be asked to ap
prove the appointment of the new Un
ion Board, selected March 31. The sev
en prospective members include Rick
Bale, Mike Collins, Ron Garrison, Sue
Horst, Ewa Kujaski, Mimi Sherman,
and Doug Sorenson.
Legislature will also continue dis
cussion of Carl Anderson's proposal
that Poli Union be ccnsured for pay
ing Senator Gore $1500 for a speech
and that a committee be formed to
investigate Poli Union methods of
speaker selection and fees paid out.
The resolution was introduced at last
week's meeting.
The meeting will be held in Room
320 at 7:30.
