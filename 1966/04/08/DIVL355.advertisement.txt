DEPRESSED BY DEFEAT?
Though you could actually buy a new 1966 MUSTANG for
around $2100 or $2200 as some of those ads promise?
Sounded so good, you wanted to believe it, even though
you knew the WHOLESALE book value of a USED 1965 Mus
tang — a 6, at that — was $1900.
It puzzled you how a businessman could sell something so
valuable so cheap and still make a profit, didn't it?
But, you found out, didn't you? They added the price of a
heater, freight charges, excise tax, and something vague like
"Delivery and Handling" charges, didn't they?
Final price was quite a bit more than $2100, wasn't it?
Cheer up. We'll sell you a New 1966 Mustang (we've got
over 60 of 'em) for less than any of those "add-on" prices.
And, we won't insult your intelligence with a come-on price.
