# Katz, Sanford Examine Students' Progress
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
Stanford students are concerned pri
marily with personal development
and not with the pursuit of intellect
ual values or with working for com
munity and world betterment.
These are the main preliminary con
clusions of the five-year Student De
velopment Study conducted by Direct
or Nevitt Sanford and Reserach Di
rector Joseph Katz of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems.
Their findings are reported in a copy
righted article in the current issue of
Stanford Today.
Following the class of 1965 through
its four years at Stanford, Sanford
and Katz found that "again and again,
from freshman to the senior years,
a majority of the students we studied

expressed great concern about the
achievement of emotional well-being,
about being respected and liked by
others, about love and affection.
"They said that these values were
much more important to them than
the achievement of wealth, or even
the pursuit of intellectual and artistic
values.
"Our Stanford students, both fresh
men and seniors, rank very low in im
portance to themselves such activities
as participation in the affairs of their
community or activities leading to na
tional or international betterment.
"In their interviews with us, they
would explain their lack of involve
ment by saying that they were not
'crusaders.' Our students' thinking
was strongly focused in a 'privitist'
direction: they said that after gradua
tion their careers and their relations
with their future families would have
first importance for them."
Turbulent College Years
"But one should not be misled into
thinking that, because of this privitist
orientation, the college years are rela
tively tranquil. Learning the tasks of
adult life and preparing oneself for
the assumption of adult roles are not
easy and the years between 17 and 22
are more or less turbulent ones for
all students.
"Serious self doubt, uncertainty
about one's acceptability to others,
and anxiety about achieving independ
ence characterize nearly every stu
dent."
A crucial problem in the contem
porary American college, the article
stated, is "the student's tendency to
separate his academic tasks from the
rest of his life."

"lt is not only that he downgrades
the academic and the intellectual in
his scheme of values, but also, when
asked to say what college experiences
have had the greatest impact upon

him, he ranks ideas presented in
classes well below a variety of ex
periences in the social sphere."
"Interviews reveal that many stu
dents fail to see the relevance of aca

demic learning to their deeper inter
ests and concerns. For a great many,
academic demands are seen merely
as stepping stones toward a career
or simply as hurdles society puts in
the way to test their obedience, en
durance, and conformity."
Challenge To Educators
"This is the perennial challenge to
educators: how to reach students, how
to make the intellectual offerings of
the college an integral part of their
developing selves.
"An attack on the problem must
begin with recognition of the fact
that the compartmentalization of the
academic, is not the fault of the stu
dents . . . They learn to segregate
the academic, and they learn it from
educators, who seem to have assumed
that because intellectual processes
can be separated conceptually, . . .
they are separated in real life.
"It is our view, one that is well
supported in psychological theory,
that the person is all of a piece, that
intellectual, emotional, and character
ological processes develop in inter
action with one another.
"It follows from this that where
our aim is to produce scholars, our
major effort should be to create a
community of scholars, offer the stu
dent clear and attractive models of
scholarship, deliberately build his
confidence in his ability to become a
scholar, and give him freedom to be
guided in his intellectual work by his
curiosity.
Speaking on student value patterns,
Sanford and Katz said that students
do not usually change basic values
but they do tend to hold them in a

different way than before. "Students
typically start college with concep
tions of who thoy are that are either
rather unclear or unduly rigid. At the
end of four years, students find that
they feel freer to have their own
opinions and to take independent initi
ative in their actions."
"There is a marked decrease in dog
matism. The senior has become much
more aware of the complexity of is
sues."
Complex Issues
"A substantial minority of students
do not permit themselves much
awareness of the intriguing processes
and problems that constitute ipner
development during these years. Their

life plans call for restricted awareness
of their own emotions and restricted
responses to the outside world. They
are security minded."
In contrast, the research uncovered
the existence of a group of students,
possibly as many as 20 per cent, for
whom conflict had become a way of
life, at least for the time being. Many
students are caught, Sanford explains,
in the conflict between "wanting to
make a contribution to society by
some socially relevant action, and
feeling great pressure to choose a
profession."
By being forced to make a commit
ment "before all the possibilities have
been ordered," students are frequent
ly left with the feeling that their
deepest hopes and ideals have gone
unexpressed. "College sets more
forces going than can be integrated
in the time allowed," Sanford says.
"When we asked our senior stu
dents to what they attributed the
changes that had taken place in them
during their college years, they listed
among the major influences the fol

lowing: the impact of their living
group, being away from home, and
close relationships with the same and
opposite sex. Our own observations
confirm the students' self estimate.
Encounter Differences
"A major underlying factor seems
to be the freeing of the imagination
provided by the encounter with—and
sometimes the shock of—difference.
Students in college encounter peers
from many different backgrounds
with many different ways of doing
things. They encounter outspoken
teachers.
The fears of parents, and sometimes
college authorities, that students
might follow slavishly "the lead of
some impulsive Pied Piper" seem to
be largely unfounded. "Students
rarely adopt the values of the unusual
ideas of people they are exposed to.
Instead they use the experience to
define their own lives in freer and
more imaginative ways.
"Advocates of nonviolence do not
usually turn students into little Gand
his, but they help them toward a more
searching understanding of .social

and political processes . . . Unorthodox
ideas may awaken students to dorm
ant possibilities in themselves and
show them that it is possible to be
daring.
Students apparently have an ambi
valent attitude toward authority.
"Students, it seems, can't do without
authority, nor can they do with it.
It follows that the collcge adminis
tration should listen to their demands
for the abandonment of rules, but
not suppose that this is exactly what
they want.
"On the other hand, knowledge that
students need rules should not lead
to a piling of one upon another and
to fresh efforts at strict enforcement.
"The question is, how do we en
courage students increasingly to take
responsibility for their own actions?
This is a basic educational objective
to which the making and enforcing
of rules should be directed.
Relax Rules
"Probably this objective would be
favored by student participation in
the making of rules, by a graded re
laxation of rules that accords with the

student's developmental status, and
by handling breaches of the rules in
ways that will make the student more
aware of his responsibilities.
"It would be favored by all educa
tional procedures that, enhance the
student's independence and self-con
fidence and increase his awareness of
himself as a citizen of a community.
"Where our aim, in addition to pro
ducing scholars," Katz and Sanford
say in conclusion, "is to produce edu
cated men and women, possessed of
such qualities as independence of
thinking, the ability to make wise
choices, social responsibility, taste
and sensibility, and sensitivity to the
feelings of others, we must learn to
use the intellectual offerings of the
college in new ways.
"We must know what students are
like and relate what goes on in the
classroom to their needs and concerns.
We must challenge what they believe
most firmly, discuss what they are
most passionate about, give them the
means for analyzing their nonrational
behavior, show them how they can do
well what they most want to do."

marily with personal development

These are the main preliminary con

or Nevitt Sanford and Reserach Di
rector Joseph Katz of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems.
Their findings are reported in a copy
righted article in the current issue of
Stanford Today.
Following the class of 1965 through
its four years at Stanford, Sanford
and Katz found that "again and again,
from freshman to the senior years,
a majority of the students we studied

expressed great concern about the
achievement of emotional well-being,
about being respected and liked by
others, about love and affection.
"They said that these values were

'crusaders.' Our students' thinking
was strongly focused in a 'privitist'

with their future families would have
first importance for them."
Turbulent College Years
"But one should not be misled into
thinking that, because of this privitist
orientation, the college years are rela
tively tranquil. Learning the tasks of
adult life and preparing oneself for
the assumption of adult roles are not
easy and the years between 17 and 22
are more or less turbulent ones for
all students.
"Serious self doubt, uncertainty
about one's acceptability to others,
and anxiety about achieving independ

A crucial problem in the contem

stated, is "the student's tendency to
separate his academic tasks from the
rest of his life."

"lt is not only that he downgrades
the academic and the intellectual in
his scheme of values, but also, when
asked to say what college experiences
have had the greatest impact upon

him, he ranks ideas presented in
classes well below a variety of ex
periences in the social sphere."
"Interviews reveal that many stu

demic learning to their deeper inter
ests and concerns. For a great many,
academic demands are seen merely
as stepping stones toward a career
or simply as hurdles society puts in
the way to test their obedience, en
durance, and conformity."
Challenge To Educators
"This is the perennial challenge to
educators: how to reach students, how
to make the intellectual offerings of
the college an integral part of their
developing selves.
"An attack on the problem must
begin with recognition of the fact
that the compartmentalization of the
academic, is not the fault of the stu
dents . . . They learn to segregate
the academic, and they learn it from
educators, who seem to have assumed
that because intellectual processes
can be separated conceptually, . . .
they are separated in real life.
"It is our view, one that is well
supported in psychological theory,
that the person is all of a piece, that
intellectual, emotional, and character
ological processes develop in inter
action with one another.
"It follows from this that where
our aim is to produce scholars, our
major effort should be to create a
community of scholars, offer the stu
dent clear and attractive models of
scholarship, deliberately build his
confidence in his ability to become a
scholar, and give him freedom to be
guided in his intellectual work by his
curiosity.
Speaking on student value patterns,
Sanford and Katz said that students
do not usually change basic values
but they do tend to hold them in a

different way than before. "Students
typically start college with concep
tions of who thoy are that are either
rather unclear or unduly rigid. At the
end of four years, students find that
they feel freer to have their own
opinions and to take independent initi
ative in their actions."
"There is a marked decrease in dog
matism. The senior has become much
more aware of the complexity of is

Complex Issues
"A substantial minority of students
do not permit themselves much
awareness of the intriguing processes

life plans call for restricted awareness
of their own emotions and restricted
responses to the outside world. They
are security minded."
In contrast, the research uncovered
the existence of a group of students,
possibly as many as 20 per cent, for
whom conflict had become a way of
life, at least for the time being. Many
students are caught, Sanford explains,
in the conflict between "wanting to
make a contribution to society by
some socially relevant action, and
feeling great pressure to choose a
profession."
By being forced to make a commit
ment "before all the possibilities have
been ordered," students are frequent
ly left with the feeling that their
deepest hopes and ideals have gone
unexpressed. "College sets more
forces going than can be integrated
in the time allowed," Sanford says.
"When we asked our senior stu
dents to what they attributed the
changes that had taken place in them
during their college years, they listed
among the major influences the fol

lowing: the impact of their living
group, being away from home, and
close relationships with the same and
opposite sex. Our own observations
confirm the students' self estimate.
Encounter Differences
"A major underlying factor seems
to be the freeing of the imagination
provided by the encounter with—and
sometimes the shock of—difference.
Students in college encounter peers
from many different backgrounds
with many different ways of doing
things. They encounter outspoken
teachers.
The fears of parents, and sometimes
college authorities, that students
might follow slavishly "the lead of
some impulsive Pied Piper" seem to
be largely unfounded. "Students
rarely adopt the values of the unusual
ideas of people they are exposed to.
Instead they use the experience to
define their own lives in freer and
more imaginative ways.
"Advocates of nonviolence do not
usually turn students into little Gand
his, but they help them toward a more
searching understanding of .social

and political processes . . . Unorthodox
ideas may awaken students to dorm

In contrast, the research uncovered
the existence of a group of students,
possibly as many as 20 per cent, for
whom conflict had become a way of
life, at least for the time being. Many
students are caught, Sanford explains,
in the conflict between "wanting to
make a contribution to society by
some socially relevant action, and
feeling great pressure to choose a
profession."
By being forced to make a commit
ment "before all the possibilities have
been ordered," students are frequent
ly left with the feeling that their
deepest hopes and ideals have gone
unexpressed. "College sets more
forces going than can be integrated
in the time allowed," Sanford says.
"When we asked our senior stu
dents to what they attributed the
changes that had taken place in them
during their college years, they listed
among the major influences the fol

lowing: the impact of their living
group, being away from home, and
close relationships with the same and
opposite sex. Our own observations
confirm the students' self estimate.
Encounter Differences
"A major underlying factor seems
to be the freeing of the imagination
provided by the encounter with—and
sometimes the shock of—difference.
Students in college encounter peers
from many different backgrounds
with many different ways of doing
things. They encounter outspoken
teachers.
The fears of parents, and sometimes
college authorities, that students
might follow slavishly "the lead of
some impulsive Pied Piper" seem to
be largely unfounded. "Students
rarely adopt the values of the unusual
ideas of people they are exposed to.
Instead they use the experience to
define their own lives in freer and
more imaginative ways.
"Advocates of nonviolence do not
usually turn students into little Gand
his, but they help them toward a more
searching understanding of .social

and political processes . . . Unorthodox
ideas may awaken students to dorm
ant possibilities in themselves and
show them that it is possible to be
daring.
Students apparently have an ambi
valent attitude toward authority.
"Students, it seems, can't do without
authority, nor can they do with it.
It follows that the collcge adminis
tration should listen to their demands
for the abandonment of rules, but
not suppose that this is exactly what
they want.
"On the other hand, knowledge that
students need rules should not lead
to a piling of one upon another and
to fresh efforts at strict enforcement.
"The question is, how do we en
courage students increasingly to take
responsibility for their own actions?
This is a basic educational objective
to which the making and enforcing
of rules should be directed.
Relax Rules
"Probably this objective would be
favored by student participation in
the making of rules, by a graded re
laxation of rules that accords with the

student's developmental status, and
by handling breaches of the rules in
ways that will make the student more
aware of his responsibilities.
"It would be favored by all educa
tional procedures that, enhance the
student's independence and self-con
fidence and increase his awareness of
himself as a citizen of a community.
"Where our aim, in addition to pro
ducing scholars," Katz and Sanford
say in conclusion, "is to produce edu
cated men and women, possessed of
such qualities as independence of
thinking, the ability to make wise
choices, social responsibility, taste
and sensibility, and sensitivity to the
feelings of others, we must learn to
use the intellectual offerings of the
college in new ways.
"We must know what students are
like and relate what goes on in the
classroom to their needs and concerns.
We must challenge what they believe
most firmly, discuss what they are
most passionate about, give them the
means for analyzing their nonrational
behavior, show them how they can do
well what they most want to do."
Stanford students are concerned pri
marily with personal development
and not with the pursuit of intellect
ual values or with working for com
munity and world betterment.
These are the main preliminary con
clusions of the five-year Student De
velopment Study conducted by Direct
or Nevitt Sanford and Reserach Di
rector Joseph Katz of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems.
Their findings are reported in a copy
righted article in the current issue of
Stanford Today.
Following the class of 1965 through
its four years at Stanford, Sanford
and Katz found that "again and again,
from freshman to the senior years,
a majority of the students we studied

expressed great concern about the
achievement of emotional well-being,
about being respected and liked by
others, about love and affection.
"They said that these values were
much more important to them than
the achievement of wealth, or even
the pursuit of intellectual and artistic
values.
"Our Stanford students, both fresh
men and seniors, rank very low in im
portance to themselves such activities
as participation in the affairs of their
community or activities leading to na
tional or international betterment.
"In their interviews with us, they
would explain their lack of involve
ment by saying that they were not
'crusaders.' Our students' thinking
was strongly focused in a 'privitist'
direction: they said that after gradua
tion their careers and their relations
with their future families would have
first importance for them."
Turbulent College Years
"But one should not be misled into
thinking that, because of this privitist
orientation, the college years are rela
tively tranquil. Learning the tasks of
adult life and preparing oneself for
the assumption of adult roles are not
easy and the years between 17 and 22
are more or less turbulent ones for
all students.
"Serious self doubt, uncertainty
about one's acceptability to others,
and anxiety about achieving independ
ence characterize nearly every stu
dent."
A crucial problem in the contem
porary American college, the article
stated, is "the student's tendency to
separate his academic tasks from the
rest of his life."

"lt is not only that he downgrades
the academic and the intellectual in
his scheme of values, but also, when
asked to say what college experiences
have had the greatest impact upon

him, he ranks ideas presented in
classes well below a variety of ex
periences in the social sphere."
"Interviews reveal that many stu
dents fail to see the relevance of aca

demic learning to their deeper inter
ests and concerns. For a great many,
academic demands are seen merely
as stepping stones toward a career
or simply as hurdles society puts in
the way to test their obedience, en
durance, and conformity."
Challenge To Educators
"This is the perennial challenge to
educators: how to reach students, how
to make the intellectual offerings of
the college an integral part of their
developing selves.
"An attack on the problem must
begin with recognition of the fact
that the compartmentalization of the
academic, is not the fault of the stu
dents . . . They learn to segregate
the academic, and they learn it from
educators, who seem to have assumed
that because intellectual processes
can be separated conceptually, . . .
they are separated in real life.
"It is our view, one that is well
supported in psychological theory,
that the person is all of a piece, that
intellectual, emotional, and character
ological processes develop in inter
action with one another.
"It follows from this that where
our aim is to produce scholars, our
major effort should be to create a
community of scholars, offer the stu
dent clear and attractive models of
scholarship, deliberately build his
confidence in his ability to become a
scholar, and give him freedom to be
guided in his intellectual work by his
curiosity.
Speaking on student value patterns,
Sanford and Katz said that students
do not usually change basic values
but they do tend to hold them in a

different way than before. "Students
typically start college with concep
tions of who thoy are that are either
rather unclear or unduly rigid. At the
end of four years, students find that
they feel freer to have their own
opinions and to take independent initi
ative in their actions."
"There is a marked decrease in dog
matism. The senior has become much
more aware of the complexity of is

"An attack on the problem must

the academic, and they learn it from
educators, who seem to have assumed
that because intellectual processes
can be separated conceptually, . . .
they are separated in real life.
"It is our view, one that is well
supported in psychological theory,
that the person is all of a piece, that
intellectual, emotional, and character
ological processes develop in inter
action with one another.
"It follows from this that where

Speaking on student value patterns,
Sanford and Katz said that students
do not usually change basic values
but they do tend to hold them in a

different way than before. "Students
typically start college with concep

rather unclear or unduly rigid. At the

life plans call for restricted awareness

are security minded."
In contrast, the research uncovered
the existence of a group of students,
possibly as many as 20 per cent, for
whom conflict had become a way of
life, at least for the time being. Many
students are caught, Sanford explains,
in the conflict between "wanting to
make a contribution to society by
some socially relevant action, and
feeling great pressure to choose a
profession."
By being forced to make a commit
ment "before all the possibilities have
been ordered," students are frequent
ly left with the feeling that their
deepest hopes and ideals have gone
unexpressed. "College sets more
forces going than can be integrated
in the time allowed," Sanford says.
"When we asked our senior stu

changes that had taken place in them
during their college years, they listed
among the major influences the fol

lowing: the impact of their living
group, being away from home, and
close relationships with the same and
opposite sex. Our own observations
confirm the students' self estimate.
Encounter Differences
"A major underlying factor seems
to be the freeing of the imagination
provided by the encounter with—and
sometimes the shock of—difference.
Students in college encounter peers
from many different backgrounds
with many different ways of doing
things. They encounter outspoken
teachers.
The fears of parents, and sometimes
college authorities, that students
might follow slavishly "the lead of
some impulsive Pied Piper" seem to
be largely unfounded. "Students
rarely adopt the values of the unusual
ideas of people they are exposed to.
Instead they use the experience to
define their own lives in freer and
more imaginative ways.
"Advocates of nonviolence do not
usually turn students into little Gand

"Students, it seems, can't do without

say in conclusion, "is to produce edu

such qualities as independence of
thinking, the ability to make wise
choices, social responsibility, taste
and sensibility, and sensitivity to the
feelings of others, we must learn to
use the intellectual offerings of the
college in new ways.
"We must know what students are
like and relate what goes on in the
classroom to their needs and concerns.
We must challenge what they believe
most firmly, discuss what they are

well what they most want to do."
Stanford students are concerned pri
marily with personal development
and not with the pursuit of intellect
ual values or with working for com
munity and world betterment.
These are the main preliminary con
clusions of the five-year Student De
velopment Study conducted by Direct
or Nevitt Sanford and Reserach Di
rector Joseph Katz of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems.
Their findings are reported in a copy
righted article in the current issue of
Stanford Today.
Following the class of 1965 through
its four years at Stanford, Sanford
and Katz found that "again and again,
from freshman to the senior years,
a majority of the students we studied

expressed great concern about the
achievement of emotional well-being,
about being respected and liked by
others, about love and affection.
"They said that these values were
much more important to them than
the achievement of wealth, or even
the pursuit of intellectual and artistic
values.
"Our Stanford students, both fresh
men and seniors, rank very low in im
portance to themselves such activities
as participation in the affairs of their
community or activities leading to na
tional or international betterment.
"In their interviews with us, they
would explain their lack of involve
ment by saying that they were not
'crusaders.' Our students' thinking
was strongly focused in a 'privitist'
direction: they said that after gradua
tion their careers and their relations
with their future families would have
first importance for them."
Turbulent College Years
"But one should not be misled into
thinking that, because of this privitist
orientation, the college years are rela
tively tranquil. Learning the tasks of
adult life and preparing oneself for
the assumption of adult roles are not
easy and the years between 17 and 22
are more or less turbulent ones for
all students.
"Serious self doubt, uncertainty
about one's acceptability to others,
and anxiety about achieving independ
ence characterize nearly every stu
dent."
A crucial problem in the contem
porary American college, the article
stated, is "the student's tendency to
separate his academic tasks from the
rest of his life."

"lt is not only that he downgrades
the academic and the intellectual in
his scheme of values, but also, when
asked to say what college experiences
have had the greatest impact upon

him, he ranks ideas presented in
classes well below a variety of ex
periences in the social sphere."
"Interviews reveal that many stu
dents fail to see the relevance of aca

demic learning to their deeper inter
ests and concerns. For a great many,
academic demands are seen merely
as stepping stones toward a career
or simply as hurdles society puts in
the way to test their obedience, en
durance, and conformity."

"This is the perennial challenge to
educators: how to reach students, how
