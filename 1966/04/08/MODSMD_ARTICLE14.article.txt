At UK, however, the campus
AWS has been the elading force
in the retention of the present
women's hours policy; it has
only agreed to discuss possible
revisions under the heaviest
pressure from the dean's office
and other campus groups. Such
pressure led to the adoption of
extended hours for junior wom
en this winter, a privilege re
ceived by senior women in the
fall of 1963.
Under this policy, junior and
senior women, with written per
mission from their parents, may
sign out to any hour as often as
they like. Residence halls use
various methods of handling the
program, ranging from giving
those who sign out late a key
to the buddy system.
AWS Proposal Defeated
A proposal introduced in AWS
last fall to set the weeknight
hours at midnight instead of the
present 10:30 p.m. was defeated
after some AWS representatives
charged it would cause an "im
possible problem with staffing."
One AWS spokesman said the
university would never be able
to find housemothers who would
be willing to stay up until mid
night. Friday and Saturday clos
ing hours are 1 a.m.
At UK the library stays open
until midnight but the student
center closes when the womens'
residence units close.
Strong Force
While the AWS has been the
strongest force for keeping
hours as they are at UK, the
dean of women has been the
strongest force for change.
When Dr. Doris Seward be
came dean of women in 1958,
she lifted many of the restrictive
policies that had been installed
by Sarah Gibson Blanding when
she was dean of women at the
university two decades earlier.
Among the Blanding policies
was "acmpusing" — the com
mon punishment for women. A
woman who was "campused"
could not leave her room after
the evening meal except to re
port to the central dormitory
once an hour to sign in.
"The rule was ridiculous,"
Dean Seward says, "a girl who

was 'campused' couldn't even
study or sleep because she had
to keep running downstairs to
report in."
Dean Blanding went on to be
come president of Vassar where
she gained national attention In
1963 by denouncing premarital
sexual relations as "improper
for the Vassar girl."

themselves have opposed any
change in hours is the Univer
sity of Kentucky.
At UK, however, the campus
AWS has been the elading force
in the retention of the present
women's hours policy; it has
only agreed to discuss possible
revisions under the heaviest
pressure from the dean's office
and other campus groups. Such
pressure led to the adoption of
extended hours for junior wom
en this winter, a privilege re
ceived by senior women in the
fall of 1963.
Under this policy, junior and
senior women, with written per
mission from their parents, may
sign out to any hour as often as
they like. Residence halls use
various methods of handling the
program, ranging from giving
those who sign out late a key
to the buddy system.
AWS Proposal Defeated
A proposal introduced in AWS
last fall to set the weeknight
hours at midnight instead of the
present 10:30 p.m. was defeated
after some AWS representatives
charged it would cause an "im
possible problem with staffing."
One AWS spokesman said the
university would never be able
to find housemothers who would
be willing to stay up until mid
night. Friday and Saturday clos
ing hours are 1 a.m.
At UK the library stays open
until midnight but the student
center closes when the womens'
residence units close.
Strong Force
While the AWS has been the
strongest force for keeping
hours as they are at UK, the
dean of women has been the
strongest force for change.
When Dr. Doris Seward be
came dean of women in 1958,
she lifted many of the restrictive
policies that had been installed
by Sarah Gibson Blanding when
she was dean of women at the
university two decades earlier.
Among the Blanding policies
was "acmpusing" — the com
mon punishment for women. A
woman who was "campused"
could not leave her room after
the evening meal except to re
port to the central dormitory
once an hour to sign in.
"The rule was ridiculous,"
Dean Seward says, "a girl who

was 'campused' couldn't even
study or sleep because she had
to keep running downstairs to
report in."
Dean Blanding went on to be
come president of Vassar where
she gained national attention In
1963 by denouncing premarital
sexual relations as "improper
for the Vassar girl."
