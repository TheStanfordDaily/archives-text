# Rhinelander: 'Administrators Should Listen'
## 
### Philip H. Rhinelander 
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.

It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are

jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact

and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi

kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are

il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist

avant garde of the period, and I think

particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.

rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote

or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives

are, I believe, largely negative.

seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.

the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.

such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.


PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
While Stanford's 11,000 spent spring vacations on
work projects in Tule or on the beaches of Bermuda,
other scholars, both here and elsewhere, were making
an effort at understanding—an effort to discover what
makes today's upstart breed of collegians tick.
Stanford's Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Philosophy,
Chairman of the Committe of 25, and former Dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, has prepared for The Daily
the major article on thus page. It is based on a speech he
delivered in mid-March to the 1966 Stanford Conference
in Oakland.

In Chicago, educators from across the nation, includ
ing a former Stanford dean and a Stanford graduate stu
dent in education, met at a conference of the Association
for Higher Education to discuss "the new breed." Some
of their findings are reported below.
And firutlly, the preliminary results of a five-year study
of Stanford's own breed, conducted by Nevitt Sanford
and Joseph Katz of the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, are reported in an article beginning on Page
One.

Attributing recent student disor
ders to "sinister outside influences"
or to "Red agitators" is much too
easy; it is a way of denying that any
special problem exists, a way of say
ing that no reforms are needed, a
way of advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to the
students' complaints; a way of reas
serting the supremacy of existing
authority and giving students the
brush-off. The trouble is that this
attitude tends to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appropriate
in dealing with prankish or irrespon
sible hell-raising, but the irony is
that in such cases, administrators are
apt to relent and to become forgiving
if the students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students have
a real complaint—or think they have
—refusal to listen to it only intensi
fies the initial grievance and adds fuel
to the fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be un
relenting and intransigent, just when
they ought not to be.
Ending Unrest
I would argue that to dismiss the
current student unrest as a symptom
of the Communist conspiracy — as
some of our right-wing politicians
seem to be doing—is to play into the
hands of the very agitators whom
they wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are. But
if you know there is a pyromaniac in
the neighborhood, you don't leave
matches and a can of kerosene lying
about in your front yard for him to
use.
By the same token, since we know
that agitators of all kinds feed on un
rest, the best defense is to remove the
cause of unrest on which they profit,
not to leave them standing. There is
a maxim in chess that you should
never drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle ap
plies, I think, in dealing with student
firebrands. If you convert them into
martyrs, you increase their power in
the student community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to prevent.
Students of the "new left" seem to
be more influenced by the civil rights
movement than by specific doctrines
of Maoism or Marxism. And behind
the civil rights movement is the fig
ure of Ghandi. But the model here
is, thus far, tactical rather than ideo
logical, and the result is a kind of
negativism. For the positive ideals of
the civil rights movement, namely in
tegration and equal opportunity for
minority groups, have no immediate
analogue on the campus except on
the theory that the entire student
population constitutes an underprivi
leged group—a position which some

of the leaders of the "new left" seem
to be trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the civil
rights movement is clear—protest ral
lies, picketing, parades, meetings,
marches, the sit-in and other recog
nized forms of civil disobedience. But
what are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am not
concerned here with the non-educa
tional, off-campus objectives to which
the campus activists often devote
themselves, such as civil rights, peace
or opposition to war in Vietnam,
but with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself. These
are, I believe, largely negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a basic
opposition to the impersonality and
machine-like aspects of existence, es
pecially in the larger Universities. We
might note that in this respect, the
students are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature and
philosophy—a protest against the de
humanization of a technological socie
ty in which men tend to become
units, numbers, performers of func
tions rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the sym
bol of anonymity and depersonaliza
tion. It represents the oppression of
the student by the system.
There is also a distrust of the au
thority which operates the system.
And I would note that the student ac
tivists here sometimes seems to re
flect the very tendencies against
which they rebel, in that their own
rejection of authority may tend to be
quite machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no animus
against Clark Kerr (or here at Stan
ford against Wally Sterling) as an
individual. They see the President
primarily as a functionary, an au
thority figure, the operator of the
University machine. And the same
seems to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our case
the Trustees.
The more extreme student activists
do not seem to discriminate among
particular individuals according to
their individual views; they do not
declare for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administrators.
The opposition, as publicly formu
lated, is impersonal and sweeping:
"Abolish the Regents," or "You can't
trust anyone over thirty." Everything
is seen in abstract terms of position
and status; everything is black and
white; there is no respect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is paradoxical,
since students of this type exhibit
toward the University the same de
personalized attitude which they con-

demn. But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes it all
>the more serious. The process of
depersonalization has gone so far that
some of those who protest it have
been caught up in it, and they may
exemplify in their own attitudes the
very tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter deserves
more attention than it has received;
it is, to my mind, the most alarming
feature of the situation. May it not
exhibit a failure in the educational
process which needs to be corrected?
It has been asserted that the pro
testing students are more sophisti
cated in their condemnations than
their proposals. The most consistent
demand of the new "left" is that stu
dents should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide variety
of subjects, but these demands are
sometimes made for symbolic reasons
—for the sake of status —not for the
sake of achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the ac
tivist students today want more au
thority, not because they value it but
because they distrust it. They have
no clear program—or at least none
has yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justified.
They are quick to see errors, short
comings, and deficiencies both in the
University and in society.
And they want two things: one is
protection against arbitrary regula
tions and the other is recognition. I
do not say this in criticism. I think
these two demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the situa
tion would be much worse if the ac
tivists were all raving Marxists —
which most of them are not. Of
course, there are some Marxists, and
some exhibitionists, and some campus
politicos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impression is
that student activism today is ideo
logically negative rather than posi
tive. It is fairly specific in its con
demnations but vague in its affirma
tions.
There appears to be a general dis
trust of all traditional systems of val
ue and all fixed institutions. If there
is an ideology here, it is an ideology
of non-ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student ac
tivism seems to reflect an attitude
which has already appeared in our
literature, art, philosophy and reli
gion. In the modern theater, we have
the so-called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modem litera
ture, we have anti-literature and the
cult of the anti-hero. In art, we have
anti-art, which purports to reject aes
thetic values. In philosophy, we have

modern schools which toll us that
philosophy is impossible. In religion,
we have advocates of a "religionlcss"
religion—of belief iri a God beyond
God, or a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a common over
tone —the sense of a void at the cen
ter of things. There is a search for a
st,able hierarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no firm
foundation for a stable hierarchy of
values is discovered. The values of
traditional religion, with its moral
rigidities, are questioned. Rationality
is questioned. The values of a techno
logical society, with its mass culture,
its machines, its impersonality, are
questioned. Science is questioned. Civ
il authority is questioned. And finally,
even the stability of the ego—the in
ner, personal self is questioned.
And there is left an image of life
as a sort of meaningless whirlpool
with a void at the center into which
everything is eventually sucked down.
Of course, this is all very avant garde,
and perhaps far removed from the
practical attitudes of every day exist
ence. But students, particularly the
more intellectual students, are typi
cally associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and I think
this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the orig
ins of current student unrest do not
lie solely within the universities, but
extend into society itself. The stu
dents reflect and respond to the mal
aise of their elders, the effect being
intensified by the familiar insecuri
ties of adolescence. Dean Martin
Meyerson, who served as Acting
Chancellor at Berkeley last spring,
has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpreta
tion of the world, protesting stu
dents at Berkeley often form a
loose coalition on specific issues.
They reject hierarchy within their
own organizations and scorn the

hierarchy of other organizations.
They like to think that each mem
ber is totally committed to the
cause . . . There is a tendency to
overestimate the power of the ad
ministration, seeing l all issues in
terms of polar viewpoints, and re
garding any supporter of student
protest who happens to side with
the administration on a particular
issue as a 'sell-out' ....
Professors Katz and Sanford of
Stanford, who have examined student
unrest as it appears in various uni
versities across the nation, have this
to say about the ground of the stu
dent demand for greater participa
tion in the formulation of University
policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on

policies:
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire to
make college life easier. Rather it
springs from a profound attempt
to seek answers as to how one
might achieve such ends as a reli
able personal identity, community
with other people, and social ob
jectives that will bring comfort and
justice to those largely bereft of
theom in our society.
Again we have the search for a
stable hierarchy of values, in terms
of which the student can find an iden
tity for himself and an effective out
let for his natural idealism and his
human concern. Katz and Sanford
also report,
It is no accident tliat the revolu
tionary student puts great empha
sis on community —what he calls
"eommimltarianlsm." It springs
from his wish that to declare that
development of warm, Ultimate re
lationships is not easy in college
today.
This is the undergraduate version
of a recurrent theme that runs
through most modern literature; the
need and the difficulty of establish
ing fruitful personal relationships in
a society which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encounters
more and more people simply as per
formers of functions or actors of
roles, not as real individuals. The
students are experiencing and enact
ing what our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to for
twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with alarm,
we ought not to view it with surprise.
And our concern—if we feel con
cerned—ought to be less for the stu
dent, as such, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that stu
dents ought always to be listened to
—and I mean really listened to —
even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they should
be agreed with or that the adminis
tration should "run scared", for the
students are quick to scent this sort
of weakness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that what
galls students is not being disagreed
with, but being talked down to.
All of us are sensitive on this score,

but college students particularly so,
since many of them tend to be sensi
tive about being treated as "mature"
individuals. If student activists can
claim that they have not been able
to get a hearing for their views, they
have a rallying cry quite independent
of whether their views are sound.
The wise administrator, then, will
see to it that there is a convenient
and known avenue by which stu
dent complaints can always be enter
tained and looked into. If complaints
are well founded, he may then be
able to take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not well
founded, he may be able to explain
why.
In either case, he treats the com
plaining students as individuals, which
is often the most important thing of
all. This may be easier said than done.
It requires patience, and it may take
a great deal of valuable time. But
such time, I believe, is time well
spent.
Forestalls!
Good administration should be
measured, in my opinion, not simply
by the crises which are overcome,
but by the crises which are fore
stalled—by the disorders which never
happen.
It is my opinion, based partly on
my own experience and partly on
what I have learned about student
disorders at other Universities, that
most outbreaks —not all of them, but
most of them—could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by a
little foresight,—by attention paid in
advance to incipient causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations there
is the simple fact that students are
students. Katz and Sanford conclude
their survey with the following esti
mate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened wlieii the bases
of their power are attacked. Those
of us who have worked or talked
with students in the movement,
find, however, that for all their ap
parent ferociousness and rebellious
ness—and even the more extreme
anarehism of some of them — un
derneath they are still reasonably
pliable. Their search is for identity,
meaning, community, and by no
means least, a response from the
adult world. When this response is
forthcoming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in its place there
is often ail almost touching desire
for adult leadership . . .
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually represent to
college authorities a unique oppor
tunity. At one time it looked like
a hard fight to get either graduate
or undergraduate students involved
on their own, even at the expense
of personal sacrifice. These stu
dents are asking to be educated
and to be one with the intellectual
community if only we show them
the way. . . .
This observation calls attention to
one most important point, namely
that rebelliousness and activism is,
for many students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the con
clusion that for most of them, there
is no positive systematic ideology in
volved; instead, there is a strong
desire for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is de
nied. Hence, their activism is, in part,
a device for obtaining the recognition
which they have failed to secure
through regular channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle course
between impatient toughness, on the
one hand, and supine weakness on
the other. Behind the student demon
strations, there is a legitimate desire
for recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting stu
dent welfare, including educational
welfare.
I see no reason why these desires
cannot be satisfied to the benefit of
all concerned, including the Univers
ity itself. And this is the direction in
which affairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that behind
rules and systems there is always
the matter of personalities and atti
tudes. Rules and systems of any sort
can become formal and mechanical,
and if they do, the impersonality of
the institutional machine, which is a
main cause of the trouble, is perpetu
ated. The machine is a good servant
but a bad master.
When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels —or some of both.
