# 'New Breed' Takes Up Protest
## 
### 
CHICAGO (CPS) — The "new
breed" of activist students has taken
a new role in the academic society.
That was a strong theme developed
by several speakers, including a for
mer Stanford dean and a Stanford
graduate student, at the twenty-first
national conference of the Associa
tion for Higher Education (AHE)
held in Chicago in March.
Dissatisfied
"The 'new breed' of college students
is dissatisfied with the present sys
tem of the society and the university
and feels intensely involved in the
world outside the walls of the acad
emy. He protests the increasing bu
reaucratization and depersonalization
he sees everywhere, especially in
higher education."
This was the portrait painted by
Richard L. Cutler, Vice President for
Student Affairs at the University of
Michigan.
The portrait was filled in by several
other speakers at some of the 44
panels of the conference.
Hardened Values
According to P. H. Ratterman, S.J.,
Dean of Men at Cincinnati's Xavier
University, "The basic indictment
brought by the 'new breed' against
modern society concerns the institu
tionalization of values."
As an example, he cited racial seg
regation, which has "hardened itself
into what amounts to an American
institution." Ratterman warned, how
ever, some of society's institutions
"are basic to civilization . . . Some,
indeed, are basic to the circumstances
in which the 'new breed' itself would
carry on its argument."
Few Participants
While agreeing there is no new
movement of activism on campuses,
Charles M. Stanton, a Stanford gradu
ate student in education, noted, "those
who actually participate in political
affairs are rare indeed. Even more
scarce are those who foment demon
strations and organize public pro
tests."
Studies have shown, Stanton said,

the majority of "college youth indi
cated an amazing complacency about
the quality of their education as well
as a basic self-interest and non-com
mitment to social or political issues."
A profile of those who do fit into
the "activist., new breed" pattern
shows intellectualism as the most pro
nounced characteristic, demonstrating
a "high degree <?f interest in the learn
ing-reasoning process as well as in
the world of ideas," Stanton reported.
Middle-Class Homes
Most of the activists come from
middle-class homes, but base moral
decisions on "humanistic and philoso
phical considerations and not on so
called middle-class morality."
They cannot be described as alien
ated, Stanton said, since "the truly
alienated withdraw from society . . .
the student agitator chooses to con
front society with its hypocrisies and
injustice."
These students reject communism,
indict the Socialist Party for its bu
reaucracy and ineffectiveness, and
"acclaim pure democracy" and action.
Meeting the Challenge
How should university administra
tors meet the challenge this "new
breed" presents?
According to Michigan's Cutler, the
greatest danger is "that those persons
who hold the decision making power
will, in their failure to understand the
intensity of interest in involvement
voiced by the students, discount the
present generation as a group of dis
sident trouble makers and thus foster
a deeper antagonism."
"If the student generation is to de
velop and maintain a trust in the sys
tem, they must become . . . partici
pants in the system," Cutler urged.
Just as the citizen in a democracy is
part of the system, so the student
must be involved by being "given ac
cess to the facts" so he may "arrive
at a rational decision."
Rational Discussion
The ideal of a rational discussion of
the University's policies was also put

forth by Xavier Ratterman, who em
phasized "it is important . . . that
each university explain and defend its
cherished institutional values and
practices."
Mervin B. Freedman, former assist
ant dean of undergraduate education
at Stanford and presently chairman
of the Department of Psychology at
San Francisco State College, went one
step further. He believes there has al
ready been a "revolution" in the rela
tionship between faculty members and
students.
These relationships "are moving
steadily in the direction of equalitari
anism and co-operative endeavor in
which status considerations are mini
mal.

"To my way of thinking, the grow
ing equalitarianism . . . has consider
able value in the development of new
knowledge," said Freedman.
The "specialist" or "expert" must
sometimes yield to the "new direc
tion" provided by "young people who
possess greater sensitivity to the
needs of society and the kinds of
changes occurring in society."
A sizable number of new courses,
student inspired, are being added at
many colleges, Freedman said. "These
courses tend to be interdisciplinary
in nature." He added that the rigid
professor working in a narrow disci
pline is being shaken up by the bright
young students.

They cannot be described as alien
ated, Stanton said, since "the truly
alienated withdraw from society . . .
the student agitator chooses to con
front society with its hypocrisies and
injustice."
These students reject communism,
indict the Socialist Party for its bu
reaucracy and ineffectiveness, and
"acclaim pure democracy" and action.
Meeting the Challenge
How should university administra
tors meet the challenge this "new
breed" presents?
According to Michigan's Cutler, the
greatest danger is "that those persons
who hold the decision making power
will, in their failure to understand the
intensity of interest in involvement
voiced by the students, discount the
present generation as a group of dis
sident trouble makers and thus foster
a deeper antagonism."
"If the student generation is to de
velop and maintain a trust in the sys
tem, they must become . . . partici
pants in the system," Cutler urged.
Just as the citizen in a democracy is
part of the system, so the student
must be involved by being "given ac
cess to the facts" so he may "arrive
at a rational decision."
Rational Discussion
The ideal of a rational discussion of
the University's policies was also put

forth by Xavier Ratterman, who em
phasized "it is important . . . that
each university explain and defend its
cherished institutional values and
practices."
Mervin B. Freedman, former assist
ant dean of undergraduate education
at Stanford and presently chairman
of the Department of Psychology at
San Francisco State College, went one
step further. He believes there has al
ready been a "revolution" in the rela
tionship between faculty members and
students.
These relationships "are moving
steadily in the direction of equalitari
anism and co-operative endeavor in
which status considerations are mini
mal.

"To my way of thinking, the grow
ing equalitarianism . . . has consider
able value in the development of new
knowledge," said Freedman.
The "specialist" or "expert" must
sometimes yield to the "new direc
tion" provided by "young people who
possess greater sensitivity to the
needs of society and the kinds of
changes occurring in society."
A sizable number of new courses,
student inspired, are being added at
many colleges, Freedman said. "These
courses tend to be interdisciplinary
in nature." He added that the rigid
professor working in a narrow disci
pline is being shaken up by the bright
young students.
CHICAGO (CPS) — The "new
breed" of activist students has taken
a new role in the academic society.
That was a strong theme developed
by several speakers, including a for
mer Stanford dean and a Stanford
graduate student, at the twenty-first
national conference of the Associa
tion for Higher Education (AHE)
held in Chicago in March.
Dissatisfied
"The 'new breed' of college students
is dissatisfied with the present sys
tem of the society and the university
and feels intensely involved in the
world outside the walls of the acad
emy. He protests the increasing bu
reaucratization and depersonalization
he sees everywhere, especially in
higher education."
This was the portrait painted by
Richard L. Cutler, Vice President for
Student Affairs at the University of
Michigan.
The portrait was filled in by several
other speakers at some of the 44
panels of the conference.
Hardened Values
According to P. H. Ratterman, S.J.,
Dean of Men at Cincinnati's Xavier
University, "The basic indictment
brought by the 'new breed' against
modern society concerns the institu
tionalization of values."
As an example, he cited racial seg
regation, which has "hardened itself
into what amounts to an American
institution." Ratterman warned, how
ever, some of society's institutions
"are basic to civilization . . . Some,
indeed, are basic to the circumstances
in which the 'new breed' itself would
carry on its argument."
Few Participants
While agreeing there is no new
movement of activism on campuses,
Charles M. Stanton, a Stanford gradu
ate student in education, noted, "those
who actually participate in political
affairs are rare indeed. Even more
scarce are those who foment demon
strations and organize public pro
tests."
Studies have shown, Stanton said,

the majority of "college youth indi
cated an amazing complacency about
the quality of their education as well
as a basic self-interest and non-com
mitment to social or political issues."
A profile of those who do fit into
the "activist., new breed" pattern
shows intellectualism as the most pro
nounced characteristic, demonstrating
a "high degree <?f interest in the learn
ing-reasoning process as well as in
the world of ideas," Stanton reported.
Middle-Class Homes
Most of the activists come from
middle-class homes, but base moral
decisions on "humanistic and philoso
phical considerations and not on so
called middle-class morality."
They cannot be described as alien
ated, Stanton said, since "the truly
alienated withdraw from society . . .
the student agitator chooses to con
front society with its hypocrisies and
injustice."

breed" of activist students has taken
a new role in the academic society.
That was a strong theme developed
by several speakers, including a for
mer Stanford dean and a Stanford
graduate student, at the twenty-first
national conference of the Associa
tion for Higher Education (AHE)
held in Chicago in March.
Dissatisfied
"The 'new breed' of college students
is dissatisfied with the present sys
tem of the society and the university
and feels intensely involved in the
world outside the walls of the acad
emy. He protests the increasing bu
reaucratization and depersonalization
he sees everywhere, especially in
higher education."
This was the portrait painted by
Richard L. Cutler, Vice President for
Student Affairs at the University of
Michigan.
The portrait was filled in by several
other speakers at some of the 44
panels of the conference.
Hardened Values
According to P. H. Ratterman, S.J.,
Dean of Men at Cincinnati's Xavier
University, "The basic indictment
brought by the 'new breed' against
modern society concerns the institu
tionalization of values."
As an example, he cited racial seg
regation, which has "hardened itself
into what amounts to an American
institution." Ratterman warned, how
ever, some of society's institutions
"are basic to civilization . . . Some,
indeed, are basic to the circumstances
in which the 'new breed' itself would
carry on its argument."
Few Participants
While agreeing there is no new
movement of activism on campuses,
Charles M. Stanton, a Stanford gradu
ate student in education, noted, "those
who actually participate in political
affairs are rare indeed. Even more
scarce are those who foment demon
strations and organize public pro
tests."
Studies have shown, Stanton said,

the majority of "college youth indi
cated an amazing complacency about
the quality of their education as well
as a basic self-interest and non-com
mitment to social or political issues."
A profile of those who do fit into
the "activist., new breed" pattern
shows intellectualism as the most pro
nounced characteristic, demonstrating
a "high degree <?f interest in the learn
ing-reasoning process as well as in
the world of ideas," Stanton reported.
Middle-Class Homes
Most of the activists come from
middle-class homes, but base moral
decisions on "humanistic and philoso
phical considerations and not on so
called middle-class morality."
They cannot be described as alien
ated, Stanton said, since "the truly
alienated withdraw from society . . .
the student agitator chooses to con
front society with its hypocrisies and
injustice."
These students reject communism,
indict the Socialist Party for its bu
reaucracy and ineffectiveness, and
"acclaim pure democracy" and action.
Meeting the Challenge
How should university administra
tors meet the challenge this "new
breed" presents?
According to Michigan's Cutler, the
greatest danger is "that those persons
who hold the decision making power
will, in their failure to understand the
intensity of interest in involvement
voiced by the students, discount the
present generation as a group of dis
sident trouble makers and thus foster
a deeper antagonism."
"If the student generation is to de
velop and maintain a trust in the sys
tem, they must become . . . partici
pants in the system," Cutler urged.
Just as the citizen in a democracy is
part of the system, so the student
must be involved by being "given ac
cess to the facts" so he may "arrive
at a rational decision."
Rational Discussion
The ideal of a rational discussion of
the University's policies was also put

forth by Xavier Ratterman, who em
phasized "it is important . . . that
each university explain and defend its
cherished institutional values and
practices."
Mervin B. Freedman, former assist
ant dean of undergraduate education
at Stanford and presently chairman
of the Department of Psychology at
San Francisco State College, went one
step further. He believes there has al
ready been a "revolution" in the rela
tionship between faculty members and
students.
These relationships "are moving
steadily in the direction of equalitari
anism and co-operative endeavor in
which status considerations are mini
mal.

"To my way of thinking, the grow
ing equalitarianism . . . has consider
able value in the development of new
knowledge," said Freedman.
The "specialist" or "expert" must
sometimes yield to the "new direc
tion" provided by "young people who
possess greater sensitivity to the
needs of society and the kinds of
changes occurring in society."
A sizable number of new courses,
student inspired, are being added at
many colleges, Freedman said. "These
courses tend to be interdisciplinary
in nature." He added that the rigid
professor working in a narrow disci
pline is being shaken up by the bright
young students.
