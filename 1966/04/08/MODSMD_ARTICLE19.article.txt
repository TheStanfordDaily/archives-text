THEATER
The Repertory Theater will continue its production of Shake
speares' All's Well That Ends Well with evening performances,
except Sundays, through next weekend, April 16. Tickets are avail
able at Tresidder Box Office.
FILMS
Sundays and Cybele is the star studded attraction at Tresidder
Friday night. The story of a magical relationship between a lonely
girl of twelve and a war veteran who rendez-vous on Sundays, the
film was awarded the Hollywood Academy Award in 1962 for Best
Foreign Film of the Year.
The Saturday Tresidder Flicks is La Strada, produced by Fellini,
starring Fellini's wife Giulietta Masini, (the combination is unbeat
able in Juliet of the Spirits, but I wonder about their victory in this
one.) Anthony Quinn plays a circus weightlifter who travels around
the countryside in a wagon beating up this poor little, helpless, de
fenseless, pregnible girl. She loves the weightlifter and I am sure
that he is quite fond of her as well but they just can't make the ends
of compatibility meet. Awarded the Academy Award for the Best
Foreign Film of 1965, La Strada, is in the tradition of Fellini (unlike
everyone else in the world, I can't help but say this tradition was
not functional).
The Sunday Flicks sports A House Is Not A Home, I might add
an additional negative that a house is not a home and neither of
them is a haven for hartistic expression.
The Bel Art presents a dynamic duo: Our Man Flint and Dr.
Strangelove. Without any reservation, either of these films would
well be worth the* trip to Belmont, or the trip to Chilicuthy, Mo.,
for that matter.
Another suberb doubleheader in The L-Shaped Room and The
Pumpkin Eater is playing in the neighborhood, at the Bijou. Both
powerful and convincing, The L-Shaped Room stars Leslie Caron
and is the film that catapaulted her to fame, and The Pumpkin
Eater has Anne Bancroft on the marquee.
OTHER
John Handy and his Quintet will give their interpretation of jazz
this afternoon in a Jazz Casual. Critic Ralph Gleason will host the
two hour concert and discussion. Tonight and tomorrow night at
the San Francisco Opera House, Josef Krips will conduct the Stan
ford Chorus in St Mathew's Passion.
