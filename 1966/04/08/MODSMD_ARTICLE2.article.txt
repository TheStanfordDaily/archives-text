## Candid Thoughts 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
Student activism both demonstrates
academic commitment and serves as a
positive catalyst for change, Joseph
Katz and Nevitt Sanford declared in
an interview with The Dally earlier
this week.
"The student activists are those
who have in a sense learned best the
lessons of the university," Katz ex
plained. "The unconventionality and
spirit of free inquiry learned in the
classroom are now being applied to
the university itself."
The great lesson of Berkeley, he
continued, was to show that "students
can make a difference. Without stu
dent initiative, there would have been
no questioning of the system.
"Students have shown that they
can upset the balance and they now
have the chance to make a real con
tribution. After all, they know most
directly the situation in undergraduate
education.'
The responsibility for initiating
change in the university has fallen
almost by default to the initiative of

students. "The faculty is not educated
to take responsibility for change, but
rather to fulfill department and dis
cipline tasks. The Trustees are too
remote; the matters concerned here
are too remote; the matters concern
ed here are too detailed for their con
sideration. And the administration is
almost powerless, because implemen
tation should come through the fac
ulty."
There are large obstacles inhibiting
change, Sanford added. The biggest
problem preventing improvements in
undergraduate teaching is the current
emphasis on specialization. The pri
mary concern of the professor is "ad
vancing his discipline. There are as
yet no rewards for undergraduate
teaching," Sanford said.
Many of the innovations tried so
far, he added, have been additions to
already existing structures, rather
than changes in the structures them
selves. Major innovations will require
structural changes, which will in
volve replacing some of the current
practices. This will meet with en
trenched opposition, he concluded.
