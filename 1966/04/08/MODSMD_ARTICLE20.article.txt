# 'Juliet' vs Spirits In 15 Rounder
## 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
"Juliet of the Spirits" is solid,
24 karat genius on film. Director
Fedrico Fellini has created a
film whose every moment
bursts with psychedellic imag
ery, wild color, a sing-aling-to
soothing-to-surf score, sensual
cinematography, sumptuous
scenes and costumes, and the
evocation of an idea, plumetting
far deeper than just colorful fan
tasia, that maybe marriage,
monogamy, and morality are
not always conjunctive to hap
piness.
Dogmatic Pablum
"Juliet* 'is the protrait of a
middle-aged Italian woman who
has been suffocated in Christian
swaddling clothes and spoon fed
the dogmatic pablum that prof
ers the reward, "And in the end,
all lived happily ever after."
The real, three dimensional
world around her begins to
erode away the top layers of
fat that she acquired during her
deformed religious education as
a child, and, voiia, an irritating
conflict is set up.
Juliet's suspicion and later
confirmation of her husband's
infidelity magnifies the conflict
into super-panavision which she
responds to in a glut of bizarre
hallucinations. Juliet is harried
into a grand fantasy of yester
day's martyrdom, today's agony,
and tomorrow's escape.
Masini Is Suberb
Acting can be judged good
or bad overall, or it can be di
sected into myriad evaluative
categories of confidence, emo
tional depth, expertise of expres
sion; but rarely are all of these
qualities so consummate in a
performance as they are in
Giulietta Masini's Juliet.

The film is at once an epic
portrayal and microscopic view
of a woman's expressions as re
actions to events .hallucinations,
and people. Giulietta Masini's
mimicry is faultless to the point
that you would think the part
was written especially for her
. . . . not to prolong suspense
any longer, the part was written
for her by her husband, Fedrico
Fellini.
The supporting actors are
most effective in their zany,
insaney roles, with the excep
tion of Mario Pisu who tries
overly hard at being bored and
passive as Juliet's husband. A
standout in the ranks, though,
is Sandra Milo who plays the
dual roles of the circus ballerina
in Juliet's childhood memories
and Suzy, the erotic emperess of

decadence. A knockout beauty
by no standards, Miss Milo ex
udes a seductive perversity that
is unmatched by the more notor
ious femme-homme fatales of
her industry.
Evocative Filming
The costume and scene de
signs of Piero Gherardi and the
cinematography in technicolor
by Gianni di Venanzo are the
most memorable features in
"Juliet." Color, essential in evok
ing the dreams and hallucina
tion that flood the screen, be
comes a language all of its own
and bespeaks more for the im
pact of the ornate scenes and
Byzantine costuming than the
material costumes and scenes
create themselves.
If the movie is to have a flaw
it would be the ease in which

the fantasy of Juliet's mind
sometimes overshadows the hu
man significance that Fellini is
so anxious to instruct—that of
liberating the individual from
martyring himself for an ances
teral morality. Fellini is not en
couraging unilateral moral dis
armament but rather promoting
a freedom in which the individ
ual can seek his own identity
without outdated religious and
moral impediments.
Fantasy Takes Floor
"Juliet of the Spirits" is hard
to capsulize, harder to maintain
a scorepad of fantasy vs. reality
and hardest to fathom the wierd,
wild, high-camp imagination that
goes into the movie's produc
tion; but it's a film that is easy
to appreciate and enjoy.

into a grand fantasy of yester
day's martyrdom, today's agony,
and tomorrow's escape.
Masini Is Suberb
Acting can be judged good
or bad overall, or it can be di
sected into myriad evaluative
categories of confidence, emo
tional depth, expertise of expres
sion; but rarely are all of these
qualities so consummate in a
performance as they are in
Giulietta Masini's Juliet.

The film is at once an epic
portrayal and microscopic view
of a woman's expressions as re
actions to events .hallucinations,
and people. Giulietta Masini's
mimicry is faultless to the point
that you would think the part
was written especially for her
. . . . not to prolong suspense
any longer, the part was written
for her by her husband, Fedrico
Fellini.
The supporting actors are
most effective in their zany,
insaney roles, with the excep
tion of Mario Pisu who tries
overly hard at being bored and
passive as Juliet's husband. A
standout in the ranks, though,
is Sandra Milo who plays the
dual roles of the circus ballerina
in Juliet's childhood memories
and Suzy, the erotic emperess of

decadence. A knockout beauty
by no standards, Miss Milo ex
udes a seductive perversity that
is unmatched by the more notor
ious femme-homme fatales of
her industry.
Evocative Filming
The costume and scene de
signs of Piero Gherardi and the
cinematography in technicolor
by Gianni di Venanzo are the
most memorable features in
"Juliet." Color, essential in evok
ing the dreams and hallucina
tion that flood the screen, be
comes a language all of its own
and bespeaks more for the im
pact of the ornate scenes and
Byzantine costuming than the
material costumes and scenes
create themselves.
If the movie is to have a flaw
it would be the ease in which

the fantasy of Juliet's mind
sometimes overshadows the hu
man significance that Fellini is
so anxious to instruct—that of
liberating the individual from
martyring himself for an ances
teral morality. Fellini is not en
couraging unilateral moral dis
armament but rather promoting
a freedom in which the individ
ual can seek his own identity
without outdated religious and
moral impediments.
Fantasy Takes Floor
"Juliet of the Spirits" is hard
to capsulize, harder to maintain
a scorepad of fantasy vs. reality
and hardest to fathom the wierd,
wild, high-camp imagination that
goes into the movie's produc
tion; but it's a film that is easy
to appreciate and enjoy.
"Juliet of the Spirits" is solid,
24 karat genius on film. Director
Fedrico Fellini has created a
film whose every moment
bursts with psychedellic imag
ery, wild color, a sing-aling-to
soothing-to-surf score, sensual
cinematography, sumptuous
scenes and costumes, and the
evocation of an idea, plumetting
far deeper than just colorful fan
tasia, that maybe marriage,
monogamy, and morality are
not always conjunctive to hap
piness.
Dogmatic Pablum
"Juliet* 'is the protrait of a
middle-aged Italian woman who
has been suffocated in Christian
swaddling clothes and spoon fed
the dogmatic pablum that prof
ers the reward, "And in the end,
all lived happily ever after."
The real, three dimensional
world around her begins to
erode away the top layers of
fat that she acquired during her
deformed religious education as
a child, and, voiia, an irritating
conflict is set up.
Juliet's suspicion and later
confirmation of her husband's
infidelity magnifies the conflict
into super-panavision which she
responds to in a glut of bizarre
hallucinations. Juliet is harried
into a grand fantasy of yester
day's martyrdom, today's agony,
and tomorrow's escape.
