# 'Patch Of Blue' Panavision

### ANDREW WILSON 
"A Patch of Blue" is an often
touching, sometimes mawkish,
story of the black leading the
blind. Sidney Poitier plays the
warm, sensitive Negro who
sticks out his neck to save a
helpless, eighteen year old white
girl (Elizabeth Hartman) from
the harsh confinement of a free
bish home-life from which her
blindness allows no escape.
This is the basic story, or
story line, and the less the mo
vie has to do with it, the better.
The movie's best moments cen
ter exclusively on the tender,
private relationship which en
velops the two main characters.
The cautious eagerness of Hart
man and the wry gentleness of
Poitier fuse naturally and beau
tifully. Intrusions from the out
side world, however, especially
those designed to carry broad
social significance, are dispirit
ingly forced and superficial.
Personal Not Political
To a bitter younger brotTuTr
incensed by such kindness to a
white woman ("Lot whities take
care of their own women"),
Poitier's response that the prob
lem is "personal, not political"
is a political euphemism—like,
man, it's in the heart.
Similarly, the girl's mother, a
mean ol' prostitute with the phy
sical attributes and characteris
tics of a dyspeptic cow, and the
grandfather, "ol' pa," a drunken
sot, are stagey cliches, aimed at
the tear ducts and puncturing
the content of the movie. Thus,
with the reverse sensibility
which threatens to spoil the mo
vie, what is set up as the key

incident tunis into the single
most damaging episode. This oc
curs with the obstreperously
bigoted mother's discovery that
her daughter is having some
sort of an affair with a Negro.
Viva La. Famila
She proceeds to tear into her
daughter, but the grandfather
intervenes, they fight, flinging
pots and pans at each other with
wild abandonment, neighbox*s
break in to stop the ruckus, and,
in what altogether devolves into
poor slapstick, the mother and
ol' pa unite — viva la famile —
to rout out the peacemakers. To
tally undermined by the slam
bang nonsense is the confronta
tion between mother and daugh
ter (also the girl's first aware
ness of the racial hang-up).
The sticky question which the
story so patently begs: what is
to become of the forbidden in
timacy of an ambitious, young
Negro and a much abused, de
fenseless white girl—, this never
is resolved except after the most
artificial fashion. Poitier makes
two phone calls, a school bus ar
rives, it whisks the girl away
to someplace where people care,
and that's that, no strings at
tached.
Poitier plays his role with ef
fortless grace, perhaps because
he's becoming so accustomed to
it (cf. "Lilies of the Field," "The
Slender Thread"). Once again he
is that rare person so warm
hearted and so understanding
that he can just about forget the
bitterness of the racial stigma
and rally sympathetically to the
cause of some necessitous white
person.

The movie seems to be made
specifically for Poitier, and
many of its shortcomings are re
flected in his acting. The failure
to come to grips with the big
problems which the film gives
tantalizing rise to, and the
smoothing over of this failure
in a sentimentality which ap
pears almost stoic, are a method
of both the movie and the man.
Poitier Suberb
When, for instance, he makes
a speech, banal enough in itself,
extolling the difficult virtue of
toleration, one is supposed to im
pute a certain gravity to it be
cause that's Sidney Poitier and
his earmark is undisclosed, long
suffering. This works fine for
tear-jerkers in which the audi
ence respond to fill the void un
just fate leaves in the charac
ters, but since f'oitier is such a
superb natural actor, one might,
wish him not so constrained.
Hartinan Vitality
Elizabeth Hartman handles
her low-key, highly charged role
with compeling simplicity and
compassion. Though the other
characters are often directed to
cloak her in a veil of tears, her
own acting avoids the pitfall of
becoming precious. Her great
strength lies in the capacity to
suggest a bursting, girlish vitali
ty while being outwardly help
less and victimized. The beauti
ful awkwardness of her first ef
forts to fend for herself under
the salutary influence of Poi
tier presents the real justifica
tion for the movie.
