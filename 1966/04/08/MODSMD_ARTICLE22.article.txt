# 'Group' Not In The In-Crowd
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Sidney Buchman produc
tion of "The Group," directed by
Sidney Lumet, is remarkably
faithful, in episode and in tone,
to Mary McCarthy's novel of the
same title.
The novel was petty, sordid
and bitchy, a keyhole - peeping
triviality without moral or aes
thetic unity. The movie is petty,
sordid and bitchy, a keyhole
peeping triviality without moral
or aesthetic unity.

This is especially sad for the
eight young actresses who por
tray the members of The Group,
an exclusive clique in the 1933
graduating class of an exclusive
girls' college. Most of the ac
tresses are making their first
important appearances in films
(except, notably, for Elizabeth
Hartman, superb in the glossy,
and erratic but sometimes bril
liant "Patch of Blue"). Each of
the eight is at least eminently
competent; some are a great

deal more than that.
But their talents are wasted in
a screenplay so busy trying to
keep track of the far-flung mem
bers of The Group that it never
tells us why on earth we should
care. Worse, except for Polly
(played by Shirley Knight), who
emerges as a full, warm human
being—an acting triumph of the
first water—with some soluble
and some insoluble problems,
and for Kay (Joanna Pettet),
who emerges as a fairly inter
esting and sympathetic neurotic,
each member is a cliche, a hack
neyed type: we have the amiable
fat girl, the social butterfly, the
warmhearted liberal, the proper
Bostonian trying to go Bohema
an, the sexless, gossipy class
correspondent, and — of course
—the Lesbian.
The movie is tied together by
Kay's wedding just after gradu
ation (the beginning of the
film and her funeral in the same
church seven years later (the
end). Major events — an affair,
a child, a marriage, a divorce—
in th ; lives of the eight girls
are shown with more or less
dramatic fullness. The reactions
of the other members to these
events are shown in fast-paced
phone conversations or chance
meetings. These conversations
also serve—and serve and serve
—as exposition; the details of
each girl's life are explicitly dis
cussed by the others ad nause.
tun. The conversations are al
most always purely functional,
never psychologically enlighten
ing. (How much can we learn
after the first few scenes, after
all, about these decidedly one
dimensional comic strip char
acters?)
Vignettes Limp and Obvious
This rapid cutting technique
can be effective, given the prop
er dramatic justification; we
have only to compare the use
of the technique in the compo
site love scene between Nazer
man and Tessie and between Or
tiz and his girl in "The Pawn
broker," surely one of the most
moving vignettes in recent cine
matic art, to be aware of its in
adequacy in "The Group." It Is
sad to observe Sidney Lumet
saddling himself with this hope
less Sidney Buchman script (and
maybe even compounding its
heavy-handedness) just after
having directed a powerful and
satisfying work of art like "The
Pawnbroker."
Well, all right: If "The Group"
is something less than a go 1 d
mine, there are at least a few
scattered nuggets. The acting,
as mentioned, is very fine in

deed. Of the girls, only Jessica
Walter (as Libby) is really un
comfortable, and this is surely
due to the slick unbelieveability
of every word of her dialogue
rather than to her delivery. Joan
Hackett (Dottie) is very touch
ing in the early scene where she
stolidly, staunchly surrenders
her Bostonian virginity to an
artsy type. Miss Hackett is
thereafter relegated to a minor
role.
Competent Aetin
Kathleen Widdoes is properly
colorless and competent as He
lena, and Mary-Robin Redd has
some very funny moments as
portly Pokey. Lakey (played by
the exquisitely beautiful Can
dice Bergen) is more felt as a
force than seen as a character.
Her few scenes are well brought
off, though, with the exception
of the final scene, an exchange
between her and the dead Kay's
husband on the way to the ceme
tery, a dialogue so leering and
fatuous no two actors could
have made it anything but
laughable.
Stars That Shlno
The shining stars In this
somewhat dismal heaven are
Misses Knight, Hartman and
Pettet, and we should not be at
all surprised if each attains pre
eminence (such as it is in Holly
wood) in the near future.
Larry Hagman, as Kay's al
coholic playwright husband,
manages to breathe some re
freshing subtlety into a stereo
typed role. James Broderick is
also good, and often wryly fun
ny, as Polly's eventual husband,
and Robert Emhardt, as her fa
ther, has some wonderful, joy
ously insane moments. In fact,
when the movie succeeds at all,
it succeed as a comedy; there
are genuinely clever lines, and
a few very funny vignettes.
Fads and Fashions Relived
And, in all fairness, it should
be said that the era of the '30's,
with its fads and fashions, its
Rooseveltism and psychoanaly
sis and birth control discoveries,
is apparently carefully and ac
curately evoked. (There are a
few anachronisms, linguistic
and otherwise; a New York
phone number is given with five
digits, for instance.)
By and large, however, the
film is an affront both to our
artistic sensibilities and to our
desire to encounter semblances
of real people in a movie which
purports to be realistic. We can
only hope that the eight alto
gether appealing young actress
es involved can emerge with
their budding careers unscathed.

This rapid cutting technique

have only to compare the use
of the technique in the compo
site love scene between Nazer
man and Tessie and between Or

broker," surely one of the most
moving vignettes in recent cine

sad to observe Sidney Lumet
saddling himself with this hope
less Sidney Buchman script (and
maybe even compounding its
heavy-handedness) just after
having directed a powerful and
satisfying work of art like "The
Pawnbroker."
Well, all right: If "The Group"
is something less than a go 1 d
mine, there are at least a few
scattered nuggets. The acting,
as mentioned, is very fine in

deed. Of the girls, only Jessica
Walter (as Libby) is really un
comfortable, and this is surely
due to the slick unbelieveability
of every word of her dialogue
rather than to her delivery. Joan
Hackett (Dottie) is very touch

stolidly, staunchly surrenders
her Bostonian virginity to an
artsy type. Miss Hackett is
thereafter relegated to a minor
role.

Kathleen Widdoes is properly
colorless and competent as He

some very funny moments as
portly Pokey. Lakey (played by
the exquisitely beautiful Can

force than seen as a character.
Her few scenes are well brought
off, though, with the exception
of the final scene, an exchange
between her and the dead Kay's
husband on the way to the ceme

fatuous no two actors could
have made it anything but
laughable.
Stars That Shlno
The shining stars In this
somewhat dismal heaven are
Misses Knight, Hartman and
Pettet, and we should not be at
all surprised if each attains pre
eminence (such as it is in Holly

Larry Hagman, as Kay's al
coholic playwright husband,
manages to breathe some re
freshing subtlety into a stereo
typed role. James Broderick is
also good, and often wryly fun
ny, as Polly's eventual husband,
and Robert Emhardt, as her fa
ther, has some wonderful, joy
ously insane moments. In fact,
when the movie succeeds at all,
it succeed as a comedy; there
are genuinely clever lines, and
a few very funny vignettes.
Fads and Fashions Relived
And, in all fairness, it should
be said that the era of the '30's,
with its fads and fashions, its
Rooseveltism and psychoanaly
sis and birth control discoveries,
is apparently carefully and ac
curately evoked. (There are a
few anachronisms, linguistic
and otherwise; a New York
phone number is given with five
digits, for instance.)
By and large, however, the
film is an affront both to our
artistic sensibilities and to our
desire to encounter semblances
of real people in a movie which
purports to be realistic. We can
only hope that the eight alto
gether appealing young actress

their budding careers unscathed.
The Sidney Buchman produc
tion of "The Group," directed by
Sidney Lumet, is remarkably
faithful, in episode and in tone,

The novel was petty, sordid

triviality without moral or aes
thetic unity. The movie is petty,

This is especially sad for the
eight young actresses who por

an exclusive clique in the 1933
graduating class of an exclusive
girls' college. Most of the ac
tresses are making their first
important appearances in films
(except, notably, for Elizabeth
Hartman, superb in the glossy,
and erratic but sometimes bril
liant "Patch of Blue"). Each of
the eight is at least eminently
competent; some are a great

deal more than that.
But their talents are wasted in
a screenplay so busy trying to
keep track of the far-flung mem
bers of The Group that it never
tells us why on earth we should
care. Worse, except for Polly
(played by Shirley Knight), who
emerges as a full, warm human
being—an acting triumph of the
first water—with some soluble
and some insoluble problems,
and for Kay (Joanna Pettet),
who emerges as a fairly inter

Larry Hagman, as Kay's al
coholic playwright husband,
manages to breathe some re
freshing subtlety into a stereo
typed role. James Broderick is
also good, and often wryly fun

ously insane moments. In fact,
when the movie succeeds at all,
it succeed as a comedy; there
are genuinely clever lines, and
a few very funny vignettes.
Fads and Fashions Relived
And, in all fairness, it should
be said that the era of the '30's,
with its fads and fashions, its
Rooseveltism and psychoanaly
sis and birth control discoveries,
is apparently carefully and ac
curately evoked. (There are a
few anachronisms, linguistic
and otherwise; a New York
phone number is given with five
digits, for instance.)
By and large, however, the
film is an affront both to our
artistic sensibilities and to our
desire to encounter semblances
of real people in a movie which
purports to be realistic. We can
only hope that the eight alto
gether appealing young actress
es involved can emerge with
their budding careers unscathed.
The Sidney Buchman produc
tion of "The Group," directed by
Sidney Lumet, is remarkably
faithful, in episode and in tone,
to Mary McCarthy's novel of the
same title.
The novel was petty, sordid
and bitchy, a keyhole - peeping
triviality without moral or aes
thetic unity. The movie is petty,
sordid and bitchy, a keyhole
peeping triviality without moral
or aesthetic unity.

This is especially sad for the
eight young actresses who por
tray the members of The Group,
an exclusive clique in the 1933
graduating class of an exclusive
girls' college. Most of the ac
tresses are making their first
important appearances in films
(except, notably, for Elizabeth
Hartman, superb in the glossy,
and erratic but sometimes bril
liant "Patch of Blue"). Each of
the eight is at least eminently
competent; some are a great

deal more than that.
But their talents are wasted in
a screenplay so busy trying to
keep track of the far-flung mem
bers of The Group that it never
tells us why on earth we should
care. Worse, except for Polly
(played by Shirley Knight), who
emerges as a full, warm human
being—an acting triumph of the
first water—with some soluble
and some insoluble problems,
and for Kay (Joanna Pettet),
who emerges as a fairly inter
esting and sympathetic neurotic,
each member is a cliche, a hack
neyed type: we have the amiable
fat girl, the social butterfly, the
warmhearted liberal, the proper
Bostonian trying to go Bohema
an, the sexless, gossipy class
correspondent, and — of course
—the Lesbian.
The movie is tied together by
Kay's wedding just after gradu
ation (the beginning of the
film and her funeral in the same
church seven years later (the
end). Major events — an affair,
a child, a marriage, a divorce—
in th ; lives of the eight girls
are shown with more or less
dramatic fullness. The reactions
of the other members to these
events are shown in fast-paced
phone conversations or chance
meetings. These conversations
also serve—and serve and serve
—as exposition; the details of
each girl's life are explicitly dis
cussed by the others ad nause.

most always purely functional,
never psychologically enlighten
ing. (How much can we learn
after the first few scenes, after
all, about these decidedly one
dimensional comic strip char
acters?)
Vignettes Limp and Obvious
This rapid cutting technique
can be effective, given the prop
er dramatic justification; we
have only to compare the use
of the technique in the compo
site love scene between Nazer
man and Tessie and between Or
tiz and his girl in "The Pawn
broker," surely one of the most
moving vignettes in recent cine
matic art, to be aware of its in
adequacy in "The Group." It Is
sad to observe Sidney Lumet
saddling himself with this hope
less Sidney Buchman script (and
maybe even compounding its
heavy-handedness) just after
having directed a powerful and
satisfying work of art like "The
Pawnbroker."
Well, all right: If "The Group"
is something less than a go 1 d
mine, there are at least a few
scattered nuggets. The acting,
as mentioned, is very fine in

deed. Of the girls, only Jessica
Walter (as Libby) is really un
comfortable, and this is surely
due to the slick unbelieveability
of every word of her dialogue
rather than to her delivery. Joan
Hackett (Dottie) is very touch
ing in the early scene where she
stolidly, staunchly surrenders
her Bostonian virginity to an
artsy type. Miss Hackett is
thereafter relegated to a minor
role.
Competent Aetin
Kathleen Widdoes is properly
colorless and competent as He
lena, and Mary-Robin Redd has
some very funny moments as
portly Pokey. Lakey (played by
the exquisitely beautiful Can
dice Bergen) is more felt as a
force than seen as a character.
Her few scenes are well brought
off, though, with the exception
of the final scene, an exchange
between her and the dead Kay's
husband on the way to the ceme
tery, a dialogue so leering and
fatuous no two actors could
have made it anything but
laughable.
Stars That Shlno
The shining stars In this
somewhat dismal heaven are
Misses Knight, Hartman and
Pettet, and we should not be at
all surprised if each attains pre
eminence (such as it is in Holly
