# S.F. Conductor Leads Chorus, Praises Musicians

### SUE BAKER 
Josef Krips is not a complete
ly unfamiliar figure to Stanford
students. He has been the con
ductor of the San Francisco
Symphony for three seasons,
and during this time, Stanford
vocal groups have been invited
to present several programs
with the Symphony. Working on
the"St. Matthew's Passion" by
Bach, the University Chorus and
Choir have once again come un
der Krip's direction, and the ex
perience has been stimulating
and educational.
He is an imposing figure on
the podium, standing stiff and
proud and conducting with mili
tary precision. Maintaining com
plete control of his performers,
he can elicit the softest of pia
nissimos or the most thundering
fortissimo with the slightest al
teration of his baton. His music
may at times lack a certain lyri
cal quality or flow of feeling,
but it is always technically ex
act. He is always the master
showman.
Charming, The Maestro
In a personal interview, how
ever, the maestro is quite differ
ent — charming, relaxed and
very willing to talk of his musi
cal philosophy, and background.
Born in Vienna in 1902, he began
his career as a conductor, with
the Vienna Volksoper in 1921,
and has been conductor of the
Staatsoper since 1931. His con
ducting had earned him a Eu
rope-wide reputation when, in
1938, the German occupation of
ficials in Austria banned his ap
pearance on the podium, be
cause—although he is a Roman
Catholic — his father's parents
were Jewish. After the libera
tion in 1945, Krips was charged
by Soviet occupation authorities

with the task of pulling toge
ther the remnants of the Staats
oper, and almost entirely on his
own, Krips rebuilt and reorga-

nized Vienna's musical founda
tions.
Krips finally made his Ameri
can debut in 1953 with the Buf
falo Philharmonic, and begin
ning with the 1963-64 season,
Krips became the conductor and
musical director of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
Krips delights in his work with
young performers. Speaking of
the Stanford vocalists — "They
have enthusiasm, and it is won
derful to have enthusiasm in a
performance; when college stu
dents can still become enthusi
astic about Bach, that is realiy
something." As musicians, Krips
has nothing but praise for the
Stanford groups and their con
ductor Harold Schmidt—"They
have great feeling in their inter
pretation of the music."
This is the first Bay Area per
formance of the "Passion", in
quite some time, and Krips is
verry happy with his selection.
