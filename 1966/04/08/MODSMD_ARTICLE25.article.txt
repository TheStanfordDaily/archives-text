# Baseball Hopes Ride On Weekend Series
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team takes
on Cal in a home and home se
ries starting up at Berkeley this
afternoon at 3:00.
Saturday, the Indians host the
Bears in Sunken Diamond at
2:00 p.m.
Cal has a number of good
pitchers and Stanford will face
their ace Andy Messersmith one
of those days. Indian hitters
have been coming alive of late,
though, and could give Cal
throwers a bad time.
Steve Hovley has moved into
fourth spot among the league's
leading hitters with a .394 aver
age.
Frank Duffy has also matched
Hovley's phenomenal rise. Duf
fy is now hitting .387 good for
fifth place among the league's
big bats.
Cal hasn't been hitting much
better than Stanford this season,
and their top batter is Cooper

who is hitting .333.
Coach Dutch Fehring will
probably start John Mason to
day and either Daro Quiring or
Terry Docken tomorrow.
Stanford is hanging by a
thread as far as their champion
ship hopes go. The Indians must
win every game from here on
and hope that USC gets knocked
off by some one else for their
fourth loss.
If the Tribe can get by Cal,
the crucial series with UCLA
and USC are coming up.
