# Cricket Team Begins Season

### 
Stanford's champion cricket
eleven opens a long season this
Saturday against UCLA at 12:00
on the intramural field next to
Stanford Stadium.
In the past all games have
been against clubs from north
ern California, and only two oth
er universities â€” Berkeley and
Davis. According to Jim Byrd,
secretary of Stanford's side, Sat
urday's match may very well
mark the "beginning of orga
nised university cricket in Cali
fornia."
For two years the self-orga
nised, self - sustained - Stanford
eleven has held the California
Inter - University Cricket Cup.
Last year they won every match
on their slate.
Comprised mostly of foreign
and graduate students, the club
has been very active and quite
successful entirely through its
own initiative. So far, it has re
ceived no aid from the univer
sity except for the field on
which it plays.
The eleven may also boast the
longest season of any of Stan
ford's squads. They play every
weekend from the beginning of
April through to October, usual
ly before a good-sized crowd of
spectators.
