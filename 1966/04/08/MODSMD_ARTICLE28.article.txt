## More Than Catch? 
### Tom Edison 
Bright gold and blue strips of
crepe paper marked the front
boundary. An official stood be
tween opposing squads intently
watching the action. A loud
speaker from above beamed out
a commentary on the contest's
progress, while a meager but
enthusiastic audience responded
in voice as the performers ma
neuvered before them.
The scene is the Second An
nual Lawn Frisbec Tournament
at Stanford University.
Left to the imagination and
spirit of college students to de
velop a pastime that would chal
lenge the concentration of pool,
the drama of poker, and more
important, replace studying,
lawn frisbee has become a nat
ural afternoon activity at Stan
ford.
Innocent Beginning
It began merely as an inno
cent game of catch, tossing the
frisbee back and forth on the
front lawn after lunch or while
waiting for the dinner bell to
ring.
However, games of catch were
too limited and so the competi
tive element was introduced.
Boundaries were established,
rules were laid down, and teams
were chosen.
Soon everyone was finding a
partner. Challenges were issued
that could only be settled on the
front yardâ€”with a frisbee.
Play was sloppy at first and
arguments were continually
arising as to what was legal and
who had scored. But as time
passed, tossing became more
controlled, catching became an
art, and the rules were defined.
Competition Between Houses
Different living groups have
developed frisbee teams at Stan
ford and intra-house competi
tion has occurred.
The field usually consists of

the grass-covered grounds in
front of a living group so that
the action can be easily watched
by all interested members. The
area is divided into two equal
sections with the side and back
boundaries well defined.
Conduct of Contest
Generally a frisbee contest is
conducted with squads of two
players from both teams with a
team consisting of eight players.
Play consists of three matches,
five games per match, and
games are played to five points.
Scores are made by tossing the
six-inch circular frisbee into the
opposition's territory without
being caught, or if the opposi
tion tosses out-of-bounds. Nu-

Nine Stanford frosh swimmers
began competition yesterday in
the AAWU swimming tourna
ment in Florida, Also two var
sity swimmers from Stanford
went for the trip but will be
competing for Santa Clara.
Stanford stands an excellent
chance of winning the champion
ship with two world record hold
ers, lyouis Nicholos and Dick
Itoth, swimming for them. The
competition ends Saturday night.

merous points are awarded for
violations of catching, tossing,
and landing of the frisbee.
Tosses have to be at least knee
high, must strike the ground at
less than 45 degrees, and the
'fris' can be caught with only
one hand without aid from any
other part of the body.
First Unofficial Tourney
Two years ago the members
of the Delta Upsilon fraternity,
clad in gold shorts, blue and
white stripped jerseys, and
straw hats played the Phi Kappa
Sigma fraternity in what Is un
officially called the First An
nual Lawn Frisbee Tourna
ment. The DU's were victorious.
This contest saw excellent
flings, spectacular catches, few
dundersplats (illegal tosses; not
knee-high), few fritchells (strik
ing the ground at more than 45
degrees), no robatsies (catching
with two hands or the body),
and a large crowd cheering their
favorites.
Last spring another challenge
was resounded by the Phi Kap's
in hopes of regaining the dubi
ous honor of being university
champs of lawn frisbee.
Second Annual Contest
The contest commenced early
Saturday morning when the
weather, especially the wind,
was ideal. The competitors
formed their team ranks in the
middle of the field. Rules were
discussed, although each team
was already well versed on the
regulations, opposing team
members shook hands, and the
Second Annual Frisbee Tourna
ment was initiated.
Although the Phi Kap's put
up a stubborn opposition and
showed considerable poise and
mastery of the game, the after
noons spent by the DU's in re
fining and polishing their ma
neuvers paid off. The DU's suc
cessfully defended their title
and remained university lawn
frisbee champions.
Undoubtedly forces will be re
grouped this year and another
challenge will be sounded in
hope of gaining the glory and
honor that follows the victor of
the annual lawn frisbee tour
nament at Stanford.
