# Grid Wars To Begin

### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
With over a month of inten
sive drilling and conditioning
awaiting them, Stanford's foot
hall team starts spring practice
tomorrow morning at 8:00 on
the practice field next to Sunken
1 diamond.
Coach John Ralston will be
greeted with 104 prospective var
sity performers who hope to
surpass the highly successful
6-3-1 record of last season.
Twenty-five of these candidates
are returning lettermen.
Besides the bundle of exper
ienced lettermen, Ralston and
his staff also have 50 mem
bers of an unbeaten freshman
team to scout when making
their preseason estimates and
adjustments.
Speed's a Factor
Speed will definitely be a char
acteristic of this spring's crop
of varsity hopefuls. Returning
and hopefully as fit as ever, is
halfback Bob Blunt who, is the
quick, elusive runner that Ral
ston will especially be watching.
Ralston hopes he can carry next
year's squad to the heights that
Stanford football supporters
have been dreaming of for a
long time.
Other key backs who are still
question marks as to their var
sity abilities are redshirts Bob
Oar and Jon Huss, and frosh
Gene Washington and Nate Kirt
man.
