# Tennis Battles Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team after being humiliated last weekend by
USC and UCLA—who are probably the top two tennis teams in the
country—receives another severe test Saturday when they collide
with the University of California here at Stanford. Friday the In
dians meet relatively unheard of Seattle University.
Stanford and Cal met earlier in the season in the Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Tournament. Cal won the tournament. Stan
ford hobbled to third place playing without their number two and

three men.
Coach Optimistic
However, as Stanford's coach
Bob Renker put it, "We will defi
nitely be in better playing form
against Cal Saturday. Although
the scores don't show it we
played well down south and
should be at our tops against
the Bears. We will have to be.
They have a good team."
Heading the Cal list of per
formers is Chuck Darley. He de
feated Stanford's top man, Jim
Beste, 3-6, 6-4, and 8-6 when they
met earlier in the year.
Earlier in the week Stanford
dropped the University of Cali
fornia of Hayward, 7-2, extend
ing their season record to 4-3.
San Jose previously toppled the
Indians 6-3 for their other loss.
Indian victories have been over
University of Redlands, 5-4, San

ta Barbara, 7-2, and a white
washing of San Francisco State,
6-0.
The Bears also were defeated
by USC and UCLA which
brought their record down to
3-2.
