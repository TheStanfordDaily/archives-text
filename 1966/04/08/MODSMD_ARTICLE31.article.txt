# Track Team Tests OSU In Away Tilt
## 
### 
Out to capture their third dual
meet victory of the year, Stan
ford's track team journeys to
Corvallis, Oregon this weekend
to match skills with Oregon
State.
The Indians are fresh from an

impressive win last Saturday
over perennial power San Jose
State. Captain Bob Stoecker was
the big point getter as he cap
tured the shot put, the javelin,
and the discus. Sprinter Larry
Questad appeared to be regain
ing the fine form that won him
the -NCAA century title two
years ago.
The biggest tribe surprise,
however, was the fine perform
ance of the quarter mile relay
team which featured Questad
and three sophomores Roger
Cox, Donn Forbes and Jim
Ward.
Beavers 2-4 Last Year
The Beavers are trying to re
build this season after suffering
a 2-4 dual meet record last year.
Their wins came at the expense
of California and Oregon.
OSU is paced by sprinter
Butch Lumby who has the
fourth best AAWU 100 time,
a nifty 9.8. Other leaders are
Tony Albin who has a 23-3%
long jump to his credit, Phil
Lowrey who has thrown the
javelin 230 feet, and Lachen
Samson who has heaved the shot
57 feet.
Coach Jordan is also hoping
that pole valuters Jim Eshelman
and Chuck Smith, quarter miler
Jim Ward, and hurdler and long
jumper Bud Walsh will be in
top form. The Tribe will enter
the meet with a far more ex
perienced and seasoned squad
than OSU.
