# Stanford Meets San Francisco
## 
### 
Flying high after their 6-5 vic
tory over favored Peacock Gap
last weekend, Stanford's La
crosse Indians travel to San
Francisco this weekend to take
on the winless San Francisco La
crosse Club.
The Indians have already dealt
handily with the Club, souelch
ing them 12-1 in a winter quar
ter contest. Since that time
both teams have tightened up
and the contest should be a good
one.
The Stanford game against
Peacock Gap was not nearly as
close as the score indicates, for
the Indians dominated the game
in surprising and precise fash
ion. An effective fast break and
the ability to capitalize on good
luck, however, kept the Gappers
within one goal the entire game.
Aside from yeomen's work on
the attack by Mary lander Cly
Primose and on defense by Chip
Green, the key to the Indians
victory was the conditioning of
the Red midfielders. The three
Stanford midfield lines ultimate
ly ran the Peacock Gap mid
fielders into the ground.
