# More Than 'Listening'

Professor Philip Rhinelander's perceptions on
the state of campus activism on page three of
today's Daily come as a welcome relief to much
of the current drivel on the nature of the current
student unrest coming from Lewis Hershey
and 112. Edgar Iloovcr, among others. Yet, we
persist in the feeling that although he may
understand the problems, he, like the students
he analyzes, has no completely satisfactory solu
tions to them.
"Students of the 'new left' seem to be more
influenced by the civil rights movement than
by specific doctrines of Maoism or Marxism,"
says Prof. Rhinelander, in rejecting the notion
that today's students are falling dupes to a com
munist conspiracy. In fact, he notes, student
activists have a general distrust not just of Marx
ism, but of all traditional value systems and fixed
institutions. "On die whole, my impression is that
student activism today is ideologically negative
rather than positive," he comments. "If there is
an ideology here, it is an ideology of non
ideology or anti-ideology .... There is a sense of
void in the center of tilings."
When this is applied to the university, Rhine
lander notes, he is left with the impression that
"the activist students today want more author
ity, not because they value it, but because they
distrust it."
As a solution to this problem of distrust,
Rhinelander suggests that "students ought
always to be listened to —and I mean really
listened to —even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable .... The wise
administrator . . . will see to it that there is a
convenient and known avenue by which student
complaints can always be entertained and
looked into." While such a solution would be a
vast improvement over the present situation here
and on other campuses, it is analagous, we feel,
to treating a cancer patient with moq)hine. For
while such an approach may solve problems as
they become apparent, it does not discourage
them from occurring.

The crux of the matter, as we see it, is in the
gulf between the administrative generation and
the student generation in regards to the revolu
tion in values. For although a substantial per
centage of today's students have rejected many
of the traditional notions about religion, sexual
mores, and"the good life," their elders, by and
large, have not, Tims, when a student is faced
with explaining his problems to a university
decision-maker, he may receive sympathy and
he may detect a desire to understand, but the
chances are good that he will not find it fully
possible to communicate his attitudes and feel
ings. "Really listening", it seems, is not always
synonymous with understanding. The authority
structure that clings to the old values cannot
fully understand and satisfactorily fill the needs
of the student who has survived "the revolution."
And what is it that today's activist wants?
Chiefly, we believe, it is the right to develop
and practice such values as he finds most appro
priate for himself. In short, he wants a plural
istic society that will allow him to be what he is,
and allow others to be what they are. This, how
ever, often proves impossible when a university
authority structure, formed under the influence
of the old traditions, blocks his path. With a
plethora of regulations and codes which contra
dict his values hanging over his head, it is only
natural that he comes to distrust authority.
It would seem, then, that listening to students
is not enough. A better solution might lie in
allowing students to have a major voice in form
ing those policies under which they must live
and develop. If this means placing students on
the Board of Trustees, then perhaps it should be
considered.
We urge Stanford's decision-makers to listen
—and we, too, mean really listen—to what Prof.
Rhinelander has to say. We hope also that they
not stop there, but go on to consider the basic
causes, and not just the solutions, to student
unrest.

ideology or anti-ideology .... There is a sense of
void in the center of tilings."
When this is applied to the university, Rhine
lander notes, he is left with the impression that
"the activist students today want more author
ity, not because they value it, but because they
distrust it."
As a solution to this problem of distrust,
Rhinelander suggests that "students ought
always to be listened to —and I mean really
listened to —even, or especially, when their de
mands appear most unreasonable .... The wise
administrator . . . will see to it that there is a
convenient and known avenue by which student
complaints can always be entertained and
looked into." While such a solution would be a
vast improvement over the present situation here
and on other campuses, it is analagous, we feel,
to treating a cancer patient with moq)hine. For
while such an approach may solve problems as
they become apparent, it does not discourage
them from occurring.

The crux of the matter, as we see it, is in the
gulf between the administrative generation and
the student generation in regards to the revolu
tion in values. For although a substantial per
centage of today's students have rejected many
of the traditional notions about religion, sexual
mores, and"the good life," their elders, by and
large, have not, Tims, when a student is faced
with explaining his problems to a university
decision-maker, he may receive sympathy and
he may detect a desire to understand, but the
chances are good that he will not find it fully
possible to communicate his attitudes and feel
ings. "Really listening", it seems, is not always
synonymous with understanding. The authority
structure that clings to the old values cannot
fully understand and satisfactorily fill the needs
of the student who has survived "the revolution."
And what is it that today's activist wants?
Chiefly, we believe, it is the right to develop
and practice such values as he finds most appro
priate for himself. In short, he wants a plural
istic society that will allow him to be what he is,
and allow others to be what they are. This, how
ever, often proves impossible when a university
authority structure, formed under the influence
of the old traditions, blocks his path. With a
plethora of regulations and codes which contra
dict his values hanging over his head, it is only
natural that he comes to distrust authority.
It would seem, then, that listening to students
is not enough. A better solution might lie in
allowing students to have a major voice in form
ing those policies under which they must live
and develop. If this means placing students on
the Board of Trustees, then perhaps it should be
considered.
We urge Stanford's decision-makers to listen
—and we, too, mean really listen—to what Prof.
Rhinelander has to say. We hope also that they
not stop there, but go on to consider the basic
causes, and not just the solutions, to student
unrest.
Professor Philip Rhinelander's perceptions on
the state of campus activism on page three of
today's Daily come as a welcome relief to much
of the current drivel on the nature of the current
student unrest coming from Lewis Hershey
and 112. Edgar Iloovcr, among others. Yet, we
persist in the feeling that although he may
understand the problems, he, like the students
he analyzes, has no completely satisfactory solu
tions to them.
"Students of the 'new left' seem to be more
influenced by the civil rights movement than
by specific doctrines of Maoism or Marxism,"
says Prof. Rhinelander, in rejecting the notion
that today's students are falling dupes to a com
munist conspiracy. In fact, he notes, student
activists have a general distrust not just of Marx
ism, but of all traditional value systems and fixed
institutions. "On die whole, my impression is that
student activism today is ideologically negative
rather than positive," he comments. "If there is
an ideology here, it is an ideology of non
ideology or anti-ideology .... There is a sense of
void in the center of tilings."
