# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Who's Been Writing All That Jazz? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Your article April 6 announc
ing the appearance of John
Handy at Stanford was an in
sult to every musician and jazz
buff who knows and respects
Mr. Handy's artistry.
It is a well-known fact that
The Daily has no one on their
staff capable of writing a jazz
column. That is excusable. But
to assign someone to do re
search work and all he comes
up with is misquoting the back
of a record album—that is ridic
ulous.
The article gave the impres
sion that Handy was a newcom
er to jazz and the only previous
experience he had was with
Charlie Mingus. When, in fact,
as early as the 1950's John made
his debut performance at Carne
gie Hall. Later he went on a
world tour with his own group
and then became the first and
only jazz musician to play for
the United Nations.
Handy came back to the Bay
Area in 1963 to study for his
Masters degree at San Francis
co State (you gave the impres
sion that he was a high school
graduate, which is another mis
quote from the album jacket).
His studies were interrupted in
1964 when he went to Washing
ton, D.C. for the Civil Rights
March. After returning from

Washington, D. C. he formed the
Freedom Band in which I had
the honor of being a member.
I have never known any of
Handy's groups to be a failure
as you implied. As were Charlie
Parker, Theolonious Monk and
John Coltraine (just to name
a few) John Handy today is the
pace setter in the world of jazz.
I think The Daily owes an apol
ogy to Mr. Handy and its jazz
audience.
You may print all or part of
this letter. And you should!

Editor, The Daily:
The recent otherwise delight
ful spread of Stanford pictures
and Japanese poetry, headlined
"Stanford in February," by its
awkward translations diminish
ed the pleasure of readers fa
miliar with Japanese verse and
eager to see its rigid but evoca
tive conventions more widely
used in English verse. From
lifelong interest I would gently

protest the violence done both
meaning and feeling by your
anonymous translator seeking
to keep to the 3-5-3 syllable
sequence of the original.
Take the famous "Crow on a
Bare Branch" of the 17th cen
tury master Basho. The lines
"Kare-eda ni/ Karasu no tomari
keri/ Aki no kure" are rendered,
A cautious crow clings
To a bare bough silently
Watching 1 the sunset.
Though the boldfaced words
correspond to nothing in the
Japanese, the omission of
"autumn" leaves the season un
certain in what is a poem of the
seasons. Finally, in being pre
cise where the poet is vague, the
translator keeps from us the
bleakly austere intimations of
what the Japense critic Miya
mori has called "this epoch-mak
ing verse which took the first
step in the movement elevating
the haikai to serious pure litera
ture."
Now, these terse Japanese
poems, as has been aptly said,
are but the titles of poems
created jointly by poet and
reader, or seeds of poems
planted by the poet and hus
banded by the reader. All the
greater the need for fidelity
in translation. The literary his
torian Aston in his rendering:
"On a withered branch/ A crow

is sitting/ This autumn eve
ning" sacrifices some poetic
feeling with the syllable of the
reader, who may still cooperate
in their common enterprise.
I prefer, however, the spare,
chiseled, even more literal ren
dering:
On a bare branch
Perches a crow:
Autumn evening.
For thus the poet still com
municates "that single sharp im
pression, with a sense in it," as
Walter Pater puts it, with an
almost breathless ejaculation of
poetry, and his reader, telling
the lines over and over, after
the Japanese custom in such
things, gathers new and sub
jective impressions not provided
for in English poetic conven
tions.

• Subsidy Program
Editor, The Dally:
Critics of American policy in
Vietnam have written that the
people of South Vietnam hate
the United States because we
support the regime that backs
their landlords. That is, that
when American or South Vietna
mese troops clear an area of Viet
Cong, the old landlords return
and demand exorbitant amounts

of back rent. If these critics are
correct, our country is in a dilem
ma. On the one hand, we cannot
go on supporting a regime that
puts up with rent gouging. On
the other hand, we cannot sup
port a government that would
confiscate land from its legal
owners. After all, America is
more or less committed to free
enterprise, and to the principle
that private property should not
be seized without due process of
law.
There Is a solution to this di
lemma, however, and the princi
ple for it lies in one of President
Johnson's less successful domes
tic programs, the rent subsidy.
The United States Government
could easily afford to pay, say,
nine-tenths of the rent which a
peasant living in non • Commu
nist territory now pays. Natural
ly, we would have to institute
some sort of rent control to pre
vent the landlords from taking
advantage of us by raising their
rents. Nevertheless, since much
of the rent now paid is in the
form of crops, these crops could
be sold by the peasants them
selves on the market, rather than
being given to landlords who in
turn sell them to speculators and
black marketeers. Thus even the
consumers in the cities would
benefit.
