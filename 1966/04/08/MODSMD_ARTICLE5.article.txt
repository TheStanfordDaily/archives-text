WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (CPS) —
Purdue University sophomore, junior
and senior women will no longer have
any curfew restrictions as of today.
The new rules eliminating hours for
upperclassmen were approved early
this year by the campus Associated
Women Students and the dean of
women's office. Freshmen hours re
main in effect.
Each women's residence unit will

establish its own procedures for ef

approval of the dean's office. Plans
already approved range from a buddy
system (to let girls in after the doors
are locked) to the hiring of matrons
who will remain on duty all night.
A major university study on the use
of other campus facilities will be one
result of the elimination of hours.
Purdue officials explain that the clos

and other buildings have generally
coincided with the closing of dormi
tories. These times may now be re
vised.
Purdue's AWS took the initiative in
seeking the elimination of hours. The
subject first received serious consider

covered that the strongest resistance
to change came from the women
themselves.
Women's Fears Repudiated
The women feared that without
closing hours they would no longer
be able to escape "extended dates with
creeps," an AWS spokesman said.
AWS held "fireside chats" in each
dormitory, contending that without
closing hours there would be no so
cial pressures to stay out to any given
hour — women could set their own
hours. The women changed their
minds.
AWS' subsequent revolution called
for the elimination of all hours, but
a compromise was reached with the
dean of women's office which leaves
freshman hours intact at 11 p.m. on
weekdays and 1 a.m. on Fridays and
Saturdays.
