# LASSU Tables Women's Rules, Poll U Questions
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
LASSU backed out last night on
consideration of two controversial
bills, one calling for an advisory elec
tion to evaluate women's attitudes
toward present social regulations, the
other censuring the Political Union
for paying Senator Gore $1500 for a
speech.
Both will be taken up again next
Thursday.
The social regulations poll resolu
tion, sponsored by Martin Gerry and
Bob Klein, seeks to "make a responsi
ble assessment of the opinion of wom
en undergraduates on the subject of
social regulations." Gerry stated at
the meeting that he is seeking "an op
portunity for women to go on record
how they feel about this."
Choices proposed to be voted upon
are no social regulations, social regu
lations for first quarter freshmen,
social regulations for freshman year,
social regulations for those under 21,
or the present system.
An amendment will also be dis
cussed whether to delete the resolu
tion's second passage which favors
putting the Social Regulations Com
mittee under the exclusive control of

a non-ASSU women's organization.
If passed, the poll will be presented
to women on the ASSU primary elec
tion ballot.
'Railroaded'
A motion to reconsider the resolu
tion censuring the Poli Union was
made despite its defeat at the meet
ing because, according to Anderson,
the bill was "railroaded" through by
the call-for-a-previous-question pro
cedure and not enough time was al
lowed for amendments.
Anderson claims that $1500 is "an
exorbitant amount for such a pro
gram and that "funds for political
programs are limited and should be
used to present as wide a variety of
programs as possible."
Mike Jeffries, Poli Union president,
argued that the payment was not
only an honorarium to Senator Gore
"for less than $1000" but also in
cluded his expenses and a fee for his
lecture bureau.
Furthermore, he explained, Gore's
appearance occurred a week after
public hearings on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. He also stated
that "only $250 came from the
LASSU. The remaining $1250 came
from a special fund.

LASSU. The remaining $1250 came
from a special fund.
