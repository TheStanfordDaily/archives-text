Europe For You—A Mercedes For Dad
a,^er s idea of your summer vacation the last few years has been the night
shift at the ice plant, while everyone else headed for London and Rome and
I// Munich ... or
IF you are a father who has already decided to give in to your son or daughter s
Ewonderlust this summer and are looking for some reward for yourself along
with the canceled traveler s checks .
CONSIDER THIS:
A Mercedes 230 that sells for $4349.00 FO B New York can be picked
up in Europe for $2981.00, US. specifications included. Add on the charge
for home shipment and U S. duty (approximately $325, to West Coast, and
$140, respectively) and your (Dad's) car is back home, ready to go, at a sav
ings of over $900 —enough to pay for plane or boat fare to Europe and back
and a sizeable chunk of expenses in between. The car itself takes care of trans
portation, conveniently and economically.
Sound like a good idea? It is. And if you'd perfer a Jaguar, Porsche, Rover,
MG, VW, or any other European make, you can save on them, too The amount
varies from car to car, but the principle is the same. Auto-Europe, Inc., America s
larges* overseas delivery dealer, handles all arrangements: car delivery, Euro
pean insurance coverage, home shipment, travel aids.
