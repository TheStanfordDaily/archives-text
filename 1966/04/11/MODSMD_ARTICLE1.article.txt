# RAs', Sponsors' Evaluations Of Students Criticized
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor (First In a Series 
A proposal to alter radically student evalua
tion forms will be presented to Residence Di
rectors tomorrow by ASSU Vice President
Clark Brown. The presentation has the en
couragement of Dean Robert Gordon.
Brown's report, prepared together with four
sponsors and RA's, calls for the abolition of
incident reports and the change of procedure
on personnel reports, having them written by
students themselves, rather than by sponsors
and RA's.
Present policy is that sponsors and RA's
file with the Dean's Office reports on mis
conduct, disturbances, etc., as well as an end
of the year "personnel evaluation" form. The
reports are used In counseling and for writ
ing recommendations.
Brown's group, including sponsors Alice Jo
Amis and Howard Graves, and RA's Barbara
Vance and Tom Bachman, worked closely last
quarter with Dean Douglas Davis in drawing
up their recommendations.
Incident reports, the group says, tend to

be uneven, negative in tone, and of doubtful
use, accuracy and confidentialness.
Since many sponsors and RA's, "as a mat
ter of policy, don't make these reports, while
others seem quite conscientious, ... a stu
dent's file may give an inaccurate picture of
his conduct and problems," the report states.
Any tendencies toward inaccurate picturing
of the student are heightened by the fact that
"the nature of incident reports tends to be
negative rather than positive." Seldom or
never are incident reports completed when a
student contributes to furthering educational
aspects of residential living, so reports fail
"to give a 'complete' picture of the student."
The committee also questions the extent
of use of the forms, both for counseling and
for the writing of recommendations, the two
reasons the Dean's Office gives for the exist
ence of the reports.
Oral Reports
The committee feels that verbal reports
would be more accurate and thus enhance
the counseling ability of the Dean's Office.
"Sponsors especially are selected for their
ability to excite academic involvement," Brown

explains. "They are not trained to write coun
seling reports."
"Oral reports," he feels, "would be more
effective than written ones, because there is
greater likelihood that they will be complete
and less danger that comments will be mis
interpreted."
"Sponsors' and RA's' talking to the Deans
and Residence Directors will imprive their
ability to carry on counseling responsibilities,"
he says,"and further will improve communi
cations between members of the Dean's staff."
Even when employed for the writing of
recommendations the incident reports are of
little value, the committee feels. The Dean's
Office employs a part time secretary to check
students "personal" files on clearance for
recommendation from the Dean's Office.
Usually, she writes a form sentence, generally
affirmative in tone. If there are serious in
cidents, the recommendation is turned over to
one of the deans who writes the recommenda
tion on the basis of a separate "judicial" file.
Not Really Confidential
The last major objections cited against the
use of incident reports is "an objection to the

general availability of the incident reports to
RA's and other members of the Dean's staff.
There seems to be no control over who sees
what."
"An incident report describing a student's
emotional problem may be intended for a dean
or counselor or psychiatrist. At a later time,
however, this same report may be used by
a dean or residence director who is not trained
in counseling."
"The triplicate form of the incident report
further increases the likelihood of leakage of
confidential information," the report states.
Most of the objections that apply to the
incident reports apply to the personnel reports
as well, the committee states. But there are
additional objections to the procedures sur
rounding these annual evaluations of students
by their RA's and sponsors.
First is bias on the part of the sponsor or
RA.' "Some students in the living area are
better known by the RA or sponsor than
others. This leads to almost inevitable biases
in reporting. This problem is aggravated by
the use of the blank counseling form. Specific

objectives for the personnel report are not in
dicated: for example, the ways the personnel
reports will be used in the future."
The blank form "affords too great an oppor
tunity for the sponsor or RA to reflect his
own prejudices in describing a student's be
havior or in making an evaluation."
Injure RA-Student Relations
The second objection is that these reports
can be injurious to sponsor and RA relations
with students. "Some RA's and sponsors feel
that if the undergraduates in their house
knew that such reports as the end-of-year
personnel reports were being written about
them, they would be very hesitant to form
friendly, easy-going relationships with the
RA's and sponsors."
"If RA's and sponsors are to be effective in
helping people," the report states, "they must
not be seen as individuals 'keeping tabs' on
students for whom they are responsible."
Further objection* to the use of personnel
reports well at> the committee's suggestions
for ehange will be presented In tomorrow's
article.
