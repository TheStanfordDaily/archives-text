## Booklet Berates Ivy Dates 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—A college
girl's guide called "Where the
Boys Are" unmasks the dating
habits of male collegiates, but
from Dartmouth to Rutgers the
boys aren't going along with the
appraisal.
The 32-page book offering dat
ing advice to college girls was
compiled by the staffs of stu
dent newspapers at Smith and
Mt. Holyoke College for women.
Tartly written to plunge dag
gers into the male ego, it is a
reply to a book published last

year at Princeton in w hi c h the
boys had their say about the
girls. That one was entitled
"Where the Girls Are."
Written by Men
"Where the Boys Are" wasn't
written by girls at all but by
two young Amherst College se
niors, Thomas G. Plate of Far
mingdale, N. Y., and J. Aaron
Latham of Tucson, Ariz.
"The boys provided the cour
age and raised the money to get
the book published and we pro
vided the information," said 19-
year-old Marsha Cohen, a Smith
coed.
Here are some sample pass
ages from "Where the Boys
Are" and how they were greeted
by the men:
PRINCETON: "The only place
in the world where when a boy
and his date walk past a mirror,
it's the boy who stops to comb
his hair."
Wife Hunters
HARVARD: "Always remem
ber that if the Harvard man
you're dating is wearing a three
piece suit as you walk into the
Brattle Theater, he's wondering
how you'll look next to him at
some diplomatic reception in 10
years."
COLUMBIA: "If you want to
do the junior sophisticate bit
around Moringside Heights, the

Columbia boy is not for you, but
don't take him for a pushover;
anyone who's had to fight his
way into a subway is tougher
than any flimsy Ivy."
Wolves at Dartmouth
DARTMOUTH. "The Darmouth
man is a masochist . . . he's ma
rooned in the wilds of New
Hampshire ... so when another
voice (yours), soft, charming,
feminine, finally arrives, the
timber wolf is bound to pounce."
RUTGERS: "Berkeley East.
That's what your date will think
Rutgers is. He'll even try to
dress the part. California jeans
and longish, surfing hair."

from Dartmouth to Rutgers the
boys aren't going along with the
appraisal.
The 32-page book offering dat
ing advice to college girls was
compiled by the staffs of stu
dent newspapers at Smith and
Mt. Holyoke College for women.
Tartly written to plunge dag
gers into the male ego, it is a
reply to a book published last

year at Princeton in w hi c h the
boys had their say about the
girls. That one was entitled
"Where the Girls Are."
Written by Men
"Where the Boys Are" wasn't
written by girls at all but by
two young Amherst College se
niors, Thomas G. Plate of Far
mingdale, N. Y., and J. Aaron
Latham of Tucson, Ariz.
"The boys provided the cour
age and raised the money to get
the book published and we pro
vided the information," said 19-
year-old Marsha Cohen, a Smith
coed.
Here are some sample pass
ages from "Where the Boys
Are" and how they were greeted
by the men:
PRINCETON: "The only place
in the world where when a boy
and his date walk past a mirror,
it's the boy who stops to comb
his hair."
Wife Hunters
HARVARD: "Always remem
ber that if the Harvard man
you're dating is wearing a three
piece suit as you walk into the
Brattle Theater, he's wondering
how you'll look next to him at
some diplomatic reception in 10
years."
COLUMBIA: "If you want to
do the junior sophisticate bit
around Moringside Heights, the

Columbia boy is not for you, but
don't take him for a pushover;
anyone who's had to fight his
way into a subway is tougher
than any flimsy Ivy."
Wolves at Dartmouth
DARTMOUTH. "The Darmouth
man is a masochist . . . he's ma
rooned in the wilds of New
Hampshire ... so when another
voice (yours), soft, charming,
feminine, finally arrives, the
timber wolf is bound to pounce."
RUTGERS: "Berkeley East.
That's what your date will think
Rutgers is. He'll even try to
dress the part. California jeans
and longish, surfing hair."
NEW YORK (AP)—A college

habits of male collegiates, but
