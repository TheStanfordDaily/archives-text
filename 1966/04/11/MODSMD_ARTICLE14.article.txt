# Bear Nine Ruins Stanford Title Hopes In Upset Sweep
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's baseball squad can
now safely assume the role of
spoiler in the CIBA after two
weekend losses to Cal put them
out of the race. Even under the
most fortuitous of circumstances
Stanford's chances of winning
the pennant for the second year
in a row are rather dim.
Friday afternoon the Indians
traveled to Berkeley only to fall
victim to Andy Messersmith, an
all-league pitcher as a sopho
more last year.
Hitter, Too
Messersmith knocked in a cou
ple of runs with his bat and he
didn't have too much trouble
keeping the Indians in check
with his arm as he led his team
to a 6-1 victory.
Saturday's game in Sunken
Diamond was a more typical
Stanford loss. Stanford lost, 2-1.
Normally an excellent field
ing club, especially in the in
field, the Tribe made four errors
—all of them by infielders.
The Indians have worked
themselves out of bases loaded

and no out situations a couple
of times this season, but then
they'll give up a cheap run on
an error and a hit as happened
against Cal.
Pitcher Terry Docken didn't
didn't give up any earned runs.
Both base runners who scored
got aboard on errors.
In the seventh, Cal third base
man Tom Cooper got on through
an error and then scored when
Bear pitcher Bill Frost doubled.
Frost got two hits in his four at
bats.
Cal added what turned out to
be the winning run in the top
of the ninth when shortstop Don
Bunch reached first on an error
and eventually scored on a hard
shot down the leftfield line by
Bob Rebuschatis.
Stanford Cooled
Pitcher Frost was meanwhile
cooling Stanford bats for the
first eight innings. Centerfielder
Steve Hovley got two hits, but
that was about the extent of the
Stanford attack until the ninth
inning.

Marty Erck came up as a
pinch hitter with one away in
the ninth and blasted the ball
over the rightfield fence for
Stanford's only run. The ball
traveled approximately 350 feet.
Frost didn't have too much
trouble with the Tribe aside
from Erck's homer. He struck
out 14 batters for his 110 th
strike out in 75 innings. If Frost

of the ninth when shortstop Don
Bunch reached first on an error
and eventually scored on a hard
shot down the leftfield line by
Bob Rebuschatis.
Stanford Cooled
Pitcher Frost was meanwhile
cooling Stanford bats for the
first eight innings. Centerfielder
Steve Hovley got two hits, but
that was about the extent of the
Stanford attack until the ninth
inning.

Marty Erck came up as a
pinch hitter with one away in
the ninth and blasted the ball
over the rightfield fence for
Stanford's only run. The ball
traveled approximately 350 feet.
Frost didn't have too much
trouble with the Tribe aside
from Erck's homer. He struck
out 14 batters for his 110 th
strike out in 75 innings. If Frost
Stanford's baseball squad can
now safely assume the role of
spoiler in the CIBA after two

most fortuitous of circumstances
Stanford's chances of winning
the pennant for the second year
in a row are rather dim.
Friday afternoon the Indians
traveled to Berkeley only to fall
victim to Andy Messersmith, an

Messersmith knocked in a cou
ple of runs with his bat and he
didn't have too much trouble
keeping the Indians in check
with his arm as he led his team
to a 6-1 victory.
Saturday's game in Sunken
Diamond was a more typical
Stanford loss. Stanford lost, 2-1.
Normally an excellent field
ing club, especially in the in
field, the Tribe made four errors
—all of them by infielders.
The Indians have worked
themselves out of bases loaded

and no out situations a couple
of times this season, but then
they'll give up a cheap run on
an error and a hit as happened
against Cal.
Pitcher Terry Docken didn't
didn't give up any earned runs.
Both base runners who scored
got aboard on errors.
In the seventh, Cal third base
man Tom Cooper got on through
an error and then scored when
Bear pitcher Bill Frost doubled.
Frost got two hits in his four at
bats.
Cal added what turned out to
be the winning run in the top
of the ninth when shortstop Don
Bunch reached first on an error
and eventually scored on a hard
shot down the leftfield line by
