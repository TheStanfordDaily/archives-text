# Card Laxmen Extend Streak
## 
### 
Things began on a sour note
for the Indian Lacrosse team
Saturday at the Golden Gate
Park Polo field when San Fran
cisco attackman Gaudr.n batted
in a rebound off Stanford goalie
Mel Ellis's save to open up the
scoring.
But forty-five minutes later
Clay Primrose had turned a hat
rick for the Indians and Sandy
Saxton, Tony King and Doug
Ramsey had two goals apiece.
Stanford was on top 11-4 for its
third straight victory.
Primrose also contributed two
assists to the Indian cause.
In his best effort to date, Ellis
turned away ten San Francisco
shots after the initial fluke. San
Francisco got all its other goals
in the second half off second
string goalie Hugh West.
The game was roughly played
and little seemed to aggravate
the officials to call penalties.
The Indians meet Cal this
weekend.
