Stanford's great frosh swim
ming team, under the guidance
of coach Jim Gaughran, copped
off with third place at the AAU
National Swimming and Diving
Indoor Championships in Flori
da this last week.
Coach Gaughran said, "The
conditions were very poor, al
most like an age-group swim
meet. The water was 69 degrees
and the pool was three feet deep,
and not really suited for na
tional competition. But our boys
really did a great )job."
The frosh were only 10 points
behind the Yale Varsity, and the
powerful Santa Clara Swim
Team came in fourth behind
Stanford.
Strong In Relays
In the relay department the
Frosh came in third in the 400
yard medley relay, fourth in the
800 yard freestyle relay, and
fifth in the 400 yard freestyle
relay. In the 400 free relay, Mor
gan Manning anchored with a
46.8 100 free.
In the 800 free relay, the splits
were great. Morgan Manning,
Paul Meyer and Luis Nicolao all

swam 1:47.4's with Dick Roth
anchoring with 1:46.2.
In the butterfly leg of the
medley relay Luis Nicolao went
a fantastic 50.2 seconds .
Stanford's "B" relays placed
ninth in both the 800 free and
the 400 free. Pete Siebert went
a 48.6 and Paul Meyer went a
48.2 in the 400 free relay.
Nicolao Great
In individual events Stanford's
Luis Nicolao was great. He
placed seventh in the 100 free,
and second in both the 200 fly
and the 100 fly. He swam the
100 fly immediately after swim
ming the 100 free. Dick Roth
captured Stanford's only first
place in the 400 individual med
ley.
Other outstanding freshman
performances were: Bob Hart,
who placed tenth in both the 200
I.M. and 100 back; Bill Kee, who
placed eleventh in the 100 back
and missed his turn in the 200
back to just miss qualifying;
and Morgan Manning who
placed twelveth in the 200 free.
Three other Stanford swim
mers did well, but swam under
the banner of the Santa Clara
Swim Team. Greg Buckingham
set a new American record in
the 500 free (4:41.1). Mike Wall
placed fourth in the 1,650-yard
free (16:44.5), and sixth in the
500 free (4:49.0) making the
best times of his career. Bob
Momsen placed seventh in the
200 breaststroke.
