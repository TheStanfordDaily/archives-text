# Send Beer, Not Blood
## 
### 
Stanford's red, white and blue ROTC boys
are off and running again—this time not only
confusing humanitarianism with politics, but
with beer as well.
The local chapter of the Association of the
United States Army, the successor organization
to the Walter Army Society, has promised a keg
of beer to the living group with the highest per
centage of donnors in tomorrow's renewal of
autumn quarter's bleed-in.
While it may a kind gesture to send blood to
civilian and military casualties of the war in Viet
nam, we have yet to read of an American Red
Cross warning that the supply is running low.
The blood drive's purpose seems to emerge as

a political gimmick to show support for the
American policy that is causing the very casual
ties the A USA seeks to repair. As a conse
quence, individuals who would otherwise do
nate to Alpha Phi Omega's annual spring drive,
which has been cancelled to make way for the
A USA, will no doubt stay home.
Robert Clark, vice president of the Stanford
AUSA chapter, states that "it is the hope of the
AUSA that the blood drive's demonstration of
solidarity will shorten the war by bolstering the
morale of the anti-communist forces."
We submit that the AUSA could do a lot more
for the morale of our boys in Vietnam if it would
just send the beer instead.
