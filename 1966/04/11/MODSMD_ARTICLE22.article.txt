# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## Dogmatism In The University 
### DAVID CORNBERG JONATHAN KETCHUM 
(Editor's note: This is the second in a series of
articles commenting on American higher educa
tion, with particular reference to the problems
present in Stanford's approach to it.)

The history of education, even at its highest
levels, serves warning that no region of human
culture is ever completely free from dogmatism
— the entrenched and unexamined conviction
that essential problems are understood, and that
reality is known as well as it can be. Such dog
matism is an arch enemy of intellectual freedom;
and because it thrives best by going unnoticed
and unexamined, the act of attention to its char
acteristic forms is one of the first steps in sepa
rating true education from mere cultural preju
dice.
Resentment and Hyporerisy
The greatest intellectual guardian against dog
matism, as anyone in the university knows, is
true criticism. But when criticism is directed
extensively towards the status quo—whether the
relationship of boy and girl, or the relationship
of the university to the history and needs of the
culture —a characteristic dogmatic reaction to
this encounter is resentment, which may be open
or hidden. Resentful dogmatism fosters a latent
confusion between personalities in encounter and
the issues themselves, making the task of criti
cism very much more difficult.
If resentment is not overcome, a dogmatist
may assume a posture of openness and criticism
within his own enclave, resisting criticism from
another quarter, and hardening into a more subtle
and more deeply defensive posture: hypocrisy. A
hyprocritical dogmatist runs the risk of main
taining one set of beliefs, while acting according
to quite another set in the face of those issues
which concern him most directly. The critic faced
with this deep dogmatism must either retire into
solitude, or wage a war on resentment and hypoc
risy together—a war in which the critic too may
fall into the very attitude he is fighting.
Inquiry and Dissent
The way of this strait,which can become a
maelstrom of educational disaster, is a clarifi
cation which distinguishes the personalities of
the disputants and their various viewpoints from
the issues themselves. Clarification involves a
free encounter with the opposing viewpoint, and
requires constant self - examination, to guard
against the possibility of resentment and hypoc
risy within.
Sustained self-inquiry and critical dissent re
quire courage and perserverence in the work of
encounter, attitudes without which such complex
and emotionally charged issues as academic
dogmatism and alienation can neither be dis
cussed in their concrete setting nor seen as is
sues which may well transcend us as individuals
and the university in which they appear.
Liberalism, Activism, and Conservatism
Dogmatism may manifest itself concretely in
just those issues of the day which are of most

interest and concern to us—such issues as aca
demic liberalism, social activism, conservatism,
or even apathy.
The academic liberal believes that he solves
the problem of dogmatism by recommending free
inquiry. Yet his asserted openmindedness to all
viewpoints may be contradicted by his actions,
in brushing aside conflicting viewpoints and
dogmatically maintaining that the best possible
balance has already been achieved. Critics who
have tried to investigate departmental onesided
ness or interdisciplinary isolation have often
raised the most bitter dogmatism, resentment,
and hypocrisy.
The social activist may believe that his enthu
siasm for social justice is in itself a hedge
against dogmatism; but he may at the same time
dogmatically assert his own ethical Tightness,
brushing aside legal, political, ethical or diplo
matic issues with which scholar and politician
alike must deeply concern themselves.
The conservative, too, whether in the univer
sity or in society, is open to all the same hazards;
and insofar as liberals and conservatives fail to
make the effort to encounter one another, they
both run the risk of intellectual and social ossi
fication.
Apathy and Courage
These active forms of dogmatism have a pass
ive counterpart as well: an apathetic conviction
of Tightness in the face of alienation or social de
feat. The passive dogmatist, disillusioned over
his failure, may fall into embittered retreat or
prostrate rejection of criticism and dissent. The
courage to know and to do what can and should
be done is the way out of apathy; but the apathy
itself should serve as evidence to others for the
need for debate and inquiry into those issues
which have driven the apathetic critics under
ground.
These problems and issues in their concrete
form at Stanford are not hard to find. But we
as students or teachers in a potentially great
university will never disentangle ourselves from
the provinciality of our concerns unless we rec
ognize the universality of these problems of com
munication, which are not new to the human
race. The two central requirements for such rec
ognition are the courage and insight to disen
tangle personal convictions from the issues them
selves, and the perserverence to grasp these is
sues in depth and to respond to them deeply
ourselves.
We are not only Stanford students or teachers,
and not only American intellectuals; we belong
to a great academic tradition spread far over the
world and far into the past. The great academies
and universities in this tradition have periodical
ly confronted these stumbling blocks to human
communication — dogmatism, resentment, hy
pocrisy— and have forged ever anew methods of
communication to overcome them, and to spell
out at length, with care, and in detail the meth
od of departure from this simple starting point:
first understand, then criticize.
