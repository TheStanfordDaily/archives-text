# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Blame The Faculty 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
A summary of Philip Rhine
lander's fine discussion of "re
cent s t d u en t disorders" (The
Daily, April 18) might be that
administrators should deal
with each student as an indi
vidual. A student is a negative
rebel against impersonality,
searching "for a stable hierar
chy of values, in terms of which
(he) can find an identity for him
self and an effective outlet for
his natural idealism and his hu
man concern."
The Daily editorialized: "A bet
ter [than 'really listening'] solu
tion might lie in allowing stu
dents to have a major voice in
forming those policies under
which they must live and devel
op."
Although I hope administra
tors will really listen, even to
the point of giving students the
major voice for which they ask,
I suggest the real cause of un
rest would remain untouched.
For the problem is not with the
administrators: it is with the
faculty.
I don't know why contempor
ary faculties refuse to partici
pate in, if not take responsibility
for, the moral and emotional de
velopment of undergraduates,
though I do know that concen
tration on the intellectual leaves
education incomplete. Whatever
the reasons, the fact remains
that the classroom is the least
significant aspect of college life
for most students. Which, to
coin a phrase, is exactly upside
down.
No amount of administrative
sensitivity can overcome the
problem because the administra
tion is not at fault, ultimately;
it is only a symptom, a highly
visible product of the real dis
ease. Focusing on the adminis
tration and its little rules is in
deed treating cancer with mor
phine. The disease is the profes
sor who brings into the class
room his mind but not his soul,
his intellect but not his values.
The tragedy is the students who
leave the classroom as empty in
side as when he enters.

• A Free Choice
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Calfee's article in The
Daily, April 6, is clearly as su
perficial as he portrays frater
nity rush to be. His egalitarian
implications are unrealistic. The
process of choosing — whether
it be for a job, Phi Beta Kappa,
or a fraternity—is an inalien
able right in American society.
The other side of the coin is of
course the right for one to re
fuse or the possibility that he
may be turned down.
Mr. Calfee's first point is the
superficiality of rush and the
"ding-nugget" attitude of fra
ternity members. He first of all
fails to realize that the criteria
for judgment used by anyone of
any group are necessarily rela
tive to that group. Members, in
this case pledges, are picked for
their potential contribution to
the house and, it is important
to note, the possible contribution
the House may make to their
individual careers.
Obviously a 11 freshmen are
not regarded the same in any
one house. It is equally obvious
that there is no universal agree
ment in the Greek system on
the "nuggets" or the "dings,"
illustrating again the relative
nature of the selection criteria.
But while the above consider
ations are obvious and need no
elaboration, Mr. Calfee turns his
wrath on our superficiality, all
the while missing the essence of
the fraternity system that rush
so effectively brings out. This is
simply the privilege—even the
right — for fraternity men, or
anyone else if they so choose, to
pick (to discriminate for the

cynical) among prospective
freshmen the members of their
respective houses. Let me say
immediately that this does not
mean necessarily that the choos
ing is based on racial, religious,
or any other sectarian issue.
The chapters at Stanford have
illustrated this.
The fraternities here are not
a homogeneous mass of hell
raisers or anti-intellectuals (al
though Mr. Calfee would have
one think that). To the unbiased
observer this is equally obvious.
Mr. Calfee evidently identifies
"integration into the academic
community" with "elaborate fac
ulty and adviser programs."
This point is inconsequential. I
need but mention the number
of seniors in my house that are
going to graduate schools to
prove the contrary.
My point is simply that Mr.
Calfee has given a superficial
and biased account of Stanford
fraternities. I do not deny there
are drawbacks; I do not deny
there are advantages elsewhere;
but I do deny the use of rhetori
cal garbage as empirical evi
dence by Mr. Calfee against the
fraternities.
No one forces a freshman to
go through rush.. It is his free
choice. No one can force him to
accept a fraternity bid; it is his
free choice. It is the free choice
of the fraternity to give the
bids. This two-sided aspect must
be understood.
This is the essence of true
freedom here—the right of each
party to choose and to preserve
the integrity of each one—and
it is one of the greatest assets
of the fraternity system.

Editor, The Daily:
Like many other Stanford stu
dents on a hot Tuesday after
noon I was stretched out on the
bank of Lake Lag trying to com
bine some study with the sun.
Enjoying the sun also was a
group of a half-dozen fellows
about the age of Stanford fresh
men laughing and talking with
one another on the bank. This
bucolic scene was rudely inter
rupted by the appearance of a
campus patrolman asking to see
their student body cards and
upon finding none demanding
that they leave.
When I inquired of the patrol
man if he had asked the little
old ladies, the multitude of kids
and the young looking girls
down the other end of the lake
for proof of their membership
in the Stanford community, he
informed me that he asked
"everyone he thought was not a
student, staff or faculty mem
ber." Then I wonder why on this
particular afternoon he picked
on this particular group and, as
far as I could see, on no other.
Perhaps, because they were pre
dominantly Negro and hence
most unlikely (in the eyes of the
police) to be Stanford students.
This one incident certainly pro
vides no basis for accusing the
Stanford Police Department of
anything, but it does lead me to
pose a number of questions. For
instance, on what basis do offi
cers choose to ask for IDs. Is it
age? Then what about the little
kids, the Paly High girls and the
little old ladies. If not age, then
what?
Last year a considerable stir
resulted at Berkeley when it was
discovered that the "suspicious"
people in the Union who were
asked to show their IDs turned
out coincidentally to be predomi
nantly Negroes. I'm hopeful
that no similar pattern of dis
crimination will develop here at
Stanford.

respective houses. Let me say
immediately that this does not
mean necessarily that the choos
ing is based on racial, religious,
or any other sectarian issue.
The chapters at Stanford have
illustrated this.
The fraternities here are not
a homogeneous mass of hell
raisers or anti-intellectuals (al
though Mr. Calfee would have
one think that). To the unbiased
observer this is equally obvious.
Mr. Calfee evidently identifies
"integration into the academic
community" with "elaborate fac
ulty and adviser programs."
This point is inconsequential. I
need but mention the number
of seniors in my house that are
going to graduate schools to
prove the contrary.
My point is simply that Mr.
Calfee has given a superficial
and biased account of Stanford
fraternities. I do not deny there
are drawbacks; I do not deny
there are advantages elsewhere;
but I do deny the use of rhetori
cal garbage as empirical evi
dence by Mr. Calfee against the
fraternities.
No one forces a freshman to
go through rush.. It is his free
choice. No one can force him to
accept a fraternity bid; it is his
free choice. It is the free choice
of the fraternity to give the
bids. This two-sided aspect must
be understood.
This is the essence of true
freedom here—the right of each
party to choose and to preserve
the integrity of each one—and
it is one of the greatest assets
of the fraternity system.

Editor, The Daily:
Like many other Stanford stu
dents on a hot Tuesday after
noon I was stretched out on the
bank of Lake Lag trying to com
bine some study with the sun.
Enjoying the sun also was a
group of a half-dozen fellows
about the age of Stanford fresh
men laughing and talking with
one another on the bank. This
bucolic scene was rudely inter
rupted by the appearance of a
campus patrolman asking to see
their student body cards and
upon finding none demanding
that they leave.
When I inquired of the patrol
man if he had asked the little
old ladies, the multitude of kids
and the young looking girls
down the other end of the lake
for proof of their membership
in the Stanford community, he
informed me that he asked
"everyone he thought was not a
student, staff or faculty mem
ber." Then I wonder why on this
particular afternoon he picked
on this particular group and, as
far as I could see, on no other.
Perhaps, because they were pre
dominantly Negro and hence
most unlikely (in the eyes of the
police) to be Stanford students.
This one incident certainly pro
vides no basis for accusing the
Stanford Police Department of
anything, but it does lead me to
pose a number of questions. For
instance, on what basis do offi
cers choose to ask for IDs. Is it
age? Then what about the little
kids, the Paly High girls and the
little old ladies. If not age, then
what?
Last year a considerable stir
resulted at Berkeley when it was
discovered that the "suspicious"
people in the Union who were
asked to show their IDs turned
out coincidentally to be predomi
nantly Negroes. I'm hopeful
that no similar pattern of dis
crimination will develop here at
Stanford.

A summary of Philip Rhine
lander's fine discussion of "re
cent s t d u en t disorders" (The
Daily, April 18) might be that
administrators should deal
with each student as an indi
vidual. A student is a negative
rebel against impersonality,
searching "for a stable hierar
chy of values, in terms of which
(he) can find an identity for him
self and an effective outlet for
his natural idealism and his hu
man concern."
The Daily editorialized: "A bet
ter [than 'really listening'] solu
tion might lie in allowing stu
dents to have a major voice in
forming those policies under
which they must live and devel
op."
Although I hope administra
tors will really listen, even to
the point of giving students the
major voice for which they ask,
I suggest the real cause of un
rest would remain untouched.
For the problem is not with the
administrators: it is with the
faculty.
I don't know why contempor
ary faculties refuse to partici
pate in, if not take responsibility
for, the moral and emotional de
velopment of undergraduates,
though I do know that concen
tration on the intellectual leaves
education incomplete. Whatever
the reasons, the fact remains
that the classroom is the least
significant aspect of college life
for most students. Which, to
coin a phrase, is exactly upside
down.
No amount of administrative
sensitivity can overcome the
problem because the administra
tion is not at fault, ultimately;
it is only a symptom, a highly
visible product of the real dis
ease. Focusing on the adminis
tration and its little rules is in
deed treating cancer with mor
phine. The disease is the profes
sor who brings into the class
room his mind but not his soul,
his intellect but not his values.
The tragedy is the students who
leave the classroom as empty in
side as when he enters.

• A Free Choice
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Calfee's article in The
Daily, April 6, is clearly as su
perficial as he portrays frater
nity rush to be. His egalitarian
implications are unrealistic. The
process of choosing — whether
it be for a job, Phi Beta Kappa,
or a fraternity—is an inalien
able right in American society.
The other side of the coin is of
course the right for one to re
fuse or the possibility that he
may be turned down.
Mr. Calfee's first point is the
superficiality of rush and the
"ding-nugget" attitude of fra
ternity members. He first of all
fails to realize that the criteria
for judgment used by anyone of
any group are necessarily rela
tive to that group. Members, in
this case pledges, are picked for
their potential contribution to
the house and, it is important
to note, the possible contribution
the House may make to their
individual careers.
Obviously a 11 freshmen are
not regarded the same in any
one house. It is equally obvious
that there is no universal agree
ment in the Greek system on
the "nuggets" or the "dings,"
illustrating again the relative
nature of the selection criteria.
But while the above consider
ations are obvious and need no
elaboration, Mr. Calfee turns his
wrath on our superficiality, all
the while missing the essence of
the fraternity system that rush
so effectively brings out. This is
simply the privilege—even the
right — for fraternity men, or
anyone else if they so choose, to
pick (to discriminate for the

cynical) among prospective
freshmen the members of their
respective houses. Let me say
immediately that this does not
mean necessarily that the choos

• A Free Choice
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Calfee's article in The
Daily, April 6, is clearly as su
perficial as he portrays frater
nity rush to be. His egalitarian
implications are unrealistic. The
process of choosing — whether
it be for a job, Phi Beta Kappa,
or a fraternity—is an inalien
able right in American society.
The other side of the coin is of
course the right for one to re
fuse or the possibility that he
may be turned down.
Mr. Calfee's first point is the
superficiality of rush and the
"ding-nugget" attitude of fra
ternity members. He first of all
fails to realize that the criteria
for judgment used by anyone of
any group are necessarily rela
tive to that group. Members, in
this case pledges, are picked for
their potential contribution to
the house and, it is important
to note, the possible contribution
the House may make to their
individual careers.
Obviously a 11 freshmen are
not regarded the same in any
one house. It is equally obvious
that there is no universal agree
ment in the Greek system on
the "nuggets" or the "dings,"
illustrating again the relative
nature of the selection criteria.
But while the above consider
ations are obvious and need no
elaboration, Mr. Calfee turns his
wrath on our superficiality, all
the while missing the essence of
the fraternity system that rush
so effectively brings out. This is
simply the privilege—even the
right — for fraternity men, or
anyone else if they so choose, to
pick (to discriminate for the

cynical) among prospective
freshmen the members of their
respective houses. Let me say
immediately that this does not
mean necessarily that the choos
ing is based on racial, religious,
or any other sectarian issue.
The chapters at Stanford have
illustrated this.
The fraternities here are not
a homogeneous mass of hell
raisers or anti-intellectuals (al
though Mr. Calfee would have
one think that). To the unbiased
observer this is equally obvious.
Mr. Calfee evidently identifies
"integration into the academic
community" with "elaborate fac
ulty and adviser programs."
This point is inconsequential. I
need but mention the number
of seniors in my house that are
going to graduate schools to
prove the contrary.
My point is simply that Mr.
Calfee has given a superficial
and biased account of Stanford
fraternities. I do not deny there
are drawbacks; I do not deny
there are advantages elsewhere;
but I do deny the use of rhetori
cal garbage as empirical evi
dence by Mr. Calfee against the
fraternities.
No one forces a freshman to
go through rush.. It is his free
choice. No one can force him to
accept a fraternity bid; it is his
free choice. It is the free choice
of the fraternity to give the
bids. This two-sided aspect must
be understood.
This is the essence of true
freedom here—the right of each
party to choose and to preserve
the integrity of each one—and
it is one of the greatest assets
of the fraternity system.

Editor, The Daily:
Like many other Stanford stu
dents on a hot Tuesday after
noon I was stretched out on the
bank of Lake Lag trying to com
bine some study with the sun.
Enjoying the sun also was a
group of a half-dozen fellows
about the age of Stanford fresh
men laughing and talking with
one another on the bank. This
bucolic scene was rudely inter
rupted by the appearance of a
campus patrolman asking to see
their student body cards and
upon finding none demanding
that they leave.
When I inquired of the patrol
man if he had asked the little
old ladies, the multitude of kids
and the young looking girls
down the other end of the lake
for proof of their membership
in the Stanford community, he
informed me that he asked
"everyone he thought was not a
student, staff or faculty mem
ber." Then I wonder why on this
particular afternoon he picked
on this particular group and, as
far as I could see, on no other.
Perhaps, because they were pre
dominantly Negro and hence
most unlikely (in the eyes of the
police) to be Stanford students.
This one incident certainly pro
vides no basis for accusing the
Stanford Police Department of
anything, but it does lead me to
pose a number of questions. For
instance, on what basis do offi
cers choose to ask for IDs. Is it
age? Then what about the little
kids, the Paly High girls and the
little old ladies. If not age, then
what?
Last year a considerable stir
resulted at Berkeley when it was
discovered that the "suspicious"
people in the Union who were
asked to show their IDs turned
out coincidentally to be predomi
nantly Negroes. I'm hopeful
that no similar pattern of dis
crimination will develop here at
Stanford.

The fraternities here are not
a homogeneous mass of hell
raisers or anti-intellectuals (al
though Mr. Calfee would have
one think that). To the unbiased
observer this is equally obvious.
Mr. Calfee evidently identifies
"integration into the academic
community" with "elaborate fac
ulty and adviser programs."
This point is inconsequential. I
need but mention the number
of seniors in my house that are
going to graduate schools to
prove the contrary.
My point is simply that Mr.
Calfee has given a superficial
and biased account of Stanford
fraternities. I do not deny there
are drawbacks; I do not deny
there are advantages elsewhere;
but I do deny the use of rhetori
cal garbage as empirical evi
dence by Mr. Calfee against the
fraternities.
No one forces a freshman to
go through rush.. It is his free
choice. No one can force him to
accept a fraternity bid; it is his
free choice. It is the free choice
of the fraternity to give the
bids. This two-sided aspect must
be understood.
This is the essence of true
freedom here—the right of each
party to choose and to preserve
the integrity of each one—and
it is one of the greatest assets
of the fraternity system.

• Discrimination?
Editor, The Daily:
Like many other Stanford stu
dents on a hot Tuesday after
noon I was stretched out on the
bank of Lake Lag trying to com
bine some study with the sun.
Enjoying the sun also was a
group of a half-dozen fellows
about the age of Stanford fresh
men laughing and talking with
one another on the bank. This
bucolic scene was rudely inter
rupted by the appearance of a
campus patrolman asking to see
their student body cards and
upon finding none demanding
that they leave.
When I inquired of the patrol
man if he had asked the little
old ladies, the multitude of kids
and the young looking girls
down the other end of the lake
for proof of their membership
in the Stanford community, he
informed me that he asked
"everyone he thought was not a
student, staff or faculty mem
ber." Then I wonder why on this
particular afternoon he picked
on this particular group and, as
far as I could see, on no other.
Perhaps, because they were pre
dominantly Negro and hence
most unlikely (in the eyes of the
police) to be Stanford students.
This one incident certainly pro
vides no basis for accusing the
Stanford Police Department of
anything, but it does lead me to
pose a number of questions. For
instance, on what basis do offi
cers choose to ask for IDs. Is it
age? Then what about the little
kids, the Paly High girls and the
little old ladies. If not age, then
what?
Last year a considerable stir
resulted at Berkeley when it was
discovered that the "suspicious"
people in the Union who were
asked to show their IDs turned
out coincidentally to be predomi
nantly Negroes. I'm hopeful
that no similar pattern of dis
crimination will develop here at
Stanford.

A summary of Philip Rhine
lander's fine discussion of "re
cent s t d u en t disorders" (The
Daily, April 18) might be that
administrators should deal
with each student as an indi
vidual. A student is a negative
rebel against impersonality,
searching "for a stable hierar
chy of values, in terms of which
(he) can find an identity for him
self and an effective outlet for
his natural idealism and his hu
man concern."
The Daily editorialized: "A bet
ter [than 'really listening'] solu
tion might lie in allowing stu
dents to have a major voice in
forming those policies under
which they must live and devel
op."
Although I hope administra
tors will really listen, even to
the point of giving students the
major voice for which they ask,
I suggest the real cause of un
rest would remain untouched.
For the problem is not with the
administrators: it is with the
faculty.
I don't know why contempor
ary faculties refuse to partici
pate in, if not take responsibility
for, the moral and emotional de
velopment of undergraduates,
though I do know that concen
tration on the intellectual leaves
education incomplete. Whatever
the reasons, the fact remains
that the classroom is the least
significant aspect of college life
for most students. Which, to
coin a phrase, is exactly upside
down.
No amount of administrative
sensitivity can overcome the
problem because the administra
tion is not at fault, ultimately;
it is only a symptom, a highly
visible product of the real dis
ease. Focusing on the adminis
tration and its little rules is in
deed treating cancer with mor
phine. The disease is the profes
sor who brings into the class
room his mind but not his soul,
his intellect but not his values.
The tragedy is the students who
leave the classroom as empty in
side as when he enters.

• A Free Choice
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Calfee's article in The
Daily, April 6, is clearly as su
perficial as he portrays frater
nity rush to be. His egalitarian
implications are unrealistic. The
process of choosing — whether
it be for a job, Phi Beta Kappa,
or a fraternity—is an inalien
able right in American society.
The other side of the coin is of
course the right for one to re
fuse or the possibility that he
may be turned down.
Mr. Calfee's first point is the
superficiality of rush and the
"ding-nugget" attitude of fra
ternity members. He first of all
fails to realize that the criteria
for judgment used by anyone of
any group are necessarily rela
tive to that group. Members, in
this case pledges, are picked for
their potential contribution to
the house and, it is important
to note, the possible contribution
the House may make to their
individual careers.
Obviously a 11 freshmen are
not regarded the same in any
one house. It is equally obvious
that there is no universal agree
ment in the Greek system on
the "nuggets" or the "dings,"
illustrating again the relative
nature of the selection criteria.
But while the above consider
ations are obvious and need no
elaboration, Mr. Calfee turns his
wrath on our superficiality, all
the while missing the essence of
the fraternity system that rush
so effectively brings out. This is
simply the privilege—even the
right — for fraternity men, or
anyone else if they so choose, to
pick (to discriminate for the

cynical) among prospective
freshmen the members of their
respective houses. Let me say
immediately that this does not
mean necessarily that the choos
ing is based on racial, religious,
or any other sectarian issue.
The chapters at Stanford have
illustrated this.
The fraternities here are not
a homogeneous mass of hell
raisers or anti-intellectuals (al
though Mr. Calfee would have
one think that). To the unbiased
observer this is equally obvious.
Mr. Calfee evidently identifies
"integration into the academic
community" with "elaborate fac
ulty and adviser programs."
