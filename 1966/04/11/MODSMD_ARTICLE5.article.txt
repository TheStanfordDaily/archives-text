# ROTC Students To Solicit Blood
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of the Asso
ciation of the United Statets Army
(AUSA) has promised a keg of beer
to the men's and women's residences
that give the most blood, on a percent
age basis, in support of United States
commitment in Vietnam. Donations
will be by the American Red
Cross in the Old Union tomorrow
from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m.
The drive, sponsored by the AUSA
(formerly Walter Army Society), is
a follow-up drive to a similar one
autumn quarter. At that time, the
Society announced it would conduct
successive drives while there re
mained a major U. S. military involve
ment in South Vietnam.
According to Robert Clark, Vice-
President, the goal of the drive is
both political and physical.
There is a physical need for blood
which can be processed into gamma
globulin and for serum albumin used
in the treatment of hepatitis and
shock. These derivatives will go pri
marily to U. S. and Vietnamese mili
tary and civilian casualties of the
war, after being processed in labora
tories.

In addition, according to Clark, "It
is the hope of the AUSA that the
blood drive's demonstration of soli
darity will shorten the war by per
suading the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong that the U. S. will not tire
of the war either on the battlefield or
on the home front."
Clark reminds those who have their
doubts about the propriety of the U.S.
actions in this area, "It is in the best
humanitarian tradition to contribute
through the Red Cross toward allevi
ating the inevitable suffering of war."
The annual A-Phi-O blood drive,
usually held during the spring quar
ter, was cancelled this year to avoid
conflict with the drive for the Depart
ment of Defense.
