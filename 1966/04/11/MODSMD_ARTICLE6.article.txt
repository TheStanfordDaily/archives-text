# 'Viva La Huelga!'

### 

Four thousand Delano gTape workers
and supporters marched into Sacra
mento yesterday for a rally on the
steps of the State Capitol. Tills view
of the strikers' entry is from a Stan
ford delegation of grape strike sup
porters who marched the last five
miles of the 300-mlle, Delano-to-Sacra
mento Easter pilgrimage.
