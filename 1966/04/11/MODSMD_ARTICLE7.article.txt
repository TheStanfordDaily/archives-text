# Norman Thomas To Speak On Vietnam, Santo Domingo Today
## 
### 
Norman Thomas, six times the So
cialist Party candidate for President
of the United States, will speak this
afternoon at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Sponsored by Political Un
ion, the 82-year-old's visit to Stanford
will also include an informal recep
tion and discussion at the I-Center
tonight at 8.
Still the Socialist Party spokesman,
Mr. Thomas has favored the reconsti
tution of the Party as an educational
and research body, rather than a vote
seeking organization, since 1948. In
1960 the Party abandoned the presi
dential race. At that time Mr. Thom
as stated that neither the Republi
cans nor the Democrats provided an
adequate peace program. American
resources should be used to alleviate
world poverty and to plan for an
economy with disarmament. How
ever, Mr. Thomas opposed unilateral

disarmament. While critical of right
wing policy, he held firm in his de
sire for inspection provisions.
Socialism During the Depression
Mr. Thomas' first major political
candidacy came in 1924 when he ran
on the Socialist ticket for governor
of New York. He ran twice for mayor
of New York City, as well as for presi
dent of the U.S. in 1928, '32, '36, '40,
'44, and '48.
The Depression added support to
the Socialist Party cause. Mr. Thom
as' 1936 Presidential campaign was
addressed to the nation's immediate
needs. He advocated unemployment
insurance, adoption of a minimum
wage, a shorter work week, the end
of child labor. He criticized the New
Deal for meeting economic emergen
cies while neglecting moral issues.
During the ensuing factional dis
pute within the Socialist Party in

the 1930's Mr. Thomas represented
the "progressive" faction, as opposed
to the old-line Marxists. But the is
sues of Communism, fascism, and
organized labor contributed to fur
ther factionalism and party weak
ness. Just as the early years of the
Depression had strengthened the Par
ty's support, the New Deal policies
stole its major appeal.
Abandons Absolute Pacificism
In 1937 Mr. Thomas' trip to Mos
cow during the purge trials weakened
his faith in the Soviet experiment.
And the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 com
pleted his disenchantment. Although
his Loyalist sympathies in the Span
ish Civil War led him to abandon ab
solute pacifism, he remained a mem
ber of the Keep America Out of War
Committee. He thought American en
try in the war would only spread
fascism at home without destroying
it abroad.
During World War IT Mr. Thomas
followed a policy of "critical sup
port," aimed at the preservation of
democratic values. He fought the in
ternment of Japanese - Americans,
and he also denounced Soviet totali
tariansm when the U.S.S.R. was our
ally.
Ordained Minister
Mr. Thomas founded and edited
World To-morrow from 1918-21, and
he was associate editor of The Nation,

1921-22. He was chairman of the Post
war World Council, and he is a mem
ber of the Institute for International
Labor Research, the National Com
mittee for Sane Nuclear Policy, the
American Committee for Cultural
Freedom, the American Committee on
Africa, and Spanish Refugee Aid.
Although best known for his politi
cal interests, Mr. Thomas was or
dained as a Presbyterian minister in
1911. He received his A.B. from
Princeton, 1905; his B. D. from Union
Theological Seminary, 1911, and his
Litt. D. from Princeton, 1932. He re
signed from the ministry in 1931.
