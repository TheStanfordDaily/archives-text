# Sigma Chi Ponders Fate Of Local S.U. Chapter
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
Sometime this week Stanford's Al
pha Omega chapter of Sigma Chi will
find out if it will be readmitted to
the national or permanently expelled.
Various sources indicated the chapter
will probably be allowed to return,
but no official word has yet been re
leased.
The chapter was put on a year's
suspension last April for "disregard
of and active opposition to ritual,"
but the national's announcement
came the same week a Negro was
pledged.
National Protest
Since the suspension, which was
upheld by a national convention in
June by a 3-1 margin vote, there has
come a wave of protest throughout

the country against alleged de facto
discrimination.
Sigma Chi has no stated discrimi
nation policy, but a "social accepta
bility" clause requires that no chap
ter propose anyone for membership
"who for any reason is likely to be
considered personally unacceptable
by any chapter or any member any
where." Although photographs are
no longer required of prospective ini
tiates (a requirement dropped just
this year), all must be passed by a
national membership committee.
In January the membership com
mittee refused to approve initiation
of a Lafayette College, Pennsylvania,
pledge of Korean ancestry. University
of Colorado regents have placed the
Boulde| chapter on probation for the
national's policy, and Brown has or
dered its chapter to disaffiliate alto
gether. At least eight other eastern
schools and several midwestern and
western universities have also fo l
cused upon Sigma Chi chapters.
Letters from Humphrey
Vice-President Hubert Humphrey
has shown interest in the Stanford
chapter's problems by writing the
University to praise Alpha Omega's
work. "The elimination of racial dis
crimination in all aspects of universi
ty life is a matter which demands
prompt and effective action," Hum
phrey said.
Since its suspension, Alpha Omoga
has been forbidden to use the Sigma
Chi name when answering the phone
or on any correspondence. Represen
tatives have reportedly visited the
house throughout the year.
Yet the question remains whether
ritual or race were the primary fac
tors for suspension. Former national
president Harry V. Wade has said
the Stanford problem "is not mem
bership, and if we do have such a
problem it will have to be in the fu
ture."
Ollrich's Statement
Following the Denver convention,
in which most other undergraduate
chapters voted in favor of Stanford's
suspension, former Alpha Omega
president Frank Ollrich said:
"We have felt and always will feel
that, in our opinion, the suspensions
was based on the discrimination ques
tion. However, we sincerely feel that
definite steps are being made to elimi
nate racial barriers in our fraternity
and that this problem can be solved
within the framework of the national
fraternity.
"We intend to fulfill our obligation
to the national. However, we do not
intend to compromise our moral posi
tion on the question of racial discrimi
nation."
An alumnus of Sigma Chi who at
tended the Denver convention noted
that "there was no more than one
minute's worth of discussion about
ritual for every hour spent on race."
He added that several houses admit
ted they did not follow ritual closely
at meetings.
