# Sigma Chi Chapter Readmitted To National
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
Sigma Chi has been readmitted to
its national, ending a year's suspen
sion that began last April.
A statement released today an
nounced: "The period of suspension
of Alpha Omega chapter has termin
ated and it has now resumed its stat
us as an active, operating chapter
of the Sigma Chi fraternity."
A statement from the national or
ganization said it was "happy to re
instate the Stanford chapter and
noted "at no time has Stanford taken

no Negro pledge who meets the aca
any action against the national or in
ternational fraternity." The Sigma
Chi action was effective midnight,
April 7.
Winbigler's Response
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler, responding to Alpha Omega's
return to its national, said "the uni
versity understands that the chapter
has not changed its position with re
spect to rushing and pledging on a
non-discrimination basis.
"However, at the present time,"
Winbigler continued, "the chapter has

demic requirements for initiation into
the fraternity."
Alpha Omega was suspended for
alleged disregard of ritual, although
the suspension came the same week
a Negro student was pledged. The
action against the local chapter was
upheld by the national convention
two months later.
Status In Doubt
The status of Sigma Chi chapters
is in doubt at several schools through
out the country because of alleged
de facto segregation in national mem
bership requirements.
To date, two of Stanford's three
local fraternities ended national affili
ation because of discrimination. In
1960 the local Alpha Tau Omega chap
ter gave up its charter rather than
meet demands to drop four pledges
who were of the Jewish faith.
Two years later, the Sigma Nu
house withdrew in protest of clauses
which barred Negro and Oriental
members.
