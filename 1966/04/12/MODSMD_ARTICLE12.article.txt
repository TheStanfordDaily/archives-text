(Editor's note: This is the first in a
series of articles describing the plat
forms of the eight candidates for
ASSU President.)

The basis behind the campaign of
ASSU presidential candidate Steve
Ketchel is what he has termed "a
communications gap" between stu
dent-elected officers and the students
themselves.
"It seems that after a student body
officer is elected he loses his depen
dence upon his constituents, the peo
ple who elected him."
Ketchel feels that ASSU presidents

too often act only on the advice of
a limited number of advisers—who
generally agree with him anyway—
and do not take into account the feel
ings of the rest of the student body.
Lost Contact
"The student body loses contact
with what their elected officers kre
doing," Ketchel says. "At the end of
the year, when you come down to
asking a student 'What have your stu
dent body officers done for you or
for the University as a whole?' the
answer will probably be in most cases
'I don't know.' "
Thus Ketchel feels, the student body
as a whole is unable to express either
approval or disapproval of what the
student administration is doing, be
cause they are not fully aware of
what it is doing.
To remedy this situation, Ketchel
plans, if elected, to release much more
information to the students.
"Another way," he says, "will be
to institute a method which has been
used in the past—that of having in
formal, perhaps bi-weekly gatherings
where people can come and talk to
their officers.
"In this way student officials can
find out what people are thinking,
and it will give students a chance to
be a part of student government."
Schmidt's Theory
The theory behind next year's stu

dent government, according to presi
dential hopeful Carl Schmidt, should
be one of continuing the attitude of
trust and cooperation that has been
built up this year between students
and members of the faculty and ad
ministration.
"Students have proved this year
that they can be accepted on Universi
ty committees," Schmidt says,"And
on the committees that they have
been placed, they have been accepted
very well."
According to Schmidt, the original
conception of what the administra
tion of the ASSU President could do
was too small.
"We started out this year just hop
ing to get students on committees,
but found that they were accepted
with open arms."
Reluctant Committees
There are still a few committees,
says Schmidt, that are reluctant to
accept students, such as the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education. But
this. Schmidt thinks, will come next
year, "if we keep up this attitude of
mutual trust."
"Students have been able to put
their ideas across in those commit
tees simply because the faculty and
administration have found that stu
dents can do reliable work and that
their work is pretty generally first
rate.

"Professors and members of the ad
ministration often have neither the
time nor the inclination to go out
and make surveys or do research,"
Schmidt feels, "but students do. Stu
dents have the interest in doing this;
it's part of their education and they
learn a great deal."
Schmidt, who is legislative assist
ant to this year's ASSU President
Sandy MacKenzie, feels he has gained
valuable, first • hand experience in
student government.

as a whole is unable to express either
approval or disapproval of what the
student administration is doing, be
cause they are not fully aware of
what it is doing.
To remedy this situation, Ketchel
plans, if elected, to release much more
information to the students.
"Another way," he says, "will be
to institute a method which has been
used in the past—that of having in
formal, perhaps bi-weekly gatherings
where people can come and talk to
their officers.
"In this way student officials can
find out what people are thinking,
and it will give students a chance to
be a part of student government."
Schmidt's Theory
The theory behind next year's stu

dent government, according to presi
dential hopeful Carl Schmidt, should
be one of continuing the attitude of
trust and cooperation that has been
built up this year between students
and members of the faculty and ad
ministration.
"Students have proved this year
that they can be accepted on Universi
ty committees," Schmidt says,"And
on the committees that they have
been placed, they have been accepted
very well."
According to Schmidt, the original
conception of what the administra
tion of the ASSU President could do
was too small.
"We started out this year just hop
ing to get students on committees,
but found that they were accepted
with open arms."
Reluctant Committees
There are still a few committees,
says Schmidt, that are reluctant to
accept students, such as the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education. But
this. Schmidt thinks, will come next
year, "if we keep up this attitude of
mutual trust."
"Students have been able to put
their ideas across in those commit
tees simply because the faculty and
administration have found that stu
dents can do reliable work and that
their work is pretty generally first
rate.

"Professors and members of the ad
ministration often have neither the
time nor the inclination to go out
and make surveys or do research,"
Schmidt feels, "but students do. Stu
dents have the interest in doing this;
it's part of their education and they
learn a great deal."
Schmidt, who is legislative assist
ant to this year's ASSU President
Sandy MacKenzie, feels he has gained
valuable, first • hand experience in
student government.

CARL SCHMIDT
(Editor's note: This is the first in a
series of articles describing the plat
forms of the eight candidates for
ASSU President.)

The basis behind the campaign of
ASSU presidential candidate Steve
Ketchel is what he has termed "a
communications gap" between stu
dent-elected officers and the students
themselves.
"It seems that after a student body
officer is elected he loses his depen
dence upon his constituents, the peo
ple who elected him."
Ketchel feels that ASSU presidents

too often act only on the advice of
a limited number of advisers—who
generally agree with him anyway—
and do not take into account the feel
ings of the rest of the student body.
Lost Contact
"The student body loses contact
with what their elected officers kre
doing," Ketchel says. "At the end of
the year, when you come down to
asking a student 'What have your stu
dent body officers done for you or
for the University as a whole?' the
answer will probably be in most cases
'I don't know.' "
Thus Ketchel feels, the student body
as a whole is unable to express either
approval or disapproval of what the
student administration is doing, be
cause they are not fully aware of
what it is doing.
