to the State Capitol of striking
grape pickers from Delano. The
following account gives Hodges'
impressions of the event.)

Sacramento at 2:30 a. m. is an
uninspiring prospect anyway,
and the thought of spending the
night in a convent didn't help.
But on arriving at Our Lady of
Grace convent and school in
West Sacramento, it became
easier to accept.
The three of us — Stanford's
press team — gathered up the
blankets and sleeping bags and
headed for the school auditori
um. There, in the dim light of
a single bulb, sat a Mexican-
American man and his wife,
talking quietly but excitedly
about their Easter celebration.
We asked if there was a place
to sleep.

"Four or five students are
sleeping up there on the stage,"
he said, and then asked where
we were from. "Ah, yes," he
responded. "Many student have
come. We were lucky—families
in Sacramento put most of them
up for the night." The man then
went over the plan of action
for the last day of the pilgrim
age—a mass at 9 a. .m., a five
mile march to the State Capitol,
a rally on the Capitol steps.
Easter Parade
At 6 a. m. we were awakened
by noises from the back of the
auditorium — a clean-up crew
getting the building ready for
the Easter mass. Looking
around the stage—it had been
totally dark at 2:30 that morn
ing — it became apparent that
we had slept in a church sanctu
ary. On one side was a large
portable altar, and all around
us were jars, pots, and coffee
cans full of spring flowers.
On the wall behind the altar
was a 20- by 25-foot banner, the

red, white, and black symbol of
the National Farm Workers As
sociation and several other ban
ners proclaiming, "Bienvenidos!"
(Welcome). Finally descending
from the altar, we walked over
to one of the strikers and talked
for a minute or so.
"Y'know," he said, "this'll be
the first Easter parade I've been
to in a long time."
Pilgrimage
And yet it wasn't just another
Easter, for us or for any of the
marchers who began to gather
about 7 a.m. For the grape
workers and their families, it
represented the last day of a
modern Easter .pilgrimage.
About 60 of the striking grape
pickers began searching on St.
Patrick's Day, March 17, from
the Delano home of Schenley
Industries, the g r o we r they
were striking. Their numbers
rose and fell along the 300-mile
route as citizens joined them
for short distances and then re
turned to their jobs. About 20
of the original starters complet
ed the trek, which proved to be
closer to 400 miles because of
the winding rural roads they
traveled.
But the march was not an or
dinary protest march of modern
times; it was indeed a religious
experience for many. Under the
"Plan of Delano," the march
was a "pilgrimage to the capital
of the State in Sacramento in
penance for all the failings of
Farm Worker s." Symbolic of
"the long historical road we
have traveled in this valley
alone, and the long road we
have yet to travel," the proces
sion was headed by the symbol
of la virgen de la Guadalupe,
patroness of the Mexican peo
ple.
Ecumenism
It was a day of religious sig
nificance to others, too. At eight
or so we heard singing—in En
glish—a shorter distance from
the auditorium. Investigation
showed that it was a group rep
resenting Stanford's Canter
bury organization, led by the
Rev. Lane Barton. The Episco
pal service was held on the lawn

of the school, between the school
buildings and the convent.
After the service, Rev. Barton
explained that the Canterbury
group had stayed at the Church
of Christ in Sacramento, where
air matresses had been provid
ed for them. Stanford's Canter
bury group comprised the larg
est of those representing the
Farm.
Shortly after 9 a joint Protes
tant-Catholic Easter ceremony
was held in the auditorium, now
packed with strikers and their
sympathizers. The congregation
seemed to take part in a spirit
of ecumenism, with great enthu
siasm. Catholics — the people
and the priests — took part in
Protestant prayers and songs,
and vice versa.
Those who spoke only English
tried to follow the Catholic
mass, conducted primarily in
Spanish. The singing of the
Spanish hymns was strong and
particularly melodious—the en
thusiasm of the farm workers
was apparent in most of the
day's activities. Appropriately
enough, the only accompani
ment for the hymns was a gui
tar.
'Viva!'
Immediately after the mass,
the marchers began to organize
the processional in the parking
lot. Thousands of marchers, rep
resenting such groups as union
locals, religious organizations,
students, and unaffiliated sym
pathizers lined up four abreast
for the last lap of the pilgrim
age.
As the march started, I joined
an independent group of Stan
ford students. It was a cordial
group, happy to be there — it
was a good day for marching—
and participating fully in the
spirit of the procession. Every
few minutes during the first
half of the march, someone
along the route would shout,
"Viva la huelga!" (long live the
strike), and would be answered
with "Viva!" in unison from the
marchers.
At one point along the line of
march, a young girl — maybe
three years old — was shouting

"Viva la huelga!" "Viva Cha
vez!" from her car, waving a
balloon to the marchers. The
crowd responded in enthusiastic
vivas, and from that point, the
groups were even more en
thused by the march. By the
time we reached the drawbridge
that marked Sacramento's city
limit, "Viva" had become loud
er, longer, and more frequent.
On the capital side of the
drawbridge were several groups
of sympathizers — welcoming
committees, as it were—carry
ing banners proclaiming "Bien
venidos." Some women along the
route were crying.
As the march drew into view
of the Capitol building, the "pil
grims" began to organize their
shouts of "Viva la huelga!"

Sympathizers along the route
volunteered "Viva Chavez" and
"Viva nuestra Senora de Guada
lupe," and were answered by
more vivas.
When we got within a few
blocks of the Capitol, we passed
an elderly woman who had
joined the march within the
city, but who was having trou
ble keeping up with the quick
pace. For an organized march,
this Easter pilgrimage was one
of the most spontaneous I have
seen.
Brown Vacationing
The rally was held on the
steps of the Capitol. Included
in the program were speeches
by union representatives, rec
ognition of those who played
important parts in the pilgrim
age, and a speech by Cesar Cha
vez, founder of the National
Farm Workers Association.
Chavez was disappointed that

he failed in his objective — to
meet with Governor Brown on
Easter Sunday following the 25-
day march. Brown was spending
Easter with his family in Palm
Springs. One of the greatest
cheers from the crowd came
when it was announced that
farm workers from the Imperial
Valley were planning to picket
the place where Brown was
staying there.
Finally the crowd reorganized
in a processional to a Sacra
mento church, near which a fi
esta was held afterwards. It
seemed significant that after
the group had loft the massive
steps of the capital, "Viva la
huelga! Viva Cesar!" could still
be heard drifting from its line
of march.
Excerpts from the strikers'
speeches will be broadcast by
KZSU on April 30.

Brown Vacationing
The rally was held on the
steps of the Capitol. Included
in the program were speeches
by union representatives, rec
ognition of those who played
important parts in the pilgrim
age, and a speech by Cesar Cha
vez, founder of the National
Farm Workers Association.
Chavez was disappointed that

he failed in his objective — to
meet with Governor Brown on
Easter Sunday following the 25-
day march. Brown was spending
Easter with his family in Palm
Springs. One of the greatest
cheers from the crowd came
when it was announced that
farm workers from the Imperial
Valley were planning to picket
the place where Brown was
staying there.
Finally the crowd reorganized
in a processional to a Sacra
mento church, near which a fi
esta was held afterwards. It
seemed significant that after
the group had loft the massive
steps of the capital, "Viva la

be heard drifting from its line
of march.

following account gives Hodges'
impressions of the event.)

Sacramento at 2:30 a. m. is an
uninspiring prospect anyway,
and the thought of spending the
night in a convent didn't help.
But on arriving at Our Lady of
Grace convent and school in
West Sacramento, it became
easier to accept.
The three of us — Stanford's
press team — gathered up the
blankets and sleeping bags and
headed for the school auditori
um. There, in the dim light of
a single bulb, sat a Mexican-
American man and his wife,
talking quietly but excitedly
about their Easter celebration.
We asked if there was a place
to sleep.

"Four or five students are
sleeping up there on the stage,"
he said, and then asked where
we were from. "Ah, yes," he
responded. "Many student have
come. We were lucky—families
in Sacramento put most of them
up for the night." The man then
went over the plan of action
for the last day of the pilgrim
age—a mass at 9 a. .m., a five
mile march to the State Capitol,
a rally on the Capitol steps.
Easter Parade
At 6 a. m. we were awakened
by noises from the back of the
auditorium — a clean-up crew
getting the building ready for
the Easter mass. Looking
around the stage—it had been
totally dark at 2:30 that morn
ing — it became apparent that
we had slept in a church sanctu
ary. On one side was a large
portable altar, and all around
us were jars, pots, and coffee
cans full of spring flowers.
On the wall behind the altar
was a 20- by 25-foot banner, the

red, white, and black symbol of
the National Farm Workers As
sociation and several other ban
ners proclaiming, "Bienvenidos!"
(Welcome). Finally descending
from the altar, we walked over
to one of the strikers and talked
for a minute or so.
"Y'know," he said, "this'll be
the first Easter parade I've been
to in a long time."
Pilgrimage
And yet it wasn't just another
Easter, for us or for any of the
marchers who began to gather
about 7 a.m. For the grape
workers and their families, it
represented the last day of a
modern Easter .pilgrimage.
About 60 of the striking grape
pickers began searching on St.
Patrick's Day, March 17, from
the Delano home of Schenley
Industries, the g r o we r they
were striking. Their numbers
rose and fell along the 300-mile
route as citizens joined them
for short distances and then re
turned to their jobs. About 20
of the original starters complet
ed the trek, which proved to be
closer to 400 miles because of
the winding rural roads they
traveled.
But the march was not an or
dinary protest march of modern
times; it was indeed a religious
experience for many. Under the
"Plan of Delano," the march
was a "pilgrimage to the capital
of the State in Sacramento in
penance for all the failings of
Farm Worker s." Symbolic of
"the long historical road we
have traveled in this valley
alone, and the long road we
have yet to travel," the proces
sion was headed by the symbol
of la virgen de la Guadalupe,
patroness of the Mexican peo
ple.
Ecumenism
It was a day of religious sig
nificance to others, too. At eight
or so we heard singing—in En
glish—a shorter distance from
the auditorium. Investigation
showed that it was a group rep
resenting Stanford's Canter
bury organization, led by the
Rev. Lane Barton. The Episco
pal service was held on the lawn

of the school, between the school
buildings and the convent.
After the service, Rev. Barton
explained that the Canterbury
group had stayed at the Church
of Christ in Sacramento, where
air matresses had been provid
ed for them. Stanford's Canter
bury group comprised the larg
est of those representing the
Farm.
Shortly after 9 a joint Protes
tant-Catholic Easter ceremony
was held in the auditorium, now
packed with strikers and their
sympathizers. The congregation
seemed to take part in a spirit
of ecumenism, with great enthu
siasm. Catholics — the people
and the priests — took part in
Protestant prayers and songs,
and vice versa.
Those who spoke only English
tried to follow the Catholic
mass, conducted primarily in
Spanish. The singing of the
Spanish hymns was strong and
particularly melodious—the en
thusiasm of the farm workers
was apparent in most of the
day's activities. Appropriately
enough, the only accompani
ment for the hymns was a gui
tar.
'Viva!'
Immediately after the mass,
the marchers began to organize
the processional in the parking
lot. Thousands of marchers, rep
resenting such groups as union
locals, religious organizations,
students, and unaffiliated sym
pathizers lined up four abreast
for the last lap of the pilgrim
age.
As the march started, I joined
an independent group of Stan
ford students. It was a cordial
group, happy to be there — it
was a good day for marching—
and participating fully in the
spirit of the procession. Every
few minutes during the first
half of the march, someone
along the route would shout,
"Viva la huelga!" (long live the
strike), and would be answered
with "Viva!" in unison from the
marchers.
At one point along the line of
march, a young girl — maybe
three years old — was shouting

"Viva la huelga!" "Viva Cha
vez!" from her car, waving a
balloon to the marchers. The
crowd responded in enthusiastic
vivas, and from that point, the
groups were even more en
thused by the march. By the
time we reached the drawbridge
that marked Sacramento's city
limit, "Viva" had become loud
er, longer, and more frequent.
On the capital side of the
drawbridge were several groups
of sympathizers — welcoming
committees, as it were—carry
ing banners proclaiming "Bien
venidos." Some women along the
route were crying.
As the march drew into view
of the Capitol building, the "pil
grims" began to organize their
shouts of "Viva la huelga!"

Sympathizers along the route
volunteered "Viva Chavez" and
"Viva nuestra Senora de Guada
lupe," and were answered by
more vivas.
When we got within a few
blocks of the Capitol, we passed
an elderly woman who had
joined the march within the
city, but who was having trou
ble keeping up with the quick
pace. For an organized march,
this Easter pilgrimage was one
of the most spontaneous I have
seen.

vez!" from her car, waving a
balloon to the marchers. The
crowd responded in enthusiastic
vivas, and from that point, the
groups were even more en
thused by the march. By the
time we reached the drawbridge
that marked Sacramento's city
limit, "Viva" had become loud
er, longer, and more frequent.
On the capital side of the
drawbridge were several groups
of sympathizers — welcoming
committees, as it were—carry
ing banners proclaiming "Bien
venidos." Some women along the
route were crying.
As the march drew into view
of the Capitol building, the "pil
grims" began to organize their
shouts of "Viva la huelga!"

Sympathizers along the route
volunteered "Viva Chavez" and
"Viva nuestra Senora de Guada
lupe," and were answered by
more vivas.
When we got within a few
blocks of the Capitol, we passed
an elderly woman who had
joined the march within the
city, but who was having trou
ble keeping up with the quick
pace. For an organized march,
this Easter pilgrimage was one
of the most spontaneous I have
seen.
Brown Vacationing
The rally was held on the
steps of the Capitol. Included
in the program were speeches
by union representatives, rec
ognition of those who played
important parts in the pilgrim
age, and a speech by Cesar Cha
vez, founder of the National
Farm Workers Association.
Chavez was disappointed that

he failed in his objective — to
meet with Governor Brown on
Easter Sunday following the 25-
day march. Brown was spending
Easter with his family in Palm
Springs. One of the greatest
cheers from the crowd came
when it was announced that
farm workers from the Imperial
Valley were planning to picket
the place where Brown was
staying there.
Finally the crowd reorganized
in a processional to a Sacra
mento church, near which a fi
esta was held afterwards. It
seemed significant that after
the group had loft the massive
steps of the capital, "Viva la
huelga! Viva Cesar!" could still
be heard drifting from its line
of march.
Excerpts from the strikers'
speeches will be broadcast by
KZSU on April 30.

The Daily accompanied Ralph
Peer and Barbara Steeg of

following account gives Hodges'
impressions of the event.)

Sacramento at 2:30 a. m. is an
uninspiring prospect anyway,
and the thought of spending the
night in a convent didn't help.
But on arriving at Our Lady of
Grace convent and school in
West Sacramento, it became
easier to accept.
The three of us — Stanford's
press team — gathered up the
blankets and sleeping bags and
headed for the school auditori
um. There, in the dim light of
a single bulb, sat a Mexican-
American man and his wife,
talking quietly but excitedly
about their Easter celebration.
We asked if there was a place
to sleep.

"Four or five students are
sleeping up there on the stage,"
he said, and then asked where
we were from. "Ah, yes," he
responded. "Many student have
come. We were lucky—families
in Sacramento put most of them
up for the night." The man then
went over the plan of action
for the last day of the pilgrim
age—a mass at 9 a. .m., a five
mile march to the State Capitol,
a rally on the Capitol steps.
Easter Parade
At 6 a. m. we were awakened
by noises from the back of the
auditorium — a clean-up crew
getting the building ready for
the Easter mass. Looking
around the stage—it had been
totally dark at 2:30 that morn
ing — it became apparent that
we had slept in a church sanctu
ary. On one side was a large
portable altar, and all around
us were jars, pots, and coffee
cans full of spring flowers.
On the wall behind the altar
was a 20- by 25-foot banner, the

red, white, and black symbol of
the National Farm Workers As
sociation and several other ban
ners proclaiming, "Bienvenidos!"
(Welcome). Finally descending
from the altar, we walked over
to one of the strikers and talked
for a minute or so.
"Y'know," he said, "this'll be
the first Easter parade I've been
to in a long time."
Pilgrimage
And yet it wasn't just another
Easter, for us or for any of the
marchers who began to gather
about 7 a.m. For the grape
workers and their families, it
represented the last day of a
modern Easter .pilgrimage.
About 60 of the striking grape
pickers began searching on St.
Patrick's Day, March 17, from
the Delano home of Schenley
Industries, the g r o we r they
were striking. Their numbers
rose and fell along the 300-mile
route as citizens joined them
for short distances and then re
turned to their jobs. About 20
of the original starters complet
ed the trek, which proved to be
closer to 400 miles because of
the winding rural roads they
traveled.
But the march was not an or
dinary protest march of modern
times; it was indeed a religious
experience for many. Under the
"Plan of Delano," the march
was a "pilgrimage to the capital
of the State in Sacramento in
penance for all the failings of
Farm Worker s." Symbolic of
"the long historical road we
have traveled in this valley
alone, and the long road we
have yet to travel," the proces
sion was headed by the symbol
of la virgen de la Guadalupe,
patroness of the Mexican peo
ple.
Ecumenism
It was a day of religious sig
nificance to others, too. At eight
or so we heard singing—in En
glish—a shorter distance from
the auditorium. Investigation
showed that it was a group rep
resenting Stanford's Canter
bury organization, led by the
Rev. Lane Barton. The Episco
pal service was held on the lawn

of the school, between the school
buildings and the convent.
After the service, Rev. Barton
explained that the Canterbury
group had stayed at the Church
of Christ in Sacramento, where
air matresses had been provid
ed for them. Stanford's Canter
bury group comprised the larg
est of those representing the
Farm.
Shortly after 9 a joint Protes
tant-Catholic Easter ceremony
was held in the auditorium, now
packed with strikers and their
sympathizers. The congregation
seemed to take part in a spirit
of ecumenism, with great enthu
siasm. Catholics — the people
and the priests — took part in
Protestant prayers and songs,
and vice versa.
Those who spoke only English
tried to follow the Catholic
mass, conducted primarily in
Spanish. The singing of the
Spanish hymns was strong and
particularly melodious—the en
thusiasm of the farm workers
was apparent in most of the
day's activities. Appropriately
enough, the only accompani
ment for the hymns was a gui
tar.
'Viva!'
Immediately after the mass,
the marchers began to organize
the processional in the parking
lot. Thousands of marchers, rep
resenting such groups as union
locals, religious organizations,
students, and unaffiliated sym
pathizers lined up four abreast
for the last lap of the pilgrim
age.
As the march started, I joined
an independent group of Stan
ford students. It was a cordial
group, happy to be there — it
was a good day for marching—
and participating fully in the
spirit of the procession. Every
few minutes during the first
half of the march, someone
along the route would shout,
"Viva la huelga!" (long live the
strike), and would be answered
with "Viva!" in unison from the
marchers.
At one point along the line of
march, a young girl — maybe
three years old — was shouting

"Viva la huelga!" "Viva Cha
vez!" from her car, waving a
balloon to the marchers. The
crowd responded in enthusiastic
vivas, and from that point, the
groups were even more en
thused by the march. By the
time we reached the drawbridge

thusiasm of the farm workers
was apparent in most of the
day's activities. Appropriately
enough, the only accompani
ment for the hymns was a gui
tar.
'Viva!'
Immediately after the mass,
the marchers began to organize
the processional in the parking
lot. Thousands of marchers, rep
resenting such groups as union
locals, religious organizations,
students, and unaffiliated sym
pathizers lined up four abreast
for the last lap of the pilgrim
age.
As the march started, I joined
an independent group of Stan
ford students. It was a cordial
group, happy to be there — it
was a good day for marching—
and participating fully in the
spirit of the procession. Every
few minutes during the first
half of the march, someone
along the route would shout,
"Viva la huelga!" (long live the
strike), and would be answered
with "Viva!" in unison from the
marchers.
At one point along the line of
march, a young girl — maybe
three years old — was shouting

"Viva la huelga!" "Viva Cha
vez!" from her car, waving a
balloon to the marchers. The
crowd responded in enthusiastic
vivas, and from that point, the
groups were even more en
thused by the march. By the
time we reached the drawbridge
that marked Sacramento's city
limit, "Viva" had become loud
er, longer, and more frequent.
On the capital side of the
drawbridge were several groups
of sympathizers — welcoming
committees, as it were—carry
ing banners proclaiming "Bien
venidos." Some women along the
route were crying.
As the march drew into view
of the Capitol building, the "pil
grims" began to organize their
shouts of "Viva la huelga!"

Sympathizers along the route
volunteered "Viva Chavez" and
"Viva nuestra Senora de Guada
lupe," and were answered by
more vivas.
When we got within a few
blocks of the Capitol, we passed
an elderly woman who had
joined the march within the
city, but who was having trou
ble keeping up with the quick
pace. For an organized march,
this Easter pilgrimage was one
of the most spontaneous I have
seen.
Brown Vacationing
The rally was held on the
steps of the Capitol. Included
in the program were speeches
by union representatives, rec
ognition of those who played
important parts in the pilgrim
age, and a speech by Cesar Cha
vez, founder of the National
Farm Workers Association.
Chavez was disappointed that

he failed in his objective — to
meet with Governor Brown on
Easter Sunday following the 25-
day march. Brown was spending
Easter with his family in Palm
Springs. One of the greatest
cheers from the crowd came
when it was announced that
farm workers from the Imperial
Valley were planning to picket
the place where Brown was
staying there.
Finally the crowd reorganized
in a processional to a Sacra
mento church, near which a fi
esta was held afterwards. It
seemed significant that after
the group had loft the massive
steps of the capital, "Viva la
huelga! Viva Cesar!" could still
be heard drifting from its line
of march.
Excerpts from the strikers'
speeches will be broadcast by
KZSU on April 30.

The Daily accompanied Ralph
Peer and Barbara Steeg of
KZSU to Sacramento tliis past
weekend to witness the march
to the State Capitol of striking
grape pickers from Delano. The
following account gives Hodges'
impressions of the event.)

Sacramento at 2:30 a. m. is an
uninspiring prospect anyway,
and the thought of spending the
night in a convent didn't help.
But on arriving at Our Lady of
Grace convent and school in
West Sacramento, it became
easier to accept.
The three of us — Stanford's
press team — gathered up the
blankets and sleeping bags and
headed for the school auditori
um. There, in the dim light of
a single bulb, sat a Mexican-
American man and his wife,
talking quietly but excitedly
about their Easter celebration.
We asked if there was a place
to sleep.

"Four or five students are
sleeping up there on the stage,"
he said, and then asked where
we were from. "Ah, yes," he
responded. "Many student have
come. We were lucky—families
in Sacramento put most of them
up for the night." The man then
went over the plan of action
for the last day of the pilgrim
age—a mass at 9 a. .m., a five
mile march to the State Capitol,
a rally on the Capitol steps.
Easter Parade
At 6 a. m. we were awakened
by noises from the back of the
auditorium — a clean-up crew
getting the building ready for
the Easter mass. Looking
around the stage—it had been
totally dark at 2:30 that morn
ing — it became apparent that
we had slept in a church sanctu
ary. On one side was a large
portable altar, and all around
us were jars, pots, and coffee
cans full of spring flowers.
On the wall behind the altar
was a 20- by 25-foot banner, the

red, white, and black symbol of
the National Farm Workers As
sociation and several other ban
ners proclaiming, "Bienvenidos!"
(Welcome). Finally descending
from the altar, we walked over
to one of the strikers and talked
for a minute or so.
"Y'know," he said, "this'll be
the first Easter parade I've been
to in a long time."
Pilgrimage
And yet it wasn't just another
Easter, for us or for any of the
marchers who began to gather
about 7 a.m. For the grape
workers and their families, it
represented the last day of a
modern Easter .pilgrimage.
About 60 of the striking grape
pickers began searching on St.
Patrick's Day, March 17, from
the Delano home of Schenley
Industries, the g r o we r they
were striking. Their numbers
rose and fell along the 300-mile
route as citizens joined them
for short distances and then re
turned to their jobs. About 20
of the original starters complet
ed the trek, which proved to be
closer to 400 miles because of
the winding rural roads they
traveled.
But the march was not an or
dinary protest march of modern
times; it was indeed a religious
experience for many. Under the
"Plan of Delano," the march
was a "pilgrimage to the capital
of the State in Sacramento in
penance for all the failings of
Farm Worker s." Symbolic of
"the long historical road we
have traveled in this valley
alone, and the long road we
have yet to travel," the proces
sion was headed by the symbol
of la virgen de la Guadalupe,
patroness of the Mexican peo
ple.
Ecumenism
It was a day of religious sig
nificance to others, too. At eight
or so we heard singing—in En
glish—a shorter distance from
the auditorium. Investigation
showed that it was a group rep
resenting Stanford's Canter
bury organization, led by the
Rev. Lane Barton. The Episco
pal service was held on the lawn

of the school, between the school
buildings and the convent.
After the service, Rev. Barton
explained that the Canterbury
group had stayed at the Church
of Christ in Sacramento, where
air matresses had been provid
ed for them. Stanford's Canter
bury group comprised the larg
est of those representing the
Farm.
Shortly after 9 a joint Protes
tant-Catholic Easter ceremony
was held in the auditorium, now
packed with strikers and their
sympathizers. The congregation
seemed to take part in a spirit
of ecumenism, with great enthu
siasm. Catholics — the people
and the priests — took part in
Protestant prayers and songs,
and vice versa.
Those who spoke only English
tried to follow the Catholic
mass, conducted primarily in
Spanish. The singing of the
Spanish hymns was strong and
particularly melodious—the en
thusiasm of the farm workers
was apparent in most of the
day's activities. Appropriately
enough, the only accompani
ment for the hymns was a gui
tar.
