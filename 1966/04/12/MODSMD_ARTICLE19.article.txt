## Work In Spring? 
### Tom Edison 
A chance glance at next year's
football team would, of course,
be highly subjective by any
Stanford football worshipper.
Hopefully, however, past per
formances and statistics will be
briefly overlooked, if not totally
ignored, by Stanford's coaching
staff in these the, initial days of
spring football practice.
A new coaching schedule has
been devised for spring practice
in hopes of improving the results
of spring practice.
Coach John Ralston and his
seven-man crew will be as ob
jective as possible in the first
ten days of practice using their
drills of skill to uncover latent
abilities. Personnel will be
switched to new areas in hopes
of finding their most natural
positions.
Fifty Football Frosh
Recieving the bulk of atten
tion will be fifty highly rated
freshmen who compiled an un
defeated, slim four-game sea
son.
Two weeks of field inspection
will then be followed by a week
of drawing-board analysis which
should develop some valid evalu
ations of the squad's strengths
and weaknesses. Following this
breathing period—for the play
ers only—will be ten crucial
practices before the annual
Varsity-Alumni game, May 14.
A newcomer to the coaching
forces is Ed Peasley. From the
calibre of the coaching staff he
previously served under at the
University of Washington, he
should definitely contribute, if
not to the knowledge or finess
to the overall enthusiasm of
Stanford's coaching staff.

Dick Vermeil, last year's frosh
coach, has been moved up to
assistant varsity coach. He
should be able to provide inside
dope on the ability of the frosh
newcomers.
104 Candidates
A preliminary prospectus pub
lished by Stanford's athletic de
partment lists 104 candidates
for next year's football squad.
Naturally injuries and other fac
tors will take their toll of this
total. Ralston will still have a
large force with which to ex
periment.
Of primary concern will be
the loss of several defensive
personnel, the likes of Dale Ru
bin, Glenn Meyers, Bob Rath,
and Craig Richey. They com
prise most of the back-up for
Stanford's defensive line. Oh
yes, Ray Handley is also gone.
Although there are definite
strengths, in the terms of Dave
Lewis, John Mason, John Read,
Bob Blunt, and Mike Hibler,
Ralston's spring diagnosis will
be primarily concerned with his
major defensive weaknesses.
For the most part untested,
will come freshmen and red
shirts who will hope to fill the
gaps. Modification will also be
made of returning varsity per
sonnel.
25 Let term en
Twenty-five lettermen and 17
non-lettermen return from last
year's varsity squad. They pro
duced a 6-3-1 season, which on
the outside appears pleasing
enough but hides humiliating
losses to Washington and
UCLA.
Of the fifty or so freshmen re
porting for practice, quarter
backs Gene Washington and
Mak Marquess, halfbacks Nate
Kirtman and Bill Shoemaker,
end George Buehler, tackles
Malcolm Snider and Dan Fulk
erson, and guard John de la
Forest should emerge from
spring practice more confident
of their own ability while also
forming a composite from which
Stanford's coaches will pick to
paste into the 1966 football sea
son's glossy.

of drawing-board analysis which
should develop some valid evalu
ations of the squad's strengths
and weaknesses. Following this
breathing period—for the play
ers only—will be ten crucial
practices before the annual
Varsity-Alumni game, May 14.
A newcomer to the coaching
forces is Ed Peasley. From the
calibre of the coaching staff he
previously served under at the
University of Washington, he
should definitely contribute, if
not to the knowledge or finess
to the overall enthusiasm of
Stanford's coaching staff.

Dick Vermeil, last year's frosh
coach, has been moved up to
assistant varsity coach. He
should be able to provide inside
dope on the ability of the frosh
newcomers.
104 Candidates
A preliminary prospectus pub
lished by Stanford's athletic de
partment lists 104 candidates
for next year's football squad.
Naturally injuries and other fac
tors will take their toll of this
total. Ralston will still have a
large force with which to ex
periment.
Of primary concern will be
the loss of several defensive
personnel, the likes of Dale Ru
bin, Glenn Meyers, Bob Rath,
and Craig Richey. They com
prise most of the back-up for
Stanford's defensive line. Oh
yes, Ray Handley is also gone.
Although there are definite
strengths, in the terms of Dave
Lewis, John Mason, John Read,
Bob Blunt, and Mike Hibler,
Ralston's spring diagnosis will
be primarily concerned with his
major defensive weaknesses.
For the most part untested,
will come freshmen and red
shirts who will hope to fill the
gaps. Modification will also be
made of returning varsity per
sonnel.
25 Let term en
Twenty-five lettermen and 17
non-lettermen return from last
year's varsity squad. They pro
duced a 6-3-1 season, which on
the outside appears pleasing
enough but hides humiliating
losses to Washington and
UCLA.
Of the fifty or so freshmen re
porting for practice, quarter
backs Gene Washington and
Mak Marquess, halfbacks Nate
Kirtman and Bill Shoemaker,
end George Buehler, tackles
Malcolm Snider and Dan Fulk
erson, and guard John de la
Forest should emerge from
spring practice more confident
of their own ability while also
forming a composite from which
Stanford's coaches will pick to
paste into the 1966 football sea
son's glossy.
A chance glance at next year's
football team would, of course,
be highly subjective by any
Stanford football worshipper.
Hopefully, however, past per
formances and statistics will be
briefly overlooked, if not totally
ignored, by Stanford's coaching
staff in these the, initial days of
spring football practice.
A new coaching schedule has
been devised for spring practice
in hopes of improving the results
of spring practice.
Coach John Ralston and his
seven-man crew will be as ob
jective as possible in the first
ten days of practice using their
drills of skill to uncover latent
abilities. Personnel will be
switched to new areas in hopes
of finding their most natural
positions.
Fifty Football Frosh
Recieving the bulk of atten
tion will be fifty highly rated
freshmen who compiled an un
defeated, slim four-game sea
son.
Two weeks of field inspection
will then be followed by a week
of drawing-board analysis which
should develop some valid evalu
ations of the squad's strengths
and weaknesses. Following this
breathing period—for the play
