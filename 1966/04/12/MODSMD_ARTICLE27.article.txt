# From A Club To The Bomb; War's Not As Much Fun Now
## 
### DAVE KNOKE The Collegiate Press Service 
While it may be axiomatic that human nature
changes little over the centuries, one very nota
ble exception is the manner in which men wage
war nowadays. Granted the sophistication of
weapons and tactics have considerably changed
since Neanderthalean brainbashes were the most
effective way of doing your neighbor in.
This is not the point; technology has always
made gruesome advances in killing techniques
while the morality that guides men to use these
has remained relatively static.
What is most startling in reviewing the long
and colorful history of mankind's war is the real
ization that war is suddenly being fought by
men with entirely different attitudes from those
held just a few short centuries ago. The plain
fact seems to be that men no longer enjoy mas
sacring each other; war is being waged out of
inertia.
Paths of Glory
Time was when the common foot soldier had
an immediate, personal stake in marching down
the paths of glory; today he has been reduced to
the mundane role of cannon fodder.
Rack in the good ol' days (always idealized
by those who never lived then) when a man
could take the law in his own hands, fighting
was down-right fun. Rape, torture, pillage, loot
ing, gluttony, drunkenness â€”the enlistee's life
was one eternal round of glorious entertainment.
The Teutonic war bands enjoyed the physical
pleasure of fighting so much that, if the chief
could not think up an ideological dispute to start
a war, the tribes held a sort of Bacchanalia.
The mob would gather on the opposite sides of
some verdant spring meadow, and, with a super
abundance of strutting, cursing, caterwalling
and other sorts of bravura, would run toward
each other at top speed. Pairing off, they would
swing their war clubs, brandish their spears and
shields and begin pounding away without fi
nesse, taking care not to hit any vital spots. Dur
ing a daylight span, the armies would flail away

at each other in concentrated earnestness, on
the whole achieving at day's end nothing more
than a relaxing exhaustion and a hearty appetite.
Theatrical Talent
This ancient and noble custom has gone into
oblivion, as today's soldiers unimaginatively at
tempt to knock each other's blocks off without
displaying a modicum of theatrical talent.
No longer do soldiers from different armies
fraternize when they pause from battle; this an
cient courtesy of the fighting man toward his foe
saw its last gasp in the winter of 1914 when Ger
man and Russian troops took time out to cele
brate Christmas together on the Eastern front.
Once upon a time the army was a profession
every young man lusted after; there was no need
of a draft with a surfeit of volunteers and wars
were genetically selective. The best fighters were
the ones who went home to father the next gen
eration.
Sadly, the battlefield as a proving ground of
manhood began to disappear with the invention
of gunpowder. After all, in trench warfare, it
seems rather unfair that the short man has the
natural survival advantage over the tall man. No
wonder the French were a nation of midgets af
ter World War I.
Rules of War
Another dirty trick played on the common sol
dier was the invention of the rules of war. When
restriction started being put on the treatment
of prisoners and when extracurricular rapine
was sharply curtailed by stodgy top brass, all
the fun went out of the soldier's life. Mass butch
ery became the property of arm-chair generals
who designed genocide programs with a mini
mum of waste and excitement.
So instead of warring for personal gain and
prestige, the foot soldier had to start thinking
in ideological terms of National Interest, Home,
God, and Country as prix de la guerre. Rather
poor fare for the nasty business they do, but
everyone is told that "This man's army ain't
never had it so good."
They don't know the half of it.
