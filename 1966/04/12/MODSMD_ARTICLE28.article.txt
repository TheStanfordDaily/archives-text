# On The Right
## The 						Ice Age Begins Again 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
It must be very discouraging
to Western intellectuals year af
ter year at once to prove so im
potent, and so innocent. They
fancy that they have great in
fluence in the rational and aes
thetic order, and that noxious
regimes and practices will with
er away under the heat of their
displeasure. Yet it is so very of
ten the intellectuals who are be
mused, and who do not seem ca
pable of learning from experi
ence.
Denunciations
The proceedings in Moscow,
where the Communist Parties
of the world have foregathered,
are mostly in secret session,
free from the prying eyes of for
eign Kremlinologists. But sev
eral have been public, and the
most striking of these was the
session devoted to the denuncia
tion of every Russian intellectu
al who has dared by twitch or
by fancy to show a spirit of in
dependence.
The first and of course the
most authoritataive statement
came from Brezhnev himself—
who emerges, by the way, as the
likeliest new czar, whose Sia
mese relationship with Kosygin
is clearly loosening. Brezhnev
scolded and ranted about the de
linquencies of certain Russian
artists and intellectuals.
He was followed by Mikhail
Sholokohov, who was awarded
the Nobel Prize as recently as
in 1965 and, unlike Boris Paster
nak, was permitted to go to
Oslo to receive it. Sholokohov
proved that his first master is
not his muse, but his warden.
So the man with the Nobel Prize
pounded away at "those who
have betrayed the homeland and
slung mud at everything most
sacred to us."
Insufficient Servility
His reference was to the
wretched Sinyavsky and Daniel,
imprisoned a month or so ago
for insufficient servility to the
Communist system in their lit
erature. But Sholokhov's denun
ciation was not merely of the
Russian malefactors, but of
those around the world who pro
tested against their imprison
ment, among them known Com
munists; indeed, among them
some members of the audience
Sholokhov was addressing.
The speakers went on to at
tack "Novy Mir," the most spir
ited of the Russian literary
journals, pointedly criticizing a
play by its editor, Alexander
Tvasdovsky, which was critical
ol Stalin, Indeed, Stalin's repu

tation is being zealously rehabili
tated, if not by affirmation, at
least by discouraging criticism
of him.
The Russian ambassador to
Britain during World War II
wrote powerful and popular me
moirs criticizing Stalin's beha
vior during the war; and now
ho is denounced. Worst of all,
the overpowering little recrea
tion of the time of Stalin —"One
Day in the Life of Ivan Deniso
vitch" — which Khrushchev
found it temporarily convenient
to encourage back when he was
busy deflating the myth of Sta
lin—is now proscribed. The
whole school of effort praised
just two years ago by the Yugo
slav critic Mihajlo Mihajlov, is
now reviled for its "politically
amorphous personalities . . .

(who) flaunt their social and
civic passiveness."
The Riot Act
There is a sense of the deja vu
about it all. Not too long after
Khrushchev permitted a little
period of relative relaxation, he
descended on his artists and
read them a riot act in language
largely unpublishable. It began
with his favorite salutation:
"Pederasts"!—and he screamed
to the assembly: "We should
take down your pants and get
you down in a clump of nettles
until you understand your mis
takes . . . We aren't going to
spend a kopeck on this (trash).
We have the right to send you
out to cut trees until you've paid
bac kthe money the state has
spent on you."
That effusion was given, if I
recall, somewhere between the

Spirit of Camp David and the
Spirit of Geneva, where the cul
tural exchange programs were
instituted to advance an amica
ble intercourse between the in
tellectual and artistic leaders of
the two worlds.
Western intellectuals were
temporarily rattled by Khru
shchev's explosion, but they
quickly settled down to writing
about the new thaw; even as, to
day, it is predictable that West
tern intellectuals will for the
most part quickly forget the
imprisoned Sinyavsky and Dan
iel, and cozy up to the Russian
Establishment which has just
finished committing one more
affront on the moral intelli
gence, and exhibiting the subhu
manity of the culture with
which we are encouraged amica
bly to co-exist.

It must be very discouraging
to Western intellectuals year af
ter year at once to prove so im
potent, and so innocent. They
fancy that they have great in
fluence in the rational and aes
thetic order, and that noxious
regimes and practices will with
er away under the heat of their
displeasure. Yet it is so very of
ten the intellectuals who are be
mused, and who do not seem ca
pable of learning from experi
ence.
Denunciations
The proceedings in Moscow,
where the Communist Parties
of the world have foregathered,
are mostly in secret session,
free from the prying eyes of for
eign Kremlinologists. But sev
eral have been public, and the
most striking of these was the
session devoted to the denuncia
tion of every Russian intellectu
al who has dared by twitch or
by fancy to show a spirit of in
dependence.
The first and of course the
most authoritataive statement
came from Brezhnev himself—
who emerges, by the way, as the
likeliest new czar, whose Sia
mese relationship with Kosygin
is clearly loosening. Brezhnev
scolded and ranted about the de
linquencies of certain Russian
artists and intellectuals.
He was followed by Mikhail
Sholokohov, who was awarded
the Nobel Prize as recently as
in 1965 and, unlike Boris Paster
nak, was permitted to go to
Oslo to receive it. Sholokohov
proved that his first master is
not his muse, but his warden.
So the man with the Nobel Prize
pounded away at "those who
have betrayed the homeland and
slung mud at everything most
sacred to us."
Insufficient Servility
His reference was to the
wretched Sinyavsky and Daniel,
imprisoned a month or so ago
for insufficient servility to the
Communist system in their lit
erature. But Sholokhov's denun
ciation was not merely of the
Russian malefactors, but of
those around the world who pro
tested against their imprison
ment, among them known Com
munists; indeed, among them
some members of the audience
Sholokhov was addressing.
The speakers went on to at
tack "Novy Mir," the most spir
ited of the Russian literary
journals, pointedly criticizing a
play by its editor, Alexander
Tvasdovsky, which was critical
ol Stalin, Indeed, Stalin's repu

tation is being zealously rehabili
tated, if not by affirmation, at
least by discouraging criticism
of him.
The Russian ambassador to
Britain during World War II
wrote powerful and popular me
moirs criticizing Stalin's beha
vior during the war; and now
ho is denounced. Worst of all,
the overpowering little recrea
tion of the time of Stalin —"One
Day in the Life of Ivan Deniso
vitch" — which Khrushchev
found it temporarily convenient
to encourage back when he was
busy deflating the myth of Sta
lin—is now proscribed. The
whole school of effort praised
just two years ago by the Yugo
slav critic Mihajlo Mihajlov, is
now reviled for its "politically
amorphous personalities . . .

(who) flaunt their social and
civic passiveness."
The Riot Act
There is a sense of the deja vu
about it all. Not too long after
Khrushchev permitted a little
period of relative relaxation, he
descended on his artists and
read them a riot act in language
largely unpublishable. It began

It must be very discouraging
to Western intellectuals year af
ter year at once to prove so im
potent, and so innocent. They
fancy that they have great in
fluence in the rational and aes
thetic order, and that noxious
regimes and practices will with
er away under the heat of their
displeasure. Yet it is so very of
ten the intellectuals who are be
mused, and who do not seem ca
pable of learning from experi
ence.
Denunciations
The proceedings in Moscow,
where the Communist Parties
of the world have foregathered,
are mostly in secret session,
free from the prying eyes of for
eign Kremlinologists. But sev
eral have been public, and the
most striking of these was the
session devoted to the denuncia
tion of every Russian intellectu
al who has dared by twitch or
by fancy to show a spirit of in
dependence.
The first and of course the
most authoritataive statement
came from Brezhnev himself—
who emerges, by the way, as the
likeliest new czar, whose Sia
mese relationship with Kosygin
is clearly loosening. Brezhnev
scolded and ranted about the de
linquencies of certain Russian
artists and intellectuals.
He was followed by Mikhail
Sholokohov, who was awarded
the Nobel Prize as recently as
in 1965 and, unlike Boris Paster
nak, was permitted to go to
Oslo to receive it. Sholokohov
proved that his first master is
not his muse, but his warden.
So the man with the Nobel Prize
pounded away at "those who
have betrayed the homeland and
slung mud at everything most
sacred to us."
Insufficient Servility
His reference was to the
wretched Sinyavsky and Daniel,
imprisoned a month or so ago
for insufficient servility to the
Communist system in their lit
erature. But Sholokhov's denun
ciation was not merely of the
Russian malefactors, but of
those around the world who pro
tested against their imprison
ment, among them known Com
munists; indeed, among them
some members of the audience
Sholokhov was addressing.
