### BILL RORABAUGH 
Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-
Tung has created a personality cult
in the spirit of Josef Stalin, said Far
East expert Arthur A. Cohen last
night.
Cohen, a government employee,
told a Tresidder audience last night
that Mao, who considers himself a
great Communist philosopher, has
borrowed his ideology from either
Lenin or Stalin, with two signifi
cant but unphilosophic innovations.
Communist doctrine from Marx to
Lenin stressed the importance of ur
ban revolution, but Mao first marked
the trail for guerilla wars in the un
derdeveloped countries of the world.
'Self Criticism'
Secondly, Mao has emphasized
"thought reform" as a method to
maintain political control. Mao, like
Stalin, has used labor camps and bu
reaucracy to hold power, but he has
also introduced "self-criticism" and
"confession of failure to promote the
Revolution."
Mao's foreign policy has been to
promote revolutionary wars in under
developed countries, while maintain
ing that "major war is unnecessary."
Cohen quoted party press dispatches
stating "Vietnam is the clearest ex
ample of how communists can use
revolutionary wars to defeat imperial
ism."
'Nuclear Weapons'
Philosophically, adds Cohen, Mao
emphasizes adversity as a strength.
Struggle is happiness. "A man is soft
unless he has faced combat," says
Mao.
Mao has maintained that mankind
is "superior" to nuclear weapons.
Since, in struggle, the will triumphs
over economics, the weapons support
for armies are less important than
spirit. The best weapon is the
"Thought of Mao-Tse-Tung."
