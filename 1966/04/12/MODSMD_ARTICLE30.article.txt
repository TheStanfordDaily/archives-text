# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## AUSA And The Blood Drive 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to make one clar
ification and one correction on
The Daily's April 11 article on
the Herbert D. Walter Co. of
the Association of the United
States Army's drive for blood
for the Department of Defense.
The Walter Army Society was
not superceded by the Associa
tion of the United States Army;
rather, the two organizations
which formerly existed have
now merged into one for the
sake of efficiency, since their
purposes and efforts duplicated
each other's. My position in the
expanded organization is not
that of vice-president, as it was
in the previously separate Wal
ter Army Society.
I would like to emphasize that
the goal of the drive is both
physical and political. Secretary
of Defense McNamara has re
cently stated that the physical
need for the two derivatives
gamma globulin and serum al
bumin is "vital" and that "Con
tinued efforts must be made to
enlarge the supply to meet
emergencies and the ever-grow
ing needs."
On the political side, news of
autumn quarter's blood drive
reached the people the blood was
intended for. The then separate
Walter Army Society received
letters of appreciation from U.S.
commander Gen. Westmoreland,
Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge, and from a number of
U.S. servicemen serving in Viet
nam, thanking all the Stanford
students who contributed. The
blood drives at this and other
universities have, says Gen.
Westmoreland, "more than off
set the negative actions of an
uninformed minority."
The Herbert D. Walter Co. of
the Association of the United
States Army will continue to col
lect blood in physical and moral
support of the war, even after
the novelty of the "political gim
mick" wear off.

• A Bloody Editorial
Editor, The Daily:
While I have no desire to de
fend the AUSA's use of a keg of
beer to encourage donations, I
feel I must protest your Monday
editorial's treatment of the
AUSA-sponsored blood drive in
two other respects.
First, you discount the possi

bility of any humanitarian mo
tives on the part of the AUSA
because you "have yet to read of
an American Red Cross warning
that the supply is running low."
Do you feel that donations
should be made only when the
supply is so low that the Red
Cross must make a special pub
lic appeal? Do you feel that the
possibility of a sudden need for
more blood should not be pre
pared for in advance? Would
you question the humanitarian
motives of an Alpha Phi Omega
blood drive that was in response
to a specific Red Cross plea?
Second, you completely disre
gard the key part of the political
purpose of the drive. In Viet
nam the Communists, largely
because of their experience with
France, greatly overestimate the
importance of the actions of the
extremist wing of the anti-war
movement in the United States.
Mistakenly believing thar pub
lic opinion here will soon force
American withdrawal from the
war, they naturally feel no need
for negotiations. It is hoped that
expressions of public support lor
the war, such as the blood drive,
will eventually disabuse the
Communists and make them feel
the need of a non-military solu
tion.

• Liquor? Horrors!
Editor, The Daily:
Pandemonium reigns free on
the Stanford campus. The time
has come for the Stanfordians
for Honor, Integrity ,and Tem
perance to speak out. Needless
to say, we unabashed "prims"
are alarmed by the recent pro
posal to liberalize campus liquor
laws. Do not our "leaders" rea
lize that drinking, an evil in it
self, serves only as a prelude to
drug addiction and venereal
disease? Do not the self-righ
teous libertines of the SSRF rea
lize the sacredness of the sexual
act as exemplified by Cardinal
Spellman?
It is time that the vast ma
jority of more moderate Stan
ford students are given an of
ficial mouthpiece. In a spasm of
outrage, from the bowels of the
campus, comes Stanfordians for
Honor, Integrity, and Temper
ance. Our moderate platform
has the following six planks:
Abolish sex. By this we mean,
of course, the pre-marital and
homosexual varieties. We plan
to do this through a vast pro
gram of education, revealing the
horrors of V.D. and early preg
nancy.
Strictly enforce Stanford's dry
campus laws. One progressive
move in this direction would be
the installation of Booze Booby
Traps (i.e., liquor detectors) in
(every dorm. These are both
easily produced and cheaply
purchased.
Discontinue the sale of Play
boy and other such obnoxities
at the Tresidder drugstore. The
reason for this is self-evident to
all who treasure Simple Honor,
Integrity ,and Temperance.
Elect Barry Goldwater.
Strengthen girl's social regula
tions. We advocate a 9:30 p.m.
curfew for underclassmen and a
10 o'clock curfew for seniors.
These rather liberal hours (con
sidering the work some people
do on the farm) could be extend
ed if the girls were accompanied
by a competent adult woman.
The glorious consequences of
such a policy will bloom bright
ly on the horizons of Stanford's
tomorrow.
Mens' privileges should be
similarly curbed. The word
"curbed" is really inappropos,
for in the long run one is af
forded greater freedom by our
program.
We can envision in the not too
distant future a time when all
regulations will become obso
lete, when the blessings of true
moral inculcation will shine
through the gloom of yesterday,
uncovering a new age for Amer
ica's now estranged youth, a re
turn to Eden's innocence. Until
the dawn of sanctity creeps
again over plains of Kasmir, we
shall search the morning star.
As Bobby Fischer once put it,
if I move my knight to king
four he will checkmate me.

• Haight's Puerility
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps not a few students
misunderstand Mr. Haight's un
subtle satire of his own crude
puerility (The Daily, April B>.
The true reason why Mr. Haight
is allowed so much space is that
the publication of his efforts
should serve to encourage young
writers, and such an aim is ob

viously of great interest to The
Daily .
There was a certain note of
elegance in the literate ruthless
ness of Nancy Steffen. Today
we have editorials showing a
careful harvesting of the fruits
of a deliberate intellect. In con
trast, the grossly inconsiderate
Mr. Haight chucks up every idle
bit in his head with an aesthetic
delicacy apparently inspired by
the lighting fixtures of Memo
rial Church.
In view of the amount of en
nobling writing in print, Stan
ford students and faculty would
seem to have a right to demand
a reasonably ennobling news
paper, and when such is impos
sible, a somewhat greater pro
portion of silence .

• McNamara's Fix
Editor, The Daily:
"The number of Viet Cong
dead dropped to the lowest total
reported in seven weeks, 627," it
was reported from the Pentagon
(The Chronicle, March 25). That
is less than one hundred Viet
namese killed each day. At this
rate, even if we add the box
scores from our Air Force vic
tories over unfriendly villagers,
it will take many years before
we can take our chances with
free elections in South Vietnam.
With this poor showing on our
part surely our man in Saigon,
freedom-loving General Ky, has
every right to get livid when
some of our Senators suggest
sitting down with the National
Liberation Front; what would
his chances be in a free election
today?
There are far too many Viet

namcse peasants, buddhists, stu
dents and other suspected Viet
Cong still living. Come now, Mr.
MeNamara, surely you can do
better than this in weeks to
come, with almost unlimited re
sources of money, firepower,
manpower, brainpower and com
puter power at your command?

While I have no desire to de

two other respects.
First, you discount the possi

because you "have yet to read of

that the supply is running low."
Do you feel that donations
should be made only when the

possibility of a sudden need for

Second, you completely disre

because of their experience with
France, greatly overestimate the
importance of the actions of the

Strictly enforce Stanford's dry

Pandemonium reigns free on
the Stanford campus. The time
has come for the Stanfordians
for Honor, Integrity ,and Tem
perance to speak out. Needless
to say, we unabashed "prims"
are alarmed by the recent pro
posal to liberalize campus liquor
laws. Do not our "leaders" rea
lize that drinking, an evil in it
self, serves only as a prelude to
drug addiction and venereal
disease? Do not the self-righ
teous libertines of the SSRF rea
lize the sacredness of the sexual
act as exemplified by Cardinal
Spellman?
It is time that the vast ma
jority of more moderate Stan
ford students are given an of
ficial mouthpiece. In a spasm of
outrage, from the bowels of the
campus, comes Stanfordians for
Honor, Integrity, and Temper
ance. Our moderate platform
has the following six planks:
Abolish sex. By this we mean,
of course, the pre-marital and
homosexual varieties. We plan
to do this through a vast pro
gram of education, revealing the
horrors of V.D. and early preg
nancy.
Strictly enforce Stanford's dry
campus laws. One progressive
move in this direction would be
the installation of Booze Booby
Traps (i.e., liquor detectors) in

easily produced and cheaply

Discontinue the sale of Play

at the Tresidder drugstore. The
reason for this is self-evident to

The true reason why Mr. Haight

There was a certain note of

Editor, The Daily:
"The number of Viet Cong
dead dropped to the lowest total
reported in seven weeks, 627," it
was reported from the Pentagon
(The Chronicle, March 25). That
is less than one hundred Viet
namese killed each day. At this
rate, even if we add the box
scores from our Air Force vic

it will take many years before
we can take our chances with
free elections in South Vietnam.
With this poor showing on our
part surely our man in Saigon,
freedom-loving General Ky, has
every right to get livid when
some of our Senators suggest
sitting down with the National
Liberation Front; what would
his chances be in a free election

There are far too many Viet

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to make one clar
ification and one correction on
The Daily's April 11 article on
the Herbert D. Walter Co. of
the Association of the United
States Army's drive for blood
for the Department of Defense.
The Walter Army Society was
not superceded by the Associa

rather, the two organizations
which formerly existed have
now merged into one for the
sake of efficiency, since their
purposes and efforts duplicated
each other's. My position in the
expanded organization is not
that of vice-president, as it was
in the previously separate Wal
ter Army Society.
I would like to emphasize that
the goal of the drive is both
physical and political. Secretary
of Defense McNamara has re
cently stated that the physical
need for the two derivatives
gamma globulin and serum al
bumin is "vital" and that "Con
tinued efforts must be made to
enlarge the supply to meet
emergencies and the ever-grow
ing needs."
On the political side, news of
autumn quarter's blood drive
reached the people the blood was
intended for. The then separate
Walter Army Society received
letters of appreciation from U.S.
commander Gen. Westmoreland,
Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge, and from a number of
U.S. servicemen serving in Viet
nam, thanking all the Stanford
students who contributed. The
blood drives at this and other
universities have, says Gen.
Westmoreland, "more than off
set the negative actions of an
uninformed minority."
The Herbert D. Walter Co. of
the Association of the United

lect blood in physical and moral
support of the war, even after
the novelty of the "political gim

• A Bloody Editorial
Editor, The Daily:
While I have no desire to de
fend the AUSA's use of a keg of
beer to encourage donations, I
feel I must protest your Monday
editorial's treatment of the
AUSA-sponsored blood drive in
two other respects.
First, you discount the possi

bility of any humanitarian mo
tives on the part of the AUSA
because you "have yet to read of
an American Red Cross warning
that the supply is running low."
Do you feel that donations
should be made only when the
supply is so low that the Red
Cross must make a special pub
lic appeal? Do you feel that the
possibility of a sudden need for
more blood should not be pre
pared for in advance? Would
you question the humanitarian
motives of an Alpha Phi Omega
blood drive that was in response
to a specific Red Cross plea?
Second, you completely disre
gard the key part of the political
purpose of the drive. In Viet
nam the Communists, largely
because of their experience with
France, greatly overestimate the
importance of the actions of the
extremist wing of the anti-war
movement in the United States.
Mistakenly believing thar pub
lic opinion here will soon force
American withdrawal from the
war, they naturally feel no need
for negotiations. It is hoped that
expressions of public support lor
the war, such as the blood drive,
will eventually disabuse the
Communists and make them feel
the need of a non-military solu

• A Bloody Editorial
Editor, The Daily:
While I have no desire to de
fend the AUSA's use of a keg of
beer to encourage donations, I
feel I must protest your Monday
editorial's treatment of the
AUSA-sponsored blood drive in
two other respects.
First, you discount the possi

bility of any humanitarian mo
tives on the part of the AUSA
because you "have yet to read of
an American Red Cross warning
that the supply is running low."
Do you feel that donations
should be made only when the
supply is so low that the Red
Cross must make a special pub
lic appeal? Do you feel that the
possibility of a sudden need for
more blood should not be pre
pared for in advance? Would
you question the humanitarian
motives of an Alpha Phi Omega
blood drive that was in response
to a specific Red Cross plea?
Second, you completely disre
gard the key part of the political
purpose of the drive. In Viet
nam the Communists, largely
because of their experience with
France, greatly overestimate the
importance of the actions of the
extremist wing of the anti-war
movement in the United States.
Mistakenly believing thar pub

will eventually disabuse the

Abolish sex. By this we mean,
of course, the pre-marital and

Strictly enforce Stanford's dry

The true reason why Mr. Haight

Editor, The Daily:
"The number of Viet Cong
dead dropped to the lowest total
reported in seven weeks, 627," it
was reported from the Pentagon
(The Chronicle, March 25). That
is less than one hundred Viet

rate, even if we add the box

it will take many years before
we can take our chances with

With this poor showing on our

every right to get livid when
some of our Senators suggest

careful harvesting of the fruits
of a deliberate intellect. In con
trast, the grossly inconsiderate
Mr. Haight chucks up every idle
bit in his head with an aesthetic
delicacy apparently inspired by
the lighting fixtures of Memo
rial Church.
In view of the amount of en
nobling writing in print, Stan
ford students and faculty would
seem to have a right to demand
a reasonably ennobling news
paper, and when such is impos
sible, a somewhat greater pro
portion of silence .

• McNamara's Fix
Editor, The Daily:
"The number of Viet Cong
dead dropped to the lowest total
reported in seven weeks, 627," it
was reported from the Pentagon
(The Chronicle, March 25). That
is less than one hundred Viet
namese killed each day. At this
rate, even if we add the box
scores from our Air Force vic
tories over unfriendly villagers,
it will take many years before
we can take our chances with
free elections in South Vietnam.
With this poor showing on our
part surely our man in Saigon,
freedom-loving General Ky, has
every right to get livid when
some of our Senators suggest
sitting down with the National
Liberation Front; what would
his chances be in a free election
today?
There are far too many Viet

namcse peasants, buddhists, stu
dents and other suspected Viet
Cong still living. Come now, Mr.
MeNamara, surely you can do
better than this in weeks to
come, with almost unlimited re
sources of money, firepower,
manpower, brainpower and com
puter power at your command?
