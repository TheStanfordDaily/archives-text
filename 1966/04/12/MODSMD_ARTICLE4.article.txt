# Congresswoman Criticizes Cut In School Aid
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
Congresswoman Edith Green (D,
Portland) scored President Johnson's
proposed cuts in aid to higher educa
tion in a press conference held yester
day at Stanford.
Mrs. Green, a member of the House
Education and Labor Committee said
the committee had rejected cuts in
National Defense Education Loans as
well as cuts in aid to the land grant
colleges. Faced with rising costs of
the Vietnam war, the congresswoman
said the United States could not af
ford to resolve the problem with
"guns and ignorance."
Million in Loans
Stanford students presently hold
more than $1 million in National De

rense Loans. Under the provision of
the National Defense Act, a student
may borrow up to $10,000 dollars.
The six-term congresswoman is
making a three day visit to Stanford
and will deliver the Tuesday evening
Series tonight in Cubberly auditorium
at 7:45. In her address "Moving
Ahead," she will discuss the right of
dissent in the current policy debate.
Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Higher Education and Special Educa
tion, Mrs. Green taught school in
Salem, Oregon for 14 years prior to
entering the house. After graduating
from the University of Oregon she
did graduate work at Stanford.
Citing cost figures, Mrs. Green
leveled strong criticism at Operation
Headstart and the Job Corps. "If we
gave to the established school sys
tems what we are now willing to give
to these programs, they could prob
ably make some pretty spectacular
break-throughs," she maintained.
Cost Of Job Corps
According to Mrs. Green's figures,
the cost of the Jobs Corps was about
$9100 last year for each man enrolled
and $8400 for each woman participat
ing. Yet the program has benefited
only 20,000 of the nearly one million
men and women who qualify for the
program.
"The only way we can reach these

youngsters is through the established
school systems," the congresswoman
noted.
Turning to other topics, Mrs. Green
called the current Vietnam regime
a "puppet government." "If we could
just move from bombs to education
and economic development," the con
gresswoman asserted the United
States' position would be much
stronger while benefiting the Viet
namese people.
Mrs. Green favors negotiations
which would include the Viet Cong
at the bargaining table.
A Gap In Understanding
Asked about the impact of student
protest upon the Congress, Mrs. Green
said there was a gap in understand
ing between the generations which in
part was the responsibility of the
government. She blamed federal
grants for "siphoning off professors
into research" and adding to the im
personal quality of American col
leges.
"There is something exciting about
the involvement of college students
today. They believe what they have
been taught. They believe in Freedom
of Speech," she observed. Mrs. Green
refused to classify student activists
as members of the fringe, and assert
ed the right of all citizons to dissent
regardless of age.

Turning to other topics, Mrs. Green
called the current Vietnam regime
a "puppet government." "If we could
just move from bombs to education
and economic development," the con
gresswoman asserted the United
States' position would be much
stronger while benefiting the Viet
namese people.
Mrs. Green favors negotiations
which would include the Viet Cong
at the bargaining table.
A Gap In Understanding
Asked about the impact of student
protest upon the Congress, Mrs. Green
said there was a gap in understand
ing between the generations which in
part was the responsibility of the
government. She blamed federal
grants for "siphoning off professors
into research" and adding to the im
personal quality of American col
leges.
"There is something exciting about
the involvement of college students
today. They believe what they have
been taught. They believe in Freedom
of Speech," she observed. Mrs. Green
refused to classify student activists
as members of the fringe, and assert
ed the right of all citizons to dissent
regardless of age.
Congresswoman Edith Green (D,
Portland) scored President Johnson's
proposed cuts in aid to higher educa
tion in a press conference held yester
day at Stanford.
Mrs. Green, a member of the House
Education and Labor Committee said
the committee had rejected cuts in
National Defense Education Loans as
well as cuts in aid to the land grant
colleges. Faced with rising costs of
the Vietnam war, the congresswoman
said the United States could not af
ford to resolve the problem with
"guns and ignorance."
Million in Loans
Stanford students presently hold
more than $1 million in National De

rense Loans. Under the provision of
the National Defense Act, a student
may borrow up to $10,000 dollars.
The six-term congresswoman is
making a three day visit to Stanford
and will deliver the Tuesday evening
Series tonight in Cubberly auditorium
at 7:45. In her address "Moving
Ahead," she will discuss the right of
dissent in the current policy debate.
Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Higher Education and Special Educa
tion, Mrs. Green taught school in
Salem, Oregon for 14 years prior to
entering the house. After graduating
from the University of Oregon she
did graduate work at Stanford.
Citing cost figures, Mrs. Green
leveled strong criticism at Operation
Headstart and the Job Corps. "If we
gave to the established school sys
tems what we are now willing to give
to these programs, they could prob
ably make some pretty spectacular
break-throughs," she maintained.
Cost Of Job Corps
According to Mrs. Green's figures,
the cost of the Jobs Corps was about
$9100 last year for each man enrolled
and $8400 for each woman participat
ing. Yet the program has benefited
only 20,000 of the nearly one million
men and women who qualify for the
program.
"The only way we can reach these

youngsters is through the established
school systems," the congresswoman
noted.
