# Aged Thomas Attuned To Present
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Managing Editor 
Typically, Norman Thomas intro
duces his remarks with a parentheti
cal "in my long life."
But the white-haired politician, six
times Socialist candidate for United
States President, is not one for remi
niscing on his 82 years. Although he

complains of his weak vision and his
"old-age, faulty memory," he is re
markably attuned to the present and
his Comments are often sharp and
perceptive.
"In my long experience," he said
in an interview yesterday,"I have
never known a time when neighbors
persecuted neighbors as much as to
day. And I don't just mean the Ku
Klux Klan."
One factor responsible for this in
tolerance, he said, is the "legacy of
violence which is a result of the
wars we have had."
Before his speech on the Vietnam
war, Thomas refused to comment on
the subject since it would be "like
asking a musician to play a couple
of bars just before a concert," but
he did make one terse remark about
the war to a reporter and it clearly
influencd much of his thinking.
Welfare State
"We have got to get out," he stat
ed. "It is incredible that we should
be sending boys to die for people who
don't even want them there."
Moreover, he asserted that Presi
dent Johnson could not achieve his

"Great Society" and continue the war.
"The rhetoric has been much better
than the accomplishments so far," he
added.
He pointed further to the "possible
danger that the welfare state can be
come a glorified version of bread
and circuses for keeping the prole
tariat quiet."
Asked to describe his greatest ac
complishment, Thomas, whose red
challis tie and blue tweed suit reflect
his Princeton education, replied:
Great Change
"I am reasonably gratified that I
and the Socialist Party pretty well
pioneered in a lot of ideas that are
now accepted in the welfare state.
There has been a great change."
The foremost spokesman for the
Socialist Party, Thomas does not ex
pect it to go "much of anywhere" in
the future, although he urged a "more
aggressive education organization."
"At present, I don't think it can
go very far by having its own na
tional ticket," he explained, "but I
wish the Party were stronger right
now. I want it to sponsor a peace
pledge drive."

Moreover, he asserted that Presi
dent Johnson could not achieve his

"Great Society" and continue the war.
"The rhetoric has been much better
than the accomplishments so far," he
added.
He pointed further to the "possible
danger that the welfare state can be
come a glorified version of bread
and circuses for keeping the prole
tariat quiet."
Asked to describe his greatest ac
complishment, Thomas, whose red
challis tie and blue tweed suit reflect
his Princeton education, replied:
Great Change
"I am reasonably gratified that I
and the Socialist Party pretty well
pioneered in a lot of ideas that are
now accepted in the welfare state.
There has been a great change."
The foremost spokesman for the
Socialist Party, Thomas does not ex
pect it to go "much of anywhere" in
the future, although he urged a "more
aggressive education organization."
"At present, I don't think it can
go very far by having its own na
tional ticket," he explained, "but I
wish the Party were stronger right
now. I want it to sponsor a peace
pledge drive."
Typically, Norman Thomas intro
duces his remarks with a parentheti
cal "in my long life."
But the white-haired politician, six
times Socialist candidate for United
States President, is not one for remi
niscing on his 82 years. Although he

complains of his weak vision and his
"old-age, faulty memory," he is re
markably attuned to the present and
his Comments are often sharp and
perceptive.
"In my long experience," he said
in an interview yesterday,"I have
never known a time when neighbors
persecuted neighbors as much as to
day. And I don't just mean the Ku
Klux Klan."
One factor responsible for this in
tolerance, he said, is the "legacy of
violence which is a result of the
wars we have had."
Before his speech on the Vietnam
war, Thomas refused to comment on
the subject since it would be "like
asking a musician to play a couple
of bars just before a concert," but
he did make one terse remark about
the war to a reporter and it clearly
influencd much of his thinking.
Welfare State
"We have got to get out," he stat
ed. "It is incredible that we should
be sending boys to die for people who
don't even want them there."
Moreover, he asserted that Presi
dent Johnson could not achieve his

"Great Society" and continue the war.
"The rhetoric has been much better
than the accomplishments so far," he
