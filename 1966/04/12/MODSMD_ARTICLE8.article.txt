# Socialist Urges Viet Settlement

### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
"Wo must either co exist with China
or cease to exist," said Socialist lead
er Norman Thomas, speaking here on
U. S. policy in Vietnam yesterday.
While there is "no immediate likeli
hood" of a major war with China,
Thomas said that China does not
want to stop the conflict in Vietnam
and "is willing to fight ... to the last
Vietnamese."
The 82-year-old Socialist spokesman
addressed a crowd of more than 400,
who responded with two standing
ovations. Thomas concentrated on the
failure of the administration's policy
in Southeast Asia and briefly outline
a proposal for negotiations and set
tlement.
"There is scarcely a government in
the world which can't get help from
the U. S. if only it claims it is anti
communistic," he said. Thomas cited
the "Stop Communism" campaign as
a poor justification for U.S. inter
vention in a "civil war."
"Through such war as this we can't
stop Communism; we can only check
it and postpone an inevitable war
with China," he continued.
"Our foreign policy has followed
the wrong line . . . by emphasizing
the negative containment of commu
nism through military force," he said.
"There are ways of carrying out for
eign policy other than war in the
false name of freedom."
Make Money Where They Can
Thomas cited the construction of
costly bases in South Vietnam as an

indication that there are plans for
U. S. troops to remain indefinitely.
"I'm not saying that this is a capital
ists" war, but businessmen are will
ing to make money where they can,"
he said.
Thomas called for negotiations with
a "responsible force" composed of rep
resentatives from the South Vietna
mese and the National Liberation
Front. A cease-fire agreement and
end to bombing raids would then be
necessary. Finally, the "Geneva na
tions must reconvene to recognize
China" and the U. S. must revoke its
absurd policy" of non-recognition.
Strengthen U. N.
Extending his views to world dis
armament, Thomas called for an "in
ternational authority" and strength
ing of the U. N. Asking for a world
wide "War on Poverty," he suggested
that all aid be administered through
the U. N. rather than through indivi
dual countries, a system "more whole
some than the 'poor nephew' - 'rich
Uncle Sam' atmosphere."
Concerning the draft, Thomas said
he would not serve if he were of eli
gible age. "I'd rather be shot than go
into this war," he said. He contended
that conscription for war "damages
the individual, regardless of his con
victions. The government may have
some power over property, but
shouldn't have such power over indivi
duals," he said.
Thomas added that conservative
leaders such as Robert Welch and Wil
liam F. Buckley, Jr., who profess to
fear an overpowering state, have il
logically tended to "whoop it up"
when it comes to conscription.

"I'm not saying that this is a capital
ists" war, but businessmen are will
ing to make money where they can,"
he said.
Thomas called for negotiations with
a "responsible force" composed of rep
resentatives from the South Vietna
mese and the National Liberation
Front. A cease-fire agreement and
end to bombing raids would then be
necessary. Finally, the "Geneva na
tions must reconvene to recognize
China" and the U. S. must revoke its
absurd policy" of non-recognition.
Strengthen U. N.
Extending his views to world dis
armament, Thomas called for an "in
ternational authority" and strength
ing of the U. N. Asking for a world
wide "War on Poverty," he suggested
that all aid be administered through
the U. N. rather than through indivi
dual countries, a system "more whole
some than the 'poor nephew' - 'rich
Uncle Sam' atmosphere."
Concerning the draft, Thomas said
he would not serve if he were of eli
gible age. "I'd rather be shot than go
into this war," he said. He contended
that conscription for war "damages
the individual, regardless of his con
victions. The government may have
some power over property, but
shouldn't have such power over indivi
duals," he said.
Thomas added that conservative
leaders such as Robert Welch and Wil
liam F. Buckley, Jr., who profess to
fear an overpowering state, have il
logically tended to "whoop it up"
when it comes to conscription.
"Wo must either co exist with China
or cease to exist," said Socialist lead
er Norman Thomas, speaking here on
U. S. policy in Vietnam yesterday.
While there is "no immediate likeli
hood" of a major war with China,
Thomas said that China does not
want to stop the conflict in Vietnam
and "is willing to fight ... to the last
Vietnamese."
The 82-year-old Socialist spokesman
addressed a crowd of more than 400,
who responded with two standing
ovations. Thomas concentrated on the
failure of the administration's policy
in Southeast Asia and briefly outline
a proposal for negotiations and set
tlement.
"There is scarcely a government in
the world which can't get help from
the U. S. if only it claims it is anti
communistic," he said. Thomas cited
the "Stop Communism" campaign as
a poor justification for U.S. inter
vention in a "civil war."
"Through such war as this we can't
stop Communism; we can only check
it and postpone an inevitable war
with China," he continued.
"Our foreign policy has followed
the wrong line . . . by emphasizing
the negative containment of commu
nism through military force," he said.
"There are ways of carrying out for
eign policy other than war in the
false name of freedom."
Make Money Where They Can
Thomas cited the construction of
costly bases in South Vietnam as an

indication that there are plans for
U. S. troops to remain indefinitely.
