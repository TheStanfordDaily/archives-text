# Hall Directors Abolish Yearly Evaluations
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor (Second In a series 
The abolition of year-end student personnel
reports was announced and approved at a
residence hall directors' meeting yesterday.
In addition, Dean Robert Gordon appointed
a committee to formulate a policy regarding
other forms of student evaluation reports. The
committee will convene early next week.
The suggestion to abolish the year-end eval
uations of students by their RA's and spon
sors came from a report by a student com
mittee under ASSU Vice President Clark
Brown. The committee, including sponsors
Alice Jo Amis and Howard Graves and RA's
Barbara Vance and Tom Bachman, worked
closely last quarter with Dean Douglas Davis
in drawing up their recommendations.
Brown read at the meeting yesterday his
committee's report which called for radical
change in the year-end reporting procedure
and the abolition of incident reports.
The student committee's objections to the
filing of incident reports were discussed in
Monday's article. The committee contended

that they tended to be uneven, negative in
tone, and of doubtful use, accuracy, and con
fidentialness.
Many of the same criticisms apply to the
year-end personnel reports as well, the com
mittee stated. In addition, it found other reas
ons for objecting to the use of these annual
evaluations of students by their RA's and
sponsors.
Ethical Problem
The form was such that the bias of the
RA or sponsor was more easily reflected than
the situation of the student, the committee
said. Further, the committee believed that
student knowledge of the existence of these
reports was potentially injurious to the rela
tionship between the student and his RA
or sponsor.
A third objection stated in the report was
the "ethical problem of violating a student's
privacy by having someone in his living group
report on incidents which the student may not
want revealed."
The college years are a time of growth
and experimentation, the report stated. It is
important that a person not be held perman

ently accountable lor something done as part
of the growth process.
'In trying to find ne wvalue systems, it is
expected that a student may act in ways dif
fering from those normally considered con
ducive to group life," the report stated. "We
recognize this as normal and expected. Yet,
if such behavior were included in a personnel
report, it would carry perjorative connotations
that might unfairly label a student's behavior
and attitudes after this time of experimenta
tion is over."
Sponsors balk at writing these reports, the
committee added, because they feel it violates
the confidential relationship created with the
student.
A fourth objection to the current system
was that the time pressure of having to com
plete 35 to 75 reports at the end of spring
quarter was detrimental to the objectivity and
thoroughness of the personnel reports. "Many
sponsors and RA's find that after writing
a few personnel reports, they tend to make
similar comments on the remaining reports."
The committee further questioned the use
fulness of the reports. Objective data used to

get RA's acquainted with new students can
better be gained through the white "activities"
card, while "deans and counselors can get all
the information they need about particular
students from the individual students them
selves," the report said.
The final problem raised was reporting on
off-campus students. Under the old system
nothing was kept in the student's file unless
he lived in a university dormitory or fratern
ity house. So for the 20 to 25 percent of under
graduate men living off-campus, the Dean's
office had no reports.
The committee recommended the substitu
tion of student-written for RA-written person
nel reports.
Recommendation
"The student committee," said Brown, "has
been impressed with the demonstrated readi
ness of the Dean's office to consider our rec
ommendations and act on them."
The committee made recommendations
about the use of overseas campus recommen
dations. Since "these recommendations should
only be for the use of the foreign campus
selection committee ,it is recommended that

carbons not be required with the recommen
dations," the report said.
Student Choice
Further, it was suggested that students
"have the opportunity to select the person
making the overseas recommendation." In
most cases this would be the RA or sponsor,
who currently writes the recommendation.
Under th£ suggested system, "the person
selected could discuss the recommendation
with the student to get some idea of why the
student wants to go overseas and what he
would like included on the form."
Final decision on overseas recommendations
will come from a different group than the
committee appointed yesterday.
The members of the committee appointed
yesterday are: the five students who sub
mitted the report read yesterday, two resi
dence directors, John Black, (head of the
Counseling and Testing Service), Maurice
Osbourne (Executive Head of the Health Serv
ice), and Deans Douglas Davis, Jean Hinds,
and Robert Gordon.

selves," the report said.
The final problem raised was reporting on
off-campus students. Under the old system
nothing was kept in the student's file unless
he lived in a university dormitory or fratern
ity house. So for the 20 to 25 percent of under
graduate men living off-campus, the Dean's
office had no reports.
The committee recommended the substitu
tion of student-written for RA-written person
nel reports.
Recommendation
"The student committee," said Brown, "has
been impressed with the demonstrated readi
ness of the Dean's office to consider our rec
ommendations and act on them."
The committee made recommendations
about the use of overseas campus recommen
dations. Since "these recommendations should
only be for the use of the foreign campus
selection committee ,it is recommended that

carbons not be required with the recommen
dations," the report said.
Student Choice
Further, it was suggested that students
"have the opportunity to select the person
making the overseas recommendation." In
most cases this would be the RA or sponsor,
who currently writes the recommendation.
Under th£ suggested system, "the person
selected could discuss the recommendation
with the student to get some idea of why the
student wants to go overseas and what he
would like included on the form."
Final decision on overseas recommendations
will come from a different group than the
committee appointed yesterday.
The members of the committee appointed
yesterday are: the five students who sub
mitted the report read yesterday, two resi
dence directors, John Black, (head of the
Counseling and Testing Service), Maurice
Osbourne (Executive Head of the Health Serv
ice), and Deans Douglas Davis, Jean Hinds,
and Robert Gordon.
(The final article in the series will be an
interview with Dean Gordon.)
The abolition of year-end student personnel
reports was announced and approved at a
residence hall directors' meeting yesterday.
In addition, Dean Robert Gordon appointed
a committee to formulate a policy regarding
other forms of student evaluation reports. The
committee will convene early next week.
The suggestion to abolish the year-end eval
uations of students by their RA's and spon
sors came from a report by a student com
mittee under ASSU Vice President Clark
Brown. The committee, including sponsors
Alice Jo Amis and Howard Graves and RA's
Barbara Vance and Tom Bachman, worked
closely last quarter with Dean Douglas Davis
in drawing up their recommendations.
Brown read at the meeting yesterday his
committee's report which called for radical
change in the year-end reporting procedure
and the abolition of incident reports.
The student committee's objections to the
filing of incident reports were discussed in
Monday's article. The committee contended

that they tended to be uneven, negative in
tone, and of doubtful use, accuracy, and con
fidentialness.
Many of the same criticisms apply to the
year-end personnel reports as well, the com
mittee stated. In addition, it found other reas
ons for objecting to the use of these annual
evaluations of students by their RA's and
sponsors.
Ethical Problem
The form was such that the bias of the
RA or sponsor was more easily reflected than
the situation of the student, the committee
said. Further, the committee believed that
student knowledge of the existence of these
reports was potentially injurious to the rela
tionship between the student and his RA
or sponsor.
A third objection stated in the report was
the "ethical problem of violating a student's
privacy by having someone in his living group
report on incidents which the student may not
want revealed."
The college years are a time of growth
and experimentation, the report stated. It is
important that a person not be held perman

ently accountable lor something done as part
of the growth process.
'In trying to find ne wvalue systems, it is
expected that a student may act in ways dif
fering from those normally considered con
ducive to group life," the report stated. "We
recognize this as normal and expected. Yet,
if such behavior were included in a personnel
report, it would carry perjorative connotations
that might unfairly label a student's behavior
and attitudes after this time of experimenta
tion is over."
Sponsors balk at writing these reports, the
committee added, because they feel it violates
the confidential relationship created with the
student.
A fourth objection to the current system
was that the time pressure of having to com
plete 35 to 75 reports at the end of spring
quarter was detrimental to the objectivity and
thoroughness of the personnel reports. "Many
sponsors and RA's find that after writing
a few personnel reports, they tend to make
similar comments on the remaining reports."
The committee further questioned the use
fulness of the reports. Objective data used to

get RA's acquainted with new students can
better be gained through the white "activities"
card, while "deans and counselors can get all
the information they need about particular
students from the individual students them
selves," the report said.

said. Further, the committee believed that
student knowledge of the existence of these
reports was potentially injurious to the rela
tionship between the student and his RA
or sponsor.
A third objection stated in the report was
the "ethical problem of violating a student's
privacy by having someone in his living group
report on incidents which the student may not
want revealed."
The college years are a time of growth
and experimentation, the report stated. It is
important that a person not be held perman

ently accountable lor something done as part
of the growth process.
'In trying to find ne wvalue systems, it is
expected that a student may act in ways dif
fering from those normally considered con
ducive to group life," the report stated. "We
recognize this as normal and expected. Yet,
if such behavior were included in a personnel
report, it would carry perjorative connotations
that might unfairly label a student's behavior
and attitudes after this time of experimenta
tion is over."
Sponsors balk at writing these reports, the
committee added, because they feel it violates
the confidential relationship created with the
student.
A fourth objection to the current system
was that the time pressure of having to com
plete 35 to 75 reports at the end of spring
quarter was detrimental to the objectivity and
thoroughness of the personnel reports. "Many
sponsors and RA's find that after writing
a few personnel reports, they tend to make
similar comments on the remaining reports."
The committee further questioned the use
fulness of the reports. Objective data used to

get RA's acquainted with new students can
better be gained through the white "activities"
card, while "deans and counselors can get all
the information they need about particular
students from the individual students them
selves," the report said.
The final problem raised was reporting on
off-campus students. Under the old system
nothing was kept in the student's file unless
he lived in a university dormitory or fratern
ity house. So for the 20 to 25 percent of under
graduate men living off-campus, the Dean's
office had no reports.
The committee recommended the substitu
tion of student-written for RA-written person
nel reports.
Recommendation
"The student committee," said Brown, "has
been impressed with the demonstrated readi
ness of the Dean's office to consider our rec
ommendations and act on them."
The committee made recommendations
about the use of overseas campus recommen
dations. Since "these recommendations should
only be for the use of the foreign campus
selection committee ,it is recommended that

carbons not be required with the recommen
dations," the report said.
Student Choice
Further, it was suggested that students
"have the opportunity to select the person
making the overseas recommendation." In
most cases this would be the RA or sponsor,
who currently writes the recommendation.
Under th£ suggested system, "the person
selected could discuss the recommendation
with the student to get some idea of why the
student wants to go overseas and what he
would like included on the form."
Final decision on overseas recommendations
will come from a different group than the
committee appointed yesterday.
The members of the committee appointed
yesterday are: the five students who sub
mitted the report read yesterday, two resi
dence directors, John Black, (head of the
Counseling and Testing Service), Maurice
Osbourne (Executive Head of the Health Serv
ice), and Deans Douglas Davis, Jean Hinds,
and Robert Gordon.
(The final article in the series will be an
interview with Dean Gordon.)
The abolition of year-end student personnel
reports was announced and approved at a
residence hall directors' meeting yesterday.
In addition, Dean Robert Gordon appointed
a committee to formulate a policy regarding
other forms of student evaluation reports. The
committee will convene early next week.
The suggestion to abolish the year-end eval
uations of students by their RA's and spon
sors came from a report by a student com
mittee under ASSU Vice President Clark
Brown. The committee, including sponsors
Alice Jo Amis and Howard Graves and RA's
Barbara Vance and Tom Bachman, worked
closely last quarter with Dean Douglas Davis
in drawing up their recommendations.
Brown read at the meeting yesterday his
committee's report which called for radical
change in the year-end reporting procedure
and the abolition of incident reports.
The student committee's objections to the
filing of incident reports were discussed in
Monday's article. The committee contended

that they tended to be uneven, negative in
tone, and of doubtful use, accuracy, and con
fidentialness.
Many of the same criticisms apply to the
year-end personnel reports as well, the com
mittee stated. In addition, it found other reas
ons for objecting to the use of these annual
evaluations of students by their RA's and
sponsors.
Ethical Problem
The form was such that the bias of the
RA or sponsor was more easily reflected than
the situation of the student, the committee
said. Further, the committee believed that
student knowledge of the existence of these
reports was potentially injurious to the rela
tionship between the student and his RA
or sponsor.
