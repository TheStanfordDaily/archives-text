# Heschel Challenges Reader's Humanity
## 
### EDWIN M. GOOD Associate Professor of Religion Hebrew 
Abraham J. Heschel. Who Is
Man? Stanford University
Press, 1965, 119 pages, $3.95.
Those who heard Professor
Heschel deliver the West Lec
tures in May, 1963, on which this
book is based, will be glad to re
capture some of the moments of
remarkable insight and wisdom
that the lectures brought. They
should be warned, however, in
the midst of the pleasant recol
lection of memorable sayings,
that some of their favorite mo
ments may not be here. I
searched in vain for a pair of
sentences in the lectures that
had put the capstone for me on
the Tower of Babel story. But
let no one criticize the book for
what is not in it. What is there
is rich enough fare for anyone.
A Call
Some books are easy to re
view. You state the author's
thesis, outline his argument,
learnedly chide him for what he
neglected, and magnanimously
thank him for his helpful wis
dom. One cannot do that with
this book. It has a thesis, but
the entire book is the thesis. It
has an argument, but thesis and
argument are one, and to set out
either is to repeat the book.
Indeed, the thesis itself is less
a statement than a challenge,
less an intellectual proposition
than an invitation to be human.
When Professor Heschel asks

"Who is man?" he is not asking
a merely intellectual question
He is asking who I am and who
yv.u arc. Put it in the category
of existentialism if you like. But
throw away the stereotypes that
set boundaries to the category.
It is not Sartre; Professor Hes
chel believes in God. It is not
Heidegger; he disagrees funda
mentally with Heidegger on be
ing. It is not Camus; he rejects
Camus' "one serious philosophi
cal problem." It is not Buber,
though many a paragraph will
bring Buber to mind. But Hes
chel has no shred of utopian
ism in him, and Buber at some
salient points has. Best forget
categories altogether.

I am struck with the impres
sion that Professor Heschel
knew exactly what he was doing
when he chose his title. For the
only category the book really
fits is the category of question.
Again and again he poses ques
tions, singly or in series. And
these are not rhetorical ques
tions but probing questions on
which the reader must pause to
reflect, and to which he will find
no superficial answers. It may
be argued that the interrogative
in this book is more important
than the indicative. In fact, Pro
fessor Heschel's indicative is as
often as not an interrogative.
"Human living is not simply be
ing here and now, being around,
a matter of fact; it is being in
a dilemma, being cross-exam
ined, called upon to answer." (P.
104) The indicative about man
is the interrogation of man.
"Who is man?" That does not
mean "Who is he?" but "Who
am I?"
It is a dangerous book. It
gracefully pokes holes in all
sorts of cherished suppositions
and brings commonplaces to
disturbing relevance. Let any
one who would rather not think
of God beware of this book. It
will slowly, slowly lead him
along the question of man until
suddenly he is aware that God
has been in the picture for ten
pages or more, and that it seems
oddly natural that this should
be so.
Embarrassing Question
But it is a hard book to re
view. Dotted with epigrams that
might become wearying, if one
supposed that they were com
posed for the sake of titillation,
it is far too rich to summarize.
"The root of creativity is dis
content with mere being." (P.
95) One could pause over that
and argue over it all night, and
no more summary of topics cov
ered would reproduce a discus
sion that proceeds from one
such provocative proposition to
another. One is tempted to quote
some of his own favorites, but
that could degenerate into a con
test, one trying to outdo the oth
er. And it would be to miss the
point. Professor Heschel doesn't
care if we quote him. What he
cares is that we come to actual
ize the wonder and the embar
rassment of being human, that
we take his question to our
selves, make "Who is man?"
mean "Who am I?"
I came first to know Profes
sor Heschel when he gave these
lectures. It is a friendship that
I, a Christian, cherish profound
ly on personal grounds and
apart from Professor Heschel's
Jewishness. But the question he
asks entails and involves both.
Let the Christian, then, close
his response to the Jew's ques
tions by asking something that
the Jew will recognize as com
ing from deep in the Christian's
tradition: What is the proper
place, in being human, of ut
ter and complete failure?
