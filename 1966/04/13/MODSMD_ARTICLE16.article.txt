### MICHAEL FRENCH 
The Saddest Summer of Samuel
S by J. P. Donleavy. A Seymour
Lawrence Book by Delacorte
Press. 114 pages, $3.95.
Samuel S is a man of principle
—a strange principle for the wit-
Hy, forty-year-old intellectual
that he is: "I'm finished screw
ing for screwing's sake"—and in
the course of this surrealistic,
black comic novel, Donleavy
skillfully reveals the neurotic
roots of this principle.
Samuelson is an American
cynic who fled the phony life in
the States and has lived in Vien
na on five years worth of hand
outs from rich friends. The
money is spent on his psycho-

analyst for two sessions of every
week in which he reveals his
consuming problem: that he is
afraid he is abnormal, that he
is sick.
The moral essence of the novel
is Donleavy's implication that
although the protagonist is sick,
it is not quite in the same way
as Samuel imagines it. The pro
tagonist is merely sensitive and
lonely, seeking recognition and
love, but because he is so scorn
ful, cynical and socially awk
ward, this quest has not been re
quited, and he interprets the de
nial as proof that there is some
thing inherently wrong with
him. In desperation and fear of
abnormality, he clings to his in
tegrity (his principle of sexual
honesty) because he believes he
has nothing else —no prestige,
no money, no normality of mind
—to cling to.
Flag Waving
Samuel's real sickness, then,
is a self-fear, which breeds a
fear of others. A rich Countess
who likes his wit and humor
offers him a retainer fee, but
Samuel's pride forces him to
rebel, and he waves his principle
like a red flag. An American col
lege girl, Abigail, who is touring
Europe and accidentally runs
into Samuel, also admires his
sensitive wit and offers him a
good old-fashioned lay, and
again the red flag goes up, Sam
uel pathetically swearing he will
never make love to her unless
she promises to marry him, for
marriage is a sign of normality.
She, of course, refuses, and so
does he.
Samuel is forced to repel these
overtures of concern and affec
tion, for they threaten his prin
ciple. And his principle—which
Is not only a last hold on his
normality, but also a means of
flouting a world which has al
ready flouted him—must not be
threatened. This, then, is the
novel's central paradox: that in
clinging to his principle, Samuel
S thinks he is preserving his
normality, when actually such
adherence means the rejection
of money and admiration which
he so desperately wants, and
thus a threat to his normality
and a cause of his unhappiness.
Crushed Opportunity
Abigail, an honest and sensi
tive if somewhat an ingenuous
person herself (she talks free
ly to Samuel about stomach
gas intonation, going to the
bathroom on airplanes, and the
nitty-gritties of the sex act), rec
ognizes these same traits in
Samuel and takes both a psycho
logical and sexual interest in
him. She confesses her problems
and doubts about life ("I've read
all the great books, and you
know what? I think they
stink"), but Samuel, because his

sensitivity has been buried by
cynicism and because he is so
concerned about his integrity,
cannot help her.
Donleavy implies that if Sam
uel could have helped Abigail, he
could have helped himself. For
the secret of normality is a re
jection of self-analysis and in
trospection, of sensitivity and
doubt. To be normal is to laugh
at the absurd, to be aggressive
and callous, to treat people as
they want to be treated. All of
which is reflected in Donleavy's
elusive, if not profound, concept:
Samuel S says, "If ever I am
cured I will never know it." He
will not know he has been cured,
because he did not know he was
sick.
The themes of phoniness,
threatened sensitivity, and frus
tration are certainly not new,
and Donleavy's protagonist—an
intellectual Holden Caulfield—is
equally derivative. But Donlea
vy's treatment of Samuel Sand
his plight in a surrealistic, sar
donic way is an entertaining
rendition. The graphic meta
phors (life is likened to a giant
breast at which the whole world
fights to gnaw), Samuel's ab
surd experiences (he finds him
self dying in a bathtub), and
the style itself (fast and always
moving toward the climax, short
and often elliptic sentences, and
brief injections of flashbacks
and streams of consciousness)
gives the novel a surrealistic
and black comic tone.
Real Surreal
There are flaws, to be sure,
which interrupt the unity of the
novel. One is the gimicky phras
es, especially in the psychoanaly
sis sessions, which seem like
Bob Newhart imitations and be
come gratuitous intrusions vio
lating the characterization and
mood. Another is the often lack
of organic growth in the charac
ters, a failure by Donleavy to
explain cause or effect when
such knowledge is either needed
by the reader or needed to cast
the characters in a new light, to
make them rounder, deeper and
more interesting. But despite
the flaws, Donleavy has succeed
ed in making a surreal experi
ence real, a sad summer an in
teresting novel.
