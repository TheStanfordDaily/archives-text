Goldsworthy Lowes Dickin
son, a friend and teacher of E.
M. Forster, exemplifies a mod
ern dilemma that writers like
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold,
and Forster himself experi
enced: the disunion of feeling
and rationality, the separation
of individual and society, the dis
sociation of faith and knowl
edge, the distinction between
consciousness and unconscious
ness, the disjunction of art and
society.
Modern Clash
A sensitive man, Dickinson re
acted against the materialism of
his age, against the prevailing
social philosophy which saw
man as an aggressive, posses
sive, competitive creature, iso
lated from his power-hungry fel
lows. His longing for internal
freedom shaped his esthetics,
through which he hoped to com
bat the forces of materialism.
Like Forster, he meant by
religion "a reaction of the high
est imagination of the best men
upon life and the world ... a
passionate apprehension, from
the point of view of ideals, of
the general situation in which
we find ourselves." However, un
like Forster, he failed to find an
esthetic solution for the recipro
cating conflicts of personal
ideals and social conventions.
Where Dickinson was a failure,
Forster was a success, for he
represented artistically the reac
tion of imagination to life.
The artist's effort to depict
human situations in artâ€”that is
the subject of Professor Stone's
The Cave and the Mountain: A
Study of E. M. Forster. Stone
explores Forster's intellectual
backgrounds and his esthetics,
discussing the pitfalls that could
have trapped Forster in the "or
chidaceous emotionalism" and
spiritual solipsism of Dickinson.
Forster's first artistic at
tempts (two books of stories,
The Celestial Omnibus and The
Eternal Moment) to externalize
imaginative conceptions were
little more than dialogues be
tween the artist and his own
mind, permeated with wish-ful
fillment and escape. They were
ineffective representations of
the disharmony Forster was ex
periencing. To better effect and
achieve an artistic expression of

a divided and discordant world
Forster turned to the novel.
His first one, Where Angels
Fear to Tread, was comic and
ironic. The leading character,
Philip Herriton, refuses to face
the implicit tragedy within; his
only recourses are humor and
beauty, between which he alter
nates with indecisive inefficacy.
"His plight is an existential ab
surdity, since his frustration is
so fundamental: it is not that
he can't find the right woman
or the right man, it is that he
cannot find himself."
Passionate Journey
Two novels, A Room with a
View and Howards End (be
fore A Passage to India) evi-

dence Forster's maturation as
an artist; each was a necessary
step to the successful creation
of a myth. In Howards End he
extended his attention from pri
vate to public reality. He con
cerned himself with the individu
al's ability to connect inner and
outer self, to unite private and
public experience, to combine
idealistic estheticism and mate
rial reality. The connections
were not established, and the
characters were left in the seclu
sion of a private, solipsistic
world.
In A Passage to India, how
ever, Forster succeeded admirab
ly integrating self and others,
finding symbolic representation
for a disparate experience.
Throughout Forster's fiction,
ambivalent feminine symbols
such as houses, dells, hollows,
and containers recur, represent
ing prison and paradise, har
mony and death. In earlier
works he attempts to unite rea
son and emotion by retreating
into a private hideaway. In A
Passage to India, though all
characters are similarly fraught
with disconnected experiences,
the context for integration and
stabilization is present, a sym
bolic medium of meaning and
representation.

The central symbolism of "A
Passage to India" is based on
the Marabar Caves at the base
of the Marabar Hills, older than
time itself, through which en
trances have been cut. The
Caves represent the nucleus of
the Great Round, the Circle of
Perfection; they are microcos
mic symbols of a larger macro
cosm. The cave and the moun
tain are Forster's essential sym
bols. The heart of the World
Mountain is the cave, and repre
sents what may be called the
subconscious or the well of psy
chic energy. It is the core that
reduces every word to an unin
tellible "bourn" or "ou-boum,"
sounds "utterly dull." Within
this core man confronts the
primitive forces from which he
evolved.
The core in Indian religious
consciousness represents Kali,
the universal mother, creator
and destroyer, the origin of the
universe's motion that began
immediately after androgynous
fertilization. In confronting the
caves, the Marabar Hills, and
the complex of meaning associ
ated with them, the major char
acters of the novel reveal their
instability.
The Anglo - Indians, for ex
ample, are victims of the ego,
distrusting and suppressing
their emotions. When Mrs.
Moore, an English woman, en
ters the cave, she encounters the
"shadow" of the human psyche.
Rather than recognizing the
shadow as the force underlying
and uniting everyone, she be
comes egoistically preoccupied
with her own "nothingness." She
fails to comprehend that all of
us partake of the same physical
and psychical environment. The
Anglo-Indians are not the only
unstable race, for the Hindus
too, lack equilibrium. Their cen
ter of gravity is within the cave
rather than the mountain Hself,
the world of will and mina.
Prayer Without Preaching
Stone writes, "Without preach
ing, the novel asks us to be re
sponsible, to integrate our
selves, to link reason and in
stinct, to base our civilized ar
rangements on what the hu
man race has in common instead
of on what rives it into races,
classes, religions, sexes and di
vided personalities."
Clearly Forster has progressed
far beyond the fantasies of his
early career, far beyond Golds
worthy Lowes Dickinson.
