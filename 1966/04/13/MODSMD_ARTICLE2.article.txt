# SSRF Petition Calls For Ballot On Pill Debate
## Ouch! 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
After collecting signatures for two
quarters, the Sexual Rights Forum
(SSRF) has received the necessary
number of names to call an all-stu
dent referendum on distribution of
contraceptives.
James Sayre, one of the Forum
leaders who has now withdrawn from
school to enter the Peace Corps, has
anounced 650 students have signed
a petition that asks the University
Health Service "be authorized to pre
scribe contraceptives to any student
desiring them."
The petition was cleared yesterday
by the ASSU election commission,
and a referendum will appear on the
presidential primary ballo: later this
month.
Activities Are Sacrosanct
SSRF's principle tenet is that "pri
vate sexual activities of adults are
sacrosanct and are not the concern
of governments, churches, or schools."
At present the Health Service's policy
generally is to prescribe contracep
tives only to married students, and
engaged students to be married with
in two months.
Dr. Maurice Osborne, Health Service
Director, says he doubts if the refer
endum will have much direct effect.
"The decision must be a concensus of
the community at large," Osborne
noted, and that includes staff, the
president, and the Board of Trustees.
"The referendum will bring the
issue to the forefront," Osborne said,
"but certainly will not be final."
Osborne has called the Forum's po
sition "a tragically crude and simplis
tic approach to an enormously com
plex issue."
Sayre, however, condemns present
University policy as "a moral judge
ment on non-marital intercourse." He
says the Forum "is not advocating
any particular sexual ethic. Rather,
we are simply trying to have the
responsibility of choice placed in the
individual."
