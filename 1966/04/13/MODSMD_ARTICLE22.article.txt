### WENDY WEINER 
Interested in spending your
summer working and living in
Peru?
The Peru Summer Project,
sponsored by the Peruvian
American Council for Education
al Exchange (PACE), is still
looking for qualified students,
to work and live with a Peruvi
an family.
The unique work project will
be focused on 53 barridas (low
er class squatter's communi
ties) that surround Arequipa,
Peru, a city with a population
of 200,000. Volunteers will work
on construction and other com
munity development projects.
Those fluent in Spanish will
teach in understaffed barrida
schools.
Other students will work in
government agencies, health
clinics, and at the Institute for
the Blind. Students with special
skills in medicine will be as
signed to hospitals and clinics,
and those with communications
and television experience will
work on an educational TV proj
ect.
A few PACE volunteers will
work in Lima at the Lima Boys

Town or with the Worcester
Foundation for Experimental
Biology on a new birth control
project.
Volunteers need a basic knowl
edge of Spanish, though fluency
in the language is not required.
They must serve for a minimum
of seven weeks, after which
they are free to travel on their
own.
Ten Stanford students partic
ipated in the program last sum
mer with 40 other college stu
dents. Former volunteers still at
Stanford include Stern R. A.
Bob Burke, Roble Sponsor Jane
Whiteside, Barbara Dudley, Cam
Duncan, Pauline Rowe, and El
len Holmes.
According to Bill Chandler,
PACE Regional Director, the
program offers a unique and
comprehensive opportunity for
students wishing to gain an un
derstanding of Latin America.
"We can't expect miracles in
two months that the Peace
Corps can't produce in two
years," said Chandler, "but we
can expose students to the prob
lems faced by Latin American
nations with the hope that what
they learn this summer will be
an impetus for further action on
their part in the future.
"I can't emphasize enough the
need for American students to
get out of the classroom and ac
tually see the conditions that
exist in South America,"he con
tinued. "You can read Maria de
Jesus' Child of the Dark, but
you really don't know what
she's talking about until you see
it in person."

Orientation Seminars for the
Peru Project will begin this Sat
urday at the I-Center. Professor
Robert Packenham will discuss
"Latin American Politics" in a
lecture at 10:00 a.m.
Applications for the project
may be obtained from Gwyn
Foster at the I-Center. Partici
pants from the Mexicali and
Guanabara Projects are especial
ly urged to apply. For further
information about the Peru
Project, students can call Bill
Chandler at 322-3782.
