# U Of Maryland To Ban Batons
## 
### 
(CPS) â€” In the interest of
greater marching efficiency, the
University of Maryland band is
trying to get rid of its baton
twirling majorettes, but the idea
has met a wall of protest from
students who like to watch the
girls.
"Nobody looks at the band,"
said Jed Levin, a student. The
stadium's too small to see the
formations anyway. Some of
those girls are good, and they
have a right to be there."
He charged that the status of
girls has fallen during the past
few years "ever since the girls
on the honor guard were or
dered to wear longer skirts."
And he claimed that since the
student government spends
$6,000 of its $16,000 budget each
year on the band, it has a right
ful says about what's happening
to the majorettes.
