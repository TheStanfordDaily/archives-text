# Spring Sports Review
## 
### 
All five Stanford varsity
spring sports have shifted into
full gear.
Some are heading down
a straight and narrow
path which will, hopefully, lead
to a championship season. Oth
ers have not Deen so fortunate
and have discovered numerous
obstacles in their climb for suc
cess.
Although crew and golf have
not yet really dipped into their
schedules, a spring prognosis
finds Stanford with impressive
athletic personnel and, for the
most part, using them adequate
ly-
Perhaps not unique but none
theless interesting is the fact
that both USC and UCLA are
playing havoc with Stanford's
conference hopes in all areas.
Baseball Disappointing
Stanford's baseball team — in
the precarious position of last
year's conference champs — is
currently in fourth place in the
CIBA with a 4-6 record. Al
though they won the conference

championship with only a 12-8
record last season, they appear
to be beyond reach of repeating
as conference champs.
A key series against USC and
UCLA at Stanford this weekend
could possibly salvage part of
what has been a dismal season
but will only help to tighten up
the title race between USC and
UCLA.
Dumping Seattle University,
7-2 last Friday, Stanford's ten
nis team extended their record

to 5-3. Losses have been to USC.
UCLA, and San Jose. USC and
UCLA also reign supreme in
tennis having dumped Stanford
8-1 and 9-0. The Indians also
have a big weekend series
against these two southern Cali
fornia athletic machines this Fri
day and Saturday.
Track Has Depth
Stanford's track squad has
dual meet victories over Fresno
State, San Jose, and OSU. After
losing to San Jose in the Stan
ford Relays Stanford came back
to defeat them two weeks ago
82-62. Though without many
individual standouts, Stanford is
loaded with well-balanced per
sonnel.
A victory over UCLA, who fin

ished 10 points ahead of Stan
ford for first place in the Santa
Barbara Relays, would place the
Indians in the national spotlight.
Both Stanford's golf team
and crew are inexperienced but
produced early season victories
that indeed point to successful
seasons. Stanford finished ninth
in the Far Western Intercolleg
iate Tourney in Santa Cruz and
also defeated the Stanford Golf
Club. The crew swept to victory
against OSU, USC, and Santa
Clara last Saturday.
Even though Stanford's chances
may appear promising in some
areas while disappointing in oth
ers one must remember the old
cliche, "the season is still
young."

Perhaps not unique but none
theless interesting is the fact
that both USC and UCLA are
playing havoc with Stanford's
conference hopes in all areas.
Baseball Disappointing
Stanford's baseball team — in
the precarious position of last
year's conference champs — is
currently in fourth place in the
CIBA with a 4-6 record. Al
though they won the conference

championship with only a 12-8
record last season, they appear
to be beyond reach of repeating
as conference champs.
A key series against USC and
UCLA at Stanford this weekend
could possibly salvage part of
what has been a dismal season
but will only help to tighten up
the title race between USC and
UCLA.
Dumping Seattle University,
7-2 last Friday, Stanford's ten
nis team extended their record

to 5-3. Losses have been to USC.
UCLA, and San Jose. USC and
UCLA also reign supreme in
tennis having dumped Stanford
8-1 and 9-0. The Indians also
have a big weekend series
against these two southern Cali
fornia athletic machines this Fri
day and Saturday.
Track Has Depth
Stanford's track squad has
dual meet victories over Fresno
State, San Jose, and OSU. After
losing to San Jose in the Stan
ford Relays Stanford came back
to defeat them two weeks ago
82-62. Though without many
individual standouts, Stanford is
loaded with well-balanced per
sonnel.
A victory over UCLA, who fin

ished 10 points ahead of Stan
ford for first place in the Santa
Barbara Relays, would place the
Indians in the national spotlight.
Both Stanford's golf team
and crew are inexperienced but
produced early season victories
that indeed point to successful
seasons. Stanford finished ninth
in the Far Western Intercolleg
iate Tourney in Santa Cruz and
also defeated the Stanford Golf
Club. The crew swept to victory
against OSU, USC, and Santa
Clara last Saturday.
Even though Stanford's chances
may appear promising in some
areas while disappointing in oth
ers one must remember the old
cliche, "the season is still
young."
All five Stanford varsity
spring sports have shifted into
full gear.
Some are heading down
a straight and narrow
path which will, hopefully, lead
to a championship season. Oth
ers have not Deen so fortunate
and have discovered numerous
obstacles in their climb for suc
cess.
Although crew and golf have
not yet really dipped into their
schedules, a spring prognosis
