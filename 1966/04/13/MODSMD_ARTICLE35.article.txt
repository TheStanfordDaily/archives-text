# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						Blood Flows On 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In an effort to be cute, you
have displayed courage quite
above and beyond the call of
duty, by printing uninformed
"information". ("Send Beer, Not
Blood", The Daily, April 11).
You said you hadn't read any
Red Cross warning about a low
blood supply. Did you inquire?
Or do you often print unverified
information? A three-minute
call to Palo Alto's Red Cross
Chapter would have proven how
wrong you were.
According to the Director of
the Pacific Area Blood Program,
the Defense Department recent
ly asked National Red Cross for
hi million more pints of blood
to supply emergency needs for
gamma globulin and serum al
bumen. This is in addition to
blood included in the annual
drive goal, practically doubled
this year to meet increasing do
mestic and military needs. And
many Blood Banks have short
ages due to the flu epidemic.
Blood from Stanford will be
given American soldiers in Viet
nam. Regardless of your feeling
about U. S. policy, these are
humans — just like you except
their lives depend upon a trans
fusion.
Hopefully those who would
have donated to A-Phi-O won't
stay home because of your com
ments. A-Phi-O obviously didn't
intend that. And hopefully an
individual representing us,
whether he likes it or not, won't
fail to receive that crucial pint
(of blood!) because of your un
informed cuteness. Yesterday
you head-lined a quote by Phil
lips: "We live under a govern
ment of men and morning news
papers." Irresponsibility in gov
ernment is a crime.
MICHELLE DE KLYEN
(Editor's note: If Miss De
Kleyn had spent more than three
minutes in research, she might
have learned that the blood-sup
ply situation can be interpreted
in a variety of ways.
(As we said Monday, the Red
Cross has published no recent
statement to the effect that the
supply of blood is running low,
and in fact there Is no shortage.
The Department of Defense,
however, has expressed a need
for certain blood derivatives, and
the Red Cross, as a non-partisan
organization, is helping the De
partment in collecting the raw
blood from which they are proc
essed.
(We understand that although
the blood drawn in the Old Un
ion yesterday is intended for
American troops in Vietnam, the
Department of Defense has re
served the option to abbrogate
the donors' wishes should a crit
ical shortage arise elsewhere —a
fact that was overlooked in the
ROTC's oversimplified "Win A
Contest" propaganda that cur
rently graces campus bulletin
boards.
(We are entirely in favor of

providing blood where it is need
ed to preserve human life —be
those humans American soldiers
or "Viet Cong." Moreover, we
do not believe the humanitarian
act of providing 1 that blood
should be obscured by equating
blood donations with flag wav
ing, as the Stanford ROTC chap
ter of the Association of the
United States Army has done.
(A more humanistic approach,
we feel, would be to bypass
partisan fanfare and donate
blood directly to a neutral or
ganization that can determine
for itself where the blood is
most needed.
(For those annual A-Phi-O
donors who were scared away
from the Old Union by the
AUSA yesterday, we suggest—
and encourage—them to give a
call to either the Peninsula
Blood Bank (6974034) or the
Bed Cross in Palo Alto (322-
2143) and arrange for the pro
vision of a non-partisan pint.)
• Not In The Daily
Editor, The Daily:
Please print a notice in your
letter column correcting your
omission of the word "not" from
the last sentence of the second
paragraph of my letter printed
in Tuesday's Daily.

(Editor's note: The ommission
of the word "not" was an unin

The Daily regrets the mistake.)
• Cruel And Unfair
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to add a com
ment to the current discussion
about rush. I must agree with
the verdict of Mr. Hecht and
Mr. Dahl. Rush, as a system of
selection with certain objectives,
is very inefficient. The "mis
takes" become obvious only the
following year. In some in
stances, it is cruel. It is almost
universally unfair.
I also must agree with Mr.
Hecht that dormitory living,
especially as it is now practiced,
is also not attractive. The
thought of spending four years
in Wilbur is enough to make me
want to transfer to Berkeley.
Faced with these two alterna
tives, it is no wonder that so
many men choose to live off
campus. (I must include the
Eating Clubs with the Fraterni
ties. They are less of a "third
choice" than they would like to
be, especially in their rush prac
tices, but they are more of one
than-the Fraternities would like
to admit.)
At the end of his letter, Mr.
Hecht raises the question of the
draw system. But even this
raises the problem of selection.
If the draw is not to be done by
the computer, it must involve
the parties concerned, the living
groups and the Freshmen. In
practice, this usually means
open houses, or their equivalent.
The living groups still have

"ding" sessions to arrive at
their preference lists. Both the
living groups and Freshmen
make up their minds on the
basis of scanty misinformation.
There are still heart-breaks be
cause, "I wasn't chosen," or
more commonly, "There wasn't
i x>m." It may be, however, that
the draw system reduces these
effects enough to recommend it
self. I don't know. The women
of this campus would know bet
ter.
The last point I would like to
make is that the importance of
the decision to live here, or
there, or wherever is not quite
as binding as getting married.
People do change, in both their
wants and living groups. This is
perhaps the best corrective to
mistakes made during rush and
should be enhanced. Unfortun
ately, it is only a corrective.

• N'est-ce Pas?
Editor, The Daily:
Last quarter it was the draft
that Stanford students had to be
protected from. Now it seems
that they are not to experience
any disappointments in life, at
least while in the Stanford nest.
If rush is supposed to be such
an evil institution, then who is
going to hold their hands when
they fail to get the job they
want want or fail to gain mem
bership in a civic or social or
ganization. Just when should
Stanford students be allowed to
grow up?

I would call the attention of
the Stanford Community to the
curious notice on the doors of
our post office:
NO DOGS ALLOWED
(Except seeing-eye dogs)
Now, a man with a seeing
eye dog would not observe the
notice; it is above a dog's eye
level, and so he could not read
it —the parenthetical exception
is extraneous.
Furthermore, the nearby bush
es are more interesting to a non
seeing-eye dog than the post
master's leg—the notice is ex
traneous.
PETER THOMPSON
• Unfamiliarity
Editor, The Daily:
Being unfamiliar with the
American language I battled
long and hard to grasp the sub
tlety of your answer to Mr.
Kugelmass (The Daily, April 8).
My struggles proved to be futile
because to the end the "levels
of reality" which aspired to
"support civilized existence"
eluded by understanding. Until
yesterday I was content with
one level of reality which has
no plans on "civilized existence".
Could you please remedy my
ignorance?

• Unfamiliarity
Editor, The Daily:
Being unfamiliar with the
American language I battled
long and hard to grasp the sub
tlety of your answer to Mr.
Kugelmass (The Daily, April 8).
My struggles proved to be futile
because to the end the "levels
of reality" which aspired to
"support civilized existence"
eluded by understanding. Until
yesterday I was content with
one level of reality which has
no plans on "civilized existence".
Could you please remedy my
ignorance?
MICHAEL ATHANASSOGLOU
Editor, The Daily:
In an effort to be cute, you
have displayed courage quite
above and beyond the call of
duty, by printing uninformed
"information". ("Send Beer, Not
Blood", The Daily, April 11).
You said you hadn't read any
Red Cross warning about a low
blood supply. Did you inquire?
Or do you often print unverified
information? A three-minute
call to Palo Alto's Red Cross
Chapter would have proven how
wrong you were.
According to the Director of
the Pacific Area Blood Program,
the Defense Department recent
ly asked National Red Cross for
hi million more pints of blood
to supply emergency needs for
gamma globulin and serum al
bumen. This is in addition to
blood included in the annual
drive goal, practically doubled
this year to meet increasing do
mestic and military needs. And
many Blood Banks have short
ages due to the flu epidemic.
Blood from Stanford will be
given American soldiers in Viet
nam. Regardless of your feeling
about U. S. policy, these are
humans — just like you except
their lives depend upon a trans
fusion.
Hopefully those who would
have donated to A-Phi-O won't
stay home because of your com
ments. A-Phi-O obviously didn't
intend that. And hopefully an
individual representing us,
whether he likes it or not, won't
fail to receive that crucial pint
(of blood!) because of your un
informed cuteness. Yesterday
you head-lined a quote by Phil
lips: "We live under a govern
ment of men and morning news
papers." Irresponsibility in gov
ernment is a crime.

(Editor's note: If Miss De

(As we said Monday, the Red

The Department of Defense,
however, has expressed a need

the Red Cross, as a non-partisan

(We understand that although
the blood drawn in the Old Un

American troops in Vietnam, the

• Cruel And Unfair
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to add a com
ment to the current discussion
about rush. I must agree with
the verdict of Mr. Hecht and
Mr. Dahl. Rush, as a system of
selection with certain objectives,
is very inefficient. The "mis
takes" become obvious only the
following year. In some in
stances, it is cruel. It is almost
universally unfair.
I also must agree with Mr.
Hecht that dormitory living,
especially as it is now practiced,
is also not attractive. The
thought of spending four years
in Wilbur is enough to make me
want to transfer to Berkeley.
Faced with these two alterna
tives, it is no wonder that so
many men choose to live off
campus. (I must include the
Eating Clubs with the Fraterni
ties. They are less of a "third
choice" than they would like to
be, especially in their rush prac
tices, but they are more of one
than-the Fraternities would like
to admit.)
At the end of his letter, Mr.
Hecht raises the question of the
draw system. But even this
raises the problem of selection.
If the draw is not to be done by
the computer, it must involve
the parties concerned, the living
groups and the Freshmen. In
practice, this usually means
open houses, or their equivalent.
The living groups still have

"ding" sessions to arrive at
their preference lists. Both the
living groups and Freshmen
make up their minds on the
basis of scanty misinformation.
There are still heart-breaks be
cause, "I wasn't chosen," or
more commonly, "There wasn't
i x>m." It may be, however, that
the draw system reduces these
effects enough to recommend it
self. I don't know. The women
of this campus would know bet
ter.
The last point I would like to
make is that the importance of
the decision to live here, or
there, or wherever is not quite
as binding as getting married.
People do change, in both their
wants and living groups. This is
perhaps the best corrective to
mistakes made during rush and
should be enhanced. Unfortun
ately, it is only a corrective.

• Unfamiliarity
Editor, The Daily:
Being unfamiliar with the
American language I battled
long and hard to grasp the sub
tlety of your answer to Mr.
Kugelmass (The Daily, April 8).
My struggles proved to be futile
because to the end the "levels
of reality" which aspired to
"support civilized existence"
eluded by understanding. Until
yesterday I was content with
one level of reality which has
no plans on "civilized existence".
Could you please remedy my
ignorance?

Editor, The Daily:
In an effort to be cute, you
have displayed courage quite
above and beyond the call of
duty, by printing uninformed
"information". ("Send Beer, Not
Blood", The Daily, April 11).
You said you hadn't read any
Red Cross warning about a low
blood supply. Did you inquire?
Or do you often print unverified
information? A three-minute
call to Palo Alto's Red Cross
Chapter would have proven how
wrong you were.
According to the Director of
the Pacific Area Blood Program,
the Defense Department recent
ly asked National Red Cross for
hi million more pints of blood
to supply emergency needs for
gamma globulin and serum al
bumen. This is in addition to
blood included in the annual
drive goal, practically doubled
this year to meet increasing do
mestic and military needs. And
many Blood Banks have short
ages due to the flu epidemic.
Blood from Stanford will be
given American soldiers in Viet
nam. Regardless of your feeling
about U. S. policy, these are
humans — just like you except
their lives depend upon a trans
fusion.
Hopefully those who would
have donated to A-Phi-O won't
stay home because of your com
ments. A-Phi-O obviously didn't
intend that. And hopefully an
individual representing us,
whether he likes it or not, won't
fail to receive that crucial pint
(of blood!) because of your un
informed cuteness. Yesterday
you head-lined a quote by Phil
lips: "We live under a govern
ment of men and morning news
papers." Irresponsibility in gov
ernment is a crime.

the Red Cross, as a non-partisan

(We understand that although
the blood drawn in the Old Un

• Cruel And Unfair
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to add a com
ment to the current discussion
about rush. I must agree with
the verdict of Mr. Hecht and
Mr. Dahl. Rush, as a system of
selection with certain objectives,
is very inefficient. The "mis
takes" become obvious only the
following year. In some in
stances, it is cruel. It is almost
universally unfair.
I also must agree with Mr.
Hecht that dormitory living,
especially as it is now practiced,
is also not attractive. The
thought of spending four years
in Wilbur is enough to make me
want to transfer to Berkeley.
Faced with these two alterna
tives, it is no wonder that so
many men choose to live off
campus. (I must include the
Eating Clubs with the Fraterni
ties. They are less of a "third
choice" than they would like to
be, especially in their rush prac
tices, but they are more of one
than-the Fraternities would like
to admit.)
At the end of his letter, Mr.
Hecht raises the question of the
draw system. But even this
raises the problem of selection.
If the draw is not to be done by
the computer, it must involve
the parties concerned, the living
groups and the Freshmen. In
practice, this usually means
open houses, or their equivalent.
The living groups still have

"ding" sessions to arrive at
their preference lists. Both the
living groups and Freshmen
make up their minds on the
basis of scanty misinformation.
There are still heart-breaks be
cause, "I wasn't chosen," or
more commonly, "There wasn't
i x>m." It may be, however, that
the draw system reduces these
effects enough to recommend it
self. I don't know. The women
of this campus would know bet
ter.
The last point I would like to
make is that the importance of
the decision to live here, or
there, or wherever is not quite
as binding as getting married.
People do change, in both their
wants and living groups. This is
perhaps the best corrective to
mistakes made during rush and
should be enhanced. Unfortun
ately, it is only a corrective.

Editor, The Daily:
Last quarter it was the draft

that they are not to experience
any disappointments in life, at
least while in the Stanford nest.
If rush is supposed to be such
an evil institution, then who is
going to hold their hands when
they fail to get the job they
want want or fail to gain mem

I would call the attention of
the Stanford Community to the
curious notice on the doors of
our post office:
NO DOGS ALLOWED
(Except seeing-eye dogs)
Now, a man with a seeing
eye dog would not observe the
notice; it is above a dog's eye
level, and so he could not read
it —the parenthetical exception
is extraneous.
Furthermore, the nearby bush
es are more interesting to a non

• Unfamiliarity
Editor, The Daily:
Being unfamiliar with the
American language I battled
long and hard to grasp the sub
tlety of your answer to Mr.
Kugelmass (The Daily, April 8).
My struggles proved to be futile
because to the end the "levels
of reality" which aspired to
"support civilized existence"
eluded by understanding. Until
yesterday I was content with
one level of reality which has
no plans on "civilized existence".
Could you please remedy my
ignorance?
MICHAEL ATHANASSOGLOU
Editor, The Daily:
In an effort to be cute, you
have displayed courage quite
above and beyond the call of
duty, by printing uninformed
"information". ("Send Beer, Not
Blood", The Daily, April 11).
You said you hadn't read any
Red Cross warning about a low
blood supply. Did you inquire?
Or do you often print unverified
information? A three-minute
call to Palo Alto's Red Cross
Chapter would have proven how
wrong you were.
According to the Director of
the Pacific Area Blood Program,
the Defense Department recent
ly asked National Red Cross for
hi million more pints of blood
to supply emergency needs for
gamma globulin and serum al
bumen. This is in addition to
blood included in the annual
drive goal, practically doubled
this year to meet increasing do
mestic and military needs. And
many Blood Banks have short
ages due to the flu epidemic.
Blood from Stanford will be
given American soldiers in Viet
nam. Regardless of your feeling
about U. S. policy, these are
humans — just like you except
their lives depend upon a trans
fusion.
Hopefully those who would
have donated to A-Phi-O won't
stay home because of your com
ments. A-Phi-O obviously didn't
intend that. And hopefully an
individual representing us,
whether he likes it or not, won't
fail to receive that crucial pint
(of blood!) because of your un
informed cuteness. Yesterday
you head-lined a quote by Phil
lips: "We live under a govern
ment of men and morning news
papers." Irresponsibility in gov
ernment is a crime.
MICHELLE DE KLYEN
(Editor's note: If Miss De
Kleyn had spent more than three
minutes in research, she might
have learned that the blood-sup
ply situation can be interpreted
in a variety of ways.
(As we said Monday, the Red
Cross has published no recent
statement to the effect that the
supply of blood is running low,
and in fact there Is no shortage.
The Department of Defense,
however, has expressed a need
for certain blood derivatives, and
the Red Cross, as a non-partisan
organization, is helping the De
partment in collecting the raw
blood from which they are proc
essed.
(We understand that although
the blood drawn in the Old Un
ion yesterday is intended for
American troops in Vietnam, the
Department of Defense has re
served the option to abbrogate
the donors' wishes should a crit
ical shortage arise elsewhere —a
fact that was overlooked in the
ROTC's oversimplified "Win A
Contest" propaganda that cur
rently graces campus bulletin
boards.
(We are entirely in favor of

providing blood where it is need
ed to preserve human life —be
those humans American soldiers
or "Viet Cong." Moreover, we
do not believe the humanitarian
act of providing 1 that blood
should be obscured by equating
blood donations with flag wav
ing, as the Stanford ROTC chap
ter of the Association of the
United States Army has done.
(A more humanistic approach,
we feel, would be to bypass
partisan fanfare and donate
blood directly to a neutral or
ganization that can determine
for itself where the blood is
most needed.
(For those annual A-Phi-O
donors who were scared away
from the Old Union by the
AUSA yesterday, we suggest—
and encourage—them to give a
call to either the Peninsula
Blood Bank (6974034) or the
Bed Cross in Palo Alto (322-
2143) and arrange for the pro
vision of a non-partisan pint.)

omission of the word "not" from

• Cruel And Unfair
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to add a com
ment to the current discussion
about rush. I must agree with
the verdict of Mr. Hecht and
Mr. Dahl. Rush, as a system of
selection with certain objectives,
is very inefficient. The "mis
takes" become obvious only the
following year. In some in
stances, it is cruel. It is almost
universally unfair.
I also must agree with Mr.
Hecht that dormitory living,
especially as it is now practiced,
is also not attractive. The
thought of spending four years
in Wilbur is enough to make me
want to transfer to Berkeley.
Faced with these two alterna
tives, it is no wonder that so
many men choose to live off
campus. (I must include the
Eating Clubs with the Fraterni
ties. They are less of a "third
choice" than they would like to
be, especially in their rush prac
tices, but they are more of one
than-the Fraternities would like
to admit.)
At the end of his letter, Mr.
Hecht raises the question of the
draw system. But even this
raises the problem of selection.
If the draw is not to be done by
the computer, it must involve
the parties concerned, the living
groups and the Freshmen. In
practice, this usually means
open houses, or their equivalent.
The living groups still have

"ding" sessions to arrive at
their preference lists. Both the
living groups and Freshmen
make up their minds on the
basis of scanty misinformation.
There are still heart-breaks be
cause, "I wasn't chosen," or
more commonly, "There wasn't
i x>m." It may be, however, that
the draw system reduces these
effects enough to recommend it
self. I don't know. The women
of this campus would know bet
ter.
The last point I would like to
make is that the importance of
the decision to live here, or
there, or wherever is not quite
as binding as getting married.
People do change, in both their
wants and living groups. This is
perhaps the best corrective to
