## Supreme Court Deep In 'Dirt' 
### Art Buchwald 
The Supreme Court got itself
into a peck of trouble a few
weeks ago when it decided sev
eral obscenity cases, some for
and some against the prurient
interests of the United States.
In one case the Justices up
held the conviction of Ralph
Ginzburg for publishing and ad
vertising pornography; in an
other they ruled that Fanny Hill,
a pornographic novel of the 18th
century, had some "redeeming
social value"; and in a third,
they upheld the conviction of a
man named Mishkin for selling
dirty books.
While the Supreme Court did
not resolve any of the problems
of obscenity, they fixed it so
each piece of pornography
would have to be judged on Its
merits, and this will require a
great deal of outside reading.
Let us go to the dining room
of the Supreme Court where the

Supreme Court Justices are
having lunch.
One of the Justices says to the
other, "I read Lashed, Whipped
and Abandoned last night."
"Oh, how was it?"
"It had no literary merit,
though I must say it had some
redeeming social value at the
end. The girl finally joins the
Peace Corps."
Another Justice says,"I read
Raped, Warp*-d and Wanton,
which I found patently offen
sive. It was nothing but a series
of erotic scenes, tied together
by a man who is trying to stop
urban renewal in his neighbor
hood."
"Do you think it has any value
to the community?"
"It depends how you feel
about urban renewal."
"I really got stuck with a dog
last night," another one of the
Justices said. "It was titled Sin
ner, Sin Once More."

"Did it appeal to your pruri
ent interests?"
"It certainly did. I could hard
ly put it down."
"Well, we'll have to do some
thing about that book. May I
have it next?"
"Somebody else has asked for
it. I think you're fourth in line."
"If you let me read it tonight,
I'll let you have the one I just
finished, Nude Interlude."
"Is it obscene according to the
Roth Decision of 1957?"
"It goes far beyond the Roth
decision, at least as far as the
dominant theme is concerned."
"All right, I'll trade you. I was
going to read Lo*t in Sodom to
night, but I found the advertis
ing on the "back cover very
dull."
"Have you seen the new ad
vertising campaign for Don
Quixote?"
"No, do you think we've got
a case there?"
"I should hope so. Don Quixote

is shown attacking a windmill
which is in the shape of a bare
breasted woman."
"And what is Sancho Panza
doing?"
"He's protecting the windmill.
The whole thing has the leer of
a sensualist to it. The campaign
is a disgrace to the communi
ty."
"Who wrote it?"
"Miguel de Cervantes."
"Is he up on appeal?"
"Not yet. But I believe they're
going after him in Oklahoma."
"I hope I get to write the de
cision. I never heard of anything
so outrageous."
The clerk of the Court comes
in. "A new batch of books has
just arrived, gentlemen."
"I get first choice after the
Chief Justice," someone cries.
"You had first choice last
time," another Justice shouts.
"Can I help it if I'm a fast
reader?"
