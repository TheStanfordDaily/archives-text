# Today And Tomorrow
## No Viet Government Can Stand Without Buddhists 
### Walter Lippmann 
Much depends on whether or not the present crisis in Vietnam is
merely one more in the series of reshuffles which have been taking
place since 1963. It begins to look as if it were very much more than
that—no mere reshuffle among generals, but a deep popular crisis.
For the Buddhists, who are the core of the opposition, are de-

manding a new kind of govern
ment, not merely a change
within the government, say the
removal of Gen. Nguyen Cao
Ky.
A Revolution
A change in the kind of gov
ernment, from the directorate of
warlords to some sort of direc
torate of civilians, would be not
a reshuffle but a revolution.
The genuinely revolutionary
character of the movement is at
tested to by the fact that the
Buddhist leaders are demanding
that the present government of
the generals be replaced by a
civilian government before elec
tions are held. For they realize
quite well that in a country like
South Vietnam those who con
duct the elections will win the
elections.
The Buddhist leaders are ask
ing for a government in which
they will have the predominant
power when the generals go.
The Buddhists
The question then is what the
Buddhists represent. We have no
definitive information on this
subject, in the main because it
is a technical impossibility for
Americans and other Western
journalists to get any reliable
measure of the extent and force
of the opposition in a country
which is ravaged by a ferocious
civil war.
What we do know is that in
the whole series of crises since
the downfall of Diem in 1963 the
Buddhists, when they have in
tervened actively, have appeared
to play a predominant role.
Revolutions are always the
work of a conscious minority,
and it is probably true that,
whether or not the Buddhists
are at present a majority by a
count of heads, no government
in Saigon can govern for long
if the Buddhists oppose it.
Popular Discontent
There are reasons for thinking
that the Buddhists are moving
with a rising tide of popular dis
content. There is discontent over
the savage inflation which is so
cruelly oppressive of the poor.
There is discontent with the
pervasive and open corruption
which is unbearably offensive to
the hungry victims.
There is, of course, discontent
with the cruelties and miseries
of war. Finally, but not least,
there is discontent with the over

powering presence of a large
army of rich, unreticent aliens
from a different civilization.
It may well be that the situa
tion in South Vietnam has
reached the breaking point, fore
seen by a few who have studied
the war at close hand. The time
may have come when we are
faced with a dilemma: as we
multiply our own troops and
take over command, there is a
countervailing tendency of the
South Vietnamese army to re
cede into the background. This
presents us with a continually
rising demand for more Ameri
can force.
Hatred
As our Army has enormous
logistical requirements it acts
as a crushing weight upon the
simpler, primitive village econ
omy of the Vietnamese. All this
generates a popular hatred of
the war.
It is a plausible supposition
that the Buddhists, who have
ways of being well-informed
about what is going on In their
country, are responding to this
situation.
If this is what is happening,
we have to take account of sev
eral contingencies.
The first is that Gen. Ky and
some of his fellow generals may
decide to suppress the Buddhist
rebellion by military force. If
they do try this they are likely
to precipitate a civil war inside
of that part of South Vietnam
where we are lodged, and the
consequences of such a civil war
are incalculable.
Internal Quarrel
We must not forget that the
fall of Diem began with the re
pression of the Buddhists, and
we must hope that Undersecre
tary of State George Ball is
speaking with authority when
he disclaims any intention on
our part to become involved in
the internal quarrel.
A second contingency is that
the Buddhists, having set up a
civilian government, will nego
tiate a cease-fire with the Viet
Cong. If we are wise we shall
play that one cool.
A third contingency is that a
South Vietnamese government
will tell us that our military
support is no longer necessary
and will invite us to withdraw
our troops. If and when this con
tingency confronts us we shall
have to take a new look at the
holding strategy which was so
scornfully dismissed earlier this
year.
Keeping One's Cool
Although we shall have failed
to do what it was never possible
to do—to conquer the Viet Cong
and turn the whole of South
Vietnam over to Gen. Ky's gov
ernment — there is no reason
why we should lose our heads.
We shall have an undefeated
army in Indochina, and while it
should eventually be withdrawn
from the mainland of Asia, I be
lieve that the character of its
withdrawal should be a main
subject of negotiation in the
politics of Asia. A negotiation of
the phasing and the timing of
the withdrawal, and their rela
tionship to reciprocal guaran
tees, would be a great opportuni
ty—if and when the statesman
ship takes over.
