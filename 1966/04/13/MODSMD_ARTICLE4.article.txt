# Oregon Congress woman Praises Food For Peace
## 
### JANE ARIES 
The great and compelling appeal
of America must be its immense agri
cultural capacity, a power more po
tent in a hungry world than all the
nuclear bombs ever manufactured,
Congresswoman Edith Green (D-Ore.)
told the Tuesday Evening Series.
k Luxury of Conflict
Most of the world can not afford
the luxury ol ideological conflicts, she
declared. The offer of freedom from
Communist dictatorship is not com
pelling to people suffering from eco
nomic and social oppression.
Mrs. Green advocated the formation
of a Farmers Corps as proposed by
Senator McGovern to share agricul
tural techniques with underdeveloped
countries. The audience applauded
her hope that one day the peace corps
and farmer corp would replace the
green beret. For the United States to
spend $2 billion to reduce agricultural

production must seem criminal to
those dying of hunger.
Admiring the Food for Peace pro
gram instituted in 1954, Mrs. Green
warned against sinking back into
complacency and self satisfaction.
She noted that in 1965 the U. S. spent
four times more on defense, $50 bil
lion, than it spent in 11 years on Food
for Peace.
Praised Johnson
She praised Johnson's recent action
on aid to India as an "opportunity
for those who disapprove of adminis
tration policy in Vietnam to show
they can be as vigorous in assent to
policy which is constructive as they
can be vigorous in dissent to policy
which seems destructive."
The United States now has the pos
sibility to combat famine in India.
Mrs. Green recalled the Berlin airlift
which transported 1,750,000 tons of
supplies for $266 million. It was a
relatively inexpensive gesture com

pared to the $7.8 billion allocated for
ammunition alone in Vietnam, yet it
represented a brilliant chapter in the
struggle- against Communism.
The speech began with a defense
of the right to dissent. Though we can
not all make policy, we have the right
to judge it. Mrs. Green attacked those
in the government who suggest that
disagreement with foreign policy is
a kind of sedition.
Compartment Theory
She also questioned the "expert
theory" which implies that anyone
not involved in policy making it un
qualified to criticize it, and the "Com
partment theory" which allows dis
cussion of foreign policy, but forbids
action.
Agreeing with Senator Fullbright
Mrs. Green called on the universities
to be the great centers of freedom.
We have a responsibility to love our
country not as it is, but as we would
have it be.
