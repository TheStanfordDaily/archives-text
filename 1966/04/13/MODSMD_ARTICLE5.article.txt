series describing the platforms of the
eight candidates for ASSU President.)

ASSU presidential candidate Bob
Fellmeth stresses the need for a
strong executive branch of student
government.
"We need a strong executive," Fell
meth says; "an executive that cares.
We need an executive that is going
to present an extensive and detailed
program to the Legislature and then
is going to make a great effort to
push it through and then is going to
carry out those programs."
Benefits
"It would mean," Fellmeth says,
"more academic experimentation, cre
ation of a no-grade system, efficient
scheduling procedures, efficient
budgeting procedures, ASSU enter
tainment programming, a better cur
riculum, departmental reform, a
Rathskeller with beer or any number
of things."
Fullmeth admits that to many these
ideas seem very idealistic, but empha
sizes that many things have been
done recently at Stanford that before
were considered impossible.

"We were told on the Program Di
vision of Tresidder Memorial Union
that it was impossible to get three
Nobel Prize winners in one series,"
Fellmeth says, "but we did it. We
were told that we were being idealis-

tie when we thought we could attract
10,000 people to Frost Amphitheater
for a Jazz Year concert and we did
that. We did all these things, and
things like this can be done In stu
dent government. It's up to us to ef
fect a change of scope, for that is the
only way the true potential of student
government can be realized."

Bob Klein and Jan Jacobi, running
for ASSU president and vice presi
dent, feel that student participation
in the area of educational reforms is
the central issue confronting student
government.
The two candidates believe that stu
dent government is reaching a point
where it must shift its emphasis.
Reforms
"In 1962," Jacobi says, "Armin Ros
enkranz ran for student body presi
dent, and he was at that time the
first really serious student body presi
dent in that he worked for definite
reforms in certain areas: freedom of
political expression, judicial reforms
and reform of present social regula
tions. Over the last four years student
government has achieved reforms in
all those areas and is in the final
stages of achieving reforms in the
areas of liquor policy and religious
freedom."
Now, Klein and Jacobi feel, it is
important to shift the emphasis in
student government to issues of edu
cational importance.
The key issue, Klein says, is what
the students have to say about the
education they are receiving.
Klein proposes re-examination of
the total academic curriculum by a
committee of undergraduate stu
dents.
"It has been 11 years," Klein says,

"since the general studies require
ments have been evaluated, and the
senior colloquium system has never
been re-examined."
Klein and Jacobi also propose a vol
untary pass-fail grading system, par
ticularly for general studies require
ments outside a student's major.

"This system," Klein feels, "would
eliminate the problem of students
taking less difficult courses in areas
in which they know they have a de
ficiency in order to avoid poor grades
which might keep them out of good
graduate schools."
Klein and Jacobi also feel that stu
dents should serve in an advisory ca
pacity on the Board of Trustees.

tainment programming, a better cur
riculum, departmental reform, a
Rathskeller with beer or any number
of things."
Fullmeth admits that to many these
ideas seem very idealistic, but empha
sizes that many things have been
done recently at Stanford that before
were considered impossible.

"We were told on the Program Di
vision of Tresidder Memorial Union
that it was impossible to get three
Nobel Prize winners in one series,"
Fellmeth says, "but we did it. We
were told that we were being idealis-

tie when we thought we could attract
10,000 people to Frost Amphitheater
for a Jazz Year concert and we did
that. We did all these things, and
things like this can be done In stu
dent government. It's up to us to ef
fect a change of scope, for that is the
only way the true potential of student
government can be realized."

Bob Klein and Jan Jacobi, running
for ASSU president and vice presi
dent, feel that student participation
in the area of educational reforms is
the central issue confronting student
government.
The two candidates believe that stu
dent government is reaching a point
where it must shift its emphasis.
Reforms
"In 1962," Jacobi says, "Armin Ros
enkranz ran for student body presi
dent, and he was at that time the
first really serious student body presi
dent in that he worked for definite
reforms in certain areas: freedom of
political expression, judicial reforms
and reform of present social regula
tions. Over the last four years student
government has achieved reforms in
all those areas and is in the final
stages of achieving reforms in the
areas of liquor policy and religious
freedom."
Now, Klein and Jacobi feel, it is
important to shift the emphasis in
student government to issues of edu
cational importance.
The key issue, Klein says, is what
the students have to say about the
education they are receiving.
Klein proposes re-examination of
the total academic curriculum by a
committee of undergraduate stu
dents.
"It has been 11 years," Klein says,

"since the general studies require
ments have been evaluated, and the
senior colloquium system has never
been re-examined."
Klein and Jacobi also propose a vol
untary pass-fail grading system, par
ticularly for general studies require
ments outside a student's major.

"This system," Klein feels, "would
eliminate the problem of students
taking less difficult courses in areas
in which they know they have a de
ficiency in order to avoid poor grades
which might keep them out of good
graduate schools."
Klein and Jacobi also feel that stu
dents should serve in an advisory ca
pacity on the Board of Trustees.

eight candidates for ASSU President.)

ASSU presidential candidate Bob
Fellmeth stresses the need for a
strong executive branch of student
government.
"We need a strong executive," Fell
meth says; "an executive that cares.
We need an executive that is going
to present an extensive and detailed
program to the Legislature and then
is going to make a great effort to
push it through and then is going to
carry out those programs."
Benefits
"It would mean," Fellmeth says,
"more academic experimentation, cre
ation of a no-grade system, efficient
scheduling procedures, efficient
budgeting procedures, ASSU enter
tainment programming, a better cur
riculum, departmental reform, a
Rathskeller with beer or any number
of things."
