# Unit Takes 148 Pints In Army Blood Drive
## 
### 
About 148 Stanford donors volun
teered their blood yesterday "in physi
cal and moral support" of the Viet
nam war effort.
The drive was sponsored by the
Herbert D. Walter Co. of the Associa

tion of the United States Army
(AUSA).
It was a follow-up to the Walter
Army Society's drive last October,
when 222 pints of blood were collected
"in support of the U. S. commitment
in South Vietnam." The Walter Army
Society since has merged with the
AUSA.
'Gratifying'
Wilbur freshman Robert Clark,
who was vice-president of the Walter
Army Society and active in promoting
both drivees, said the response to the
AUSA's call for blood was "gratifying
â€”all things considered."
In making the call for blood volun
teers on campus, Clark .v essed that
the goal of the drive was 'both physi
cal and political."
He quoted Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara as saying there
is a "vital need" for the blood deriva
tives gamma globulin, used in treat
ing hepatitus, and serum albumin,
for treating shock.
'Solidarity'
Clark said the AUSA hopes the
blood drive's "demonstration of soli
darity" would manifest AUSA's com
mitment in the broadest political
sense.
"The Army's job is to prosecute the
war in the most efficient way possi
ble; we here at Stanford are not reluc
tant to do that job when our time
comes to serve," he explained. "That
is the extent of tthe political side of
the drive."
Busiest period for the drive, which
was held in the Old Union dining
room, between 9 a. m. and 4 p. m.,
was the first hour and a half.
'Helping Out*
Among the pre-lunch donors was
Associate Dean of Students Robert
Gordon, who told The Daily he was
"just trying to help out."
During the morning 37 Red Cross
volunteers took down donors' temper
atures, determined blood pressures,
and recorded short medical histories
in preparation for extracting the
blood. The process took about 50 min
utes for each donor.
Altogether, 175 potential donors
showed up for the drive, although
many were unable to give blood for
health reasons.
Beer Winner Unannounced
The AUSA has not yet announced
which campus residence won the keg
of beer promised to the living group
with the largest percentage of mem
bers giving blood.
Clark noted that although the blood
was collected with the intention that
it go to Vietnam, it will be transferred
to the Department of Defense "to
use at its discretion."
