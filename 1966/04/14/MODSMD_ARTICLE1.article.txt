# S.R.I. Seeks To Cut Defense Contracts
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
Stanford Research Institute, recipient of
more than $22 million annually from mili
tary contracts, is seeking to reduce its de
pendence on defense funds.
Established in 1946 as a center for "diver
sified" research, the Institute now ranks fifth
among non-profit military contractors. Con
tracts include multi-million dollar research
projects dealing with chemical and "uncon
ventional" warfare.
Ernest C. Arbuckle, Dean of the Gradu
ate School of Business and newly-appointed
chairman of SRI, emphasized that the shift
is for business reasons only.
Demand Independable
"Military demand is too undependable.
We prefer to put our trust in a growing
economy."
Dean Arbuckle denied that the military
contracts endangered the autonomy of the
University.
"We are very conscious of what influence,
if any, results from government contracts.

I believe that the government has not ex
erted any undesirable degree of control."
He emphasized that the Institute, though
bearing the Stanford name, is physically
and administratively separate from the rest
of the University. Control of SRI is vested
in the Stanford Board of Trustees, who dele
gate it to the Board of Directors of the In
stitute. "The connection is strictly a volun
tary and a cooperative one," he said.
No Jurisdiction
The Dean rejected as "unsound" a pro
posal by the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee to create a faculty-administration
board to pass on the contracts offered to the
SRI. "The faculty has no jurisdiction in this
matter," he said.
Dean Arbuckle remarked, however, that
President Sterling reviews government con
tracts and their effect on University auton
omy with the Board of Trustees. "But, to
my knowledge, the University has never de
cided what kinds of contracts are unaccept
able."

Dean Arbuckle felt that accepting defense
contracts is part of the Institute's respons
bility to "cooperate and collaborate in build
ing resources to carry out national policy.
The government has to have somewhere to
turn where they can be sure that work will
be regarded as confidential."
Denies Special Interest
He denied, however, that the Institute or
private industry has a special stake in the
continuation of a high level of defense
spending. "Businessmen do not like to be
dependent on military contracts for volume
or profits. Executives in big companies spend
most of their time trying to figure out how
to get a bigger share of the civilian market."
Dean Arbuckle attributed this desire to
concentrate on non-military products to the
smaller rate of profit in government work
as well as to fear of fluctuations in demand.
"I don't think a 'military-industrial com
plex' exists," he remarked. "It's in the selfish
interests of business to concentrate on the
free, competitive market."

The SRI, he said, is part of this trend.
Since its founding about 30 per cent of its
income has come from private sources. The
Institute maintains over 400 research projects
in four areas: physical sciences, life sciences,
engineering, and economics and manage
ment sciences.
The Dean stated that the main purpose
of the Institute is to "translate and dissemi
nate the discoveries of the University for
the use of business and government.
"In 1946, we felt there was a great need
for a regional institute of research that
could bring together all the knowledge and
skill concerning specific problems that could
be obtained. It would benefit the whole
region in terms of economic development.
The University could draw on the Institute,
and the Institute could draw on the Uni
versity."
No Professorial Rank
Although SRI employees do not hold any
professional rank, they often collaborate
with men in the University. Professors from

the School of Business recently served as
consultants on an SRI study of long-range
planning for industry.
SRI scientists have helped manufacture
and machine parts for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The parts had to he machined
far more accurately than has ever been done
before.
The Institute operates on expenses of
over $50 million per year. Its main labora
tories are located in Menlo Park, three miles
from the campus. They also maintain labs
in Palo Alto and in South San Francisco, as
well as offices throughout the world.
Dean Arbuckle assumed the chairman
ship of SRI from President Sterling, who re
signed because of the volume of his other
work. Dean Arbuckle, a Stanford graduate,
was an executive in business and a member
of the Stanford Board of Trustees before

"We are very conscious of what influence,
if any, results from government contracts.

I believe that the government has not ex
erted any undesirable degree of control."
He emphasized that the Institute, though
bearing the Stanford name, is physically
and administratively separate from the rest
of the University. Control of SRI is vested
in the Stanford Board of Trustees, who dele
gate it to the Board of Directors of the In
stitute. "The connection is strictly a volun
tary and a cooperative one," he said.
No Jurisdiction
The Dean rejected as "unsound" a pro
posal by the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee to create a faculty-administration
board to pass on the contracts offered to the
SRI. "The faculty has no jurisdiction in this
matter," he said.
Dean Arbuckle remarked, however, that
President Sterling reviews government con
tracts and their effect on University auton
omy with the Board of Trustees. "But, to
my knowledge, the University has never de
cided what kinds of contracts are unaccept
able."

Dean Arbuckle felt that accepting defense
contracts is part of the Institute's respons
bility to "cooperate and collaborate in build
ing resources to carry out national policy.
The government has to have somewhere to
turn where they can be sure that work will
be regarded as confidential."
Denies Special Interest
He denied, however, that the Institute or
private industry has a special stake in the
continuation of a high level of defense
spending. "Businessmen do not like to be
dependent on military contracts for volume
or profits. Executives in big companies spend
most of their time trying to figure out how
to get a bigger share of the civilian market."
Dean Arbuckle attributed this desire to
concentrate on non-military products to the
smaller rate of profit in government work
as well as to fear of fluctuations in demand.
"I don't think a 'military-industrial com
plex' exists," he remarked. "It's in the selfish
interests of business to concentrate on the
free, competitive market."

The SRI, he said, is part of this trend.
Since its founding about 30 per cent of its
income has come from private sources. The
Institute maintains over 400 research projects
in four areas: physical sciences, life sciences,
engineering, and economics and manage
ment sciences.
The Dean stated that the main purpose
of the Institute is to "translate and dissemi
nate the discoveries of the University for
the use of business and government.
"In 1946, we felt there was a great need
for a regional institute of research that
could bring together all the knowledge and
skill concerning specific problems that could
be obtained. It would benefit the whole
region in terms of economic development.
The University could draw on the Institute,
and the Institute could draw on the Uni
versity."
No Professorial Rank
Although SRI employees do not hold any
professional rank, they often collaborate
with men in the University. Professors from

the School of Business recently served as
consultants on an SRI study of long-range
planning for industry.
SRI scientists have helped manufacture
and machine parts for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The parts had to he machined
far more accurately than has ever been done
before.
The Institute operates on expenses of
over $50 million per year. Its main labora
tories are located in Menlo Park, three miles
from the campus. They also maintain labs
in Palo Alto and in South San Francisco, as
well as offices throughout the world.
Dean Arbuckle assumed the chairman
ship of SRI from President Sterling, who re
signed because of the volume of his other
work. Dean Arbuckle, a Stanford graduate,
was an executive in business and a member
of the Stanford Board of Trustees before
joining the administration as Dean of the
Graduate School of Business Administra
tion.
Stanford Research Institute, recipient of
more than $22 million annually from mili
tary contracts, is seeking to reduce its de
pendence on defense funds.
Established in 1946 as a center for "diver
sified" research, the Institute now ranks fifth
among non-profit military contractors. Con
tracts include multi-million dollar research
projects dealing with chemical and "uncon

Ernest C. Arbuckle, Dean of the Gradu

tracts and their effect on University auton
omy with the Board of Trustees. "But, to
my knowledge, the University has never de
cided what kinds of contracts are unaccept
able."

Dean Arbuckle felt that accepting defense
contracts is part of the Institute's respons
bility to "cooperate and collaborate in build
ing resources to carry out national policy.
The government has to have somewhere to
turn where they can be sure that work will
be regarded as confidential."
Denies Special Interest
He denied, however, that the Institute or
private industry has a special stake in the
continuation of a high level of defense
spending. "Businessmen do not like to be
dependent on military contracts for volume
or profits. Executives in big companies spend
most of their time trying to figure out how
to get a bigger share of the civilian market."
Dean Arbuckle attributed this desire to
concentrate on non-military products to the
smaller rate of profit in government work
as well as to fear of fluctuations in demand.
"I don't think a 'military-industrial com
plex' exists," he remarked. "It's in the selfish
interests of business to concentrate on the
free, competitive market."

The SRI, he said, is part of this trend.
Since its founding about 30 per cent of its
income has come from private sources. The
Institute maintains over 400 research projects
in four areas: physical sciences, life sciences,
engineering, and economics and manage
ment sciences.
The Dean stated that the main purpose
of the Institute is to "translate and dissemi
nate the discoveries of the University for
the use of business and government.
"In 1946, we felt there was a great need
for a regional institute of research that
could bring together all the knowledge and
skill concerning specific problems that could
be obtained. It would benefit the whole
region in terms of economic development.
The University could draw on the Institute,
and the Institute could draw on the Uni
versity."
No Professorial Rank
Although SRI employees do not hold any
professional rank, they often collaborate
with men in the University. Professors from

the School of Business recently served as
consultants on an SRI study of long-range
planning for industry.
SRI scientists have helped manufacture
and machine parts for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. The parts had to he machined
far more accurately than has ever been done
before.
The Institute operates on expenses of
over $50 million per year. Its main labora
tories are located in Menlo Park, three miles
from the campus. They also maintain labs
in Palo Alto and in South San Francisco, as
well as offices throughout the world.
Dean Arbuckle assumed the chairman
ship of SRI from President Sterling, who re
signed because of the volume of his other
work. Dean Arbuckle, a Stanford graduate,
was an executive in business and a member
of the Stanford Board of Trustees before
joining the administration as Dean of the
Graduate School of Business Administra
tion.
