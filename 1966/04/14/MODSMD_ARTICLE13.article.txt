# Sigma Chi's Lead Murals
## Daily 
### BOB THIERIOT 
With the coming of spring
intramurals, defending cham
pion Sigma Chi looks as though
it will cop the crown again this
year. By capturing 77 points
in basketball and 117 during the
winter quarter, the Chi's over
came a 16 point fall quarter
deficit to romp into the lead.
The Phi Delts dropped from
Ist to sth place. Fremont
grabbed 88 V2 points in the win
ter to improve from 6th to 3rd
place. They trail the leaders by
23 V2 points. Donner collected 109
points in the winter, second only
to Sigma Chi's 117. Unlisted in
the top ten after action in the
fall, Donner invaded the top ten

circle by taking over Bth place.
El Cuadro disappeared.
The Theta Delts held on to
2nd place, while the Chi's passed
them, and the Phi Delts fell be
hind. The Theta's only scored
78 points to give the Chi's the
opportunity.
Wilbur's best entrant is Juni
pero with 99 points. They have
concentrated on the major
sports to collect their points.
They earned 39 in football for all
their fall quarter points and
64 in basketball, all but two
of their winter quarter scoring.
Though the Sigma Chi's did
not win any championships last
spring, they rallied for enough
points to capture the top tro
phy. This year they will have
to win something for they have

two hot pursuersâ€”Theta Delt
and Fremont. Fourth place is a
long distance away. The SAE's
have only 168 and trail by 39
points.
After the dropoff from 3rd
to 4th the teams are pretty well
bunched up. But none of them
can even challenge for the Uni
versity Championship without a
whole lot of victories.
