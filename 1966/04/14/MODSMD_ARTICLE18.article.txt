# The 						RA-Sponsor Reports
## 
### 
The Office of the Dean of Students is show
ing signs of entering a new era of cooperation
with students.
A case in point is the willingness of Associate
Dean of Students Robert Gordon and Assistant
Dean Douglas Davis to consider and partially
accept the recommendatioons of an ad hoc com
mittee of sponsors and RA's formed by ASSU
Vice President Clark Brown to investigate the
use and nature of reports made by RA's and
sponsors on the students under their jurisdic
tion.
In the past, these personal reports have
been used for recommendations for overseas
campuses, graduate schools and jobs, as well
as for counseling. And while perhaps no more
superficial than, say, rush, they have left much
to be desired in the way of reflecting and eval
uating the whole student. Several sponsors have
protested that without training in counseling,
they do not feel qualified to fill out the reports,
and that student knowledge of the reports ham
pers the possibility of building up friendly,
easy-going relationships between the sponsor
or RA and the student.
These reports, long a bone of contention be
tween residence directors and the RA's and
sponsors who work with them, have been of two
types. End-of-the-year reports, in which the
RA or sponsor evaluates the students who have
lived with him in his dormitory or fraternity,
have been abolished. These mandatory reports,

which have managed to exist without the
knowledge of most students, have caused many
an RA and sponsor to feel that he is violating
the confidential relationship created with the
student. Abolition should help further the posi
tion of the sponsor as a friend and counselor
rather than as a disciplinarian.
The status of the incident report, written by
the sponsor or RA when a student commits a
transgression, is still in doubt. In the past,
many sponsors and RAs, as a matter of prin
ciple, have not filled out these reports; as a
consequence, the files of the students into
which they would go have often been very in
complete, and as a result, inaccurate. More
over, the reports, by their nature, have usually
been negative rather than positive in tone, and
therefore of limited value in corrective coun
seling. Additionally, the written reports are
treated loosely by the Deans' Office—and the
nature of the information is such that it should
be confidential. Brown's committee is asking
that the written reports be replaced with more
complete, and therefore more useful, oral re
ports.
A well-qualified committee of students and
administrators is seeking a solution on this final
point. We hope that they will find it in their
wisdom to accept the recommendation for the
oral report —and thereby bring a successful
and quiet ending to what has so far been a suc
cessful example of student-administrative co
operation.

operation.
The Office of the Dean of Students is show
ing signs of entering a new era of cooperation
with students.
A case in point is the willingness of Associate
Dean of Students Robert Gordon and Assistant
Dean Douglas Davis to consider and partially
accept the recommendatioons of an ad hoc com
mittee of sponsors and RA's formed by ASSU
Vice President Clark Brown to investigate the
use and nature of reports made by RA's and
sponsors on the students under their jurisdic
tion.
In the past, these personal reports have
been used for recommendations for overseas
campuses, graduate schools and jobs, as well
as for counseling. And while perhaps no more
superficial than, say, rush, they have left much
to be desired in the way of reflecting and eval
uating the whole student. Several sponsors have
protested that without training in counseling,
they do not feel qualified to fill out the reports,
and that student knowledge of the reports ham
pers the possibility of building up friendly,
easy-going relationships between the sponsor
or RA and the student.
These reports, long a bone of contention be
tween residence directors and the RA's and
sponsors who work with them, have been of two
types. End-of-the-year reports, in which the
RA or sponsor evaluates the students who have
lived with him in his dormitory or fraternity,
have been abolished. These mandatory reports,

which have managed to exist without the
knowledge of most students, have caused many
an RA and sponsor to feel that he is violating
the confidential relationship created with the
student. Abolition should help further the posi
tion of the sponsor as a friend and counselor
rather than as a disciplinarian.
The status of the incident report, written by
the sponsor or RA when a student commits a
transgression, is still in doubt. In the past,
many sponsors and RAs, as a matter of prin
ciple, have not filled out these reports; as a
consequence, the files of the students into
which they would go have often been very in
complete, and as a result, inaccurate. More
over, the reports, by their nature, have usually
been negative rather than positive in tone, and
therefore of limited value in corrective coun
seling. Additionally, the written reports are
treated loosely by the Deans' Office—and the
nature of the information is such that it should
be confidential. Brown's committee is asking
that the written reports be replaced with more
complete, and therefore more useful, oral re
ports.
A well-qualified committee of students and
administrators is seeking a solution on this final
point. We hope that they will find it in their
wisdom to accept the recommendation for the
oral report —and thereby bring a successful
and quiet ending to what has so far been a suc
cessful example of student-administrative co
operation.
