# Stanford Social Regs Become The 'Inappropriate Tradition'
## 
### JUDY ANCEL 
Although I am a member of
the Social Regulations Commit
tee, I speak here only as a hu
man being.
Throughout the past year the
Social Regulations Committee
has been confronted with ques
tions from students about the
purpose of social regulations.
As a result of these questions
and because we could not dis
cover a consistent explanation
for the system, the Committee
decided to interview several ad
ministrative officials to try to
determine what the University
saw as its responsibility in reg
ulating this aspect of a student's
non-academic life. The answers
we received were not entirely
satisfactory.
Not Responsible
Most administrators contend
that until many women gradu
ate they are not responsible
enough for themselves to be
able to set their own regulations
and need the guidance of a sys
tem; they feel that if there were
no controls or standards, the
University would indeed be
shirking its duty to a girl's par
ents and not fulfilling a "cour
tesy" it owes them because it
would be allowing her to come
from a protected home-life to
the freedom of the Stanford en
vironment.
In response to this rationale
for creating the present system,
one may legitimately inquire
whether in meeting the demands
of parents, alumni, and other
pressure groups outside the
University, Stanford is not com
promising some of its basic edu
cational assumptions.
In Pursuit of Education
As an institution for higher
education, Stanford must as
sume that its students are here
because they seriously want to
pursue an academic education.
If the University aspires to be
more than a glorified high
school, it must expect and re
quire its students to be here pri
marily to study and learn
through the books, lectures and
personal associations with mem
bers of the faculty that it makes
available.
Of course there are many oth

er benefits of membership in
this community, but the Univer
sity's primary reason for being
is to accumulate and transmit
knowledge to its students and
to teach them how to think. If
Stanford is to be a great univer
sity, it cannot afford to cater
to the casual student. One of
Stanford's strengths is that it
does accept this premise aca
demically, for it entrusts us
with good teachers and gives
us freedom to engage in indepen
dent programs and to set the
pace of our studies.
No Such Luck
This policy does not, however,
carry over to the woman stu
dent's social life. Stanford men
are considered to be mature and
serious enough students not to
need social regulations; the Uni
versity does not assume the re
sponsibility for the parents in
their case. The women, however,
have no such luck.
In a survey the Social Regula
tions Committee took Winter
quarter of the use of the sign
out information, which is intend
ed to be for a woman's own pro
tection in case of trouble and
for reaching her in an emerg
ency, it was found that this year
the University has never used
it to help a girl in an emergency.
Not only is the system ineffec
tive as a guide to set standards
and as protection, but also,
through this policy, Stanford
shows that it believes that stu
dents will spend as much time
as they are allowed socializing
away from their studies unless
they are controlled.
Own Best Judge
It would seem that once a stu
dent has attended Stanford for
one or two quarters, she is the
one best able to estimate the
amount of time she needs to
spend on her studies. There is
nothing inherently wrong with
spending time socializing, and
certainly the regulations can
not begin to act as a moral con
trol, nor can they force a woman
to study if she does not want to.
So then what is their pur
pose?
As an arbitrary guide to stu
dy time, they can fit no one's
habits, and as a crutch to pro

tect the most immature student,
they set standards at the low
est common denomenator. Thus,
in the area of Social Regula
tions, Stanford reveals a real
mistrust of the student's ear
nestness. On one hand it expects
rational thought and real disci
pline; on the other it sets its
standards to a norm of irrespon
sibility, immaturity, and depen
dence.
In these regulations, Stanford
demonstrates an insincerity of
attitude toward education and
a faithlessness in its own pur
pose as an institution for high
er education. It thereby succeeds
in making precisely the kind of
student it cares to: one who will
not take a university education
seriously because the Universi
ty fails to take him seriously.
