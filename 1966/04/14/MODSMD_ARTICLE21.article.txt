## The 						Asian Country Of Gut Hits US Below The Belt 
### Art Buchwald 
There have been constant al
lusions in the press lately to
"the Gut issue." Every time a
spokesman from the State De
partment or the Pentagon
makes a statement, he always
refers to the "Gut issue."
The Gut issue first came into
being when John Foster Dulles
was Secretary of State. A young
State Department officer kept
referring to the Gut issue and
finally Mr. Dulles in exaspera
tion said, "What the devil is
the Gut issue?"
Marshals and Monk
Not wanting to admit he
didn't know, the young officer
replied, "It has to do with the
country of Gut which is located
in Southeast Asia. It has a popu
lation of 25,567 people and is
ruled by seven air marshals and
a Buddhist monk."
"Very interesting," Mr. Dulles
said. "What kind of soldiers do
they have?"
"They have real Gut fighters,
sir. They're tough and they
fight dirty."
"It sounds like an internal
problem." Mr. Dulles said. "But
anybody with that kind of cour
age should have American sup
port."
"Exactly what I was thinking,
sir."
Advisers
"All right, let's send in some
military advisers and beef them
up. From now on we're going
to have a pro-Gut policy. By the
way, what seems to be their
problem at the moment?"
"Communists, sir. The place
is lousy with them."
"Well, we'll soon fix that."
"How, sir?"
"We're going to show some
real Guts in Asia. If we don't
do it now, China will think
we're a paper tiger."
Mr. Dulles made the first com
mitment—small but fast. When
President Kennedy was inaugu
rated, one of his first problems
was what to do about the issue
which just wouldn't seem to go

away.
He called in his adviser, Gen.
Maxwell Taylor.
"Isn't there some way we can
clear up this matter once and
for all?" he asked.
"It will take a lot of intestinal
fortitude, Mr. President.
"Well, let's do it and get it
over withr"
The commitment was esca
lated and before we knew it we
had 20,000 men in the country.
Then President Johnson in
herited the problem. He called
in his advisers and said, "What's
happening out there?"
"Our policy is being gutted,"
McGeorge Bundy said. "We're
going to have to send in more
American troops."
Proof
"You see, sir," Dean Rusk said,
"the Chinese just don't believe
we have any you-know what.
We've got to do something to
prove to them we mean busi
ness."
"All right," the President said,
"we'll see who has the stomach
for this—me or Mao."
The President upped the com
mitment to 300,000 American
men.
In the meantime, while the
Americans were fighting with
Guts in the countryside, the
Guts in the cities were demon
strating against the Americans.
The U. S. Cabinet was called
into session and a re-evaluation
of the issue was made.
A Surprise
One of the President's advis
ers explained, "I know this is
going to come as a surprise to
you, sir, but Communists have
as much Guts as we do."
"What happened to our Guts?"
the President demanded.
"We still have some, but the
issue has become a political, not
a military problem."
"We've been hit below the
belt," the President said.
"Exactly, sir. That's the way
Gut people are."
