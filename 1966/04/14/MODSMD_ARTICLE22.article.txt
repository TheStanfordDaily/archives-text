# Two Minutes Of Haight
## As Campaign Circus Goes By 
### Tim Haight 
Even with the sound and the
fury of the ASSU Presidential
campaign all around us, educa
tion, more or less, goes on. And
with education go the problems
and projects that the ASSU has
set up, or is setting up this year.
With a couple of them we'd
like some help. The English De
partment is sponsoring a sur
vey of its students to determine
their attitudes toward possible
changes in the Department's
major requirements. They have
sampled student opinion by in
viting students to their meet
ings, and now they want more
detailed data on student opin
ion.
Spirit of Co-operation
The spirit of student-faculty
co-operation that this project
showed deserves a good job.
Another place where students
can put some time to good use
is the Education Commission.
Much has been said, and a lot
is expected of the group, just
now getting off the ground. Peo
ple are still needed on many of

the ten subcommittees of the
Commission.
The subcommittees include:
Philosophy of Education, Educa
tional Programs, Policy-making
structure, Residential Educa
tion, Academic Advising, Edu
cation and the Community,
Freshman Year, Undergraduate
Curriculum Evaluation, Gradu
ate Curriculum Evaluation, and
Grades and Degree Require
ments.
List of Chairmen
A list of the chairmen of these
subcommittees and their phone
numbers was in the LASSU min
utes of March 31. You can get
it from your representative, or
stop by the LASSU office and
take down the numbers.
While we're on the subject of
committees that need members,
LASSU needs some positions
filled. There are several open
ings on the Student Affairs
Committee, and posts on By-
Laws, Finance, and Judiciary.
Only LASSU members may
serve on these committees, al-

though subcommittees are open
to everybody.
Come to think of it, LASSU
has been pretty poorly attended
lately. With all the fuss, you'd
think living groups would have
the motivation to send repre
sentatives, especially as they
are overrepresented, compared
to graduate students. But it
seems to be easier to sit home
and complain than to risk dis
cussing the issues.
The ironic thing about all
these committees needing mem
bers is that there is an attitude
afoot now that, "Apathy at Stan
ford is not the fault of the stu
dents but rather of their gov
ernment." What utter nonsense.
If you have a flat tire, you fix
it. If you don't like the ASSU,
get in and change it.
But ignorance is bliss, and
this year candidates seem again
to be aiming at that state. Let
them. The rest of us can just go
on working to make some prog
ress toward a better education
and let the circus go by.
