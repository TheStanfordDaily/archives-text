# Tragedy Of Life Animated By Hope, Says Spanish Author Buero Vallejo
## 
### ARTHUR L. FISHER 
Life, considered in its totality, is
tragic. We live today in a tragic age,
one of the most tragic in history, and
yet there is no true tragedy which at
root is not animated by human hope.
Leading Spanish dramatist Antonio
Buero Vallejo proposed this theme as
the basis of tragic drama from the
Greeks to the present in a lecture
presented in Spanish at Tresidder last
night.
The dramatic tragedy describes a
conflict between necessity and liber
ty, and whatever the outcome, the
true tragedy is in fact an act of hope.
According to Buero Vallejo, the an
guish in tragedy is that man may be
conquered, balanced by the omnipres
ent hope that he will overcome.
To write tragedy is itself an act
of hope, he said, and he sees hope in
all writers including Sartre and the
Nihilists. Man as a being is hopeful,
and writers who claim to be without
hope are actually deceiving them
selves. "Man's destiny," he said, "is
not to submit to his destiny, but to
create it. Man is chained, but our
hope is that by vast effort man can
improve his spiritual condition."
Too, there is a very important as
pect of ambivalence in all human at
titudes. This is a reflection of the ten
sion between hope and despair in the

tragic sense of life and drama.
The tragedy of the modern world,
unifying the many partial tragedies,
is the gap between man's great tech
nical developments and his spiritual
and moral poverty.
Buero Vallejo mentioned Albert
Camus, Arthur Miller, Samuel Beck
ett, and Aeschylus (Prometheus
Bound) as illustrative of his thesis.
The classical Greek tragedies are
commonly misunderstood, he said, be
cause of a failure to consider the im
plications of the second and third
parts of Greek dramatic trilogies.
