# Presidential Duties Examined
## 
### BILL WERTZ Associate Editor 
(Editor's note: This is the third in a
series of articles describing the plat
forms of the eight candidates for
ASSU President.)

Don Bremme (whose name correct
ly rhymes with "semi") feels that the
student body has been offered the
same type of presidential candidate
year after year.
"These candidates," Bremme says,
"fall into the same traps every year.
The winner, after conducting a cam
paign with a lot of promises and goals,
ends up by becoming involved in the
daily "in-fighting" and quarrels with
the Legislature that arise.
This type of candidate, Bremme
feels, is unhealthy for student gov
ernment.
"The president should carry a con

siderable amount of weight when he
speaks. He should demand respect
and attention from the administra
tion at the various levels. Such a per
son who deals continually with the
administration can attain goals that
are set for him by the student body."
Solutions Slow
Problems whose solutions have been
slow in coming, Bremme feels, could
have been hastened by a president
with a persistent attitude who main
tained contact with campus opinions.
"A great many people are disgust
ed," Bremme says, "with the typical
student government-type campaigns
that are run, and with this kind of
ephemeral, innocuous president that
seems to result from these elections.
Bremme plans to make his views
known along with the approach he
will take toward different problems,
but will not become involved with
discussions of small administrative
issues.
"We are interested primarily with
life at the University, social regula
tions, contact among students, and
with the academic situation," Bremme
says.
Stone's Thesis
ASSU presidential candidate Bob
Stone feels that the office of ASSU

President is not really necessary since,
according to his campaign manager
Steve Gruber, Sandy MacKenzie has
been dead for four months.
"I work in the same office as Sandy
does," Stone said, "and since I haven't
seen him for four months, he might
indeed be dead. If he is alive, he may
have been kidnapped by Carl
Schmidt."
Stone feels, nevertheless, that the
office of ASSU President could be
made necessary, along with the entire
ASSU and the Legislature which he
said serves no useful purpose at the
present.
"I have three proposals which I
would consider musts if elected,"
"They are to take over Tresidder Un
ion, the Union store, and the Book
store. I would like to see them run
by and for students, and not for profit
or to provide a salary for often in
competent administrators. They
should ideally provide their respective
services for the most people at the
least cost."
The Flicks
Stone feels that the only thing
that the ASSU currently does that
benefits a large part of the student
body is to run the Flicks.
"During the summer the ASSU runs

all sorts of things like watermelon
feeds and other idiotic things that get
great participation because they are
things that the students really want
to do."
Stone feels that some ASSU-sup
ported organizations, like the Insti
tute of International Relations, do not
represent many students, yet receive
a disproportionate amount of ASSU
funds.
"Organizations like Ram's Head,
The Daily and the S.S.R.F. receive no
support from the ASSU, yet provide
entertainment and information for the
entire campus.
Contrary to rumors, however, Stone
would not abolish the Legislature.
"I think LASSU serves a purpose
for all those people who want to play
'the game,' " Stone said.
Stone's vice-presidential running
mate is Roble Freshman Mindy Mathi
son.
