# Women's Regulations Under LASSU Study
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
LASSU tonight will consider a bill
to hold a preference election on social
regulations. The bill will be a revised
edition of a proposal presented last
week.
The revised bill proposes more spec
ific categories than the bill it is in
teneded to substitute. The proposal
calls for an "advisory election" of the
undergraduate women about the
time for ceasing restrictions on over
nights and hours, and the conscequent
procedure for sign-outs.
Voters Choice
Women would vote on ending the
restrictions at the end of the third
quarter of the sophomore year, as
"now; at the end of the first quarter
of the sophomore year; or after the
first, second, or third quarters of the
freshman year; or no restrictions.
The sign-out procedure following
the abolishment of the restrictions
would also be on the same ballot to
be voted upon at the same time as
the ASSU presidential primary elec
tion. Voters would choose between

voluntary sign-out with no limit, vol
untary sign-out with self-imposed
time limit, both of these procedures,
required sign-out with no time limit,
and required sign-out with a self-im
posed time limit.
Straight Questions
According to co-sponsor Bobbi
Kramer, the ballot is intended to de
termine the preference of the under
graduate womn by "straight forward
questions." However, she emphasized
that the poll is not intended to con
flict with the present survey being
taken by the Social Regulations Com
mittee, but rather, "supplement it."
Other Issues
Other bills to be considered by the
Legislature include appropriations for
Scratch Sheet, totalling $850, and $520
to the Publications Board to assist the
"Journal of New African Literature."
Regular committee reports will also
be presented. One committee, investi
gating the speaker fees of the Politi
cal Union, will reveal its findings.
The meeting will be held in Room
320 Quad at 7:30.
