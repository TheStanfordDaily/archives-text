# Art Lecturer Analyzes Difficulty Of Distinguishing Guardi Brothers
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
Were there one or two Guardi?
"I have been involved in this problem
and I would like to involve you too."
Dr. Teresio Pignatti, specialist in 18th
Century Venetian painting, said last
night.
Masterpieces in landscapes and fig
ure painting were attributed to the
name Franseco Guardi, the eldest son
of the Guardi family. His father and
two brothers, Gian Antonio and Nic
olo also painted, though "not one of
the father's works remain, not even
a drawing." Gian Antonio had signed
only one painting, but a major por
tion of the figure paintings, once

attributed to his brother Francesco,
have now been transferred to his
credit.
Scholarship which questioned the
prevailing 19th century critics' im
pulse to give all credit, to Francesco
has recently come to light. Dr. Pig
natti was an initiator of this study,
which when pursued, revealed that
"something was wrong."
With slides Dr. Pignatti recreated
the research techniques that went into
this discovery. "I'll give you the possi
bility of making your own conclu
sion."
Dr. Pignatti started examing the
elements of Jian Antonio Guardi's
style from his one signed, documented
painting. He then traced the similar
ities he found between the questioned
works and the proved work of Guardi,
a painter with a "decorative person
ality."
Dr. Pignatti concluded that these
figure paintings, previously accredit
ed to his brother, were actually the
work of Jian Antonio, "the last of
the great Rococo painters." Dr. Pig
natti reviewed the landscape paintings
of Francesco and contrasted the use
of line.
Both of the painters had captured
the "sparkle of light and feeling of
atmosphere" which the Impression
ists were later to use.
