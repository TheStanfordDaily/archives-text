Shaving close really can be comfortable! The new Norelco
Speedshaver® 30 proves it. This new electric shaves you so close,
we dare to match it with a blade. Yet it shaves comfortably. No i&^SSS^k
nicks. No cuts. No irritation. Because Norelco rotary blades
stroke whiskers off. 'Floating heads' swing with every contour
of your face. And there's a pop-up trimmer for neat sideburns. JMHH
Easy 'flip-open' cleaning, too. If you want to spend a little less, - JHrM
try the Norelco 'Flip-Top' Speedshaver 20 (at right). Great com
fortable rotary blade shave. Just a few less .rimmings. So, mister,
if you've been getting a raw deal from shaving, get close with
Norelco. And make yourself comfortable!
