# Gordon Advocates Focusing On Individuals
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor (Last In a series 
"Any time you focus on a piece of paper
and not on individuals, something is wrong.
The objective of our staff is to build more
effective relationships," Associate Dean of
Students Robert Gordon told The Daily yes
terday.
With the transfer of Judicial procedures to
the ASSU jurisdiction, the Dean's office con
centrates on "understanding individuals, not
the reporting of incidents," the Dean said.
"Our emphasis is a counseling, not a judicial
one."
Symbolic of the shift of emphasis in the
Dean of Students office is the abolishment
announced in The Daily earlier this week, of
year-end personnel reports and incident re
ports.
The incident reports have been replaced

with "ad hoc counseling reports," Dean Gor
don said. "The emphasis now is not on the
what, but the why. We ask: what can bo done
to provide the best rehabilitation for the indi
vidual."
In the past, the incident reports were filed
by sponsors and RA's for rule violations and
even illness. In the new reporting system,
"the residence director, as a trained counselor,
calls our attention to a student need. We view
the new system as a form of communication
designed to help the individual."
No Evaluations
The end-of-the-year evaluation reports have
been abolished altogether. "It is not so import
ant at the far end of the year to automatically
make a report as to show throughout the year
that a relation exists between the RA and the
student." Dean Gordon said. "Our main ob
jective is to develop concern in a counseling
situation."
One of the main goals of the new Dean's

staff is "to asure that every student is under-
known by at least one person at
Stanford, whether it be sponsor, RA, residence
director, faculty adviser, or other member of
the community."
"Our job is to so coordinate our efforts that
the individual is not lost in the shuffle. All
our staff is committed to giving more than
the time demanded of them to work as advo
cates of student needs and problems," Dean
Gordon stated.
The re-evaluation of student report forms
was the work of the Dean's office working
with the cooperation of a student committee
headed by ASSU Vice President Clark Brown.
"The student work was systematic and ob
jective," Gordon reported. "The re-evaluation
was a beautiful example of what happens
when students and administrators get to
gether. The groups in the university commun
ity need more than knowledge of what the
other groups are doing. They need under

standing and this only comes from face-to
face contact."
The Dean frowns on "getting together just
to get together. There must be a locus of
concern ,a specific problem to be resolved."
Dean's Concern
The locus of the Dean's concern "are student
concerns. And because we are dealing with
student services, we include the thinking and
points of view of students in all of our policy
formulations," he said. All the committees of
the Residential Education Commission, for
example are made up largely of students, he
added.
Not all the details of the new policy on
student evaluation and counseling forms have
been worked out. As a result, Dean Gordon
has appointed an ad hoc committee "to make
the policy statement."
The committee includes Clark Brown and
the students on his committee: sponsors Alice
Jo Amis and Howard Graves, and RA's Bar

bara Vance and Tom Bachman; residence di
rectors Sally Mahoney of Roble and William
Blevins of Stern; John Black, head of the
Counseling and Testing Service; Maurice Os
bourne, Executive Director of the Health
Service; and Deans Gordon, Jean Hinds, and
Douglas Davis.
In addition, Dean Gordon intends to form a
"permanent structure, involving wide student
participation, to continually examine critic
ally the needs of individuals."
Locate Needs
"Students can help us to locate needs and
problems," he said. "We are at the dawn of a
day when much is being done to eliminate
overlappings, voids, and faulty processes in
counseling programs for students."
"We see our task," he continued, "as the
identification of the student's problem and the
directing of him to the best resource for help.
We must focus on the individual, or lose the
key to higher education."
"Any time you focus on a piece of paper

student services, we include the thinking and
points of view of students in all of our policy
formulations," he said. All the committees of
the Residential Education Commission, for
example are made up largely of students, he
added.
Not all the details of the new policy on
student evaluation and counseling forms have
been worked out. As a result, Dean Gordon
has appointed an ad hoc committee "to make
the policy statement."
The committee includes Clark Brown and
the students on his committee: sponsors Alice
Jo Amis and Howard Graves, and RA's Bar

bara Vance and Tom Bachman; residence di
rectors Sally Mahoney of Roble and William
Blevins of Stern; John Black, head of the
Counseling and Testing Service; Maurice Os
bourne, Executive Director of the Health
Service; and Deans Gordon, Jean Hinds, and
Douglas Davis.
In addition, Dean Gordon intends to form a
"permanent structure, involving wide student
participation, to continually examine critic
ally the needs of individuals."
Locate Needs
"Students can help us to locate needs and
problems," he said. "We are at the dawn of a
day when much is being done to eliminate
overlappings, voids, and faulty processes in
counseling programs for students."
"We see our task," he continued, "as the
identification of the student's problem and the
directing of him to the best resource for help.
We must focus on the individual, or lose the
key to higher education."
"Any time you focus on a piece of paper
and not on individuals, something is wrong.
The objective of our staff is to build more
effective relationships," Associate Dean of
Students Robert Gordon told The Daily yes
terday.
With the transfer of Judicial procedures to
the ASSU jurisdiction, the Dean's office con
centrates on "understanding individuals, not
the reporting of incidents," the Dean said.
"Our emphasis is a counseling, not a judicial
one."
Symbolic of the shift of emphasis in the
Dean of Students office is the abolishment
announced in The Daily earlier this week, of
year-end personnel reports and incident re
ports.
The incident reports have been replaced

with "ad hoc counseling reports," Dean Gor
don said. "The emphasis now is not on the
what, but the why. We ask: what can bo done
to provide the best rehabilitation for the indi
vidual."
In the past, the incident reports were filed
by sponsors and RA's for rule violations and
even illness. In the new reporting system,
"the residence director, as a trained counselor,
calls our attention to a student need. We view
the new system as a form of communication
designed to help the individual."
No Evaluations
The end-of-the-year evaluation reports have
been abolished altogether. "It is not so import
ant at the far end of the year to automatically
make a report as to show throughout the year
that a relation exists between the RA and the
student." Dean Gordon said. "Our main ob
jective is to develop concern in a counseling
situation."
One of the main goals of the new Dean's

staff is "to asure that every student is under-
known by at least one person at
Stanford, whether it be sponsor, RA, residence
director, faculty adviser, or other member of
the community."
"Our job is to so coordinate our efforts that
the individual is not lost in the shuffle. All
our staff is committed to giving more than
the time demanded of them to work as advo
cates of student needs and problems," Dean
Gordon stated.
The re-evaluation of student report forms
was the work of the Dean's office working
with the cooperation of a student committee
headed by ASSU Vice President Clark Brown.
"The student work was systematic and ob
jective," Gordon reported. "The re-evaluation
was a beautiful example of what happens
when students and administrators get to
gether. The groups in the university commun
ity need more than knowledge of what the
other groups are doing. They need under

standing and this only comes from face-to
face contact."
The Dean frowns on "getting together just
to get together. There must be a locus of
concern ,a specific problem to be resolved."
Dean's Concern
The locus of the Dean's concern "are student
concerns. And because we are dealing with
student services, we include the thinking and
points of view of students in all of our policy
formulations," he said. All the committees of
the Residential Education Commission, for
