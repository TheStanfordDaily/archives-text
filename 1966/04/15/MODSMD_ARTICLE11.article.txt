# Regs Poll Approved In LASSU
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
The attitudes of Stanford women
toward social regulations will be as
sessed in a poll approved by LASSU
last night. The advisory questionnaire
will be presented on the primary elec
tion ballots.
Women will be polled as to when
unlimited hours and overnights
should begin. Alternatives are gradu
ates, third quarter sophomores, first
quarter sophomores, third quarter
freshmen, second quarter freshmen,
first quarter freshmen, and no re
strictions.
No Longer Considered
Various sign-out procedures after
restrictions have ceased also to be
considered are voluntary sign-out
with no time limit, voluntary sign
out with optional self-imposed time
limit, both of the above, required
sign-out with no time limit, or re
quired sign-out with self-imposed
time limit.
Queried as to the usefulness of the
poll, Speaker Jay Kadane explained
that if there is a definite trend that
expresses the desire of Stanford wom
en for reform in social regulations,
it will be brought before the legisla
ture's attention for consideration.
The legislature also voted to express
its dissatisfaction with speakers bu
reaus, following a complaint by Carl
Anderson that an "exorbitant" fee
of $1500 was paid to Senator Albert
Gore for his recent appearance here,
sponsored by the Political Union.
Limited Funds
The bill passed questions the use
of such bureaus because "funds for
political programs on college cam
puses are limited" and"it is the duty
of public officials to inform students
on issues of national concern."
The resolution instructs the Presi
dent of the ASSU to write letters to
Senator Gore, the Senate Ethics Com
mittee, and the National Student As
sociation "outlining our grievances."
In other action, LASSU:
• Approved the appointment of
Tim Haight to the Rules Committee.
• Appropriated $850 from the
LASSU Contingency Fund to the
ASSU Scratch Sheet for publication
of the 1966 Scratch Sheet and $520 to
the Publications Board Assistance
Fund for the Journal of New African
Literature.
• Approved the appointment of the
Education Committee and Union
Board.
Rules Overruled
The legislature also overruled the
decision of the Rules Committee to
remove the name of Nancy Ann Cof
fey from the ballot for Senior Class
Vice-President. Miss Coffey did not
have the requisite number of units
for senior status, but will be allowed
to run anyway.
Commented graduate student rep
resentative Tom Forstenzer, "The
resolution just passed applies to the
idiosyncratic nature of the legislature
and nothing else."
