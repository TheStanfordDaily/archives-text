The Interdisciplinary Compu
ter Symposium, which features
authorities from various fields
discussing the effect of compu
ters on their studies, runs all day
tomorrow in Cubbeiiey Auditori
um, beginning at 9 a. m.
According to Prof. James An
gell of Electrical Engineering,
one of the heads of the program,
its purpose is "to catalyze cross
discipline communication." It is
not a professional conference of

serve as "a basis for interac
tion."
"It is our hope that this sym
posium will serve to bring to
gether different chunks of the

University," Angell said.
The schedule is given below.
Tickets are available free at the
