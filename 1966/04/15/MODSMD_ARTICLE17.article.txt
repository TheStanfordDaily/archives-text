THEATER
The Stanford Repertory Theatre concludes its production of
Shakespeare's ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL this weekend
all's well that ends tomorrow. The Comedia Repertory Theatre, in
Palo Alto, will present SOUTH PACIFIC Friday and Saturday
nights at 8:30 and a Sunday matinee through April. George Ber
nard Shaw's comedy, ARMS AND THE MAN, plays during the
weekends at the Playhouse (Beach and Hyde Streets, S.F.) Also at
the Playhouse, Jean Genet's THE BLACKS continues for two more
performances this and next Sunday afternoon.
FILMS
Friday night at Tresidder will pit Cary Grant, intermittently
seducing Grace Kelly, against a mysterious jewel thief who plager
izes the style he used before hp turned straight. Director Alfred
Hitchcock tosses in the occasional complication to make an enter
taining who-duh-done-it. Oh yes, the name of the movie: TO CATCH
A THIEF.
I VITELLONI, directed by Fedrico Fellini and starring Franco
Fabrizi, will play tomorrow evening at Tresidder. Winner of the
Best Foreign Film of Year, "Vitelloni" is the story of Italy's mod
ern youth, shunning jobs and supported by money from parents
and friends, who get their kicks in hot pursuit of physical pleasures
and such.
PSYCHO will be at the Sunday Flicks. Starring Tony Perkins
and Janet Leigh, this is one of the all time greats of the spooky
stiffs and gastly-gobblin horrors.
Two of Alec Guiness's great movies are playing this week around
the neighborhood. At the Bijou, paired with THE SILENCERS (see
review on this page) which someone must have had a grudge
against the world in thinking to disprove the adage that the book
is always better than the flick, is Alec Guiness in his hilarious
role as OUR MAN IN HAVANA co-starring Ernie Kovacs. Alec,
this time with William Holden, is also featured in one of the most
brutal of war film classics, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Its
co-feature, RIDE THE WILD SURF, got wiped out trying to hang
ten in the tricky currents around the Tivoli in San Carlos.
OUR MAN FLINT and DR. STRANGELOVE are still playing
at the Bel Art in Belmont and if you haven't seen either of these,
you're still rolling hoops and playing jacks and hop-skotch with
the kids down in the ally behind Kronigan's Fish Market .... I
mean, like they're enlightening, man.
Another good double-header is playing at the Varsity. Although
movies that should not be precedent in anyone's datebook, THE
GROUP, from Mary McCarthy's best seller of the same name, and
WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT?, from Woody Allen's screen play of
the same name, starring Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole, and .... yes,
Ursula's in this one .... are both entertaining and sure to cure
the approaching-mid-quarter reds.
CONCERTS
When spring is here, to the concerts we go. THE STANFORD
SYMPATHY ORCHESTRA, featuring student conductors, will per
form at 8:30 tonight in Dinkelspiel .Also at Dink, chamber music
will be played at 3:30 Sunday. Monday night will be highlighted
by a performance from pianist, Gina Bachauer, and the OAKLAND
SYMPHONY at 8:30 in Mem Aud.

will be played at 3:30 Sunday. Monday night will be highlighted
by a performance from pianist, Gina Bachauer, and the OAKLAND
SYMPHONY at 8:30 in Mem Aud.
THEATER
The Stanford Repertory Theatre concludes its production of
Shakespeare's ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL this weekend
all's well that ends tomorrow. The Comedia Repertory Theatre, in
Palo Alto, will present SOUTH PACIFIC Friday and Saturday
nights at 8:30 and a Sunday matinee through April. George Ber
nard Shaw's comedy, ARMS AND THE MAN, plays during the
weekends at the Playhouse (Beach and Hyde Streets, S.F.) Also at
the Playhouse, Jean Genet's THE BLACKS continues for two more
performances this and next Sunday afternoon.
FILMS
Friday night at Tresidder will pit Cary Grant, intermittently
seducing Grace Kelly, against a mysterious jewel thief who plager
izes the style he used before hp turned straight. Director Alfred
Hitchcock tosses in the occasional complication to make an enter
taining who-duh-done-it. Oh yes, the name of the movie: TO CATCH
A THIEF.
I VITELLONI, directed by Fedrico Fellini and starring Franco
Fabrizi, will play tomorrow evening at Tresidder. Winner of the
Best Foreign Film of Year, "Vitelloni" is the story of Italy's mod
ern youth, shunning jobs and supported by money from parents
and friends, who get their kicks in hot pursuit of physical pleasures
and such.
PSYCHO will be at the Sunday Flicks. Starring Tony Perkins
and Janet Leigh, this is one of the all time greats of the spooky
stiffs and gastly-gobblin horrors.
Two of Alec Guiness's great movies are playing this week around
the neighborhood. At the Bijou, paired with THE SILENCERS (see
review on this page) which someone must have had a grudge
against the world in thinking to disprove the adage that the book
is always better than the flick, is Alec Guiness in his hilarious
role as OUR MAN IN HAVANA co-starring Ernie Kovacs. Alec,
this time with William Holden, is also featured in one of the most
brutal of war film classics, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Its
co-feature, RIDE THE WILD SURF, got wiped out trying to hang
ten in the tricky currents around the Tivoli in San Carlos.
OUR MAN FLINT and DR. STRANGELOVE are still playing
at the Bel Art in Belmont and if you haven't seen either of these,
you're still rolling hoops and playing jacks and hop-skotch with
the kids down in the ally behind Kronigan's Fish Market .... I
mean, like they're enlightening, man.
Another good double-header is playing at the Varsity. Although
movies that should not be precedent in anyone's datebook, THE
GROUP, from Mary McCarthy's best seller of the same name, and
WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT?, from Woody Allen's screen play of
the same name, starring Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole, and .... yes,
Ursula's in this one .... are both entertaining and sure to cure
the approaching-mid-quarter reds.
CONCERTS
When spring is here, to the concerts we go. THE STANFORD
SYMPATHY ORCHESTRA, featuring student conductors, will per
form at 8:30 tonight in Dinkelspiel .Also at Dink, chamber music
will be played at 3:30 Sunday. Monday night will be highlighted
by a performance from pianist, Gina Bachauer, and the OAKLAND
SYMPHONY at 8:30 in Mem Aud.
