# 'The Silencers': Strictly 'Bush'
## 
### LARRY BIEHL 
Sex for sex's sake—a trend
which is responsible for James
Bond's Pussy Galore, Our Man
Flint's "pleasure unit", and now,
Matt Helm's Lovey Kravezit is
manifested in all its unveiled
splendor in "The Silencers." Due
to an evident over abundance of
voluptuous female spies in our
nation's movie lots today, it ap
pears that many have been
forced to drastically competitive
measures, hoping that movie
goers everywhere are staunch
observers of the old adage:
everybody loves a lover — pro
viding her statistics adhere to a
respectable numerical progres
sion which she is darling enough
to exhibit. Indeed, these "dras
tically competitive measures"
are adopted in "The Silencers"
in a vain attempt to elevate a
plot which dips well below the
standard A,B,C,D, rating.
Early in the picture, one is
aware that the director admits

his failure; for the credits are
rapidly flashed against the un
dulating abdomens of a series of
strip-teasers, successfully draw
ing the audience's attention
away from who is responsible to
what they're responsible for!
This Burlesque-type atmosphere
soon assumes Brothel-like di
mensions when we are taken to
the home of I.C.E.'s (Intercon
tinental Espionage) master
agent, Matt Helm (Dean Mar
tin).
Bed, Booze, and Broads
In a scene which drew raves
from "Playboy" and "Popular
Mechanics" alike, a fine blend
of scientific mechanization (a
bed which rotates 360°, travels
the length of Helm's bedroom,
and tilts to let its master sleepi
ly slide into a bubble bath) and
raw sex (Lovey Kravezit, Helm's
bubbly help-mate) sets a tone
which will prevail throughout
the picture. Immediately the
images of bed, booze, and broads
engrain themselves indullibly in

the viewer's mind as cogent sym
bols of secret agent society.
Unlike Spectre, Smersh
Basically, the reworked "Our
Man Flint" plot embodies a
playboy secret agent, doubling
as a photographer (Dean Mar
tin), who 4s called to fill a va
cancy, caused by the naturally
high turn-over of secret agents,
for the purpose of overthrowing
the Big "O", an organization not
unlike Spectre, Smersh, etc.,
planning to spread a toxic cloud
of radiation over Marlboro
Country by igniting an under

ground bomb. This will then
lead to an international nuclear
holocaust as each nation blames
the other, leaving the Big "O"
safe in their underground con
trol center to rule the world.
Suspense and seduction
awaits Helm at every turn; yet
the viewer soon learns that
Helm, through his wooing of
comrades and enemies alike, is
nothing but an unprincipled
boor more intent on uncovering
the many women in his life than
any international plot. A meas
ure of Intrigue develops as a
Big "O" agent (Stella Stevens)
turns to 1.C.E.; but this is coun
teracted by the defection of
beautiful and bountiful I.C.E.
agent who becomes known in
the Big "O" organization as
Cowboy (Dali Lavi).
Twixt Bumpers Reinforced
Minimal intertst is aroused
for the first time, during the
auto chase through Arizona as
two enemy-driven cars, black of
course, attempt to catch and
crush Helm's customed-Mercury
Stationwagon twixt their rein
forced bumpers. Instead of re
sorting to oil slicks, machine
guns, and injection seat, Helm
employs his auto's functionary
equipment-bed and bar, which
he proves is an equally effective
means to succomb enemy agents
(as Stella Stevens can attest).
The cast is adequately selected.
Arthur O'Connel, a graduate of
Elvis Presly features; Stella
Stevens, scarcely dressed from
her recent romp through Play
boy Magazine; and Dean Martin,
bolstering his rather nauseous
image of doing better at the bar
than at the box office, are ex
emplary of Columbia's bed-rid
den talent.
However, honor must be
awarded the wardrobe depart
ment for their frugality and
thus gallant attempt to save
"The Silencers" from financial
disaster.
