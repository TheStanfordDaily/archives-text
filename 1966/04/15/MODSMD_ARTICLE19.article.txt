# ‘Harper’ Is A Bloody Saint
## 
### DAVID NYBERG 
Paul Newman's performance
in "Harper" is the same kind of
arriding surprise as Lee Mar
vin's in "Cat Ballou." As Hud
and the hustler, Newman por
trayed characters from the hard,
cool inside, taking seriously the
fact that he was the only one of
his kind and believing that he
had to act alone and against the
others to make any sense out of
his time and his place. As Har
per, however, he has learned an
other way.
The most important difference
lies in the caviling and capricious
laughter that comes from so
many different attitudes, situa
tions and paradoxes which he
and the audience happen by—and
it is the passive sense of "hap
pening by" that is most appro
priate in describing the move
ment or the action of the film
and the changes in characters
as they become more securely
tangled and more out of breath
with each prancing s^ene.
Minced and Mingled End
Harper is a private detective
who is hired to find a missing ty
coon who is despised by every
one. The opening scene is a word
less but sufficient evincing of
why the job is important to him
at the beginning; and through a
subtle blending of music and
noise as Harper leaves his of
fice, it is an advertent to the
minced and mingled end of the
film.
The director, Jack Smight, ap
proaches the grace and humor
of Tony Richardson's "Tom
Jones" in his pacing and cutting
scenes. He was able to lead his
audience through a loose and in
curably bizarre story line by
coaxing out the best of New
man's gestures with such tim
ing that those who caught and
appreciated them found them
selves laughing and loving it in
the middle of the next scene
which often was not at all laugh
able. Finding yourself smiling
(and wishing you were more like
Newman) while he is having his
kidneys mashed, or slashing a
"fish-eyed fagot's" forehead with

a file is a powerful and deft ma
nipulation that Smight controls
as few directors can.
It is probably true that this
film would not have been made
if the James Bond series had not
been a success, for "Harper" is
the inevitable, caustic poker that
eliminates the fantasy, sullies
the glamour, and expands the
function of comedy into sober
thoughts about what can be
taken seriously. Smight could not
have chosen a better setting for
his film than Los Angeles.
A Blemish Come to Life
The dexterity with which the
ruse of taking things seriously
is handled in this film is a com
pliment to the audience. There
is a series of relief scenes inter
rupting the progress of the plot
whenever it begins to get really
involved (Newman makes a
phone call from a restroom to
his estranged wife, disguising his
voice with a mouthful of toilet
paper—only to give Janet Leigh
the chance to deliver a beautiful
but extraneous line; he stops at
a filling station —only to give us
a change to laugh at the attend
ant's enunciation of how to get
to the "ochin"; he gives a classic
description of a woman, "a blem
ish come to life," "...like cud
dling up with a fungus," in forc
ing a man whom he wishes to
protect into an admission of his
part in a crime.
No Sting
There is a slow spiraling of
values or standards that New
man holds, from the abstract to
relative to transcient to spur
rious, which comes down to a
fuzzy, confusing, senselessness
at the end. This loss is patterned
and complimented by a gradu
ally slowing motion, straining
humor, dying dialogue and over
welming fatigue. There are four
deaths, shown in such a way that
the last, a murdered man
cramped in a pile of filthy toilet
(his first appearance in the
film) is perceived bluntly, with
no sting.
No Conclusion
What appears to be uninten
tionally poor acting by several

of the supporting characters
loses its offensiveness as New
man laughs at them for us, as
he laughs at himself and at the
improbability of "Harper" re
solving in a conclusion.
In the final scene with Arthur
Hill (as the lawyer and Harper's
only friend) comes the parody of
a Perry Mason ending, the de
noument, but this is only prepa
ration for the surrender to com
plexity which comes of opposites
reversed and beleaguringly iden
tical.
