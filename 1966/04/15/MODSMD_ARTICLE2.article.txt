• China Exchange Possible
WASHINGTON—State Department
press officer Robert J. McCloskey
said yesterday that "the United States
is prepared to permit American uni
versities to invite Chinese scientists
and scholars to visit those universi
ties," and"the Chinese Communists
have been advised of this."
He said also he knows of no Peking
response. As for Nationalist China,
he said the matter has been discussed
with this U.S. ally. He did not give
the Nationalist reaction.
While the United States does not
recognize the Peking government, it
holds periodic ambassadorial talks at

this channel to outline its new policy
on visits by scientists and scholars.
