## 
### 
The two best tennis teams in

to wreak havoc with any team
that dares to stand in its way.

Friday and UCLA on Saturday.

the Trojans and 9-0 by UCLA.
The Indians will be lucky to
win that one match this week
end.
UCLA Defending: Champ
UCLA is the defending na

tional champ while USC came
in sixth last year. This year,
after USC defeated the Bruins
last Saturday, the Tro
jans are picked to finish in that
number one spot with the
Bruins right behind them.
Stanford tied for third with
Cal in the NCAA tourney last
year and could make another
strong finish this year. How
ever, the Indians are still not
anywhere near the calibre of
the two southern California
powers.
The Bruins ,who are 6-2 on
the season, are led by lan Crock
endon, Jeff Brown, nonchalant

Eltey Brown, and dynamic
Charlie Pasarell. Pasarell, who
is from San Juan, Puerto Rico
is considered as one of the top
five amateur tennis players in
the world.
use Is Loaded
To list the stars on USC's
squad would be to list the en
tire team which consists of Stan
Smith, Tom Edlefsen, Jerry
Cromwell, Horace Ritter, Jim
Hobson, and Dave Raney.
Although USC suffered one
defeat to Stanford's Jim Beste
two weeks ago, they will prob
ably be swift personnel to save
the white-wash. Beste beat
Cromwell in their first meeting
but likely will meet Edlefsen
today.
