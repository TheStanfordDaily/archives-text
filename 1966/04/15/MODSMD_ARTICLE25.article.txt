# Frosh Meets JC In Track
## Daily Sports 
### JIM WHITEHEAD 
The Frosh track team seeks
its fourth straight victory this
afternoon against Reedley Ju
nior College at 4:00 on Angell
Field.
Coach Jerry Barland's Stanford
Frosh team ranks among the
best in the nation. Led by Pat
Morrison, British sprint cham
pion, the frosh thinclads have
tied or broken several Univer
sity marks already this season
and promise more of the same.
Morrison's 9.7 in the 100 tied
the old freshman record set by
Larry Questad in 1962 and
equalled by Roger Cox in 1965.
His 21.2 in the 220 set a new
freshman record, eclipsing Que
stad's old mark of 21.3.
Boyce Jumps 6 10%
Other outstanding perform
ances have been turned in by
Peter Boyce and Tom Kommers.
Boyce, who lives in Melbourne,
Australia, high jumped 6'10%"
against San Jose State to set a
new frosh and school record.
Kommers turned a fast 38.6 in
the 330 intermediate hurdles,
only one-tenth off Greg Ford's
1964 freshman record, and ran
with Bob Bacon, Dan Woodruff,
and Morrison on the record
breaking 440 relay team. Their
time of 41.4 lowered the old
mark by two-tenths of a second.
Ryan Strong in Mile
In the distance events the
Frosh are similarly strong. Mike
Ryan, who last year ran a 4:09.5
mile for nearby Wilcox High
School, is the outstanding pros
pect in that event. Half-mile hon
ors belong to Mike Donley, who
has an excellent time of 1:54.5.
Although Mike will pass up his
specialty in today's meet, he is
scheduled to run on the mile re
lay team with Morrison, Kom
mers, and Woodruff.
Woodruff will be a busy man
this afternoon, running in both
relays and the 440 yard dash.
Other leading participants this
afternoon include A 1 Sanford in
the mile, Scott Smith and Bob
Feduniak in the weight events,
Greg Williams in the broad
jump, Mike Lemons in the pole
vault, and Kearney Buskirk in
the triple jump.
