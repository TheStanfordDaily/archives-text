# INDIANS HOPE FOR TRACK UPSET
## Cards Host ‘Loaded’ UCLA 
### BOB EGELKO 
The UCLA Bruins, probably the nation's finest college track
team, and the undefeated Stanford Indians face each other here
tomorrow. The result may be some of the finest performances
in the history of Stanford Stadium. First running event, the 440

relay, is scheduled for 1:30.
Recognizing the Bruin's indi

vidual stars and awesome depth,
the national Track <fc Field News
selected them as likely NCAA
champions before the season
started, and last week the Los
Angeles Times picked them by
nearly thirty points over de
fending national co-champion
use.
But first UCLA must get by
Stanford, and the Cards have
the potential to make it diffi
cult. Running at home before
a large crowd, with the added
incentive of the Bruins' lefty
ranking, Stanford could cut
deeply into the margin of about
25 points that Coach Payton
Jordan, figures the visitors have
"on paper."
Duel In Sprints
The focus will be on individ
ual duels, notably the sprints
between UCLA sophomore
Norm Jackson and Stanford's
Larry Questad. Jackson has the
season's best times in both the
100 (9.4) and the 220 (20.6),
but Questad (9.6, 21.1) has done
equally well in past years and
may be ready to upset his less
experienced opponent.
The tipoff may come in the
opening relay, anchored by
Questad and Jackson. Stanford
has run the distance in a con
ference leading 40.5, UCLA in
40.8.
An imposing corps of Bruin
distance runners is led by NCAA
mile champion Bob Day, who
holds the conference's best
mark in the mile (3:58.4) and
the two-mile (8:37.4). Backing
him will be Geoff Pyne (4:05.1,
8:47,2) and George Holterer
(4:06.2, 9:01.1). All can double
if necessary.
Hopes Run With Deubner
The task of breaking up the
Bruin monopoly will fall to
Dave Deubner (4:09, 9:14.0).

A strong, experienced runner
Deubner is capable of much
faster times; last year he ran
4:03.3 finishing second to Day
in the AAWU meet. He will try
the longer double this week
instead of this customary mile
and 880, where UCLA is loaded
as well.
A 17-foot pole vault could well
come out of the duel between
Stanford's Jim Eshelman and
Chuck Smith and UCLA's Marc
Savage. Eshelman, a consistent
16-footer, and Smith, who may
be ready to clear that height
as well, will need their top
efforts to have a chance against
Savage, a left-handed sopho
more who has done 16-8 and is
one of the steadier performers
in one of the least predictable
of events.
UCLA: Few Weaknesses
Unfortunately for a Stanford
team which has survived on
depth this year, the Bruins ap
pear to have few weaknesses.
The most probable Indian vic
tory is in the long jump, where
Bud Walsh has the AAWU's
best mark, 24-4. But Walsh, last
week's outstanding field athlete

in a writers' poll, is in for a
rough day in the hurdles, where
the Bruins have a 14.1 man in
Ron Copeland and a 52.3 inter
mediate hurdler in New Zea
lander Roger Johnson.
AAU champion Bob Stoecker
should win the discus, since no
Bruin has yet exceeded 180 feet,
but UCLA is set in the other
field events, with a 60-foot shot
putter, three 233-foot-plus men,
led by Norway's Egil Sundbye,
in the javelin, a 6-9 high jumper
and a 48-foot-plus triple jumper.
Another highlight should be
the 440 duel between Bruin Bob
Frey (47.1) and Stanford's Jim
Ward (47.3, with a relay leg of
about a second faster). Sopho
more Ward will also anchor the
mile relay team against a Bruin
quartet which has the second
best time in the conference.
Hopes For Upsets
Other Cards with a chance for
an upset appear to be George
Porter, who looks to be regain
ing his last year's form in the
javelin, and Art Miller, who is
capable of improving on his
season's best of 46-1 in the triple
jump.

the Bruins have a 14.1 man in
Ron Copeland and a 52.3 inter
mediate hurdler in New Zea
lander Roger Johnson.
AAU champion Bob Stoecker
should win the discus, since no
Bruin has yet exceeded 180 feet,
but UCLA is set in the other
field events, with a 60-foot shot
putter, three 233-foot-plus men,
led by Norway's Egil Sundbye,
in the javelin, a 6-9 high jumper
and a 48-foot-plus triple jumper.
Another highlight should be
the 440 duel between Bruin Bob
Frey (47.1) and Stanford's Jim
Ward (47.3, with a relay leg of
about a second faster). Sopho
more Ward will also anchor the
mile relay team against a Bruin
quartet which has the second
best time in the conference.
Hopes For Upsets
Other Cards with a chance for
an upset appear to be George
Porter, who looks to be regain
ing his last year's form in the
javelin, and Art Miller, who is
capable of improving on his
season's best of 46-1 in the triple
jump.


STANFORD VAVLTER CHUCK SMITH
The UCLA Bruins, probably the nation's finest college track
team, and the undefeated Stanford Indians face each other here
tomorrow. The result may be some of the finest performances
in the history of Stanford Stadium. First running event, the 440

relay, is scheduled for 1:30.
Recognizing the Bruin's indi

vidual stars and awesome depth,
the national Track <fc Field News
selected them as likely NCAA
champions before the season
started, and last week the Los
Angeles Times picked them by
nearly thirty points over de
fending national co-champion
use.
But first UCLA must get by
Stanford, and the Cards have
the potential to make it diffi
cult. Running at home before
a large crowd, with the added
incentive of the Bruins' lefty
ranking, Stanford could cut
deeply into the margin of about
25 points that Coach Payton
Jordan, figures the visitors have
"on paper."
Duel In Sprints
The focus will be on individ
ual duels, notably the sprints
between UCLA sophomore
Norm Jackson and Stanford's
Larry Questad. Jackson has the
season's best times in both the
100 (9.4) and the 220 (20.6),
but Questad (9.6, 21.1) has done
equally well in past years and
may be ready to upset his less
experienced opponent.
The tipoff may come in the
opening relay, anchored by
Questad and Jackson. Stanford
has run the distance in a con
ference leading 40.5, UCLA in
40.8.
An imposing corps of Bruin
distance runners is led by NCAA
mile champion Bob Day, who
holds the conference's best
mark in the mile (3:58.4) and
the two-mile (8:37.4). Backing
him will be Geoff Pyne (4:05.1,
8:47,2) and George Holterer
(4:06.2, 9:01.1). All can double
if necessary.
Hopes Run With Deubner
The task of breaking up the
Bruin monopoly will fall to
Dave Deubner (4:09, 9:14.0).

A strong, experienced runner
Deubner is capable of much
faster times; last year he ran
4:03.3 finishing second to Day
in the AAWU meet. He will try
the longer double this week
instead of this customary mile
and 880, where UCLA is loaded
as well.
A 17-foot pole vault could well
come out of the duel between
Stanford's Jim Eshelman and
Chuck Smith and UCLA's Marc
Savage. Eshelman, a consistent
16-footer, and Smith, who may
be ready to clear that height
as well, will need their top
efforts to have a chance against
Savage, a left-handed sopho
more who has done 16-8 and is
one of the steadier performers
in one of the least predictable
of events.
UCLA: Few Weaknesses
Unfortunately for a Stanford
team which has survived on
depth this year, the Bruins ap
pear to have few weaknesses.
The most probable Indian vic
tory is in the long jump, where
Bud Walsh has the AAWU's
best mark, 24-4. But Walsh, last
week's outstanding field athlete

in a writers' poll, is in for a
rough day in the hurdles, where
the Bruins have a 14.1 man in
Ron Copeland and a 52.3 inter

Deubner is capable of much
faster times; last year he ran
4:03.3 finishing second to Day
in the AAWU meet. He will try
the longer double this week
instead of this customary mile
and 880, where UCLA is loaded
as well.
A 17-foot pole vault could well
come out of the duel between
Stanford's Jim Eshelman and
Chuck Smith and UCLA's Marc
Savage. Eshelman, a consistent
16-footer, and Smith, who may
be ready to clear that height
as well, will need their top
efforts to have a chance against
Savage, a left-handed sopho
more who has done 16-8 and is
one of the steadier performers
in one of the least predictable
of events.
UCLA: Few Weaknesses
Unfortunately for a Stanford
team which has survived on
depth this year, the Bruins ap
pear to have few weaknesses.
The most probable Indian vic
tory is in the long jump, where
Bud Walsh has the AAWU's
best mark, 24-4. But Walsh, last
week's outstanding field athlete

in a writers' poll, is in for a
rough day in the hurdles, where
the Bruins have a 14.1 man in
Ron Copeland and a 52.3 inter
mediate hurdler in New Zea
lander Roger Johnson.
AAU champion Bob Stoecker
should win the discus, since no
Bruin has yet exceeded 180 feet,
but UCLA is set in the other
field events, with a 60-foot shot
putter, three 233-foot-plus men,
led by Norway's Egil Sundbye,
in the javelin, a 6-9 high jumper
and a 48-foot-plus triple jumper.
Another highlight should be
the 440 duel between Bruin Bob
Frey (47.1) and Stanford's Jim
Ward (47.3, with a relay leg of
about a second faster). Sopho
more Ward will also anchor the
mile relay team against a Bruin
quartet which has the second
best time in the conference.
Hopes For Upsets
Other Cards with a chance for
an upset appear to be George
Porter, who looks to be regain
ing his last year's form in the
javelin, and Art Miller, who is
capable of improving on his
season's best of 46-1 in the triple
jump.


STANFORD VAVLTER CHUCK SMITH
The UCLA Bruins, probably the nation's finest college track
team, and the undefeated Stanford Indians face each other here
tomorrow. The result may be some of the finest performances
in the history of Stanford Stadium. First running event, the 440

relay, is scheduled for 1:30.
Recognizing the Bruin's indi

vidual stars and awesome depth,
the national Track <fc Field News
selected them as likely NCAA
champions before the season
started, and last week the Los
Angeles Times picked them by
nearly thirty points over de
fending national co-champion
use.
But first UCLA must get by
Stanford, and the Cards have
the potential to make it diffi
cult. Running at home before
a large crowd, with the added
incentive of the Bruins' lefty
ranking, Stanford could cut
deeply into the margin of about
25 points that Coach Payton
Jordan, figures the visitors have
"on paper."
Duel In Sprints
The focus will be on individ
ual duels, notably the sprints
between UCLA sophomore
Norm Jackson and Stanford's
Larry Questad. Jackson has the
season's best times in both the
100 (9.4) and the 220 (20.6),
but Questad (9.6, 21.1) has done
equally well in past years and
may be ready to upset his less
experienced opponent.
The tipoff may come in the
opening relay, anchored by
Questad and Jackson. Stanford
has run the distance in a con
ference leading 40.5, UCLA in
40.8.
An imposing corps of Bruin
distance runners is led by NCAA
mile champion Bob Day, who
holds the conference's best
mark in the mile (3:58.4) and
the two-mile (8:37.4). Backing
him will be Geoff Pyne (4:05.1,
8:47,2) and George Holterer
(4:06.2, 9:01.1). All can double
if necessary.
Hopes Run With Deubner
The task of breaking up the
Bruin monopoly will fall to
Dave Deubner (4:09, 9:14.0).

A strong, experienced runner
Deubner is capable of much
faster times; last year he ran
4:03.3 finishing second to Day
in the AAWU meet. He will try
