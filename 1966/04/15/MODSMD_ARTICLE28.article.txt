# Stanford Meets Bears For Lacrosse Trophy
## 
### 
Tribal warfare will commence
on the University of California
campus in Berkeley tomorrow
at 1:30 when the Stanford In
dians meet the California Tribe
in the old Indian game of la
crosse.
Today's game is the first in
the annual 2-game series for the
Abercrombie and Fitch "Broken
Stick" Trophy. Should each
team win one game, the winner
is determined by the total com
bined scoring for the series.
California swept the series last
year, taking the first game in a

thrilling 9-7 overtime victory.
They won the second outing 5-3.
Based on League play thus far
in the season, both teams appear
very evenly matched. Both beat

San Francisco Lacrosse Club by
comfortable margins. Both lost
their first game with the power
ful Palo Alto Lacrosse Club by
seven points, and both beat the
Peacock Gap Club by one point.
All of which promises a close
battle.
