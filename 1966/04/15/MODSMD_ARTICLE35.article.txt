## Our Residence U's Digestive Problem 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Stern food service charges
$200 for board per quarter, ap
proximately $90 of which they
claim is used for food costs.
Last summer, while living
with two friends, the average
cost per person per week for
food was $9. Over a period of
eleven weeks, as in a quarter
here, the average cost would be
$99, not much over what they
charge here. Yet, last summer, I
was buying from a small corner
store, where prices were high,
and I was buying in small
amounts, as contrasted to Stern,
and this also increases costs.
Furthermore, I was paying
for food which was used as in
between-meal snacks, something
certainly lacking in Stern. Thus,
Stern should be getting much
more for its money than I did.
But this is not the case.
Whereas last summer I ate
rather well, at Stern I eat food
which I, and, judging by their
comments, most others consider
very poor. I am not discussing
taste, etc. for I realize that it is
hard to cook for 500 people.
What I am complaining about
is the basic quality of the food.
Not only is it poor in my
opinion, but it is also skimpy,
such as the main course of the
recent lunch which consisted of
one bun, a piece of cheese, a thin
slice of tomato, and two halves
of a slice of bacon.
Last summer, while working
in the fields, I managed to main
tain my normal weight of 165
pounds; at Stern, despite the
starch and peanut butter, I only
weigh 150 pounds.
How can a school such as
Stanford, which prides itself on
being a residence university, ex
pect people to maintain resi
dence while not being fed well?
It seems to me that the money
is being used rather poorly. Pos
sibly a new buyer is necessary.
Obviously something is.

â€¢ The Good & The Bad
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent letter the president
of one fraternity emphasized
that students have a right to
choose those with whom they
live on campus (The Daily,
April 11). I would like to express

my disagreement with this opin
ion.
I believe that small-group liv
ing for students has many ad
vantages. At its best, it will al
low each member of the group
to develop his individuality,
while at the same time showing
him the need to respect the dig
nity and rights of others. (Not
all students may wish to live in
a small group and it speaks well
for Stanford that a variety of
living arrangements is avail
able.)
It seems to me that a univer
sity should encourage those
small living groups which fur
ther these aims. The university
should teach students that all
persons have dignity and worth,
even if not apparent at first
sight. Practices such as rush or
hell week have no place on the
campus because they emphasize
superficiality, uniformity, con
ventionality and debase the dig
nity of the individual.
The economic realities of fra
ternity buildings at Stanford
(built mainly with alumni
funds) are such that fraternities
will be an integral part of Stan
ford's living arrangements for
some time. It is encouraging,
therefore, that there is a notice
able trend among fraternities
towards a type of living group
in which individuality can flour
ish. One would hope that fra
ternities will also give serious
consideration to a system of
membership which respects hu
man dignity, even if this would
lead to withdrawal from their
national organizations. Personal
ly I favor a draw system, or at
least a system in which the de
sire of the applicant to join a
group is given equal weight
with the desire of the group to
accept the applicant.
The argument has sometimes
been made that a university also
"discriminates", since its admis
sion procedure selects among ap
plicants. I look at this selection
as one of qualification for a cer
tain purpose, that is, learning.
Not all persons are equally qual
ified to learn and hence selection
is needed. Such criteria of quali
fication are not applicable to the
process of living, though.
