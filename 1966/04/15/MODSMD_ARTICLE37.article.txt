## UN No Dumping Grounds For Unpopular Problems 
### Walter Lippmann 
For the first time since it was
formed, the United Nations, on the
request of Great Britain and with the
support of this country, has invoked
Chapter VII of the charter. This chap
ter covers unexplored territory, for it
deals with the use of military mea
sures to enforce the peace. All the
rest of the charter deals with pacific
measures, with conciliation, media
tion and the like.
But Chapter VII envisages a resort
to war by the United Nations itself;
it envisages the waging of war to
forestall "threats to the peace, breach
es of the peace and acts of aggres
sion." Until last week the members
of the United Nations have always
avoided bringing Chapter VII into
their arguments.
Rhodesia Dispute
The Security Council has now ac
cepted a commitment under Chapter
VII in the dispute between lan
Smith's rebel racist government in
Rhodesia and the Queen's government
in Britain.
It is admitted that in order to do
this the Security Council has to
stretch, to "develop," the words of
the charter. For there can bo no doubt
that the British quarrel with Rhodesia
is a quarrel within the British Com
monwealth or that lan Smith's rebel
lion against the British Crown is not
an act of aggression by one sovereign
state against another.
In order to bring the Rhodesian af
fair within the purview of Chapter

VII, lawyers have argued that be
cause of its racist character and pol
icy the Smith government in Salis
bury, Rhodesia, is a "threat to the
peace." When the Security Council
accepted this determination it pos
sessed the legal right to authorize
Great Britain to prevent oil intended
for Rhodesia from being carried to
Portuguese ports in ships.
Smouldering - Conflict
It cannot be denied, I think, that
there is a genuine threat to the peace
in the smoldering racial conflict in
that part of Africa which is controlled
by Rhodesia, Portugal and South Af
rica.
The Security Council is not con
cerned with an emergency, but it is
concerned with a real and not an im
aginary threat to the future. For
there exists in South Africa and in
Rhodesia, though not so sharply in
the Portuguese territories, a policy
of white supremacy which in fact
closes the door of hope to the native
African majority.
The risk is very considerable that
this white oppression of the native
population will bring about uprisings,
rebellions and massacres and that a
racial war will result into which the
black African states and the white
European states will be drawn.
Pnident Involvement
The threat cannot be shrugged off.
It is a real one. What is not so clear
is whether it was necessary, whether

it was prudent to involve the United
Nations at this stage of the quarrel
with lan Smith's rebel government.
For in doing this it has become in
volved along with Britain in a quar
rel which extends beyond Rhodesia
and includes Portugal and South Af
rica.
Would it not have been better if
the Wilson government had treated
Rhodesia as a British responsibility?
Could it not have taken other British
measures which would have involved
only members of the Commonwealth
before it involved the United Nations
in a quarrel which is not, at least not
yet, international?
No Dumping Ground
It is of the utmost importance that
the United Nations should not be
used as a dumping ground for hard
decisions which are unpopular at
homo. For surely it is in no sense a
world government which can step in
where the national governments fear
to tread. It cannot, for example, set
tle the racial conflict in Africa nor can
it settle the war in Vietnam.
Its main business while the great
powers remain so divided is like the
business of any infant, which is to
survive in order to grow up. Only
when the great issues of the cold
wars in Europe and in Asia have been
dealt with, and the United Nations
has bccome in reality a universal so
city, can it be counted upon as the
principal keeper of the peace.
