# Profs Analyze NATO's Expulsion
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
Two Stanford Professors, analyz
ing consequences of France's with
drawal from NATO, predict that the
move will increase bad feeling in both
the United States and Europe.
Gordon Wright and Thomas Bailey
of the history department warn that
DeGaulle's actions have hindered
hopes for improved relations in Eu
rope.
Isolationist Sentiment
It may even cause "isolationist sen
timent to increase in this country,"
according to Wright. "Another con
sequence might be to re-awaken a
super-nationalism in the Germans,
who have been behaving like good
Europeans."
Wright suggested that France's po
sition is not entirely dependent on
General De Gaulle. "His foreign poli
cies are supported by a majority of
the French people, more than the
domestic policies. I think that if the
General passed from the scene today,
there would be much Gaulism that
would survive."
Believing that the nation-state is
the fundamental agency in world af
fairs, De Gaulle is trying to reassert
France's absolute sovereignty, sug
gests Wright.
"The United States can react to
France in either of two ways," Wright

asserted. "We can form a coalition
among the remaining allies and slap
back, or we can make the best of the
situation and try to prevent it from
getting worse."
Some Justification
Although he agrees with Wright's
analysis of the situation, Bailey sees
some justification for France's posi
tion.
"De Gaulle claims that he can't
depend on the United States to sac
rifice its own self-interest to defend
France. There may be some truth in
this. The present administration can
be counted on to defend Western
Europe. But 20 years from now we
could have a pacifist or isolationist
government. So France's fears have
some foundation."
"The General knows if he gets into

trouble we will bail him out," Bailey
added.
Gold Drain
Professor Bailey suggested some
other consequences of NATO leav
ing France: the billion dollars it wili
cost to move it will increase our gold
drain; moving to the low countries
or West Germany will weaken the
alliance's defense capabilities.
The personality of General De
Gaulle is distressing to Americans—
"He just doesn't like us," Bailey as
serted. "What bothers me most is that
his policy is based in part on the de
sire to recapture the grandeur and
Glory of the French past.
"With the Common Market and a
strong NATO there was hope for an
end to the fragmentism that has
plagued Europe," Bailey concluded.

among the remaining allies and slap
back, or we can make the best of the
situation and try to prevent it from
getting worse."
Some Justification
Although he agrees with Wright's
analysis of the situation, Bailey sees
some justification for France's posi
tion.
"De Gaulle claims that he can't
depend on the United States to sac
rifice its own self-interest to defend
France. There may be some truth in
this. The present administration can
be counted on to defend Western
Europe. But 20 years from now we
could have a pacifist or isolationist
government. So France's fears have
some foundation."
"The General knows if he gets into

trouble we will bail him out," Bailey
added.
Gold Drain
Professor Bailey suggested some
other consequences of NATO leav
ing France: the billion dollars it wili
cost to move it will increase our gold
drain; moving to the low countries
or West Germany will weaken the
alliance's defense capabilities.
The personality of General De
Gaulle is distressing to Americans—
"He just doesn't like us," Bailey as
serted. "What bothers me most is that
his policy is based in part on the de
sire to recapture the grandeur and
Glory of the French past.
"With the Common Market and a
strong NATO there was hope for an
end to the fragmentism that has
plagued Europe," Bailey concluded.
Two Stanford Professors, analyz
ing consequences of France's with
drawal from NATO, predict that the
move will increase bad feeling in both
the United States and Europe.
Gordon Wright and Thomas Bailey
of the history department warn that
DeGaulle's actions have hindered
hopes for improved relations in Eu
rope.
Isolationist Sentiment
It may even cause "isolationist sen
timent to increase in this country,"
according to Wright. "Another con
sequence might be to re-awaken a
super-nationalism in the Germans,
who have been behaving like good
Europeans."
Wright suggested that France's po
sition is not entirely dependent on
General De Gaulle. "His foreign poli
cies are supported by a majority of
the French people, more than the
domestic policies. I think that if the
General passed from the scene today,
there would be much Gaulism that
would survive."
Believing that the nation-state is
the fundamental agency in world af
fairs, De Gaulle is trying to reassert
France's absolute sovereignty, sug
gests Wright.
"The United States can react to
France in either of two ways," Wright

asserted. "We can form a coalition
among the remaining allies and slap
back, or we can make the best of the
situation and try to prevent it from
getting worse."
