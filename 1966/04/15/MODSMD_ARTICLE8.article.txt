# Harris Places Education On Top
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
The central issue of this year's cam
paign, according to presidential can
didate Dave Harris, is Stanford as
an educational institution.
Unfortunately, Harris says, the
campaign is bogged down in strate
gies rather than goals, and few peo
ple are talking about Stanford as an
educational institution.
"At this point in Stanford's his
tory," Harris says, "we're going to
have to talk about renovating educa
tion. The rest of the candidates, it
seems to me, are talking in terms of
acceptance of the structure that ex
ists now and the assumptions of that
structure, and I question whether this
can be extended much further and
still keep education progressing."
Rigid View
Harris feels that Stanford educa
tion shows a very rigid view toward
the academic, in that it interprets the
"intellectual striving" that goes on
in terms of degrees and majors and
general studies requirements.

"Stanford sees the student as re
cipient rather than actor, as someone
to be directed, to be filled, and to be
manipulated."
Harris also feels that Stanford edu
cation is characterized by paternal
ism.
"In regard to student decision mak
ing," Harris says,"it seems that
Stanford is running on a colonial mod
el of government. There is freedom
to operate within a separate political

system, but only until it reaches the
point where it steps on the toes of
the father figure, in this case the
Stanford administration."
Paternalism
Another example of paternalism,
Harris feels, can be found in the
University's attitude toward the stu
dents everyday life.
"By creating such things as open
house hours, social regulations, ju
dicial systems, the Stanford adminis
tration is saving to students 'you're

not responsible for your own lives,
and we don't consider you capable,
bright or independent enough to gov
ern your own lives.' When you per
sonally direct this to any Stanford stu
dent, I don't think we would admit
this; in fact, I think he would be quite
insulted by this, and I'm surprised
that there has been so little reaction
to this at Stanford."
Gerry Silent
In an interview with The Daily yes
terday, ASSU presidential candidate
Martin Gerry said his major cam
paign issue was "Make it a farce, not
a fiasco." He had no other comment.
