# Success, Woes Beset Repertory Theater
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor (First in a Series 
Last fall Stanford took the "big step" into
professional drama with the opening of the
e√üpertory Theater.
Nearly two-thirds of the way through its
first season, the company has already estab
lished its reputation as an adventurous, first
rate group. But the Rep's success has riot been
without problems.
A $300,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foun
dation provided the financial impetus for start
ing the Repertory Theater. The grant, made
in late 1964, provides $100,000 for three sea
sons to be used exclusively for actors' and di
rectors' salaries.
However the idea for establishing a profes
sional company goes back to 1961 when the
University tried to convince San Francisco's
Actor's Workshop to relocate on campus. The
Workshop turned down an inviting offer which
included a new theater.
Classroom and Stage
MFA candidates have classes in the morning
Professor Robert Loper, Chairman of the

Spoech and Drama Department continued to
work for the establishment of a professional
company which would close the gap between
the classroom and the stage. His efforts were
rewarded with the Rockefeller grant.
The grant does more than create a pro
fessional acting company on campus, for it
provides for a Master of Fine Arts program
which works closely with the Repertory Thea
ter. Presently 19 students are enrolled, but
the three year program leading to the MFA
degree will evetnually expand to 40 students.
MFA candidates have classes in the morning
and spend the rest of the day working in Rep
productions. The program includes actors,
directors, designers, and technicians.
'Cozy Alliance'
Los Angeles Times' critic Cecil Smith has
called the Rep a "cozy alliance" between the
student and the professional, but it has also
been a highly successful one.
The Rep's performances have received wide
attention up and down the West Coast as well
as note in the New York theater community.
Critics spared few superlatives on the com
pany's opening performance of "That Scoun

drel Scapin," and they have been just as
pleased with the Rep's other offerings. "Pro
metheus Bound" received 16 rave reviews from
Bay Area critics.
Despite the professional success, attendance
has been less than Rep officials had anticipat
ed. This year's deficit should run well into five
figures and perhaps six. Under terms of the
Rockefeller grant, the University will cover
expenses not met by box office receipts and
the grant.
Breaking Even
Peter Troxell, business manager for the
Repertory Theater, estimates the company
will need at least three years before it can
come close to breaking even.
At present, University officials are more
concerned about the small number of students'
attending Rep performances rather than the
deficit. Students accounted for only 11 per
cent of the attendance figures for "That Scoun
drel Scapin" and"The Skin of Our Teeth."
Student attendance rose only slightly for
"Prometheus Bound," which has been the most
successful show of the season.
Associate Dean of Humanities and Science

Richard Lyman recently commented that a
lack of student interest in the Rep would take
away one of the major reasons for establish
ing a professional company on campus.
Low Attendance
Scheduling of performances during dead
week and the price of tickets have both con
tributed to low student attendance, but Trox
ell hopes both these can be taken care of next
year.
Originally, the Rep was to begin performing
next year with the MFA Program having a
year's headstart. However, pressure from the
Rockefeller Foundation made it necessary for
the Rep to open at once. Rep officials were
forced to schedule their long runs around
events already on the calendar.
Troxell hopes to initiate student discounts
for weekend performances next year and be
lieves this will bring more students to the Rep.
The Repertory Theater will be on sounder
footing, both financially and technically when
it gets its new theater. There are no provisions
for the 1000 seat theater in the PACE Pro
gram, and a new fund raising drive has not
gotten underway yet. Troxell estimates at least
three years before the Rep would have its own

home next to Memorial Auditorium.
In the Black
Dean Lyman recently told The Daily the
University had never been led to believe the
Rep could operate without a subsidy.
In fact, he noted, "I would get a little wor
ried if we were in the black. It would mean
that we were not doing all we could to be ad
venturous and have minimum rates."
With the decision to begin performances this
year, the Rep has faced many problems and
at times suffered from a lack of time for ade
quate planning. Beginning with a play not well
known, Rep officials were shocked when at
tendance amounted to only 29 per cent, com
pared to 70 per cent anticipated as an average
figure for the season.
Part of the Price
Two of the best offerings of the year were
scheduled for the Little Theater rather than
the main stage in Memorial Auditorium.
This is part of the price Stanford has had
to pay for making the jump into first-rate
theater. Yet Troxell stresses the problems are
only temporary and solutions are forthcoming.
