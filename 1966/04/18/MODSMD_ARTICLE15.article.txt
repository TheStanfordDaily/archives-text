OSLO, Norway (AP) â€” Two
American professors debated
U. S. policy in Vietnam at a stu
dent teach-in here Saturday.
Prof. Hans J. Morgenthau of
Chicago University said that
U. S. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk has shown political in
competence in dealing with the
Vietnam situation.
Prof. Frank N. Tager of New
York University told the Nor
wegian Students Association
that no government is all right
or all wrong. He added "We
made a commitment and signed
a treaty to try to preserve the
independence of South Vietnam
. . . and we are trying to stick
by that treaty."
Morgenthau, a frequent critic
of the U. S. policy in Vietnam,
said the American position was
morally, politically and militari
ly wrong.
Trager suggested to the stu
dents that they view the facts
in an historic background. He
declared he was anti-imperialist,
but that his anti-imperialism
also applied to Soviet and Com
munist Chinese efforts to sub
jugate smaller countries by sub
version and infiltration.
