# 60th Anniversary Of The Night Of Terror
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Stanford History Editor 
Forty-seven seconds of terror struck
the Stanford campus sixty years ago
today.
Occurring at 5:13 a.m. on a quiet
Wednesday morning, the 1906 earth
quake closed Stanford for five
months.
A new library and a nearly com
pleted gymnasium were so heavily
damaged that both were razed. Me
morial Church, dedicated only three
years earlier, had to be leveled and
rebuilt from the ground up.
Outer Quad was still standing but
was also hard hit. Inner Quad, built
under the watchful eyes of Senator
Stanford, was only slightly damaged.
Two Killed
The earthquake killed two persons
on campus, one a student. Otto Ger
des, a fireman working in the power
plant, was killed by a huge stone

chimney that stood near Engineering
Corner.
But it was he who possibly saved
Stanford from a much greater disas
ter. Gerdes pulled the main power
switch as soon as the earthquake
struck, then ran outside to his death
as the chimney struck him.
The student, Junius R. Hanna, was
killed by an Encina chimney as he
lay in his bed. The chimney crashed
through four floors, carrying Hanna
and four others to the basement. None
of the other four were seriously in
jured.
Major Disaster
As the sun rose on Stanford April
18, 1906, it became readily apparent
that this was a major disaster. All
University activities were immediate
ly suspended until August.
The Daily Palo Alto, predecessor to
The Stanford Daily, managed to put
out two special editions the day of the

earthquake and two more the follow
ing day, even thou g h the printing
shop was a shambles. However, after
three more editions, The Daily also
discontinued activity until the end
of August.
Coincidently, the Hammer and Cof
fin Society of the Stanford Chaparral
was formed the night before the earth
quake.
Roped Off
The most heavily damaged struc
tures were roped off to prevent in
juries to curio-hunters from subse
quent tremors.
Orrin Leslie Elliott, in his book
Stanford University, The First Twen
ty-five Years, recorded students' reac
tions to the earthquake in some of
their letters home:
"The chimneys are gone every
where. A big marble statue of Agassiz
was toppled off his perch on the out
side of the Quad and fell foremost
into the ground up to his shoulders.
People came running from the Quad
with such sober faces, but when they
saw him they couldn't help laughing.
"In the middle of the afternoon,
express wagons from San Francisco
began to arrive with the Stanford
folks who had been caught in San
Francisco staying overnight from the
opera. They paid five dollars apiece
to be carted down."
'Down Here'
And from another letter
"I ran into the parlors [of the then
Roble Hall, now Sequoia Hall | and
found Ruth just getting out of bed
and shaking off the plaster. Her room
had sunk right down in the middle
taking her bed with it, and she wasn't
scratched. Her roommate was still up
above on the third floor having hys
terics and called 'O Ruth, where are
you?' and Ruth calmly announced,
'Down here in the parlor.'
"Right above Ruth's bed was poised
a great heavy stone which had
crashed through the roof from the
chimney and the terrible weight is
still poised there held by nobody
knows what. The two chimneys had
both fallen crashing through the roof,
but not touching the four girls direct
ly underneath."
Gym Torn Down
The gymnasium was rendered
useless and torn down that summer.
Built of sandstone and due to be com

pleted in May, 1906, it was located
across the street from the present
NROTC annex, Mahan Hall. The foun
dations may still be seen there.
The sandstone from the gymnasi
um, the library, and the Church was
dumped in San Francisquito Creek.
The library, located on the same
site on which the new Graduate
School of Business is being built, had
been completed a few days before and
some books had already been moved
in.
Foundations Dynamited
Before the construction could start
on the School of Business in 1964, the
foundation of the old library had to be
dynamited. The library had been in
tended to replace the Thomas Welton
Stanford library, located in the pres
ent Law School. It was not until 1919,
when the Main Library was com
pleted, that the library was moved out
of the Quad.
Inner Quad was not seriously dam
aged. According to Shepley, Rutan,
and Coolidge, the contracting firm
that built the Inner Quad, "You may
have noticed that the earthquake did
not affect any of the buildings we had
built except the chimney on the power
house, which toppled over.
Beyond Repair
Memorial Arch was damaged be
yond repair. It guarded the entrance
to the Quad and was approximately
40 feet high. A freize on top the Arch
depicted the growth of civilization.
Its loss was not mourned.
The Mausoleum was not damaged.
Built of large stone blocks with a wide
foundation, it could probably with
stand an earthquake even stronger
than that of 1906.
The total cost of restoration was
about $2.1 million. Rebuilding Memori
al Church cost approximately $650,-
000, repairs to other buildings $650,-
000, and replacing the library and
gymnasium $750,000.
Automatic Degrees
All graduating seniors with passing
grades were granted degrees auto
matically. Those who were not pass

ing were required to take examina
tions in September to decide their
fate. Commeneement was deferred un
til September 15.
Within a week of the earthquake
most of the students had started home.
However, many of them had to wire
home for money for the trip. The tele
graph offices were swamped and
could not send the messages. Finally
a Stanford student with a car volun
teered to drive to Sacramento with
the telegrams where they were final
ly sent out.
Not all the students left Stanford. A
few stayed to operate the "Stanford
Camp." The Camp consisted of a
group of tents on the south end of

the city where the refugees of the
earthquake could get food and shel
ter. The students were given fret?
daily transportation to and from San
Francisco by the Southern Pacific.
'Saddest Sight'
In general, the reactions of many
students to the earthquake were
summed up in this letter home:
"You cannot imagine the quadran
gle as it looks today; it is the sad
dest sight I ever saw. Some of the
people were simply sobbing this morn
ing when they saw the grand old Quad
in perfect ruins.
"I have never lived so long in my
life as that minute this morning at
5:13."
