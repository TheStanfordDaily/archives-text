# Swaying Library
## 
### 

This was to liave l>een the first University library build
inÂ«: outside the Quad. Previously, the library had been
located in the Outer Quad. The library had a dome, sup
ported by steel girders, which did not collapse during the
earthquake, but swayed, ruining most of the building.
