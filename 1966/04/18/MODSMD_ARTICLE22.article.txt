# 'No Reason Why 'Quakes Should Stop Now'
## 
### KIRK HANSON Assistant Editor 
"It is inevitable that there will be
a strong earthquake in the Stanford
area. We are in the neighborhood of
the San Andreas fault and the Hay
ward fault, and during recent geologic
epochs, they have slipped a good many
miles. There is no reason why they
should stop now."
Earthquakes have long been feared
in the Stanford area. In the preceding
statement, Dr. Benjamin Page, head
of the Geology Department, expressed
the facts that make earthquakes a
constant consideration in building
codes and civil defense and disaster
preparations at Stanford.
Proof of Impact
The destruction at Stanford in 1006
proved what impact an earthquake
can have on the campus. The Quad
was strewn with rubble and many
new buildings lay in complete ruin.
President David Starr Jordan finally
gave up hope of reopening of the Uni
versity that spring semester of 1006
and declared the University closed
until the fall of the year. Some at the
time speculated that the University
would never again open.
The final edition of The Daily said
in editorial on April 21, 1906: "The
buildings of the University are
wrecked, and the labor of years, ever
sincc the founding, has been in a large
measure undone . . .
"It is now incumbent upon all the
men and women of Stanford to show
their utmost measure of loyalty and
devotion. It is absolutely necessary

that every student now in the Univer
sity shall return next fall, and fur
thermore that every student shall use
his utmost endeavor to persuade oth
ers to come."
Earthquake Predictions
Prof. Page pointed out that there
would be several earthquakes here
this year felt by instruments, but that
there is usually only one every few
years that can be felt by people. Pre
dictions that a strong earthquake is
inevitable are based on measurements
showing crustal movement and other
evidences of stresses along the faults.
The United States Geological Sur
vey (USGA) established an earth
quake research center in Menlo Park
with scientists from all over the coun
try to study the nature of earthquakes
and possible methods of predicting
them. Dr. Bailey Willis of Stanford
was director of the USGS for several
years and made some early earth
quake prediction studies before his
death in the late 1010's.
According to Prof. Page, many theo
ries of earthquake prediction are be
ing studied today but none of them
have been developed to the point of
practical application. The hope is to
be able to say there will or will not
be a major earthquake within the
next fifty years. This could give guid
ance to construction techniques for
that period. Later the predictions
could be refined to shorter and short
er periods of time. However, such pre
dictions are now impossible and no
one knows when the next major earth
quake will occur.

What damage could a strong earth
quake have on the Stanford campus
today? In 1906, the main destruction
was centered in unreinforced stone
buildings. The new library, the gym
nasium, and Memorial Arch were to
tally destroyed while the Memorial
Church, Encina Hall, much of the
Quad, and many student residences
were heavily damaged. One-hundred

four of the 140 stone chimneys on
campus were toppled.
Damage to the Stanford Museum
showed the importance of steel rein
forcing. The center portion of the
museum, reinforced primitively with
railroad ties, stood while the unrein
forced wings were leveled. New build
ings now being built on campus are
all reinforced, but in the Quad, only

the Law School and Math Corner have
been reinforced.
Since 1945 surveys have been taken
for the University for earthquake in
surance, highlighting what damage
might be expected in a strong earth
quake. The surveys were started by
Dr. Bailey Willis and Dr. Burt Wells
and have been kept up to date by Dr.
Wells since Willis' death. Wells is now

Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineer
ing and last quarter gave some gen
eral comments concerning University
buildings.
Red Tile A Hazard
He said the most susceptible build
ings are those of heavy stone, and the
safest are the wood frame buildings
like the fraternity houses. He also
noted that the red tile roofs are verv

poor for earthquake areas and their
great weight can only constitute a
hazard.
Actual damage would depend on the
intensity and duration of the earth
quake he said. A tremor of Intensity 6
on the Richter scale would cause some
damage, mostly in cracked walls and
shattered windows.
If the intensity should reach 8 or
8.5, as the 1906 quake did, then plenty
of damage could be expected. Dr.
Wells said the Memorial Church might
or might not survive such an earth
quake, as would be the case with Jor
dan Hall and the old Chemistry Build
ing. Other questionable buildings in
clude History, Engineering, and Geolo
gy corners. (The Math Corner was
completely rebuilt two years ago and
should survive.)
The arcades throughout the Quad
were cited by both Wells and Prof.
Page as very susceptible to damage.
In 1906 most arches were damaged
and a 450-foot section between Engi
neering and Geology corners behind
Memorial Church was completely flat
tened. It has never been rebuilt.
In the past twelve years, the arches
surrounding the Memorial Court have
been dismantled, reinforced with steel,
and then put back together, but the
rest of the arches remained un
touched.
Building Codes
Before 1940 buildings on campus
were constructed without a building
code. Since then the buildings have

been built to conform to the minimum
standards of the codes established by
Santa Clara County.
According to Dr. Wells, these stand
ards do not mean that damage will not
result, but that human lives will be
saved because the buildings will re
main standing, even if the walls are
cracked and the outsides are dam
aged.
In the newer buildings, most of the
damage would be mechanical damage
to pipes and ducts. Lab buildings
would particularly suffer and could
easily be damaged by minor earth
quakes.
Safety Being Sacrificed
Dr. Wells stated that it is now pos
sible to construct new buildings to
resist all earthquakes, but that Stan
ford has followed a policy of building
just to the minimum code require
ments. He said he was "not going to
give judgment if that's best or not."
Evidently financial considerations
cause the University to sacrafice high
er standards. Seraphim F. Post, Assist
ant Business Manager of the Univer
sity, told The Daily recently that costs
have dictated the standards.
He said the only approach to earth
quakes the University could take was:
"Reinforce as well as possible within
reasonable limits and then weather
them."
According to Post, the only two
structures that the University could
build to withstand any earthquake
are a wicker basket or a steel box.
Evidently neither is being planned.
