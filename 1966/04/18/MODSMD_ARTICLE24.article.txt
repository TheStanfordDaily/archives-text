# Indians' Crew Sets Record Time, Wins
## 
### DAN CABRERA 
"Perfect" was the word for the Stanford Crow Saturday, as they
won all throe of their races and set a new course record.
In the first race, Stanford's J. V. shell, the Sam Schwacher, shot
out into what proved to be an insurmountable 1 length lead
before the boats had even reached the 500-meter, one-quarter course
mark.
The J. V. victory over Long Beach in a final time of 6:11.0 was

the first of three Stanford
won in the meet between
Stanford, Long Reach State, and
U. C. of Santa Barbara. The first
race was followed by a frosh
win in a time of 6:17.0 over the
Santa Barbara crew.
Thumbs-Up
Approximately 150 bermuda
elad, sunglassed spectators had
arrived in time to watch Stan
ford's varsity meet Long Beach
on the 2000-meter course in Red
wood City Harbor, fifteen min
utes from Stanford. Coach Will
Condon, in his s e e on d season
now with Stanford, gave the
thumbs-up sign to his eight first
shell rowers as they backed into
starting position.
The varsity shell Scimitar
went neek-and-neek with Long
Beach's almost to the 1000-meter,
half-point mark at a clip of thir
ty-eight strokes a minute and
then began to pull away, drop
ping their stroke to a smooth
thirty-two.
New Reoor<l
At the 1500-meter mark Stan
ford led by one-half length. "A
beautiful stroke," even the op
posing coach was forced to say,
and at the finish line Stanford
led by three lengths, having set
a new course record of 5:57.0.
The best time to date was 6:03.0.
Looking very much like win
ners, the Stanford crew gath
ered the losers' jerseys and
tossed their coxswain into tlie
drink. They looked forward now
to a big win over Cal in their
approaching meet. Cal was de
feated over the weekened in an
upset by IJ.C.L.A.
Coach Condon sees Cal as his
most formidable obstacle to a
perfect season for the varsity
and plans to better the course
record each time out. To date,
only two men from last year's
all-returning first shell, Herzog
and Coles, have been used in
meets, which gives some indica
tion of Condon's confidence and
the broad strength of this year's
team.
The Stanford crew will host
Cal here on Saturday, May 14.
