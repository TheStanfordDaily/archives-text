# Card Netters Fall To South
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team, possi
bly looking past their matches
preparing for their big contest
against Cal this Tuesday, was
blanked twice by identical scores
of 9-0 against USC and UCLA
this past weekend.
Possibly the only bright spot
in the entire weekend was Stan
ford's Jim Beste taking the sec
ond set from Charlie Pasarell of
UCLA, 6-2. Pasarell won the
first set 6-3 and the final set
6-2 from Stanford's top player.
Stanford's Coach Bob Rcnker
was, nonetheless, still optimistic
about the outcome. "1 feel we
played better than we did down
South earlier in the season.
Beste played much better Satur
day and our double's teams are
also improving. I look forward
to a tough meet Tuesday but
feel we should do well against
them."
