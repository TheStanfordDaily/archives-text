# Indian Laxmen Tie Cal In Overtime Thriller
## 
### 
The day was hot Saturday In
Berkeley, the lacrosse field was
twenty yards too short and con
stricted. Battling these physical
conditions and some uncanny
Golden Bear luck through regu
lation play and two overtime pe
riods, Stanford's Indians came
off the field with a 3-3 tie and
the undying conviction that they
were the best team on the field.
The Indians will be able to
prove this conviction three
weeks from now when the Bears
visit the farm and the winner of
the Aberchrombie and Fitch
Broken Stick Trophy will be de
termined.

The Stanford defense was su
perb in the contest and the Cal
defenders were not far behind,
as the low score indicates. Jack
Dirman, playing his career's
best game anchored the Red de
fense, while speedy Chip Green
ing kept the ball at the other
end of the field with clearing
maneuvers. Bill Leachman and
Nat Benchley also played ag
gressive games for the Indian
defense.
In fact, the first goal in the
game was not scored until a
mere 1:30 remained in the first
half when Cal attackman
George Couluris picked up a

loose ball on the sidelines and
beat his man as he fired at Stan
ford goalie Mel Ellis at point
blank range.
The last, tying goal came with
only 2:15 left in regulation play
when Stanford midfielder Sill
Sanders cut and took a perfect
feed from attackman Clay Prim
rose.
The second Cal goal came
shortly after the first with less
than a minute left in the half,
when Deke Huyler scooped in a
lost ball in front of the crease
for another "garbage goal."
Early in the second half, the
Golden Bears extended their
lead to 3-0 with the greatest
fluke of the afternoon. As Bear
attackman Couluris passed a
ball over the Stanford goal,
Stanford Goalie Mel Ellis, in a
good goalie maneuved, blocked
the pass. But the ball inadvert
ently hit the wood of Ellis' stick
and dropped straight down into
the goal.
Primrose finally put the In
dians on the scoreboard 3 min
utes later when he dodged
around his man and rammed a
shot pass goalie Andy Israel.
George Peters followed suit
soon after with a perfect mid
fielder's shot. Peters faked once
and with Israel effectively
screened out bounced the ball
over his shoulder to cut the de
ficit to one.
Sanders' goal finally knotted
the contest the next quarter.
Stanford controlled the ball
most of the afternoon and
played a tighter game than the
Bears. But Cal luck kept the
contest even.
Both goalies turned in good
performances.

Berkeley, the lacrosse field was
twenty yards too short and con
stricted. Battling these physical
conditions and some uncanny
Golden Bear luck through regu
lation play and two overtime pe
riods, Stanford's Indians came
off the field with a 3-3 tie and
the undying conviction that they
were the best team on the field.
The Indians will be able to
prove this conviction three
weeks from now when the Bears
visit the farm and the winner of
the Aberchrombie and Fitch
Broken Stick Trophy will be de
termined.

The Stanford defense was su
perb in the contest and the Cal
defenders were not far behind,
as the low score indicates. Jack
Dirman, playing his career's
best game anchored the Red de
fense, while speedy Chip Green
ing kept the ball at the other
end of the field with clearing
maneuvers. Bill Leachman and
Nat Benchley also played ag
gressive games for the Indian
defense.
In fact, the first goal in the
game was not scored until a
mere 1:30 remained in the first
half when Cal attackman
George Couluris picked up a

loose ball on the sidelines and
beat his man as he fired at Stan
ford goalie Mel Ellis at point
blank range.
The last, tying goal came with
only 2:15 left in regulation play
when Stanford midfielder Sill
Sanders cut and took a perfect
feed from attackman Clay Prim
rose.
The second Cal goal came
shortly after the first with less
than a minute left in the half,
when Deke Huyler scooped in a
lost ball in front of the crease
for another "garbage goal."
Early in the second half, the
Golden Bears extended their
lead to 3-0 with the greatest
fluke of the afternoon. As Bear
attackman Couluris passed a
ball over the Stanford goal,
Stanford Goalie Mel Ellis, in a
good goalie maneuved, blocked
the pass. But the ball inadvert
ently hit the wood of Ellis' stick
and dropped straight down into
the goal.
Primrose finally put the In
dians on the scoreboard 3 min
utes later when he dodged
around his man and rammed a
shot pass goalie Andy Israel.
George Peters followed suit
soon after with a perfect mid
fielder's shot. Peters faked once
and with Israel effectively
screened out bounced the ball
over his shoulder to cut the de
ficit to one.
Sanders' goal finally knotted
the contest the next quarter.
Stanford controlled the ball
most of the afternoon and
played a tighter game than the
Bears. But Cal luck kept the
contest even.
Both goalies turned in good
performances.
