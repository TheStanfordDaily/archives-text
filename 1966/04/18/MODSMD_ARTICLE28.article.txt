Behind the hot bats of Steve
Hovley and Mike Schomaker,
the Stanford baseball team beat
the best last weekend as they
edged UCLA, 7-5, and split a
doubleheader with USC.

weekend was undoubtedly cen
terfielder Steve Hovley's boom
ing homerun Friday against
UCLA which won the game.
Bomb

tom of the eighth. Mike Scho
maker led off with a single to
center, and Frank Duffy sacri

feet. The ball cleared the fence
which surrounds Sunken Dia
mond which is another 50 feet

didn't stop there. It sailed across
the street and an undetermined
distance after that. Estimates
of the blast range from 475 feet
to at least 500 feet. The home
run won the game 7-5.
The first inning looked as if
UCLA was going to rout the In
dians. Thoy scored four runs in
the top of the first. The Tribe
came right back, however, and
scored four of their own runs.
Schomaker led off with a dou
ble and singles by Duffy, Hov
ley, a walk to Marty Erek and
a single by Hi Lewis scored the
four runs.

picked up the win.
Mason Wins
The Indians backed up John
Mason's five-hit pitching with
13 hits against USC in the first
game of the doubleheader to win
going away, 5-3.
Mason did an outstanding job
striking out eight and allowing
no earned runs. In the fifth, an
error gave the Trojans two base

runners with two out. Fred
Shuey came up and hit the ball
out of Sunken Diamond and into
the Rugby Field for USC's three
runs.
Stanford drew first blood or
rather first trickle as four sin
gles in the first inning only net
ted one run. Schomaker, Jim
Hibbs, Erck, and Pete Middle
kauff all singled, but only Scho
maker scored.
Chuck Williams who filled in
for injured Dick Swan at second
gave Stanford two runs in the
fifth when he followed Middle
kauff's single with a home run
over the left field fence. This
tied the score at 3-3.
High Bounce
Schomaker started the next
frame off with a high bouncing
single over third. Duffy followed
with a ground rule double down
the left field line. Hovley scored
on Schomaker with a ground out
to deep second, and Hibbs
brought in Duffy with a perfect
squeeze bunt.
The Trojans scored lone runs
in the second, fourth, and sev
enth to win the second game, 3-2.
USC scored their first run on
an error and a bobbled double
play ball. They scored their sec
ond run on a Texas league single
and a solid single. In the sev
enth, Oscar Brown got aboard
when pitcher Terry Docken fum
bled his grounder. Brown ad
vanced to second on a sacrifice
and scored on a single by catch
er Steve Sogge.
Stanford looked like they
were going to do some damage
in the fourth, but they settled
for two runs.
The Indians came very close
to having two more runs when
Hibbs flied out against the fence
at the 385 mark with Hovley
on base in the first.
