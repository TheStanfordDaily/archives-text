# UCLA Tramples Card Tracksters
## 
### BOB EGELKO 
A good Stanford track team
met one of the best college
squads in history Saturday, and
the results were a bit frighten
ing. The UCLA Bruins, in an
awesome display of power and
depth, smothered the previously
unbeaten Cards, 196-39, taking
15 of 17 first places.
Led by sprinter Norm Jack
son and vaulter Marc Savage,
Coach Jim Bush's forces set sev
en new meet records and tied
two others in Southern Califor
nia-like weather before a Stan
ford Stadium crowd of 6800.
Jackson, the AAWU's fastest
man, convincingly won his
sprint duel with Stanford's Lar

ry Questad, tying two meet rec
ords in the process.
Both men started slowly in
the 100, but Jackson burst from
the pack at about 25 yards, with
Questad just behind, and beat
Larry to the tape in 9.6. In the
220, the speedy Bruin was first
out of the blocks and breezed
home in 20.9, with Questad
edging UCLA's Tom Jones for
second.
Savage won a pole vault duel
with Stanford's Jim Eshelman
that held most of the fans long
after the running events were
completed, but the stocky junior
had to break his own NCAA
record to do it.
Smith Third
Stanford's Chuck Smith won
his battle for third with Bruin
Erie Berge by clearing 15-6 on
his last attempt, but went out
at 16-0, and the stage was set
for the record-breaking duel.
Eshelman and Savage each
needed but one try at that
height, and the bar was moved
to 16-4%. Again Savage cleared,
but Eshelman grazed the bar
twice, then finally sailed over
cleanly to break his own school
record by more than four inch
es.
Bob Stoecker's season's best
of 54-1 M in the shot put was
only worth third place behind
Bruins Traugott Gloeckler (59-
11%) and Jack Hale. Art Mil
ler's 45-6 triple jump earned him
third back of UCLA's Doug Olm
stead (49-9) and Doug Ford.
Sophomore Jim Ward's best 440
ever, a meet record-breaking
47.1, was only good for second
as Bob Frey of the visitors ran
46.6, his best by a half-second.
Card first places went to
Stoecker, with a discus throw of
176-1 Vz, and Craig Vaughan, who
led a surprising sweep of the
long jump at 23-6V2.
Walsh W<>ary
440 hurdler Roger Johnson, a
Bruin via New Zealand, won
easily in 52.2, as a weary Bud
Walsh, in his fourth event of the
afternoon, broke stride at the
end of the backstretch, pushed
over a hurdle, somehow cleared
the remaining barriers and
gamely fought off UCLA's Mike
Slaim in the final sprint for his
third runner-up finish.
Big Ron Copeland, a smooth
striding JC transfer, won the
high hurdles in 14.3 and an
chored the mile relay team in an
effortless-looking 46 flat as the
Bruins set a school record of
3:10.8 despite holding out Frey,
their best runner.
Stanford Coach Payton Jor
dan was pleased with his team's
performance, despite the score.
"N atur a 11 y I'm disappointed
with the results," said Jordan,
"b u t we don't have to be
ashamed of our showing today.
"UCLA's a great team; I'd
have to call them the best in the
country until someone proves
otherwise."
