## Social Regs Most Traditional 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Ancel's article about
"Social Regs" (The Daily, April
14) prompts me to respond. Es
sentially, she contends that the
"Regs" are of an "inappropriate
tradition." I take exception to
that standpoint.
In accordance with dogma,
tradition, power maintenance
and intolerance, the Social Regu
lations are entirely appropriate
to the "Establishment" which
gave them birth and which pro
vides continuing nourishment.
The same phenomena exist in
Double Standards, denials of so
cial and personal realities, and
in an unwillingness to alter the
"System" (syn. of Establish
ment).
If it be so that "most adminis

trators contend that until many
women graduate they are not re
sponsible . . . etc", then the im
maturity of existing Social Reg
ulations quite adequately re
flects, and is entirely appropri
ate to, the commensurate im
maturity in those individuals
who maintain such attitudes.
However, I simply don't believe
that "most administrators con
tend . .
May we hear from them?

Just added to an already distin
guished list of publications with

his "Ode to a Campus Nymph."
What courage and dignity this
full professor displayed by
launching a series of innuendos
against an undergraduate girl!
How even more dignified he ap
peared when she failed to an
swer his insinuations in kind!
How satisfying such a triumph
must have been!
What other faculty member
could write so knowledgeably
about a student he had never
met? What other department
head would even bother?
But wouldn't it be poetic Just
ice if this week's SSRF referen
dum should pass anyway? And
wouldn't that be a bitter pill to
swallow for one so curiously
concerned about the swallowing
of pills?
