# On The Right
## In Memory Of Waugh 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
I once encountered a very
Angry lady in Dallas, Texas,
who announced herself as head
of a vigilance committee to keep
dirty literature out of the local
libraries, and we talked a bit.
I forget just how the conver
sation moved, but at one point
I said that to pull out all the
salacious passages from modern
literature would require the end
of individual reading. All of us
would have to have private
readers, like the old eccentric
who forced his prisoner to read
to him the works of Charles
Dickens in the novel by Evelyn
Waugh.
Who, asked the lady book
critic, is Evelyn Waugh? The
greatest English novelist of this
century, I ventured; but, on
ascertaining that he was not
a dirty book writer, she lost all
interest, and went off to look
for more dirty books to rail
against.
Letter To Waugh
I wrote Waugh and told him
about the episode. My letter did
not include any reference to any
business matter, so I knew he
would not reply to it; but I
knew the little story would ap
peal to his sense of satire, so
strongly developed as to make
him, in the judgment of the
critic Edmund Wilson, the "only
first-rate comic genius the En
glish have produced since
George Bernard Shaw."
(Waugh's reply, several years
later to an interviewer who
asked what was his opinion of
Edmond Wilson: "Is he Ameri
can?" End comment.)
But Waugh was much more
than that, though millions of
his readers who read only
"Handful of Dust", and "Scoop,"
and"The Loved One," did not
know about the other dimen
sions; did not know that Evelyn
Waugh the great satirist was a

conservative, a traditionalist, a
passionately convinced and con
vincing Christian, a master styl
ist routinely acknowledged, dur
ing the last decade, as the most
finished writer of English prose.
Autobiography
He died at 62 having com
pleted only one volume of a
long autobiography. In it he re
corded, dispassionately, the im
pressions of his early years;
something of the lives of his
ancestors, many of them eccen
tric; and of the chaos of his un
dergraduate career at Oxford,
from which he was duly ex
pelled, as so many interesting
Englishmen are expected to be.
He decided, in his mid-twen
ties, that the thing to do was to
commit suicide, and he describ
es, as he would in a novel, his
own venture in this dramatic
activity—the verse from Eurip
ides about water washing away
the stains of the earth, neatly
exposed where it could not be
missed by grieving relatives
and meticulous coroners; wad
ing out into the ocean, thinking
diapasonal thoughts; then run
ning into a school of jellyfish,
and racing back to the beach,
putting on his clothes, tearing
up Euripides, and finishing his
career, for which we thank
God's little jellyfish.
Impossible Man
He was an impossible man, in
many respects. At least as far
as the public was concerned.
Like J. D. Salinger and James
Gould Cozzens, he simply re
fused to join the world of flack
ery and televised literature.
Rather than live a public life,
he situated himself in a large
old house in the country, sur
rounding himself with a moat
that was proof against all but
his closest friends, and the
vicar.
The piranhas made a specialty

of devouring all first-class mail
asking for interviews, com
ments, suggestions, whatever.
I discovered that the squire
felt an obligation to reply to all
letters concerning questions of
commerce; so that if you want
ed a comment or two on a mat
ter of literature or philosophy
or politics, you could hope to
get it by dropping into your let
ter a trivial question relating to
business.
Knew People
But he was a man of charity,
personal generosity, and, above
all, of understanding. He knew
people, he knew his century,
and, having come to know it, he
had faith only in the will of
God, and in individual man's la
tent capacity to strive towards
it. He acknowledged the need
to live in this century, because
the jellyfish will not have it
otherwise; but never, ever, to
acclimate yourself to it.
Mr. Scott-King, the classics
teacher, after his tour through
Evelyn Waugh's "Modern Eur
ope," comes back to school, and
there the headmaster suggests
that he teach some popular sub
ject, in addition to the classics—
economic history, perhaps, for
the classics are not popular.
"I'm a Greats man myself,"
the headmaster says."I deplore
it as much as you do. But what
can we do? Parents are not in
terested in producing the 'com
plete man' any more. They want
to qualify their boys for jobs in
the public world. You can hard
ly blame them can you?"
"Oh yes," Scott-King replies,
"I can and do." And, deaf to the
headmaster's entreaties, he de
clares, shyly but firmly, "I
think it would be very wicked
indeed to do anything to fit a
boy for the modern world."

I once encountered a very
Angry lady in Dallas, Texas,
who announced herself as head
of a vigilance committee to keep
dirty literature out of the local
libraries, and we talked a bit.
I forget just how the conver
sation moved, but at one point
I said that to pull out all the
salacious passages from modern
literature would require the end
of individual reading. All of us
would have to have private
readers, like the old eccentric
who forced his prisoner to read
to him the works of Charles
Dickens in the novel by Evelyn
Waugh.
Who, asked the lady book
critic, is Evelyn Waugh? The
greatest English novelist of this
century, I ventured; but, on
ascertaining that he was not
a dirty book writer, she lost all
interest, and went off to look
for more dirty books to rail
against.
Letter To Waugh
I wrote Waugh and told him
about the episode. My letter did
not include any reference to any
business matter, so I knew he
would not reply to it; but I
knew the little story would ap
peal to his sense of satire, so
strongly developed as to make
him, in the judgment of the
critic Edmund Wilson, the "only
first-rate comic genius the En
glish have produced since
George Bernard Shaw."
(Waugh's reply, several years
later to an interviewer who
asked what was his opinion of
Edmond Wilson: "Is he Ameri
can?" End comment.)
But Waugh was much more
than that, though millions of
his readers who read only
"Handful of Dust", and "Scoop,"
and"The Loved One," did not
know about the other dimen
sions; did not know that Evelyn
Waugh the great satirist was a

conservative, a traditionalist, a
passionately convinced and con
vincing Christian, a master styl
ist routinely acknowledged, dur
ing the last decade, as the most
finished writer of English prose.
Autobiography
He died at 62 having com
pleted only one volume of a
long autobiography. In it he re
corded, dispassionately, the im
pressions of his early years;
something of the lives of his
ancestors, many of them eccen
tric; and of the chaos of his un
dergraduate career at Oxford,
from which he was duly ex
pelled, as so many interesting
Englishmen are expected to be.
He decided, in his mid-twen
ties, that the thing to do was to
commit suicide, and he describ
es, as he would in a novel, his
own venture in this dramatic
activity—the verse from Eurip
ides about water washing away
the stains of the earth, neatly
exposed where it could not be
missed by grieving relatives
and meticulous coroners; wad
ing out into the ocean, thinking
diapasonal thoughts; then run
ning into a school of jellyfish,
and racing back to the beach,
putting on his clothes, tearing
up Euripides, and finishing his
career, for which we thank
God's little jellyfish.
Impossible Man
He was an impossible man, in
many respects. At least as far
as the public was concerned.
Like J. D. Salinger and James
Gould Cozzens, he simply re
fused to join the world of flack
ery and televised literature.
Rather than live a public life,
he situated himself in a large
old house in the country, sur
rounding himself with a moat
that was proof against all but
his closest friends, and the
vicar.
The piranhas made a specialty

of devouring all first-class mail
asking for interviews, com
ments, suggestions, whatever.
I discovered that the squire
felt an obligation to reply to all
letters concerning questions of
commerce; so that if you want
ed a comment or two on a mat
ter of literature or philosophy
or politics, you could hope to
get it by dropping into your let
ter a trivial question relating to
business.
Knew People
But he was a man of charity,
personal generosity, and, above
all, of understanding. He knew
people, he knew his century,
and, having come to know it, he
had faith only in the will of
God, and in individual man's la
tent capacity to strive towards
it. He acknowledged the need
to live in this century, because
the jellyfish will not have it
otherwise; but never, ever, to
acclimate yourself to it.
Mr. Scott-King, the classics
teacher, after his tour through
Evelyn Waugh's "Modern Eur
ope," comes back to school, and
there the headmaster suggests
that he teach some popular sub
ject, in addition to the classics—
economic history, perhaps, for
the classics are not popular.
"I'm a Greats man myself,"
the headmaster says."I deplore
it as much as you do. But what
can we do? Parents are not in
terested in producing the 'com
plete man' any more. They want
to qualify their boys for jobs in
the public world. You can hard
ly blame them can you?"
"Oh yes," Scott-King replies,
"I can and do." And, deaf to the
headmaster's entreaties, he de
clares, shyly but firmly, "I
think it would be very wicked
indeed to do anything to fit a

terested in producing the 'com
plete man' any more. They want
to qualify their boys for jobs in
the public world. You can hard
ly blame them can you?"
"Oh yes," Scott-King replies,
"I can and do." And, deaf to the
headmaster's entreaties, he de
clares, shyly but firmly, "I
think it would be very wicked
indeed to do anything to fit a
boy for the modern world."

I once encountered a very
Angry lady in Dallas, Texas,
who announced herself as head
of a vigilance committee to keep
dirty literature out of the local
libraries, and we talked a bit.
I forget just how the conver
sation moved, but at one point
I said that to pull out all the
salacious passages from modern
literature would require the end
of individual reading. All of us
would have to have private
readers, like the old eccentric
who forced his prisoner to read
to him the works of Charles
Dickens in the novel by Evelyn
Waugh.
Who, asked the lady book
critic, is Evelyn Waugh? The
greatest English novelist of this
century, I ventured; but, on
ascertaining that he was not
a dirty book writer, she lost all
interest, and went off to look
for more dirty books to rail
against.
Letter To Waugh
I wrote Waugh and told him
about the episode. My letter did
not include any reference to any
business matter, so I knew he
would not reply to it; but I
knew the little story would ap
peal to his sense of satire, so
strongly developed as to make
him, in the judgment of the
critic Edmund Wilson, the "only
first-rate comic genius the En
glish have produced since
George Bernard Shaw."
(Waugh's reply, several years
later to an interviewer who
asked what was his opinion of
Edmond Wilson: "Is he Ameri
can?" End comment.)
But Waugh was much more
than that, though millions of
his readers who read only
"Handful of Dust", and "Scoop,"
and"The Loved One," did not
know about the other dimen
sions; did not know that Evelyn
Waugh the great satirist was a

conservative, a traditionalist, a
passionately convinced and con
vincing Christian, a master styl
ist routinely acknowledged, dur
ing the last decade, as the most
finished writer of English prose.
Autobiography
He died at 62 having com
pleted only one volume of a
long autobiography. In it he re
corded, dispassionately, the im
pressions of his early years;
something of the lives of his
ancestors, many of them eccen
tric; and of the chaos of his un
dergraduate career at Oxford,
from which he was duly ex
pelled, as so many interesting
Englishmen are expected to be.
He decided, in his mid-twen
ties, that the thing to do was to
commit suicide, and he describ
es, as he would in a novel, his
own venture in this dramatic
activity—the verse from Eurip
ides about water washing away
the stains of the earth, neatly
exposed where it could not be
missed by grieving relatives
and meticulous coroners; wad
ing out into the ocean, thinking
diapasonal thoughts; then run
ning into a school of jellyfish,
and racing back to the beach,
putting on his clothes, tearing
up Euripides, and finishing his
career, for which we thank
God's little jellyfish.
Impossible Man
He was an impossible man, in
many respects. At least as far
as the public was concerned.
Like J. D. Salinger and James
Gould Cozzens, he simply re
fused to join the world of flack
ery and televised literature.
Rather than live a public life,
he situated himself in a large
old house in the country, sur
rounding himself with a moat
that was proof against all but
his closest friends, and the
vicar.
The piranhas made a specialty

of devouring all first-class mail
asking for interviews, com
ments, suggestions, whatever.
I discovered that the squire
felt an obligation to reply to all
letters concerning questions of
commerce; so that if you want
ed a comment or two on a mat
ter of literature or philosophy
or politics, you could hope to
get it by dropping into your let
ter a trivial question relating to
business.
Knew People
But he was a man of charity,
personal generosity, and, above
all, of understanding. He knew
people, he knew his century,
and, having come to know it, he
had faith only in the will of
God, and in individual man's la
tent capacity to strive towards
it. He acknowledged the need
to live in this century, because
the jellyfish will not have it
otherwise; but never, ever, to
acclimate yourself to it.
Mr. Scott-King, the classics
teacher, after his tour through
Evelyn Waugh's "Modern Eur
ope," comes back to school, and
there the headmaster suggests
that he teach some popular sub
ject, in addition to the classics—
economic history, perhaps, for
the classics are not popular.
"I'm a Greats man myself,"
the headmaster says."I deplore
it as much as you do. But what
can we do? Parents are not in
terested in producing the 'com
plete man' any more. They want
to qualify their boys for jobs in
the public world. You can hard
ly blame them can you?"
