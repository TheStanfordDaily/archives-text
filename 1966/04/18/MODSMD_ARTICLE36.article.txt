Dear Miss Bundle:

Dear Miss Bundle:
Miss Bundle, please! Why did
you send me this "Report"
thing? I'm in school, Miss Bun

and everything, and I'm taking
a full load of sixteen hours—
all of them for crcdit. I've paid
my tuition and my room and
board, and I don't owe anybody
any money and my grades are
good ("B" average), and my
father is a veteran. Please tell
me you're not serious, Miss Bun

Dear Miss Bundle:
Oh, Miss Bundle, why won't
you answer me? I told you in
my last letter about me being
in school. Nobody else is get
ting drafted here. Why me?
What did I ever do to you?
Miss Bundle, I was born in
Safe Harbor. I grew up there,
went to school there. My parents
paid taxes there. Is it because
we moved away after my Sopho
more year at Safe Harbor High?
Is that why you don't like me?
Miss Bundle, I love Safe Harbor.
In fact, I cried when my parents
told me we were going to move.
Will you please check your rec

answer me? Thanking you, I am

Dear Miss Bundle:
O. K. If that's the way you
want to play, I can play that
way too. If you won't answer
me, then I won't write to you

any more, either. Hoping you
are miserable.

Dear Miss Bundle:
Oh, you're sneaky, all right:
having an unlisted telephone
number. Well, there are other
ways to flop my mop. My father
knows the water commissioner
in Safe Harbor, and we'll sec
whether you stay on your
throne any longer. If you don't
answer one of my letters in five
days, that water commissioner
will be knocking on your door
t0...we11, wait and see, Miss
Bundle.
I am waiting,

Miss Mildred M. Bundle,
Clerk!
What do you mean by telling
me you made a mistake! You'd
better run, Mildred, because
when I get off this battleship
Safe Harbor won't be safe any
more. You can bet on that, Milly
baby. Arranging transportation
to lowa, I am,
Soon to be truly yours,
