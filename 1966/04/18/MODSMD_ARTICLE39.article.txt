ROOMMATES REVISITED
This morning's mail brought a letter from a student at
a prominent Western university (Princeton). "Dear Sir,"
he writes. "In a recent column you said it was possible to
get along with your roommate if you try hard enough.
Well, I'd like to see anyone get along with my roommate!
Mervis Trunz (for that is his name) practices the ocarina
all night long, keeps an alligator, wears knee-cymbals, and
collects airplane tires. I have tried everything I can with
Mervis Trunz, but nothing works. I am desperate, (signed)
Desperate."
Have you, dear Desperate, really tried everything? Have
you, for example, tried a measure so simple, so obvious,
that it is easy to overlook? I mean, of course, have you of
fered to share your Personna® Super Stainless Steel Blades
with Mervis Trunz?
To have a friend, dear Desperate, you must be a friend.
And what could be more friendly than sharing the bounty
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades? Who, upon en
joying the luxury of Personna, the nickless, scrapeless, tug
less, hackless, scratchless, matchless comfort of Personna,
the ease and breeze, the power and glory, the truth and
beauty of Personna—who, I say, after such jollies could
harden his heart against his neighbor? Nobody, that's who
—not even Mervis Trunz—especially not today with the
new Personna Super Blade bringing us new highs in speed,
comfort, and durability: And here is still a further bonus:
Personna is available both in Double Edge style and Injec
tor style.

No, dear Desperate, your problem with Mervis Trunz is
far from insoluble. In fact, as roommate problems go, it is
pretty small potatoes. Compare it, for example, to the clas
sic case of Basil Metabolism and E. Pluribus Ewbank.
Basil and E. Pluribus, roommates at a prominent East
ern university (Oregon) were at an impassable impasse.
Basil could study only late at night, and E. Pluribus could
not stay awake past nine p.m. If Basil kept the lights on,
the room was too bright for E. Pluribus to sleep. If E. Pluri
bus turned the lights off, the room was too dark for Basil
to study. What to do?
Weli sir, these two intelligent American kids found an
answer. They got a miner's cap for Basil! Thus, he had
enough light to study by, and still the room was dark
enough for E. Pluribus to sleep.
It must be admitted, however, that this ingenious solu
tion had some unexpected sequelae. Basil got so enchanted
with his miner's cap that he switched his major from 18th
Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after
graduation he had what appeared to be a great stroke of
luck: while out prospecting, he discovered what is without
question the world's largest feldspar mine. This might have
made Basil very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet dis
covered a use for feldspar. Today Basil, a broken man,
squeezes out a meagre living as a stalagmite in Ausable
Chasm.
Nor has E. Pluribus fared conspicuously better. Once
Basil got the miner's cap, E. Pluribus was able to catch up
on his long-lost sleep. He woke after nine days, refreshed
and vigorous —more vigorous, alas, than he realized. It was
the afternoon of the Dean's tea. E. Pluribus stood in line
with his classmates, waiting to shake the Dean's hand. At
last his turn came, and E. Pluribus, full of strength and
health, gave the Dean a firm handshake—so firm, indeed,
that all five of the Dean's knuckles were permanently fused.
The Dean sued for a million dollars and, of course, won.
Today E. Pluribus, a broken man, is paying off his debt by
walking the Dean's cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.

H e, the makers of Personna Maries and (he sponsors of this
column, will not attempt to expertize about roommates.
Hut ire trill tell you about a great shaving-mate to Personna

comes in regular and menthol.
