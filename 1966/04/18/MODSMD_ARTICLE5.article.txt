# Palo Alto Medical Clinic Proposes Two Hospitals
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
Stanford's bid to acquire Palo Alto's
share of the 420-bed Stanford-Palo
Alto Medical Center has been followed
by a suggestion that the city really
needs three hospitals.
Dr. Robert Jamplis, executive di
rector of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
told the Palo Alto City Council's fi
nance committee April 5 that the
"very worthwhile but diversified
goals" of the city's doctors can best
be served by the establishment of two
new hospitals, one for the Clinic and
the Palo Alto Medical Research Foun
dation, the other a community hos
pital.
The finance committee is still study
ing the University's proposal to lease
or purchase the city's share of 200
beds and 35 per cent of the existing
operating and laboratory facilities in
the Medical Center, but, as committee
chairman Councilman Robert Debs
said last week, "time is running out"
for the policy decision.
President Sterling made Stanford's
offer to Mayor Edward Arnold on
January 25. The delay since then has
been due to differences of opinion
among the three groups represented
in the present Medical Center.
Stanford Support
Some of these doctors work directly
for the Medical School, which has
grown rapidly since the hospital
opened in 1959. Others are affiliated
with the Clinic (300 Homer, Palo
Alto), which cooperates quite closely
with Stanford in such matters as stu
dent x-rays. The remaining doctors
are independent doctors on the regu
lar staff of the Medical Center, some
of whom hold Stanford faculty posi
tions.
Dr. Robert G 1 a s e r, dean of the
School of Medicine and author of the
report urging the University's Board
of Trustees to buy out Palo Alto's
share of the Medical Center, strongly
supports Dr. Jamplis' three-hospital
plan.
Mr. Robert Lindee, assistant dean
for administration and vice president
for medical affairs, said, "I think that
the University would find no fault
with the basic approach and philoso
phy as Dr. Jamplis outlined it."
The independent doctors, though,
according to Dr. Robert Hill, the
Medical Center's chief of staff, want
"to continue the dual-owner situation
as it now stands, but granting the
Hospital Board complete autonomy."

All the disputants acknowledge
what Dr. Jamplis calls "the absolute
uniqueness of the medical situation
in Palo Alto." This city's three groups
of "outstanding" and "dedicated"
practicioners have "the opportunity
to mold a real center of medicine
much like that which exists in Bos
ton . . . rather than a medical center."
One large 1000-bed community hos
pital, he added, "would kill this
dream." "Such an all-enveloping hos
pital under one roof would lead to
nothing but destruction."
Dr. Jamplis and his colleagues at
the Clinic believe that the three-hos
pital plan would eliminate the con
flicts evident at the Medical Center
without any problems of overlapping
or poor liason.
The Clinic and the Medical Re
search Foundation have jointly hired
an architect and a hospital consult
ant, who have been working fulltime
since July.
