# Health Service Balks At Government LSD Policy
## 
### 
The Stanford Health Service plans
to continue its present policy of not
reporting patients using LSD and re
lated drugs despite a recent Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) request
to do so.
Dr. Osborne, Health Service direc
tor, told The Daily that doctors at

present consider knov/ledge of LSD
use a privileged communication be
tween patient and doctor and as such
cannot be revealed. "Reporting will
not help the individual as a patient.
It won't accomplish very much for
himself or for others."
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Stu-

dents, said he had not at present seen
the FDA request and so could not
comment on it. "Stanford has not
made any reports at present," how
ever, he added.
Berkeley
The administration of the UC Cam
pus in Berkeley announced Friday
that it will not report students caught
using LSD. Arleigh Williams, acting
dean of students, said thÂ°re was no
intention of complying with the FDA
request.
Williams added that he always found
out about LSD cases from the police
department anyway, and assumed
they made necessary reports.
The FDA, alarmed at spiraling use
of LSD on college campuses, recently
sent the letter to all college adminis
trators. According to FDA officials
in Washington, the main purpose of
the letter was to inform officials of
the dangers of LSD use and warn
them- its easy availability on most col
lege campuses.
New Law
However, a new low to go into ef
fect on May 15 would require doctors
to report users to police authorities.
"This is not the way to handle the
problem," said Osborne. "If the law
is taken literally, it will require viola
tion of privileged communication be
tween patient and doctor." Osborne
will talk with the trustees within a
few days on the legal implications
of the problem.
Estimates of the per cent of stu
dents using LSD on college campuses
vary. Dr. Osborne refused to specu
late on its prevalence at Stanford.
San Francisco State officials estimate
that 5 to 10 per cent of their students
have used it. Local users, however,
put the figure much higher.
Only an 'Alert'
McKay McKinnon, San Francisco
director of the FDA, said the FDA let
ter was merely trying "to alert cam
puses and chemical suppliers to the
fact that the boys (college students)
can get an intermediate (chemical
product) and it's only a stone's throw
from there to the final product."
FDA Commissioner James Goddard
stated in the letter that "unless strong
concerted action is taken, an untold
number of our students may suffer
permanent mental and physical in
jury."
"Most LSD in illegal use is produced
by small synthesizing operations . . .
FDA has had reports that this has
been done in college laboratories."
At present the FDA plans a crack
down on LSD peddlers. Property of
those caught selling or producing LSD
will be liable to seizure. Anyone
caught selling LSD to a minor will
be subject to a two-year sentence and/
or $15,000 fine on second conviction.
The FDA will also infiltrate the LSD
"underground" with undercover
agents.
