# Howe Talks On Problems Of Intellectuals In Politics
## 
### 
The problems of the political responsi
bility of America's intellectuals were
laid open for discussion by Irving
Howe, a social reform author and
critic, during an address yesterday
at Cubberly Auditorium.
Howe's speech "Functions of a
Critic in America", the first of the
three Haas Memorial Lectures to be
presented this week, encouraged aca
demic circles to develop a serious
political consciousness. '' Pre s en t
trends in American intellectual life
move away from complacency," he
noted.
Necessity of Action
Stressing the necessity of action,
he expressed mixed emotions about
the campus "radicalism" of the times.
Howe, an English professor at Hunt
er College in New York, implied it
was unfortunate that the collegiate
protest was merely "an anti or nega
tive form of criticism." He felt that
"the radical must possess an idea of
Utopia, a possible and good society,
as a standard for day-to-day living."
The dissent of the campus groups,
generally narrowly based and pro
duced by a vocal minority, may
actually harm the growth of academic
political concern because it tends to
breed anti-intellectual feelings, he
continued. He views the college radi
cals as "trapped in a symbiotic re
lationship" with the middle class
society which they criticize.
Barren Complaints
After reviewing his own ideas on
Socialism, "the movement" of his own
youth, he stated that the dissatisfied
radical must seek to articulate demo
cratic values and to attain some goal.
Otherwise, his criticism may degener
ate into "barren complaints," he con
cluded.
Continuing the Haas Series, Profes
sor Mark Schorer of Berkeley and
Professor John Hawkes will speak
on further aspects of criticism in
in modern America. Schorer will pre

sent his views on Tuesday at 7:45
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, while
Hawks will complete the program on
next Sunday.
