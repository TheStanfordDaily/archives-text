The study of a sellout. The April
issue of Ramparts chronicles how
and why Michigan State University
abdicated its integrity in a
calculated search for gold and
glory in Vietnam; how it hired cops
and CIA agents and gave them
professorial status; why it bought
tear gas, guns, grenades for
Ngo Dinh Diem.
Ramparts documents what happens
when any major university puts its
academic credentials on lend
lease to American foreign policy.

special report and look around you.
CIA agents are all right in their place,
but they make damn poor teachers.
