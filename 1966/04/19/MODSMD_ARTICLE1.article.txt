# Social Scientists Defend ‘The Stanford Poll
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
Two Stanford professors have called re
cent attacks upon the Stanford Poll "a politi
cally biased attempt to discredit the group's
findings" on American attitudes toward the
Vietnam War.
The nation-wide survey, conducted by a team
of seven Stanford social scientists headed by
Professor Sidney Verba, found "widespread
public support for a more flexible American
bargaining position in Vietnam."
In a syndicated column in the Washington
Post, Rowland Evans and Robert Novak ac
cused the Stanford group of "a scandalous job
of rigging." They also charged the survey
"beclouds what Americans really feel about
the most confused war in the nation's his
tory."
Hints of Amateurism
Evans and Novak criticized the Stanford
group's wording of the 30-question survey,
and asserted the findings did not agree with
the results of other polls.
Verba flatly rejected any hint that the
Stanford pollsters were amateurs or had used
amateurish techniques in formulating the

survey. Each member of the seven man team
has had extensive experience in polling work,
Verba noted. Verba is co-author of The Civic
Culture, a study of political attitudes in five
western nations based on detailed surveying.
He denied "the Stanford group knew what
answers it wanted before it asked any ques
tions," as Evans and Novak have charged.
Some Were Not Pleased
"The answers to the questions did not please
some people. They assumed that the bias must
have come from the study," Verba said. The
members of the group have not discussed
their political views among themselves. How
ever Verba admitted there was "a range
from support of the present policy to strong
opposition" among the group.
In a letter to the Washington Post, the
group wrote, "As independent, academic so
cial scientists — not working for "political
clients"—we have had professional training
and experience in survey work, as Evans and
Novak have not."
"The point that Evans and Novak miss is
that one can do objective research in the field
which is not affected by the pollster's private
opinions," Verba maintained.

Although the poll found strong support for
such measures as a coalition government
which would include the Viet Cong, and a
truce negotiated by the United Nations the
Stanford professors do not believe American
foreign policy should be dictated by opinion
polls. "We are not suggesting the President
should read the poll and do what it says,"
Verba noted.
Instead, the results of the Stanford Poll
suggest: "some acceptable attitude within
which the President might seek a solution to
the war."
Noting Johnson's sensitivity to public re
action, Verba said, "The President can use
our data to see if he will get into a lot of
trouble politically" if he takes measures to
ward de-escalation."
Not Satisfied With Depth
The Stanford group was motivated to con
duct the survey because it was not satisfied
with the depth of professional surveys, which
the Administration had been following care
fully.
"If the President follows public opinion, it
is incumbent upon experts to do their best job
to find out what it is," Verba told The Daily.

He criticized the professional pollsters for
not publishing their questions along with their
findings.
Verba upbraided Evans and Novak for as
serting the Stanford Poll did not agree with
other national polls, for the columnists failed
to name their sources and the wording of
questions used.
Desire for De-escalation
The latest findings by the Harris and Gal
lup organizations show the same desire for
de-escalation which the Stanford Poll dis
covered. Dr. Richard Brody, a member of the
group, charged professional pollsters had not
been testing for sentiment favoring de-escala
tion, or at least had not published such re
sults.
"It was not until our poll that any kind of
dimension existed on the question," Brody
said.
Brody and Verba rejected criticism that the
poll only found American opinion too confused
to be meaningful. One third of the survey
was devoted to gauging Americans' degree
of knowledge about the Vietnam War.
'Substantial Level'
The American people possess "a substantial
level of information for a foreign policy ques

tion," Brody concludcd. An average of 45 per
cent of those polled correctly answered the
various questions, which asked for the capi
tal of North and South Vietnam, the identity
of the Viet Cong, and troop figures.
Considering the low degree of information
generally present among the public, Verba
and Brody consider the American public quite
well informed.
Preliminary studies of the correlation be
tween an individual's level of information and
policy choices found approval of de-escalation
differed little with the degree of information.
A Question of War and Peace
Asked if public opinion was meaningful de
spite a lack of thorough knowledge of the
war, Verba noted, "When it comes to the
question of war and peace, it seems to me this
is an issue for which public opinion becomes
more important."
The Stanford group admitted in a letter
to the Washington Post, "We found that some
people were confused. But we felt a profes
sional obligation to characterize our data more
completely than a simple label could."
Nevertheless Brody maintained the average
American's opinion is "not held out of ignor
ance or symbol manipulation."

"The answers to the questions did not please
some people. They assumed that the bias must
have come from the study," Verba said. The
members of the group have not discussed
their political views among themselves. How
ever Verba admitted there was "a range
from support of the present policy to strong
opposition" among the group.
In a letter to the Washington Post, the
group wrote, "As independent, academic so
cial scientists — not working for "political
clients"—we have had professional training
and experience in survey work, as Evans and
Novak have not."
"The point that Evans and Novak miss is
that one can do objective research in the field
which is not affected by the pollster's private
opinions," Verba maintained.

Although the poll found strong support for
such measures as a coalition government
which would include the Viet Cong, and a
truce negotiated by the United Nations the
Stanford professors do not believe American
foreign policy should be dictated by opinion
polls. "We are not suggesting the President
should read the poll and do what it says,"
Verba noted.
Instead, the results of the Stanford Poll
suggest: "some acceptable attitude within
which the President might seek a solution to
the war."
Noting Johnson's sensitivity to public re
action, Verba said, "The President can use
our data to see if he will get into a lot of
trouble politically" if he takes measures to
ward de-escalation."
Not Satisfied With Depth
The Stanford group was motivated to con
duct the survey because it was not satisfied
with the depth of professional surveys, which
the Administration had been following care
fully.
"If the President follows public opinion, it
is incumbent upon experts to do their best job
to find out what it is," Verba told The Daily.

He criticized the professional pollsters for
not publishing their questions along with their
findings.
Verba upbraided Evans and Novak for as
serting the Stanford Poll did not agree with
other national polls, for the columnists failed
to name their sources and the wording of
questions used.
Desire for De-escalation
The latest findings by the Harris and Gal
lup organizations show the same desire for
de-escalation which the Stanford Poll dis
covered. Dr. Richard Brody, a member of the
group, charged professional pollsters had not
been testing for sentiment favoring de-escala
tion, or at least had not published such re
sults.
"It was not until our poll that any kind of
dimension existed on the question," Brody
said.
Brody and Verba rejected criticism that the
poll only found American opinion too confused
to be meaningful. One third of the survey
was devoted to gauging Americans' degree
of knowledge about the Vietnam War.
'Substantial Level'
The American people possess "a substantial
level of information for a foreign policy ques

tion," Brody concludcd. An average of 45 per
cent of those polled correctly answered the
various questions, which asked for the capi
tal of North and South Vietnam, the identity
of the Viet Cong, and troop figures.
Considering the low degree of information
generally present among the public, Verba
and Brody consider the American public quite
well informed.
Preliminary studies of the correlation be
tween an individual's level of information and
policy choices found approval of de-escalation
differed little with the degree of information.
A Question of War and Peace
Asked if public opinion was meaningful de
spite a lack of thorough knowledge of the
war, Verba noted, "When it comes to the
question of war and peace, it seems to me this
is an issue for which public opinion becomes
more important."
The Stanford group admitted in a letter
to the Washington Post, "We found that some
people were confused. But we felt a profes
sional obligation to characterize our data more
completely than a simple label could."
Nevertheless Brody maintained the average
American's opinion is "not held out of ignor
ance or symbol manipulation."
Two Stanford professors have called re
cent attacks upon the Stanford Poll "a politi
cally biased attempt to discredit the group's
findings" on American attitudes toward the
Vietnam War.
The nation-wide survey, conducted by a team
of seven Stanford social scientists headed by
Professor Sidney Verba, found "widespread
public support for a more flexible American
bargaining position in Vietnam."
In a syndicated column in the Washington
Post, Rowland Evans and Robert Novak ac
cused the Stanford group of "a scandalous job
of rigging." They also charged the survey
"beclouds what Americans really feel about
the most confused war in the nation's his
tory."
Hints of Amateurism
Evans and Novak criticized the Stanford
group's wording of the 30-question survey,
and asserted the findings did not agree with
the results of other polls.
Verba flatly rejected any hint that the
Stanford pollsters were amateurs or had used
amateurish techniques in formulating the

survey. Each member of the seven man team
has had extensive experience in polling work,
Verba noted. Verba is co-author of The Civic
Culture, a study of political attitudes in five
western nations based on detailed surveying.
He denied "the Stanford group knew what
answers it wanted before it asked any ques
tions," as Evans and Novak have charged.

our data to see if he will get into a lot of
trouble politically" if he takes measures to
ward de-escalation."
Not Satisfied With Depth
The Stanford group was motivated to con
duct the survey because it was not satisfied
with the depth of professional surveys, which
the Administration had been following care
fully.
"If the President follows public opinion, it
is incumbent upon experts to do their best job
to find out what it is," Verba told The Daily.

He criticized the professional pollsters for
not publishing their questions along with their
findings.
Verba upbraided Evans and Novak for as
serting the Stanford Poll did not agree with
other national polls, for the columnists failed
to name their sources and the wording of
questions used.
Desire for De-escalation
The latest findings by the Harris and Gal
lup organizations show the same desire for
de-escalation which the Stanford Poll dis
covered. Dr. Richard Brody, a member of the
group, charged professional pollsters had not
been testing for sentiment favoring de-escala
tion, or at least had not published such re
sults.
"It was not until our poll that any kind of
dimension existed on the question," Brody
said.
Brody and Verba rejected criticism that the
poll only found American opinion too confused
to be meaningful. One third of the survey
was devoted to gauging Americans' degree
of knowledge about the Vietnam War.
'Substantial Level'
The American people possess "a substantial
level of information for a foreign policy ques

tion," Brody concludcd. An average of 45 per
cent of those polled correctly answered the
various questions, which asked for the capi
tal of North and South Vietnam, the identity
of the Viet Cong, and troop figures.
Considering the low degree of information
generally present among the public, Verba
and Brody consider the American public quite
well informed.
Preliminary studies of the correlation be
tween an individual's level of information and
policy choices found approval of de-escalation
differed little with the degree of information.
A Question of War and Peace
Asked if public opinion was meaningful de
spite a lack of thorough knowledge of the
war, Verba noted, "When it comes to the
question of war and peace, it seems to me this
is an issue for which public opinion becomes
more important."
The Stanford group admitted in a letter
to the Washington Post, "We found that some
people were confused. But we felt a profes
sional obligation to characterize our data more
completely than a simple label could."
Nevertheless Brody maintained the average
American's opinion is "not held out of ignor
ance or symbol manipulation."
Two Stanford professors have called re
cent attacks upon the Stanford Poll "a politi
cally biased attempt to discredit the group's
findings" on American attitudes toward the
Vietnam War.
The nation-wide survey, conducted by a team
of seven Stanford social scientists headed by
Professor Sidney Verba, found "widespread
public support for a more flexible American
bargaining position in Vietnam."
In a syndicated column in the Washington
Post, Rowland Evans and Robert Novak ac
cused the Stanford group of "a scandalous job
of rigging." They also charged the survey
"beclouds what Americans really feel about
the most confused war in the nation's his
tory."
Hints of Amateurism
Evans and Novak criticized the Stanford
group's wording of the 30-question survey,
and asserted the findings did not agree with
the results of other polls.
Verba flatly rejected any hint that the
Stanford pollsters were amateurs or had used
amateurish techniques in formulating the

survey. Each member of the seven man team
has had extensive experience in polling work,
Verba noted. Verba is co-author of The Civic
Culture, a study of political attitudes in five
western nations based on detailed surveying.
He denied "the Stanford group knew what
answers it wanted before it asked any ques
tions," as Evans and Novak have charged.
Some Were Not Pleased
"The answers to the questions did not please
some people. They assumed that the bias must
have come from the study," Verba said. The
members of the group have not discussed
their political views among themselves. How
ever Verba admitted there was "a range
from support of the present policy to strong
opposition" among the group.
In a letter to the Washington Post, the
group wrote, "As independent, academic so
cial scientists — not working for "political
clients"—we have had professional training
and experience in survey work, as Evans and
Novak have not."
"The point that Evans and Novak miss is
that one can do objective research in the field
which is not affected by the pollster's private
opinions," Verba maintained.

Although the poll found strong support for
such measures as a coalition government
which would include the Viet Cong, and a
truce negotiated by the United Nations the
Stanford professors do not believe American
foreign policy should be dictated by opinion
polls. "We are not suggesting the President
should read the poll and do what it says,"
Verba noted.
Instead, the results of the Stanford Poll
suggest: "some acceptable attitude within
which the President might seek a solution to
the war."
Noting Johnson's sensitivity to public re
action, Verba said, "The President can use
our data to see if he will get into a lot of
trouble politically" if he takes measures to
ward de-escalation."
