Tennis attracts the strangest
breed of spectators of any sport
played today. There is a certain
air about the game that is diffi
cult to describe. The white
clothes, the intense personal
competition, and the courtly
ethics of the game all combine to
dictate to the spectators the
rules for observing.
No one has ever put out a rule
book for tennis spectating, but
the rules are precise and the
penalty for failing to observe
them swift and sure. Regardless
of the level of play, the crowd
invariably reacts in the accepted
manner.
The first rule for watching
tennis is that partisanship is not
permitted, or at least must re
main very subdued. The raucus
cheering of the football stadium
is entirely out of place. The audi
ence for Friday's match with
USC was well aware of this rule.
Throughout the match the
spectators were quiet. They ap
plauded every good shot which
was made by a player from ei
ther school. At one point, a spec

tator who was obviously new to
the discipline of watching ten
nis, shouted out, "What a crappy
call that was." Nobody said a
word to him, but every face in
the crowd relayed its owner's
message of disgust.
Two of the most difficult tech
niques which must be mastered
if one is to become a professional
at the game of watching tennis
are to know when to applaud
and to know when to react to
the antics of the players. The
observers at the USC match
were well trained in both these
points. There was only applause
for good shots, and very little
reaction to the often uncourtly
gestures of disgust on the part
of many of the players.
Tennis is often considered to
be a dull game, that is followed
by dull, lifeless, colorless people.
This conception of tennis is only
held by those who are unaware
of the great discipline required
to correctly watch a match — a
discipline which makes these
spectators the most colorful in
the world of sports.
