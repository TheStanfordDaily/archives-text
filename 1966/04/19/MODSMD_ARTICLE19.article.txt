# AGAINST CAL
## Crucial Tennis Match Today 
### 
Stanford's netmen meet arch
rival California at 2:00 today on
the Encina courts. The teams
are deadlocked for third place in
conference action, and each is
considered to be among the top
five clubs in the country.
Although every match will be
a struggle, Coach Robert Renker
expects Stanford to finish ahead.
The doubles play should prove
to be the deciding factor.

Top man Jim Beste tangles
with Charles Darley. Earlier this
year, Darley defeated Beste, who
has shown marked improvement
since, having won a set from
Charlie Pasarell last weekend.
Brian Leek will play in the sec
ond spot; while Jaime Carroll,
John McCabe, John MePherson,
and Craig Baise round out the
top six singles spaces. The games
of the latter two have sharpened
recently.
