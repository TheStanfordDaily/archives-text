# A 						‘Yes’ On Contraceptives
## 
### 
The referendum on the University Health
Service's contraceptive policy, on which the stu
dent body will vote tomorrow and Thursday,
reduces a very complicated issue to an over
simplified choice of "Yes" or "No." But given
this choice, we feel that a vote in favor of the
Stanford Sexual Rights Forum's proposal—"that
the Associated Students of Stanford University
urge that the University Health Service be au
thorized to prescribe contraceptives to any stu
dent desiring them"—is the better alternative.
First it should be noted that should the refer
endum pass, little will be changed. The pro
posal only "urges," it does not set up a conflict
between University policy and ASSU law. And
if the comprehensive and well-though-out state
ment of Health Service Executive Director
Maurice Osborne (The Daily, Feb. 16) is any
indication, the policy will not be changed at stu
dents' urgings—at least not for the present.
But yet we persist in the feeling that the pres
ent policy should be modernized, that contra
ceptives should be made available to students
desiring them —and if the student body declares
its sentiments in that direction, the likelihood of
such a change at some future date will be in
creased.
Why this feeling on our part? Because we be
lieve that the responsibilities of the Health Ser
vice to provide for the student's needs, as well
as the right of the individual student to make
his own decisions, are adversely affected by the
present policy.
At the present, any woman on campus may

obtain contraceptives. The Health Service will
refer her to a private doctor who will provide
her with pills. She will have to pay from $15 to
$25 for the appointment, whereas most medical
treatment is provided by the Health Service at
no cost. But more importantly, the Health Ser
vice, by refusing to serve her because of its de
sire to avoid public controversy, is ducking its
medical responsibility to care for those who ask
its aid.
Moreover, the Health Service already distrib
utes contraceptives to women who are married
or about to be married. As the SSRF points out,
by restricting its practice in such a way, the
Health Service is casting a judgment on pre
maritial intercourse. This, we feel, is wrong, for
the judgment in such matters should be the stu
dent's. There are, of course valid objections to
this, such as the case of the individual who is
not sufficiently mature emotionally for inter
course. But we feel that some psychological
screening by the Health Service for women un
der 21 (which would still, unfortunately, require
value judgments) would be preferable to send
ing them to the outside world where they are
handed the pills after only physical screening.
We do not condone the SSRF's publicity
oriented approach to the pill problem—an ap
proach that has brought forth more disagree
ment than discussion—, but we do feel the goal,
that of allowing the individual to choose his own
sexual ethic while at the same time being al
lowed the services of the Health Service, is a
valid one.
