# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Could Students Be At Fault? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of recent letters have
tried to figure out what is wrong
with Stanford; one said it was
the faculty, another the adminis
tration. I'd like to add another
possibility — although I think
many factors are involved. My
idea is that the students are re
sponsible for the poor quality of
undergraduate education.
If the students really cared
about the lack of classroom stim
ulation, or about the lack of gen
uine learning opportunities in or
out of class, they would not let
the academic mediocrity con
tinue. The fact is that many Stan
ford students lead very narrow
lives, have very narrow minds,
and do not question the status
quo at all academic, socio-politi
cal, or intellectual. Thoy do what
is required of them academically
--most try to do it very well, to
got good grades- but outside of
this, they play no active role in
campus life; their only "activity"
is a very passive kind of social
life, in which they allow them
selives to be entertained, either
by pre-arranged parties, or mov
ies, or keg s of beer. I'm not
against any of those; but they're
not the only extracurricular ac
tivities possible.
Perhaps the biggest problem
is that the t' uly narrow-minded
students will not even read this
letter, or if they do, dismiss it
with, 'Well, what does he expect?'
If they do respond in this way, it
is only symptomatic of their
whole approach to college life
(and life in general)—a "what is
expected of me?" viewpoint. In
evitably, this viewpoint makes
for nothing but adjustment to
the existing social, academic, or
political system.
So, why is Stanford undergrad
uate education so mediocre? The
students have a lot to do with it.

• Redlands Vs. Stern
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is for the purpose
of supporting Mr. Stephen
Thompson's view of the Stern
Food Service (The Daily, April
15), through a comparison with
the food service at one other
University.
I am a transfer student from
the University of Redlands, a
small private school in Southern
California where food service is
provided for approximately the
same number of students as is
fed by the Stern Food Service.
Four areas of comparison might
prove interesting to Stern resi

dents:
• Cost: $450 per year (last
year) vs. $600 per year at Stan
ford.
• Three meals are served on
Sunday.
• Seconds are available for all
dishes served, with the single
exception of steaks.
• Steaks are served every
Saturday night without excep
tion.
The question is this: If a food
service of comparable size can
provide such as this for $450 per
year, why can't Stern or any
Stanford food service?

prove interesting to Stern resi

dents:
• Cost: $450 per year (last
year) vs. $600 per year at Stan
ford.
• Three meals are served on
Sunday.
• Seconds are available for all
dishes served, with the single
exception of steaks.
• Steaks are served every
Saturday night without excep
tion.
The question is this: If a food
service of comparable size can
provide such as this for $450 per
year, why can't Stern or any
Stanford food service?
TOM JOHNSON
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of recent letters have
tried to figure out what is wrong
with Stanford; one said it was
the faculty, another the adminis
tration. I'd like to add another
possibility — although I think
many factors are involved. My
idea is that the students are re
sponsible for the poor quality of
undergraduate education.
If the students really cared
about the lack of classroom stim
ulation, or about the lack of gen
uine learning opportunities in or
out of class, they would not let
the academic mediocrity con
tinue. The fact is that many Stan
ford students lead very narrow
lives, have very narrow minds,
and do not question the status
quo at all academic, socio-politi
cal, or intellectual. Thoy do what
is required of them academically
--most try to do it very well, to
got good grades- but outside of
this, they play no active role in
campus life; their only "activity"
is a very passive kind of social
life, in which they allow them
selives to be entertained, either
by pre-arranged parties, or mov
ies, or keg s of beer. I'm not
against any of those; but they're
not the only extracurricular ac
tivities possible.
Perhaps the biggest problem
is that the t' uly narrow-minded
students will not even read this
letter, or if they do, dismiss it
with, 'Well, what does he expect?'
If they do respond in this way, it
is only symptomatic of their
whole approach to college life
(and life in general)—a "what is
expected of me?" viewpoint. In
evitably, this viewpoint makes
for nothing but adjustment to
the existing social, academic, or
political system.
So, why is Stanford undergrad
uate education so mediocre? The
students have a lot to do with it.

Editor, The Daily:
This letter is for the purpose
of supporting Mr. Stephen
Thompson's view of the Stern
Food Service (The Daily, April
15), through a comparison with
the food service at one other
University.
I am a transfer student from
the University of Redlands, a
small private school in Southern
California where food service is
provided for approximately the
same number of students as is
fed by the Stern Food Service.
Four areas of comparison might
prove interesting to Stern resi

dents:
• Cost: $450 per year (last
year) vs. $600 per year at Stan
ford.
• Three meals are served on
Sunday.
• Seconds are available for all
