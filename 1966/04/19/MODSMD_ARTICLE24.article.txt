# Text Of SSRF Statement On The ‘Pill’ Referendum
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is
a statement by the Stanford Sex
ual Rights Forum on the upcom
ing student referendum on the
University Health Service's con
traceptive policy.)
Since the University Health
Service Contraceptive Policy
Referendum is coming before
the student body tomorrow and
Thursday, the SSRF would like
to clarify its position.
We believe that if the Health
Service were to prescribe con
traceptives for unmarried stu
dents, it would not be a change
in its basic philosophy. (Present
ly, unmarried students are re
ferred to private doctors, but are
eligible for Health Service pre
scriptions if they are willing to
take required blood tests as evi
dence of intent to marry.) The
decision to prescribe contracep
tives has already been made by
the Health Service.
Applying this decision to all
students on the same basis by
no means implies that the
Health Service would indulge
in "pill-vending"; under any cir
cumstances, a prescription is a
medical decision. Counseling is
certainly recommended, and
Health Service doctors perhaps
more than the referral doctors
should be aware of the particu
lar needs of students. We do not
expect a large number of pills
to be passed along to non-pi'e
scription-holders, any more than
this has resulted from prescrip
tion to married students, espe
cially since the number may be
restricted to only enough for the
student's own use.
All N»t Ready
Certainly Dr. Osborne is right
that some students are not ready
for pre-marital relations. Diffi
culty in securing contraceptives
can be used as an excuse, but
non-prescription by the Health
Service does not constitute gen
eral unavailability. The girl who
has come to rely on this argu
ment may be in a difficult situa
tion if she is confronted with a

fast-talking guy who can pro
vide pills; for the persons whom
Dr. Osborne terms "exploitative
and predatory" are probably the
most resourceful in obtaining
pills or other contraceptives. Re
liance upon the lack of contra
ceptives does not encourage re
sponsible decisions and gives a
false sense of security.
Since passing this referendum
would not directly alter the pres
ent Health Service procedures,
but express student opinion, and
while we agree that the Univer
sity must be responsive to the
opinion climate of those upon
whom it is dependent for sup
port, we also feel that the aca
demic community should play
a leading part in the shaping
of those opinions by serving as
a forum for discussion, argu
ment, and interchange of ideas.
How can we do this if stu
dents themselves, an essential
part of the academic community,
do not express their opinions?
While many students do not
themselves engage in pre-mari
tal relations, we are not con
vinced that they would oppose
other students choosing differ
ently.
Straightforward Approach
We agree with Dr. Osborne
that changes in sensitive areas
should be approached with dis
cretion, but we fear that "act
ing with discretion" may be
come not acting at all on con
troversial issues. We believe a
straightforward approach is
needed to focus attention upon
such issues and bring them out
into the open.
The interest of the press and
the general public in our buttons
rather than our arguments is
indicative of a deeper problem
of lack of communication on
this subject. The only position
we propose is the development
of a climate where the individual
determines his own moral code.
A person should not be pre
judged for what is ultimately
one of the most personal de
cisions he or she can make.
