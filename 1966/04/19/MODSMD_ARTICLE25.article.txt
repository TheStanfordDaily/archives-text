## LBJ Lets Hubert Play Ball 
### Art Bucbwald 
Vice-President Hubert Humph
rey threw out the first ball of
the baseball season at D. C. Sta
dium last week. How and why
the Vice-President was chosen
for this important task can now
be revealed.
The Vice-President was home
when he received a call from the
President.
"Hubert, I'm sorry to bother
you."
"Oh. that's all right, Mr. Presi
dent. Muriel and I were just go
ing over the plans for our new
$750,000 house."
"Fine. Hubert, I have a job
that I can only entrust to you."
"You want me to go back to
Vietnam and talk to the Budd
hists?"
"No, Hubert. It's trickier than
that. I want you to go out to
D. C. Stadium and throw out
the first ball of the baseball sea

son. Are you up to it?"
"Yes, sir, Mr. President. Does
that mean you're not going?"
After Hawaii. ..
"That's right. If I go out there
and throw out the first ball, that
means I'll commit myself to the
Washington Senators team, and
after Hawaii I'm not about to
commit myself to anybody."
"I think you're wise, sir. If
Washington loses, you can al
ways blame it on me."
"There's a couple of things,
Hubert. Where were you going
to throw the ball?"
"Where do you want me to
throw it, sir?"
"Throw it towards first base."
"That's exactly where I
thought I'd throw it."
"And don't put a curve on it.
If I threw it. they'd expect a
curve, but I think you'd look bet
ter if you threw it straight."

"I've got you, sir. What's the
White House policy as far as the
Washington Senators arc con
cerned?"
It Isn't Enough
"You can say we support
them, that we of course would
like them to win, but it isn't
enough just to win. There must
also be social and economic re
forms for the players. We want
nothing for ourselves. We just
want them to be happy and to
decide their own destiny with
out outside interference."
"That makes sense, Mr. Presi
dent. I'll draft a speech to that
effect."
"You'd better not make it a
speech. Hubert. They're sup
posed to play in the afternoon
and if you spoke they might be
forced to play a night game."
"I guess you're right, sir."
One more thing, Hubert. Don't

offer the Washington team any
financial aid. I know how you
get carried away."
"I won't, sir. I leaiTied my les
son in India."
"You can take my helicopter,
Hubert, and I'll send Jack Va
lenti along with you. He can help
you throw out the ball."
"I'd appreciate that, sir. Jack
can be very helpful at times like
this."
"Well, that's about it, Hubert.
I'll be watching you on TV and
I know you're going to make a
throw that will long be remem
bered."
"I'll put everything I've got
behind it, Mr. President."
"I'm sure you will, Hubert. I
put you on the Johnson team
because I knew you would al
ways be ready to go out there
and pitch."

"I'd appreciate that, sir. Jack
can be very helpful at times like
this."
"Well, that's about it, Hubert.
I'll be watching you on TV and
I know you're going to make a
throw that will long be remem
bered."
"I'll put everything I've got
behind it, Mr. President."
"I'm sure you will, Hubert. I
put you on the Johnson team
because I knew you would al

Vice-President Hubert Humph
rey threw out the first ball of
the baseball season at D. C. Sta
dium last week. How and why
the Vice-President was chosen
for this important task can now
be revealed.
The Vice-President was home
when he received a call from the
President.
"Hubert, I'm sorry to bother
you."
"Oh. that's all right, Mr. Presi
dent. Muriel and I were just go
ing over the plans for our new
$750,000 house."
"Fine. Hubert, I have a job
that I can only entrust to you."
"You want me to go back to
Vietnam and talk to the Budd
hists?"
"No, Hubert. It's trickier than
that. I want you to go out to
D. C. Stadium and throw out
the first ball of the baseball sea

son. Are you up to it?"
"Yes, sir, Mr. President. Does
that mean you're not going?"
After Hawaii. ..
"That's right. If I go out there
and throw out the first ball, that
means I'll commit myself to the
Washington Senators team, and
after Hawaii I'm not about to
commit myself to anybody."
"I think you're wise, sir. If
Washington loses, you can al
ways blame it on me."
"There's a couple of things,
Hubert. Where were you going
to throw the ball?"
"Where do you want me to
throw it, sir?"
"Throw it towards first base."
"That's exactly where I
thought I'd throw it."
"And don't put a curve on it.
If I threw it. they'd expect a
curve, but I think you'd look bet
ter if you threw it straight."

"I've got you, sir. What's the
White House policy as far as the
Washington Senators arc con
cerned?"
It Isn't Enough
"You can say we support
them, that we of course would
like them to win, but it isn't
enough just to win. There must
also be social and economic re
forms for the players. We want
nothing for ourselves. We just
want them to be happy and to
decide their own destiny with
out outside interference."
"That makes sense, Mr. Presi
dent. I'll draft a speech to that
effect."
"You'd better not make it a
speech. Hubert. They're sup
posed to play in the afternoon
and if you spoke they might be
forced to play a night game."
"I guess you're right, sir."
One more thing, Hubert. Don't

offer the Washington team any
financial aid. I know how you
get carried away."
"I won't, sir. I leaiTied my les
son in India."
"You can take my helicopter,
Hubert, and I'll send Jack Va
lenti along with you. He can help
you throw out the ball."
"I'd appreciate that, sir. Jack
can be very helpful at times like
this."
"Well, that's about it, Hubert.
I'll be watching you on TV and
