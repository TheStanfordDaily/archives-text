# CHAPARRAL
## Take A Second Look 
### STEVE GRUBER Humor Editor 
For months now there have been
rumors that the Stanford Chaparral
was alive in Argentina.
It will return to campus tomorrow.
This issue, the second of the year,
ranges from fair to outstanding. The
majority of the material is excellent.

The theme, " 'Tis better to have
lived and laughed than never to have
lived at all," is of major importance
to a student body that appears to have
lost the ability to laugh.
Girls of the Month
For those of you who like a little
sex with your humor, the Old Boy will
present Freya Schultz and Gayla Dish
ner as the girls of the month.
And don't forget Power Pie, the
Stanford woman who figuratively
sterilizes Superbeaver. This six page
comic spread is a parody of the Mar
vel Comics heroes.
There are even a few jabs at The
Daily in this issue. After the last re
view that was written about the
Chaparral, we could use it.
As you own your Chaparral, take
a look at page two. One full-page car
ton manages to sum up the commer
cial atrocity which is now Easter and
is worth the price of the magazine it
self.
Imperfections
Rut even the Chappie is not perfect.
The "Interdisciplinary Discipline" by
Bob Ashford had a good point, but
was not as funny at it was intended
to be.
"Gosh, Mister Wizard!" is composed
of five separate stories, all dealing
with the trash that is children's tele
vision. Two of these are brilliant, two
are mediocre, and the last is esoteric.
These failings are overpowered by
the good points of this issue. Even the
ads show a certain amount of class.
And don't miss the "Unabridged
Diary of Dean Allen" on page 59.
