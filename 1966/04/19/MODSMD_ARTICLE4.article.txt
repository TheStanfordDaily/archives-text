# Doolin Says Red Rift Not Ideological
## 
### 
Beneath the Sino-Soviet dispute's
trappings as an ideological word-war,
the Communist giant's clash really is
over "policy as it affects two historic
ally antagonistic nation-states," Dr.
Dennis J. Doolin said last night.
Political scientist Doolin traced the
"rift" between Moscow and Peking to
two practical power problems that
emerged a decade agoâ€”de-Staliniza
tion and Sputnik.
Three 'New Axioms'
The 33-year-old Doolin, research
curator of the East Asian collection at
the Hoover Institution, began from
three "new axioms" he said were laid
down by former Soviet Premier
Khrushchev in his famed de-Staliniza
tion speech before the 20th Party Con
gress in Moscow in 1956:
"Peaceful coexistence is not a mere
tactical expedient but a fundamental
principle of Soviet foreign policy"
that would lead to certain communist
victory. Secondly, "War is not fatalis
tically inevitable, and, last, there is an
increasing possibility that peaceful
transition to socialism will be effect
ed in certain capitalist countries."
Mao Critical of Stalin
While the Chinese Communists now
seem to regard these axioms as here
sy, Doolin noted, "it appears that at
the time Mao Tse-tung was not critical
of the tenets' 'revisionism" but rather
of the exposure of Stalin as a ruthless
and slightly mad tyrant. It is probably
that Mao viewed de-Stalinization as an
indirect attack upon his own Olym
pian position in the Chinese Commu
nist Party."
But Mao, the Stanford political sci
entist added, was not the only one
put on the defensive by the de-Stalini
zation speech of 1956. "The tragic up
heavals in Poland and Hungary were
direct effects of the speech," Doolin
explained, and placed Khrushchev
himself at a disadvantage.
