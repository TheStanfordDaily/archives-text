# Anti-Napalm Group Announces Petition Set For Referendum
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Managing Editor 
A group which hopes to prevent
the manufacture of napalm in Red
wood City reported yesterday that it
has more than enough signatures to
call for a referendum election on that
question.
The Redwood Committee Against
Napalm (RCAN) announced it has
between 3,100 and 3,200 names on a
petition to stop United Technology
Center from opening a napalm plant
May 2.
A referendum petitiion requires 2,-
400 signaturees. The city attorney has
declared, however, that the city char
ter does not authorize a referendum
vote on the approval of a plant sub
lease, only on leases.
But according to James Colianni,
an editor of Ramparts magazine and
a member of RCAN, it will be up to
the Redwood City Council to set a
date for a special election. "That's all
it has to do," he said last night.
The petition drive began April 1
after United Technology Center, a di
vision of United Aircraft Corp., sub
leased a plant from Standard Oil of
California. The Redwood City Port
Commission then approved construc
tion of the plant.

Dave Ransom, chairman of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam (SCPV) estimated last night that
about fifty Stanford students have
been involved "at various times" in
the drive. They have been organized
by the SCPV, he said. "We did a lot
of the mailing to the registered voters
in Redwood City," he explained.
He said he was opposed to the na
palm factory "because the people of
Redwood City are being asked to en
dorse a national policy of war, which
we feel is uncivilized and immoral.
Napalm has indiscriminately killed
thousands of citizens in Vietnam."
Norman S. Menifee, chairman of Ihe
Redwood City Port Committee, does
not feel such moral issues are his
responsibility. "It is not within our
jurisdiction," he said yesterday."It
is a matter for the Federal Govern
ment to determine."
Paul Brunkow, chamber of com
merce manager, was quoted in an
article by the Associated Press yester
day: "People have to face up to the
fact that we're engaged in the Viet
nam War and I don't see anything
wrong with Redwood City's contribut
ing with the war. There are worse
weapons."

day: "People have to face up to the
fact that we're engaged in the Viet
nam War and I don't see anything
wrong with Redwood City's contribut
ing with the war. There are worse
weapons."
A group which hopes to prevent
the manufacture of napalm in Red
wood City reported yesterday that it
has more than enough signatures to
call for a referendum election on that
question.
The Redwood Committee Against
Napalm (RCAN) announced it has
between 3,100 and 3,200 names on a
petition to stop United Technology
Center from opening a napalm plant
May 2.
A referendum petitiion requires 2,-
400 signaturees. The city attorney has
declared, however, that the city char
ter does not authorize a referendum
vote on the approval of a plant sub
lease, only on leases.
But according to James Colianni,
an editor of Ramparts magazine and
a member of RCAN, it will be up to
the Redwood City Council to set a
date for a special election. "That's all
it has to do," he said last night.
The petition drive began April 1
after United Technology Center, a di
vision of United Aircraft Corp., sub
leased a plant from Standard Oil of
California. The Redwood City Port
Commission then approved construc
tion of the plant.

Dave Ransom, chairman of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
nam (SCPV) estimated last night that
about fifty Stanford students have
been involved "at various times" in
the drive. They have been organized
by the SCPV, he said. "We did a lot
of the mailing to the registered voters
in Redwood City," he explained.
He said he was opposed to the na
palm factory "because the people of
Redwood City are being asked to en
dorse a national policy of war, which
we feel is uncivilized and immoral.
Napalm has indiscriminately killed
thousands of citizens in Vietnam."
Norman S. Menifee, chairman of Ihe
Redwood City Port Committee, does
not feel such moral issues are his
responsibility. "It is not within our
jurisdiction," he said yesterday."It
is a matter for the Federal Govern
ment to determine."
Paul Brunkow, chamber of com
merce manager, was quoted in an
article by the Associated Press yester
day: "People have to face up to the
fact that we're engaged in the Viet
nam War and I don't see anything
wrong with Redwood City's contribut
ing with the war. There are worse
weapons."
