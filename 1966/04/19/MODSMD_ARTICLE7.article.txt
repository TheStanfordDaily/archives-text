# ASSU Hopefuls Debate Education
## 
### 
A debate in Branner Hall last night
between five candidates for the ASSU
presidency resolved itself into a con
flict over the University's attitude
toward students.
Bob Fellmeth, Dave Harris, Steve
Ketchel, Bob Klein, and Carl Schmidt
participated in the debate, whose for
mat called for five minute opening
statements from each candidate fol
lowed by three minute rebuttals and
then questions from the floor.
According to Harris, the assump
tions that the Administration makes
about students are "degradations of
you and me." Harris feels that by im
posing social regulations and general
studies requirements on students, the
Administration implies that the stu
dents are not capable of governing
their own livees.
Restrict Students
Klein disagrees that these rules are
degradations. He feels that the Uni
versity should have some rules that
are "aimed at their obsolescence." He
feels that such rules will guide and
direct students rather than merely
restrict them.
Harris spoke of his part in solving
the Wilbur sponsor issue. He said that
he would not be opposed to such meth
ods as "starting rumors" and civil
disobedience, but only when necessary
because other means had failed.
In response to a question from the
floor, Schmidt saaid that he too might
suggest civil disobedience as a meth
od of obtaining what the students
knew to be correct.
He emphasized, however, that he
would first exhaust all other chan
nels, that he would not be hasty in
such a move, and that he did not en
vision it ever being necessary be
cause of the fact that when properly
researched and presented the stu
dents' goals should not be that far
distant from what the faculty and
administration wanted.
Open Meetings
Fellmeth stressed the idea that all
of the platforms were similar and that
what was needed was a "red-hot"
President to get some of the measures
effected.
Ketchel emphasized communication
in his introductory speech. He prom
ised weekly columns in The Daily,
Presidential visits to the living groups,
and open meetings with interested
students.
Ketchel was interrupted early in
his speech by Martin Gerry and his
fire extinguisher. While Gerry talked
of extinguishing the "flamers," his
running mate passed out a statement

that Gerry had not received and did
not expect to receive, the support of
the Board of Trustees, President Ster
ling, and Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler.
