# Deans Tell Mothers: 'University Must Face Facts'
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith yes
terday told the Stanford Mother's Club it
would not be the University's function to up
hold state liquor laws under the liberalized
liquor regulations now pending before the
Board of Trustees.
Smith and Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler discussed some of the current activities
of the Dean's office with 100 Stanford mothers
in the Branner lounge.
"We do not intend to encourage students to
violate state laws, but we do not accept the
responsibility of student violations of the
law," Smith said. "It is not the function of the
University to indulge in that sort of policing."
With the Individual
The Associate Dean for Student Organiza
tions stressed responsibility must rest with
the individual student.
Asked why he supported liquor on campus,
Smith told the mothers, "Stanford students
are part of a culture which condones drinking
by young people." He estimated 80 per cent

of incoming students use alcohol before com
ing to Stanford.
If the Board of Trustees accepts the pro
posed recommendations, liquor would be al
lowed in University residences and at social
functions held in residences, but would be re
stricted to those over 21 in accordance with
state law. However, Winbigler cast doubts on
the possibility of a beer-serving Rathskeller
in the planned addition to Tresidder Union.
Not in the Cards
"It is not in the cards for the University
to be able to serve beer in the Union under
the present circumstances," Winbigler noted
Questioned further on the liquor issue, Smith
said his support for changes in the present
policy "represented the conclusions of a fac
ulty committee that has spent the better part
of a year studying the problem."
He cited the hazards of students returning
to the campus after off-campus social affairs
at which liquor is served and the relative
hypcroeisy in the University's failure to en
force present regulations.

He said he was "uncomfortable in imply
ing the need for liquor to keep students on
campus." Yet he went on to note Stanford has
"less social life on campus than any other uni
versity I have ever been on."
Told by one of the mothers that parents
would probably wish their children not to
drink, Smith replied, "The wish does not con
tradict the fact that students do drink, and
we have to pay attention to the facts."
"Excessive drinking is much less of a prob
lem at Overseas Campuses," Winbigler said.
He believes a similar improvement would oc
cur on campus "when we get over the hurdle,
the no drinking verboten."
Corrective Action
Along with student cooperation, Winbigler
anticipated a "much more serious considera
tion of corrective action" for violators of the
new liquor policy.
Discussing either developments in the Dean
of Students Office, Winbigler outlined recent
efforts to update admissions procedures. For
merly applications were evaluated on a 10-

point scale which included both objective and
subjective factors.
With increased reliance on computers, the
Registrar's office estimates the applicant's
projected Stanford GPA based on objective
factors such as high school record and test
scores. This allows the Admissions Office to
pay more attention to subjective factors, the
applicant's activities and recommendations,
Winbigler said.
There are always a number of applicants
who are eminently qualified as well as those
who are patently not prepared who pose no
problem to the admissions officer. But Winbig
ler said, "The basic problem every year is that
there is a substantial band of students for
whom it cannot be said that one has a better
chance than another for success at Stanford."
Turning to the issue of grades in undergrad
uate classes, the Dean of Students commented,
"The registrar would be tremendously fas
cinated by the idea of getting rid of grades,
for it would make his work so much easier.
"We are looking for means of appraisal

of academic achievement that has no pres
sure connected with it,"he said. But Winbig
ler added with a grin, "The question is how
you eliminate pressure on this earth!"
Facts of life
During his address to the Mother's club
Dean Smith labeled the current wave of stu
dent activism "a fact of life within the con
temporary university," particularly in a uni
versity "as sophisticated as Stanford."
Referring to the Vietnam protestors and
Sexual Rights Forum among other activist
groups, Dean Smith said, "We must pay at
tention to the desire of students to live their
lives significantly."
He also outlined two areas in which "we
want to motivate students to make more
progress." There are recreational activities,
including non-varsity sports, and cultural par
ticipation.
"There is not an absence of culture at Stan
ford. What is disappointing is the lack of
attention non-participating students give to
these events," Smith commented.

Facts of life
During his address to the Mother's club
Dean Smith labeled the current wave of stu
dent activism "a fact of life within the con
temporary university," particularly in a uni
versity "as sophisticated as Stanford."
Referring to the Vietnam protestors and
Sexual Rights Forum among other activist
groups, Dean Smith said, "We must pay at
tention to the desire of students to live their
lives significantly."
He also outlined two areas in which "we
want to motivate students to make more
progress." There are recreational activities,
including non-varsity sports, and cultural par
ticipation.
"There is not an absence of culture at Stan
ford. What is disappointing is the lack of
attention non-participating students give to
these events," Smith commented.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith yes
terday told the Stanford Mother's Club it
would not be the University's function to up
hold state liquor laws under the liberalized
liquor regulations now pending before the
Board of Trustees.
Smith and Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler discussed some of the current activities
of the Dean's office with 100 Stanford mothers
in the Branner lounge.
"We do not intend to encourage students to
violate state laws, but we do not accept the
responsibility of student violations of the
law," Smith said. "It is not the function of the
University to indulge in that sort of policing."
With the Individual
The Associate Dean for Student Organiza
tions stressed responsibility must rest with
the individual student.
Asked why he supported liquor on campus,
Smith told the mothers, "Stanford students
are part of a culture which condones drinking
by young people." He estimated 80 per cent

of incoming students use alcohol before com
ing to Stanford.
If the Board of Trustees accepts the pro
posed recommendations, liquor would be al
lowed in University residences and at social
functions held in residences, but would be re
stricted to those over 21 in accordance with
state law. However, Winbigler cast doubts on
the possibility of a beer-serving Rathskeller
in the planned addition to Tresidder Union.
Not in the Cards
"It is not in the cards for the University
to be able to serve beer in the Union under
the present circumstances," Winbigler noted
Questioned further on the liquor issue, Smith
said his support for changes in the present
policy "represented the conclusions of a fac
ulty committee that has spent the better part
of a year studying the problem."
He cited the hazards of students returning
to the campus after off-campus social affairs
at which liquor is served and the relative
hypcroeisy in the University's failure to en
force present regulations.

He said he was "uncomfortable in imply
ing the need for liquor to keep students on
campus." Yet he went on to note Stanford has
"less social life on campus than any other uni
versity I have ever been on."
Told by one of the mothers that parents
would probably wish their children not to
drink, Smith replied, "The wish does not con
tradict the fact that students do drink, and
we have to pay attention to the facts."
"Excessive drinking is much less of a prob
lem at Overseas Campuses," Winbigler said.
He believes a similar improvement would oc
cur on campus "when we get over the hurdle,
the no drinking verboten."
Corrective Action
Along with student cooperation, Winbigler
anticipated a "much more serious considera
tion of corrective action" for violators of the
new liquor policy.
Discussing either developments in the Dean
of Students Office, Winbigler outlined recent
efforts to update admissions procedures. For
merly applications were evaluated on a 10-

point scale which included both objective and
subjective factors.
With increased reliance on computers, the
Registrar's office estimates the applicant's
projected Stanford GPA based on objective
factors such as high school record and test
scores. This allows the Admissions Office to
pay more attention to subjective factors, the
applicant's activities and recommendations,
Winbigler said.
There are always a number of applicants
who are eminently qualified as well as those
who are patently not prepared who pose no
problem to the admissions officer. But Winbig
ler said, "The basic problem every year is that
there is a substantial band of students for
whom it cannot be said that one has a better
chance than another for success at Stanford."
Turning to the issue of grades in undergrad
uate classes, the Dean of Students commented,
"The registrar would be tremendously fas
cinated by the idea of getting rid of grades,
for it would make his work so much easier.
"We are looking for means of appraisal

of academic achievement that has no pres
sure connected with it,"he said. But Winbig

With increased reliance on computers, the
Registrar's office estimates the applicant's
projected Stanford GPA based on objective
factors such as high school record and test
scores. This allows the Admissions Office to
pay more attention to subjective factors, the
applicant's activities and recommendations,
Winbigler said.
There are always a number of applicants
who are eminently qualified as well as those
who are patently not prepared who pose no
problem to the admissions officer. But Winbig
ler said, "The basic problem every year is that
there is a substantial band of students for
whom it cannot be said that one has a better
chance than another for success at Stanford."
Turning to the issue of grades in undergrad
uate classes, the Dean of Students commented,
"The registrar would be tremendously fas
cinated by the idea of getting rid of grades,
for it would make his work so much easier.
"We are looking for means of appraisal

of academic achievement that has no pres
sure connected with it,"he said. But Winbig
ler added with a grin, "The question is how
you eliminate pressure on this earth!"
Facts of life
During his address to the Mother's club
Dean Smith labeled the current wave of stu
dent activism "a fact of life within the con
temporary university," particularly in a uni
versity "as sophisticated as Stanford."
Referring to the Vietnam protestors and
Sexual Rights Forum among other activist
groups, Dean Smith said, "We must pay at
tention to the desire of students to live their
lives significantly."
He also outlined two areas in which "we
want to motivate students to make more
progress." There are recreational activities,
including non-varsity sports, and cultural par
ticipation.
"There is not an absence of culture at Stan
ford. What is disappointing is the lack of
attention non-participating students give to
these events," Smith commented.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith yes
terday told the Stanford Mother's Club it
would not be the University's function to up
hold state liquor laws under the liberalized
liquor regulations now pending before the
Board of Trustees.
Smith and Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler discussed some of the current activities
of the Dean's office with 100 Stanford mothers
in the Branner lounge.
"We do not intend to encourage students to
violate state laws, but we do not accept the
responsibility of student violations of the
law," Smith said. "It is not the function of the
University to indulge in that sort of policing."
With the Individual
The Associate Dean for Student Organiza
tions stressed responsibility must rest with
the individual student.
Asked why he supported liquor on campus,
Smith told the mothers, "Stanford students
are part of a culture which condones drinking
by young people." He estimated 80 per cent

of incoming students use alcohol before com
ing to Stanford.
If the Board of Trustees accepts the pro
posed recommendations, liquor would be al
lowed in University residences and at social
functions held in residences, but would be re
stricted to those over 21 in accordance with
state law. However, Winbigler cast doubts on
the possibility of a beer-serving Rathskeller
in the planned addition to Tresidder Union.
Not in the Cards
"It is not in the cards for the University
to be able to serve beer in the Union under
the present circumstances," Winbigler noted
Questioned further on the liquor issue, Smith
said his support for changes in the present
policy "represented the conclusions of a fac
ulty committee that has spent the better part
of a year studying the problem."
He cited the hazards of students returning
to the campus after off-campus social affairs
at which liquor is served and the relative
hypcroeisy in the University's failure to en
force present regulations.

He said he was "uncomfortable in imply
ing the need for liquor to keep students on
campus." Yet he went on to note Stanford has
"less social life on campus than any other uni
versity I have ever been on."
Told by one of the mothers that parents
would probably wish their children not to
drink, Smith replied, "The wish does not con
tradict the fact that students do drink, and
we have to pay attention to the facts."
"Excessive drinking is much less of a prob
lem at Overseas Campuses," Winbigler said.
He believes a similar improvement would oc
cur on campus "when we get over the hurdle,
the no drinking verboten."
Corrective Action
Along with student cooperation, Winbigler
anticipated a "much more serious considera
tion of corrective action" for violators of the
new liquor policy.
Discussing either developments in the Dean
of Students Office, Winbigler outlined recent
efforts to update admissions procedures. For
merly applications were evaluated on a 10-

point scale which included both objective and
subjective factors.
