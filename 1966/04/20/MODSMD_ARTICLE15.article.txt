# The 						Candidates Speak Out On The Issues

What should be the student's
role in the university?
Education must be conceived
broadly. It transcends class
rooms and books. A successful
education should include social
awareness—and a willingness to
act on what one perceives. To
Otis Pease, this means:
"A great university may
choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is gen
erate curiosity and a sense of
commitment among its students
and teachers. And therein lies a
paradox. Curiosity is nothing
less than a desire to find a truth
about something; commitment
involves the desire to act on
what one believes to be the
truth."
The goal, then, is for the stu
dent "to learn how he may fuse
curiosity and commitment so
that each, in reinforcing the oth
er, may together give life to his
mind where singly they would
destroy it."
Curiosity involves an aware
ness of the university communi
ty, its goals and functions. Our
"new commitment" means that
a student, while his first con
cern should be to sharpen his
own tools of scholarship, should
also be ready to act on what he
perceives. He should criticize
and participate in the decisions
which would mould his commu
nity of Stanford and the broader
Community where Stanford
should play a part.
What do you think the gov
ernment's policy should be on
drafting- students out of college,
and how do you foresee that you
might attempt to have this pol
icy brought about at Stanford?
Each student has a responsi
bility for military service. But
short of a major war, students
should not be drafted. Because
of the independence of local
boards and the quixotic whimsy
of supposing Stanford student
officers to affect national pol
icy, the efforts of the ASSU can
at best buttress those of the
University.
What is your position on Stan
ford's social regulations, open
house hours, and contraceptive
prescribing policy?
Social regulations directly af
fect only Stanford women;
therefore, social regulations pol
icy should be completely under
the jurisdiction of a social regu
lations committee of the AWS.
To govern social regulations and
women's affairs AWS should be
autonomous from the legisla
ture and thereby from men's
control.
What is your position on
rush?
We are confident that IFC
IHC-ICC will continue to gov
ern rush judiciously
Do you favor any specific
changes in Stanford's academic
structure?
• A voluntary pass-fail sys
tem for all courses outside the
major.
• At least ten units of in
dependent study in a major
should be permissable for every
body ;not just honors students.
