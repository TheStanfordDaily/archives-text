Question One: In Theory
there is no reason why we stu
dents should not be represented
on almost every single univer
sity policy-making committee. In
practice, all of us are lulled into
apathy. But part of the problem
is that no one is willing to lead
the fight against apathy.
How many times have we
even heard about student perfor
mances on these committees?
How many times have we even
heard an ASSU president even
casually mention the commit
tees which he helps to hand
pick?
Participation
Student participation has not
seemed exciting partly because
the ASSU president has not been
exciting. He has not publicized
his own committees, he had not
made the mere gesture of dining
with each living group, and he
has not made a strong enough
effort to lead LASSU.
A president who pushes and
publicizes student participation
is not a full answer to apathy,
but it is surely better than what
we have now.
Question Two: The govern
ment draft policy is about as
fair as it can be under existing
circumstancees. Given these
long-standing policies of a bu
reaucratic system, a uniform
standard of grades and test
scores is near to an optimum
condition.
Social Regs
Question Three: There is little
point in proposing a change in
social regs at this time because
we have barely seen how effec
tive are the new set of regula
tions. The contraceptive ques
tion we feel is not a campaign
issue in that it is more a ques
tion for the general community
and not for complete discussion
by the student candidates. We
do feel, however, that there
should be no arbitrary criteria
for the distribution of contra
ceptives if they were to be sold
by the Health Service.
Question Four: The ASSU has
not in the past intervened in
rush policy. Given the right for
the LASSU to investigate mat
ters of this sort of course, there
is no other reason why ASSU
should put its nose where it is
not needed or wanted. The Ad-
Hoc committee on rush and the
Executive Committee on Rush
Policy (Presidents of IFC, ICC,
IHC, Head Wilbur Sponsor)
have taken an admirable and
positive approach to the solu
tion of current rush problems.
Why interfere?
Flexibility
Question Five: We favor the
implementation of a limited
pass-fail system on a trial basis.
This would allow greater flexi
bility in course selection.
We favor a "free course" for
qualified seniors. After three
years of syllabi, requirements
and papers, we feel a student
should be given the chance to
do something significant he
wants to do in any advised way
he wants to do it.
A re-evaluation of the Stan
ford "curve" should be included
in the exhaustive study that uni
versity officers are currently
considering.
We also favor re-evalution by
this group the current senior
colloquia and also the General
Studies requirement itself.
