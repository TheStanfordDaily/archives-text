Question One: The University
should have a "one scholar, one
vote government. The Board of
Trustees should not be a self
perpetuating body. It should be
elected by all scholars, members
for four-year terms, some elect
ed every year. To avoid "conflict
of interest" and "special infor
mation' 'problems, students and
faculty should not run.
The legislative body of the
University should be made up
of and elected by all scholars—
students, faculty, and academic
administration. All Committees
of the University, student, facul
ty, and administrative, should
flow from this body, although
the President would direct many
of them.
Right now we propose: facul
ty members on LASSU, one for
every faculty, many committees
of fifteen to do in-depth studies
of crucial issues, students on
the subcommittees of the Aca
demic Council as voting mem
bers.
Blowing: Best Brains
Question Two: We see little
reason why, if America must
blow the brains out of its youth,
it should use the best brains.
College attendance is not really
a good measure, though, since
it discriminates de facto against
minority and poverty-stricken
groups, and is more a badge of
socio-economic-status than much
else.
Rather, we propose a ration
ality test, made up of a law al
lowing conscientious objection
to a particular war. Anybody
who would support a war as ir
rational as the one in Vietnam
would obviously flunk the test.
Voluntary Regs
Question Three: Put all social
regulations on a voluntary basis
as soon as possible. They are
simply a bureaucratic way of
imposing one moral code over
others, but if somebody wants
to pass the buck to the rules,
let him. Men should have this
opportunity, too.
Contraceptives should be avail
able in the Health Service and
a pharmacy should be opened
on campus. Let the little old
ladies in Palo Alto storm the
President's office if they like,
most of them are too old to feel
the danger.
Question Four: Rush should
be abolished. Mike has been
through the fraternity bit, and
last year helped write, "A Sec
ond Look," an examination of
the fraternities. Dave, as a spon
sor, has seen some of the un
fortunate effects of rush on
some freshmen.
All on-campus living groups
should participate in a draw sys
tem, and all students should be
able to choose to live on- or off
campus. We're not against fra
ternities.
We also favor a more liberal
attitude toward homosexuality.
Grading
Question Five: Grading should
be "pass-fail" or paragraph sum
maries of a student's work for
all courses. General Studies re
quirements should be abolished.
Students should still have to
take 180 units of work for a
Bachelor's degree. The residence
requirement should be reduced
so that students could take in
dependent study away from the
University for part of their
work.

The Daily asked each of the
eight teams of candidates for
the ASSU presidency-vice pres
idency to answer the following
five questions:
• One: What should be the
student's role in the University?
• Two: What do you think
the government's policy should
be on drafting students out of
college, and how do you fore
see that you might attempt to
have this policy brought about
at Stanford?
• Three: What is your posi
tion on Stanford's social regula
tions, open house hours, and
contraceptive prescribing
policy?
• Four: What is your posi
tion on rush?
• Five: Do you favor any
specific changes in Stanford's
academic structure (i.e. grad
ing, General Studies, major re
quirements), and if so what?
The candidates' written re
plies are printed on this page.
