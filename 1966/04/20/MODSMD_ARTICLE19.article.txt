Question Two: The govern
ment's draft policy is tradition
ally determined by the govern
ment and not by the various can
didates for ASSU president (or
even LASSU).
Question Three: "Open hous
es" should be extended both in
length and number, and social
regulations for women can be
liberalized down the line. Re
garding contraceptives, every
Stanford man can walk down to
the local Rexall and plunk down
his six bits like all the unfortu
nates who live outside the aca
demic womb.
Question Four: Rush? Every
one should take his time.
Questions One Through Five:
Here is where the real
efforts of student government
should be concentrated. There
are often serious problems with
the curricula at the overseas
campuses; senior colloquias are
often taught from a busy-work
or parochial point of view;
courses are suddenly dropped by
departments without warning or
explanation.
Such are the problems that
must be dealt with—the solu
tions are long overdue.
Undergraduates have long
complained of sterility in stu
dent-faculty relations. The reso
lution of these problems lies in
greater student involvement, not
only on all faculty and adminis
trative committees, but in elect
ing responsible representatives
to LASSU, and in giving their
own time and effort to see that
their goals are fulfilled.
The student's role in the Uni
versity should be as an active
member, or a silent one.
