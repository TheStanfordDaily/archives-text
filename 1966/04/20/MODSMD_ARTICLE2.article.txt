# Petrovich Emphasizes Dialectical Materialism
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
"Philosophers so far have only in
terpreted the world in various ways;
the point is to change it." This belief,
according to Professor Gajo Petro
vich, is Karl Marx's basic contribu
tion to philosophy.
Petrovich, a professor at the Uni
versity of Zagreb in Yugoslavia, last
night analyzed Marx as a philosopher
and as a dialectic materialist.
According to Pctrovich, critics are
still debating whether or not Marx
can be considered a philosopher. His
concentration in such fields as eco
nomics and politics rather than tra
ditional philosophical disciplines such

as ethics and logic is often used as
an argument.
Marx's view of philosophy, how
ever, is that it cannot be separated
from social, economic, or political
thought.
Philosophy of Change
"Marx's philosophy differs from
traditional modes of thought in that
it emphasizes change, not interpreta
tion," claimed Petrovich. "It is a
philosophy of action and deed. It
doesn't remain theory but demands
change and participation."
"Action for Marx is not added to
philosophy from the outside but fol
lows directly from the essence of its
theoretical content," continued Petro
vich. "His essential thesis is the tran
sition from theory to action."
Marx's doctrine, according to Petro
vich, includes two basic concepts: na
turalistic humanism and dialectical
materialism.
Naturalistic humanism, he explain
ed, is a belief in man as a being free
for action and capable of changing
himself and the world. Petrovich saw
this idea as philosophical in that it
considers not just man but the ab
stract quality of "being." Being, for
Marx, means acting and changing.
Dialectical Materialism
Dialectical materialsim, Petrovich
continued, is often considered by
critics to be non-philosophical and in
contradiction to the idea of natural
istic humanism.
Materialism as a concept generally
divides the world into two opposites,
spirit and matter. "Dialectic" implies
that there are general laws accord
ing to which everything acts. Both
these concepts are irreconcilable with
Marx's conception of man.
Petrovich repeated Marx's defin
ition of philosophy as change, not in
terpretation, and emphasized that
Marx's dialectical materialism should
be viewed as a philosophical concep
tion.
" It should be criticized objectively,
not simply accepted or discarded."
Professor Petrovich's lecture, pre
sented at 8:15 in Tresidder, was part
of the continuing series sponsored by
the Hume Society.

sition from theory to action."
Marx's doctrine, according to Petro
vich, includes two basic concepts: na
turalistic humanism and dialectical
materialism.
Naturalistic humanism, he explain
ed, is a belief in man as a being free
for action and capable of changing
himself and the world. Petrovich saw
this idea as philosophical in that it
considers not just man but the ab
stract quality of "being." Being, for
Marx, means acting and changing.
Dialectical Materialism
Dialectical materialsim, Petrovich
continued, is often considered by
critics to be non-philosophical and in
contradiction to the idea of natural
istic humanism.
Materialism as a concept generally
divides the world into two opposites,
spirit and matter. "Dialectic" implies
that there are general laws accord
ing to which everything acts. Both
these concepts are irreconcilable with
Marx's conception of man.
Petrovich repeated Marx's defin
ition of philosophy as change, not in
terpretation, and emphasized that
Marx's dialectical materialism should
be viewed as a philosophical concep
tion.
" It should be criticized objectively,
not simply accepted or discarded."
Professor Petrovich's lecture, pre
sented at 8:15 in Tresidder, was part
of the continuing series sponsored by
the Hume Society.
"Philosophers so far have only in
terpreted the world in various ways;
the point is to change it." This belief,
according to Professor Gajo Petro
vich, is Karl Marx's basic contribu
tion to philosophy.
Petrovich, a professor at the Uni
versity of Zagreb in Yugoslavia, last
night analyzed Marx as a philosopher
and as a dialectic materialist.
According to Pctrovich, critics are
still debating whether or not Marx
can be considered a philosopher. His
concentration in such fields as eco
nomics and politics rather than tra
ditional philosophical disciplines such

as ethics and logic is often used as
an argument.
Marx's view of philosophy, how
ever, is that it cannot be separated
from social, economic, or political
thought.
Philosophy of Change
"Marx's philosophy differs from
traditional modes of thought in that
it emphasizes change, not interpreta
tion," claimed Petrovich. "It is a
philosophy of action and deed. It
doesn't remain theory but demands
change and participation."
"Action for Marx is not added to
philosophy from the outside but fol
lows directly from the essence of its
theoretical content," continued Petro
vich. "His essential thesis is the tran
sition from theory to action."
