Students must begin to con
sider themselves as a part of
the University, "not just four
year house guests. This year
students have demonstrated,
particularly through their work
on departmental committees
that they are concerned with
curriculum reform, that they
can be innovators as well as
critics.
Next year is crucial. We have
an opportunity to capitalize on
the excellent work done by stu
dents this year. It is necessary
for the ASSU to rise above the
parochial concerns of student
government organization and ac
cept responsibility for taking a
constructive role in the univer
sity.
Representation
Students should be repre
sented, with vote wherever pos
sible, on all university commit
tees concerned with undergradu
ate education, general studies
(including overseas campuses),
admissions, and university plan
ning and development. The ac
tivity of the Education Commis
sion should be intensified and
the university should provide
staff help to expedite and facili
tate their efforts.
Students should have in
creased opportunities to pursue
courses of independent study
and directed reading, to do origi
nal research over more than one
quarter even if they are not
honors students.
Those students who would
most benefit from this kind of
study are very frequently those
who are presently disqualified.
Dead week should be truly dead,
allowing for reading and in
creased opportunities for stu
dent-professor contact, but with
no classes or assignments due.
Special Assistant
In the area of housing and
residence policy the ASSU Presi
dent should appoint a special as
sistant responsible for investiga
tion of housing problems such as
noise, irregular heating and ven
tilation, inadequate study and
lounge facilities and the like. All
senior women and women over
21 should have the option of liv
ing off-campus.
An explanation of the an
nounced increase in room and
board rates should be obtained,
and the increased revenues
should go into dorm improve
ment.
Students have shown that
they will act responsibly if treat
ed responsibly.
Social regulations should as
much as possible be the concern
of the students directly in
volved. Close ties between the
Social Regulations Committee
and any of the large organs of
student government are unde
sirable in this respect. I agree
with the notion that each living
group should be able to deter
mine its own policy on open
houses.

Finally, it is vital that capa
ble freshmen and sophomores be
involved in the work of the
ASSU and the University—in
staff positions on the Education
Commission, in research and
backup positions to student
members of university commit
tees.

Students must begin to con
sider themselves as a part of
the University, "not just four
year house guests. This year
students have demonstrated,
particularly through their work
on departmental committees
that they are concerned with
curriculum reform, that they
can be innovators as well as
critics.
Next year is crucial. We have
an opportunity to capitalize on
the excellent work done by stu
dents this year. It is necessary
for the ASSU to rise above the
parochial concerns of student
government organization and ac
cept responsibility for taking a
constructive role in the univer
sity.
Representation
Students should be repre
sented, with vote wherever pos
sible, on all university commit
tees concerned with undergradu
ate education, general studies
(including overseas campuses),
admissions, and university plan
ning and development. The ac
tivity of the Education Commis
sion should be intensified and
the university should provide
staff help to expedite and facili
tate their efforts.
Students should have in
creased opportunities to pursue
courses of independent study
and directed reading, to do origi
nal research over more than one
quarter even if they are not
honors students.
Those students who would
most benefit from this kind of
study are very frequently those
who are presently disqualified.
Dead week should be truly dead,
allowing for reading and in
creased opportunities for stu
dent-professor contact, but with
no classes or assignments due.
Special Assistant
In the area of housing and
residence policy the ASSU Presi
dent should appoint a special as
sistant responsible for investiga
tion of housing problems such as
noise, irregular heating and ven
tilation, inadequate study and
lounge facilities and the like. All
senior women and women over
21 should have the option of liv
ing off-campus.
An explanation of the an
nounced increase in room and
board rates should be obtained,
and the increased revenues
should go into dorm improve
ment.
Students have shown that
they will act responsibly if treat
ed responsibly.
Social regulations should as
much as possible be the concern
of the students directly in
volved. Close ties between the
Social Regulations Committee
and any of the large organs of
student government are unde
sirable in this respect. I agree
with the notion that each living
group should be able to deter
mine its own policy on open
houses.
Frosh and Sophs
Finally, it is vital that capa
ble freshmen and sophomores be
involved in the work of the
ASSU and the University—in
staff positions on the Education
Commission, in research and
backup positions to student
members of university commit
tees.
