We think the most significant
issue that will be facing student
government in the next few
years will be the students role
in the university. Many tradi
tional concepts of education, es
pecially undergraduate educa
tion are in a state of flux.
In our opinion we must con
tinue to move in the direction
of closer integration of the en
tire academic community.
Proposals
Along these lines we propose:
• Expanded student participa
tion on all university commit
tees, except special faculty com
mittees, including the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education
and the undergraduate admis
sions committee.
• Implementation of a pass
fail system in several of our
courses may also encourage stu
dents to increase their liberal
arts education. A student should
not be prevented from taking a
course that will broaden his edu
cational background by the fear
that it will hurt his college rec
ord.
• Making senior colloquia op
tional for both B.S. and B.A.
candidates.
Invaluable Asset
Students are an invaluable
asset to the nation. As such we
believe that draft boards should
go as far out of their way as
possible to allow students to
complete their education.
As far as open houses go we
feel that each living group
should be able to determine its
own regulations.
It is our belief that Stanford
women are mature enough to
make their own decisions with
regard to the use of contracep
tive devices. Prescription of
these devices requires medical
consultation. Insofar as the
Health Service has the physical
capability of performing this
function we think they should.
In spite of the imperfections
of Stanford's rush system this
still remains the most effective
system for men to choose their
proposed living groups.
