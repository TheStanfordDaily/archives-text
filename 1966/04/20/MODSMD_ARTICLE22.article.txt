The student should be the Uni
versity; i.e., their wishes within
law and reason should be the
basis for all administration de
cisions. There should be no ques
tion of students sitting on fac
ulty and administration commit
tees, rather the question should
be, "Shall faculty and adminis
tration members sit on student
committees?"
Students should be in full con
trol of all bodies which formu
late rules for conduct. It is well
known that a student will pay
no attention to a rule that he
doesn't like and thinks he can
break without getting caught or
if the penalties will not be se
vere.
Tho Draft
I feel that the government is
entitled to draft whom it sees
fit. Students are laboring under
a misconception that they de
serve not to be drafted.
If a student is not willing to
work to earn his deferment I
see no reason why he should
continue to get it. I realize, how
ever, that it is the duty of every
American boy to dodge the draft
as long as possible.
Stanford's social regulations
are the pits. True, they have
been getting better all the time.
For seniors and juniors they
really don't exist. For Freshmen
and Sophomores, however, they
place an unnecessary restriction
on freedom. Any social regula
tion at all simply says, "You
can't be trusted."
Open Honrs
Open house hours at this Uni
versity are a ticklish situation;
primarily because some of us
are more studly than others. Un
til every room on campus has its
own private entrance, I am
afraid that these hours will have
to be determined by the ma
jority of each house.
There is no question in my
mind that the University Health
Service should distribute con
traceptives to any and all stu
dents who meet the legal and
medical requirements for obtain
ing such medication.
Rush should be abolished.
Fraternities play the same de
structive role to the freshman
psyche that sororities did many
years ago. While we cannot out
law fraternities we can get rid
of rush and put the houses on
a draw system.
Academic Structure
The academic structure of the
university should be changed in
the following ways:
• Grades should be abolished;
simple pass or fail is good
enough.
• General studies require
ments and major requirements
should be broadened; elective
courses and source materials for
all courses should be chosen by
the students taking that course.
• The quality of a professor
should at no time be allowed to
be judged by parental or alumni
pressure.

I feel that the government is
entitled to draft whom it sees
fit. Students are laboring under
a misconception that they de
serve not to be drafted.
If a student is not willing to
work to earn his deferment I
see no reason why he should
continue to get it. I realize, how
ever, that it is the duty of every
American boy to dodge the draft
as long as possible.
Stanford's social regulations
are the pits. True, they have
been getting better all the time.
For seniors and juniors they
really don't exist. For Freshmen
and Sophomores, however, they
place an unnecessary restriction
on freedom. Any social regula
tion at all simply says, "You
can't be trusted."
Open Honrs
Open house hours at this Uni
versity are a ticklish situation;
primarily because some of us
are more studly than others. Un
til every room on campus has its
own private entrance, I am
afraid that these hours will have
to be determined by the ma
jority of each house.
There is no question in my
mind that the University Health
Service should distribute con
traceptives to any and all stu
dents who meet the legal and
medical requirements for obtain
ing such medication.
Rush should be abolished.
Fraternities play the same de
structive role to the freshman
psyche that sororities did many
years ago. While we cannot out
law fraternities we can get rid
of rush and put the houses on
a draw system.
Academic Structure
The academic structure of the
university should be changed in
the following ways:
• Grades should be abolished;
simple pass or fail is good
enough.
• General studies require
ments and major requirements
should be broadened; elective
courses and source materials for
all courses should be chosen by
the students taking that course.
• The quality of a professor
should at no time be allowed to
be judged by parental or alumni
pressure.
The student should be the Uni
versity; i.e., their wishes within
law and reason should be the
basis for all administration de
cisions. There should be no ques
tion of students sitting on fac
ulty and administration commit
tees, rather the question should
be, "Shall faculty and adminis
tration members sit on student
committees?"
Students should be in full con
trol of all bodies which formu
late rules for conduct. It is well
known that a student will pay
no attention to a rule that he
doesn't like and thinks he can
break without getting caught or
if the penalties will not be se
vere.
