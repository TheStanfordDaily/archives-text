CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)—A
20-year-old Radcliffe junior says
she'd rather get married than
live in a college dormitory.
Now if the right man will only
answer the ad she is running in
the Harvard Crimson seeking a
one-year marriage.
"I really want a roommate, not
a husband," she said today. "But
he's got to marry me to satisfy

Radcliffe."
The girl, who describes herself
as blue-eyed, auburn haired and
five feet tall, refused to reveal
her name. "I don't want a whole
bunch of nuts calling me," she
said.
She said the advertisement is
"kind of a joke," but is also to
protest Radcliffe regulations
that will require her to remain
in a dormitory next year. "But
I do not rule out the possibility
that I might get married," she
added.
The ad says:
"One-year marriage? Seems to
be the only way for a Cliffie to
get out of the dorm. I'll share ex
penses, am a good cook. Other de
tails? We can work it out.
Sho said she has received 10
, jpiies and "not all of them have
been terribly attractive."
The girl said she prefers off
campus living because it's quiet
er and she can get more work
done.
