# Freshmen Meet West Valley JC
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated fresh
man tracksters go for seven
straight this afternoon when
they meet West Valley Junior
College on Angell Field. The 440
relay, featuring a potentially
great Papoose foursome, will
open proceedings at 3:55.
Frosh coach Jerry Barland
expects more competition from
West Valley than his squad has
had in recent meets. Stanford
has not been pressed since its
first meet in winning six in a
row, by an increasing margin
each time.
New stars seem to emerge
each week for the frosh, who
have been paced throughout by
record-breaking imports Pat
Morrison (sprints) and Peter
Boyce (higfi jump). Among
those cited by Barland for re
cent improvement are sprinter
Bob Bacon, distance men Bob
Beukers, Brook Thomas, Bob
Anchondo and Allen Sanford, all
around man Tom Kommers, and
long jumper Greg Williams.
