In the past The Daily, as a monopoly news
paper on the Stanford campus, has not en
dorsed candidates in ASSU elections. We plan
to cariy on that tradition this year too —not
because we have any overriding reverance
for the past, but rather because none of the
candidates, in our opinion, is particularly well
qualified to make something worthwhile of
student government.
Among the candidates, there are first the
flyweights, Steve Ketchel and Donald Bremme
—individuals who, to our knowledge, have not
during their careers in the Sandstone ever
poked their heads above the sidewalks and
out of the depths of complete obscurity. It is
safe to say that they know little or nothing
of Stanford's inner workings, and it is perhaps
safer to say that they haven't got a pacifist's
chance in ROTC of being elected.
Next come the bantamweights, Martin Gerry
and Bob Stone. They seem to recognize one
basic problem with student government—that
it is presently a farce—, but offer no solutions
other than to laugh at it. They are the Sancho
Panzas essential to any campaign, but then
the University isn't a windmill.
Following the bantamweights are the welter
weights, Bob Fellmeth and Dave Harris. Fell
meth, a "sort of" row candidate, offers little
other than to make the ASSU a division of the
Tresidder Union Board, which —as he is eager
to point out —he headed—though not so much
as he would like to think—this past year. Har
ris is another case. He is not running to win
but rather to protest. He has presented a plat
form of ideas, most of them laudable, but a few
of them laughable, in a commendable attempt
to promote discussion of significant issues
among the remaining candidates. He is too
radical to win, however, and if he were to win,

too unrealistic and dogmatic to accomplish any
thing.
Finally, we come to the middleweights, the
two who will probably fight it out in the final
election next week, and one of whom, after
750 freshmen and the 23 per cent of upperclass
men and graduate students who bother to vote
have cast their ballots, will be the next ASSU
president—Bob Klein and Carl Schmidt. Klein,
the fraternity candidate, is a clean-cut, all-
American boy backed by a good organization,
a cadre of frosh dollie secretaries, and a sharp
vice-presidential candidate. His only other
asset seems to be a campaign manager-writer
who was too smart to run for president himself
and yet who still has some fantastic ideas lin
gering in his mind about what Stanford could
be. But Klein himself, as an original thinker
and a forceful leader, is nonexistent. And, as
in the last four presidential elections, where
there's a fraternity candidate, there's an Estab
lishment candidate. Carl Schmidt, who has
more or less run Sandy Mackenzie's administra
tion for the past few months, is an experienced
organization man, and perhaps even believes
in some of his ideas about educational reform.
But if the past record in student government
of this Dick Nixon of the Left is any indication,
we would expect that next year the Legislature
might have a rival for the nit-picking champion
ship of Stanford U.
The heavyweights? There are none. There is
not a single individual running for ASSU presi
dent who has real leadership ability, experience
with the University's power structure, and a
true commitment to reforming the educational
environment which that structure has wrought.
So why don't you vote for your roommate?
At least he's a nice guy. Maybe.

dorsed candidates in ASSU elections. We plan
to cariy on that tradition this year too —not
because we have any overriding reverance
for the past, but rather because none of the
candidates, in our opinion, is particularly well
qualified to make something worthwhile of
student government.
Among the candidates, there are first the
flyweights, Steve Ketchel and Donald Bremme
—individuals who, to our knowledge, have not
during their careers in the Sandstone ever
poked their heads above the sidewalks and
out of the depths of complete obscurity. It is
safe to say that they know little or nothing
of Stanford's inner workings, and it is perhaps
safer to say that they haven't got a pacifist's
chance in ROTC of being elected.
Next come the bantamweights, Martin Gerry
and Bob Stone. They seem to recognize one
basic problem with student government—that
it is presently a farce—, but offer no solutions
other than to laugh at it. They are the Sancho
Panzas essential to any campaign, but then
the University isn't a windmill.
Following the bantamweights are the welter
weights, Bob Fellmeth and Dave Harris. Fell
meth, a "sort of" row candidate, offers little
other than to make the ASSU a division of the
Tresidder Union Board, which —as he is eager
to point out —he headed—though not so much
as he would like to think—this past year. Har
ris is another case. He is not running to win
but rather to protest. He has presented a plat
form of ideas, most of them laudable, but a few
of them laughable, in a commendable attempt
to promote discussion of significant issues
among the remaining candidates. He is too
radical to win, however, and if he were to win,

too unrealistic and dogmatic to accomplish any
thing.
Finally, we come to the middleweights, the
two who will probably fight it out in the final
election next week, and one of whom, after
750 freshmen and the 23 per cent of upperclass
men and graduate students who bother to vote
have cast their ballots, will be the next ASSU
president—Bob Klein and Carl Schmidt. Klein,
the fraternity candidate, is a clean-cut, all-
American boy backed by a good organization,
a cadre of frosh dollie secretaries, and a sharp
vice-presidential candidate. His only other
asset seems to be a campaign manager-writer
who was too smart to run for president himself
and yet who still has some fantastic ideas lin
gering in his mind about what Stanford could
be. But Klein himself, as an original thinker
and a forceful leader, is nonexistent. And, as
in the last four presidential elections, where
there's a fraternity candidate, there's an Estab
lishment candidate. Carl Schmidt, who has
more or less run Sandy Mackenzie's administra
tion for the past few months, is an experienced
organization man, and perhaps even believes
in some of his ideas about educational reform.
But if the past record in student government
of this Dick Nixon of the Left is any indication,
we would expect that next year the Legislature
might have a rival for the nit-picking champion
ship of Stanford U.
The heavyweights? There are none. There is
not a single individual running for ASSU presi
dent who has real leadership ability, experience
with the University's power structure, and a
true commitment to reforming the educational
environment which that structure has wrought.
So why don't you vote for your roommate?
At least he's a nice guy. Maybe.
