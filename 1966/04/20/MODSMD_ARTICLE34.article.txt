# On The Scene
## Klein Platform Not 'Flattery' 
### Bill Wertz 
The ASSU presidential cam
paign has raised an interesting
and basic question about life at
the University.
Of what value are social regu
lations and general studies re
quirements?
One of the presidential candi
dates, Dave Harris, suggests
that they arc of no value at all.
Rather, he says, "they are deg
radations of you and me."
Degrading
By making the assumption
that Stanford students are not
capable of deciding themselves

when to come in at night or
which courses to take, Harris
feels the Administration is de
grading students, and he is sur
prised they have put up with
it this long.
"The Stanford administra
tion," Harris says, "is saying to
students 'you're not responsible
for your own lives, and we
don't consider you capable,
bright or independent enough
to govern your own lives.' When
you personally direct this to
any Stanford student, I don't
think he would admit this; in

fact, I think he would be quite
insulted by it."
Harris is absolutely right psy
chologically; a Stanford student
would undoubtedly be insulted
by the implication that he was
considered incapable of govern
ing his life.
Flattery
Are we to be flattered then
into accepting this plank in Har
ris' platform? For flattery,
sweet and sugary, is what this
plank rests upon.
How easy it is to say that as
mature and responsible Stan-

ford students each of us can
wisely and completely choose
the courses we need for the best
education possible without the
nagging restrictions of general
studies requirements.
Easy to say and even easier to
believe, but wrong.
It is far harder, but much
more honest to admit that the
temptation to concentrate in an
area of competence is a strong
one, that a lack of general stu
dies requirements would encour
age narrowness, a narrowness
that is antithetical to the idea
of a liberal education.
An Alternative
It is far harder, but again
more honest to admit that so
cial regulations can help some
students make a difficult tran
sition from high school to rela
tively free and unfettered col
lege life, but that none would
be willing to accept them volun
tarily.
What, then, is the alternative?
"Regulations at a University,"
says Bob Klein, also a candidate
for ASSU president, "should be
designed for their own obsoles
cence."
Klein feels that the basic end
of rules and regulations at the
University should be to leave
each individual well along the
road toward becoming an inde
pendent person, capable of mak
ing mature and intelligent de
cisions.
It is certainly a less flatter
ing viewpoint, for it implies that
students arc not as mature, inde
pendent and intelligent when
they arrive here as they are
when they leave. But it is just as
certainly a more realistic view
point.
Direction and Guidance
"General studies requirements
will not in themselves give an
individual a liberal education,"
Klein says, "but they can lead a
person to develop a wide inter
est and curiosity."
All rules are not automatic
ally restrictive, some can help
guide and direct. And while it
may be nice to think that we
could all get along perfectly
well without them, there is noth
ing wrong with accepting the
help and guidance the Universi
ty offers and working with it
toward a common goal—a good
education.

tion," Harris says, "is saying to
students 'you're not responsible
for your own lives, and we
don't consider you capable,
bright or independent enough
to govern your own lives.' When
you personally direct this to
any Stanford student, I don't
think he would admit this; in

fact, I think he would be quite
insulted by it."
Harris is absolutely right psy
chologically; a Stanford student
would undoubtedly be insulted
by the implication that he was
considered incapable of govern
ing his life.
Flattery
Are we to be flattered then
into accepting this plank in Har
ris' platform? For flattery,
sweet and sugary, is what this
plank rests upon.
How easy it is to say that as
mature and responsible Stan-

ford students each of us can
wisely and completely choose
the courses we need for the best
education possible without the
nagging restrictions of general
studies requirements.
Easy to say and even easier to
believe, but wrong.
It is far harder, but much
more honest to admit that the
temptation to concentrate in an
area of competence is a strong
one, that a lack of general stu
dies requirements would encour
age narrowness, a narrowness
that is antithetical to the idea
of a liberal education.
An Alternative
It is far harder, but again
more honest to admit that so
cial regulations can help some
students make a difficult tran
sition from high school to rela
tively free and unfettered col
lege life, but that none would
be willing to accept them volun
tarily.
What, then, is the alternative?
"Regulations at a University,"
says Bob Klein, also a candidate
for ASSU president, "should be
designed for their own obsoles
cence."
Klein feels that the basic end
of rules and regulations at the
University should be to leave
each individual well along the
road toward becoming an inde
pendent person, capable of mak
ing mature and intelligent de
cisions.
It is certainly a less flatter
ing viewpoint, for it implies that
students arc not as mature, inde
pendent and intelligent when
they arrive here as they are
when they leave. But it is just as
certainly a more realistic view
point.
Direction and Guidance
"General studies requirements
will not in themselves give an
individual a liberal education,"
Klein says, "but they can lead a
person to develop a wide inter
est and curiosity."
All rules are not automatic
ally restrictive, some can help
guide and direct. And while it
may be nice to think that we
could all get along perfectly
well without them, there is noth
ing wrong with accepting the
help and guidance the Universi
ty offers and working with it
toward a common goal—a good
education.
The ASSU presidential cam
paign has raised an interesting
and basic question about life at
the University.
Of what value are social regu
lations and general studies re
quirements?
One of the presidential candi
dates, Dave Harris, suggests
that they arc of no value at all.
Rather, he says, "they are deg
radations of you and me."
Degrading
By making the assumption
that Stanford students are not
capable of deciding themselves

when to come in at night or
which courses to take, Harris
feels the Administration is de
grading students, and he is sur
prised they have put up with
it this long.
