# Two Minutes Of Haight
## Harris And The 'Bold Stand' 
### Tim Haight 
Stanford never ceases to amaze
me.
Students here say, "Cam
paigns are all the same, all the
same drivel." And I agree, in
print, even.
But now a candidate comes
along and says some exciting
things, takes a stand on rush,
takes a hard look at what our
education is all about, and re
fuses to equivocate. You'd think
people would be overjoyed.
Bold Stands
But they don't think he's seri
ous. They think he's kidding, not
trying to get elected. It just goes
to prove that old adage, "You
shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you disbe
lieved."
If you've been exposed to much
of the campaign, you know I'm
talking about Dave Harris. Even
if you haven't seen him but have
only seen the others, you know
it's not they who are taking the
bold stands.
He's radical in his approach.
He talks about civil disobedience
and about the administration
having to recognize that our
ideas about education have a
right to equal consideration with
theirs. He says the whole system
needs examination, and if we
must expose a few vested inter
ests, who just might fight, that's
too bad.

He starts his analysis of the
University by talking about
what it ought to be. He believes
that until we have some idea of
the basic reasons why we're
here, we can't begin to form sug
gestions for change. This way
of thinking opens doors. The as
sumption of the value of grades
becomes less sacred when we ask
their relevance to the goals of
education.
Social regulations, open house
hours, in loco parentis attitudes
somehow seem paradoxical in an
institution dedicated to teaching
us to be free. Because he believes
in talking to people, rather than
telling them what they want to
hear, people listen.
Soothing - Equivocations
And then they say, "Well, he's
got a point, but he'll never get
elected." So they listen to the
other candidates, who modify
their responses to Dave with
soothing equivocations, who
seem to have enough of the poli
tician about them to fit into the
students' cynical attitude of
what it means to get votes.
Everybody can think for him
self here; try to find someone
who will say that he can't. But
everybody believes that taken as
a whole the Stanford student
body must be coddled, must be
approached with gift-wrapped
ideas, must be Madison-Avcnued

to the polls just like the inhabi
tants of the Great Society.
Dave Harris refuses to believe
it. He says that thinking like
that is insulting to the students
here. He says its the same kind
of insult that the administration
delivers when it relies on re
quirements instead of argu
ments, and regulations instead
of responsibility. Everyone is
like Jonathan Swift, who likes
individual men, but can't stand
the human race.
Above The Yahoos
But how are we to ever rise
above the Yahoos unless we
stop acting like them? Why
can't we vote for what we like
instead of counting on everyone
to do something stupid, and
compensating for them?
Luckily, there is still hope.
Most of the student body has
never soiled its hands in an
ASSU election. Perhaps today
and tomorrow, just for the sake
of some support for something
beyond the usual garbage, you
can find time to come out
against the usual campaign
boredom.
Remember, if Harris doesn't
get into the finals, it means a
week of tweedledum and twee
die-dee, with the danger of the
more usual candidates reverting
to type once the heat is off. But
if you like the circus, that's your
business. I'm voting for Harris.

of the campaign, you know I'm
talking about Dave Harris. Even
if you haven't seen him but have
only seen the others, you know
it's not they who are taking the
bold stands.
He's radical in his approach.
He talks about civil disobedience
and about the administration
having to recognize that our
ideas about education have a
right to equal consideration with
theirs. He says the whole system
needs examination, and if we
must expose a few vested inter
ests, who just might fight, that's
too bad.

He starts his analysis of the
University by talking about
what it ought to be. He believes
that until we have some idea of
the basic reasons why we're
here, we can't begin to form sug
gestions for change. This way
of thinking opens doors. The as
sumption of the value of grades
becomes less sacred when we ask
their relevance to the goals of
education.
Social regulations, open house
hours, in loco parentis attitudes
somehow seem paradoxical in an
institution dedicated to teaching
us to be free. Because he believes
in talking to people, rather than
telling them what they want to
hear, people listen.
Soothing - Equivocations
And then they say, "Well, he's
got a point, but he'll never get
elected." So they listen to the
other candidates, who modify
their responses to Dave with
soothing equivocations, who
seem to have enough of the poli
tician about them to fit into the
students' cynical attitude of
what it means to get votes.
Everybody can think for him
self here; try to find someone
who will say that he can't. But
everybody believes that taken as
a whole the Stanford student
body must be coddled, must be
approached with gift-wrapped
ideas, must be Madison-Avcnued

to the polls just like the inhabi
tants of the Great Society.
Dave Harris refuses to believe
it. He says that thinking like
that is insulting to the students
here. He says its the same kind
of insult that the administration
delivers when it relies on re
quirements instead of argu
ments, and regulations instead
of responsibility. Everyone is
like Jonathan Swift, who likes
individual men, but can't stand
the human race.
Above The Yahoos
But how are we to ever rise
above the Yahoos unless we
stop acting like them? Why
can't we vote for what we like
instead of counting on everyone
to do something stupid, and
compensating for them?
Luckily, there is still hope.
Most of the student body has
never soiled its hands in an
ASSU election. Perhaps today
and tomorrow, just for the sake
of some support for something
beyond the usual garbage, you
can find time to come out
against the usual campaign
boredom.
Remember, if Harris doesn't
get into the finals, it means a
week of tweedledum and twee
die-dee, with the danger of the
more usual candidates reverting
to type once the heat is off. But
if you like the circus, that's your
business. I'm voting for Harris.
Stanford never ceases to amaze
me.
Students here say, "Cam
paigns are all the same, all the
same drivel." And I agree, in
print, even.
But now a candidate comes
along and says some exciting
things, takes a stand on rush,
takes a hard look at what our
education is all about, and re
fuses to equivocate. You'd think
people would be overjoyed.
Bold Stands
But they don't think he's seri
ous. They think he's kidding, not
trying to get elected. It just goes
to prove that old adage, "You
shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you disbe
lieved."
If you've been exposed to much
of the campaign, you know I'm
