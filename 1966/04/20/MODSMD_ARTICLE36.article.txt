# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Praising The Two Doctors 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I couldn't come close to ex
pressing my elation when read
ing the statements of Drs. Paul
sen and Osborne in The Daily
Monday morning.
Having fought for years to
bring about the most minimal
of changes in university policy
to bring them in line with some
sort of semi-rational definition
of a university education, I find
Drs. Paulsen's and Osborne's
statements the boldest steps to
ward a reasonable approach to
the problem that I have yet en
countered. Certainly, they ex
ceed the usual output of the ad
ministrative side.
Sure, we have had small change.
But when the administration jus
tices social regs changes to the
Board of Trustees on the basis
that other schools are more lib
eral than Stanford rather than
on the basis of what is
right; and when changes in judi
cial processes can only be
brought about by threat of scan
dal to the University; and when
these few, small liberal changes
are referred to by President
Sterling as "Stanford's worst
year;" Stanford is sick, with an
illness that is slowly eating
away at a potentially great uni
versity.
My frustration is as great as
my elation, for right now I am
flat on my back at the Stanford
Health Center unable to speak
for the respectable, intelligent,
consistent, and unequivocating
platform in the election, the Har
ris-Collins Education program.
The other platforms are mere
pallid apologies, touching only
on symptoms, and insulting to
the intelligence of the electorate
by suggesting soothing slogans
and jackass jingles for a compre
hensive program of educational
reform.
I not only believe it is time
for a change, but change is now
possible. With the help of such

men as Drs. Paulsen and Os
borne, numerous faculty, and
an endorsement of the Harris-.
Collins platform by the usually
complacent student body, we can
move away from the Edge of
Mediocrity and bring the 19th
century administration along
with us.

â€¢ The Patient Diplomat
Editor, The Daily:
The years has been one of
several diplomatic problems
(Union Residence, Wilbur Hall,
religion at Stanford, drinking
and sex and LSD at Stanford,
dogmatism at Stanford, drink
ing and sex on campus and the
ASSU presidency). When a war

is going on the diplomat is often
mistaken as a partisan.
Stanford's history seems to be
at a critical turning point; the
turn to the real university will
take several years, but it seems
definitely to have begun. We are
in an interim period in Stan
ford's history and during the in
terim periods diplomats are
most valuable when the tran
sient conflicts are mistaken for
the real wars.
The result of all this is that
the ASSU campaign is confus
ing. It is difficult for the most
patient observer to determine
just who would be the best pres
ident. In view of our problem
of palcnce, it seems as though
we need a candidate who is as

conscious as possible of the
problems of patience in diplom
acy. Carl Schmidt understands
as well as anyone in the cam
paign the relationship between
campus politics, diplomacy with
the administration, and the prob
lems of helping Stanford be
come a fuller university.
If the studly jock, the cute
tease, the alienated intellectual
can see the campaign diploma
tically, then Stanford can begin
to get beyond stereotypes and
see its typicality as an Anglo-
Saxon university. If Schmidt is
a good diplomat, if I have writ
ten well, then one might hope
for a good year next year in a
growing university.
