# The
						Clothesline
## Schmidt Can Do Job 
### Chris Harte 
The liquor issue may be solved
before the election is over. Open
house hours are certain to be
extended. Social Regulations and
God, after 50 years have finally
been allowed back on campus.
And so, with the peripheral
issues more or less out of the

way, student government can
concentrate on the issue central
to Stanford's existence and to
our presence here —education.
And maybe even get some
thing done.
The voter's choice today and
tomorrow is significant because
he does have a chance to elect
a candidate — Carl Schmidt —
who can transform the pro
grams and promises of the cam
paign to realities.
Dave Harris
Only one other candidate,
Dave Harris, has an understand
ing of what the issues are and
what needs to be done. But there
is every reason to believe that
his rash and unpredictable meth
ods will do more harm than
good.
Half Platform
Klein's platform gives some
deference to the fact that the
issue is education, but as the
critique by the Harris and Col
lins platform committee has
shown it is only in half meas
ures, most of which have al
ready been suggested or put
into effect.
A quick glance at Klein's bi
ographical sketch points to the
lack of any real background in
student government—listed are
such feats as his participation
in decorating the SAE house
for Big Game.
In fact, running mate Jan
Jacobi and campaign manager
Mike Couzens are probably re
sponsible for whatever enlight
ened programs Klein has to of
fer. It would be interesting to
surmise where Klein would be
now if it were not for these
two.
For in a campaign which has
been as relevant to the real is
sues as this one has, he would
not even be in the running with
out their cram courses in stu
dent government and liberal
education, without their help in
writing his speeches, in answer
ing the questions thrown at him.
Past Performance
Klein's past performance does
not show any of the concern for
student involvement in educa
tion which his platform and
campaign have stressed. The
only conclusion can be that he
does not really feel this con
cern, and that Jacobi and Cou
zens are responsible.
And the ASSU President must
be someone who has a genuine
concern for these matters, and
someone who can stand on his
own two feet, even under pres
sure, when his advisors cannot
be with him.
Fellmeth, the only other can
didate with a chance at any
thing, does not even realize what
the issue is. He has stated that
he is for "increased academic
experimentation," but has never
expanded very satisfactorily on
this.
Nebulous Accomplishments
His listed accomplishments
are nebulous, are not really his
to take credit for, and are total
ly irrelevant to the campaign

for ASSU President. Both on the
basis of what he has done and
his simplified view of what
needs to be done he is not the
candidate to get the job done.
Schmidt, through his work
with ASSU and LASSU, knows
best how to get something done.
He is not satisfied with those
bodies as they have functioned
in the past, but :it least fas a
working knowledge of both,
which no other candidate can
claim, and wants to work
through them, revitalizing them
to do the work that needs to be
done.
Schmidt alone of the candi
date's realizes that the ASSU's
only potential for growth is in
creased student participation
and its expansion into the life of
the University as a whole.
