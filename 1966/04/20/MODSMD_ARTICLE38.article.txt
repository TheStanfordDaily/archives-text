# Gruber Speaks
## Stone, Mathison Represent All 
### Steve Gruber 
I found a winner.
Don't get me wrong. I didn't
try to find a winner.
All I did was ask for a candi
date for student body president.
Bob Stone and Mindy Mathison
stepped forth and I had my can
didate.
Then the impossible happened.
Seven other candidates entered
the contest.
Political View
Let's look at the situation
from a strictly political point of
view.
Of the sixteen candidates run
ning for president and vice presi
dent on the eight tickets:
• Three are in fraternities.
This will split the fraternity
vote.

• Three are in eating clubs.
Another bloc is split.
• One is a Wilbur sponsor,
lessening the chance that the
freshmen will be swayed by the
garbage of the Little Establish
ment candidate.
• One is a graduate student,
tying up a few graduate votes.
• One is a Sternie, taking
more votes away from the Little
Establishment.
Perfect Ticket
But I stumbled onto the per
fect ticket.
Between Bob Stone and Mindy
Mathison, there are five differ
ent groups represented. These
groups are:
• Stone is from New York,
Mindy is from Hollywood — a
perfect geographical split.

• Bob is in an eating club,
Mindy is going with a fraternity
man who is attending Loyola.
• Mindy lives on-campus (to
Roblc) and Bob lives off-campus.
• Bob is a sophomore, Mindy
is a freshman.
• Mindy is female, Bob is
male.
The last point may seem a bit
trite, but I must remind you
that it is traditional to have a
female vice-president. Clark
Brown is the first exception to
this rule in many years.
So much for politics.
Positive Ideas
Bob Stone has surprised me
by bringing forth many positive
ideas about changes in the struc
ture of the ASSU.
His suggestion that the book
store, Tresidder Union, and the
Tresidder Store be student-run
and managed is at first startling.
A little thought on the subject
brings the realization that it is
feasible, which is even more
startling.
Stone's idea that the ASSU
should serve the student body
socially instead of politically
brings forth the response, "Why
didn't somebody think of that
before?" Could it be that they
(the Little Establishment) were
too interested in personal glory
or that they had their hands in
the till?
I admire the boy for being
able to run a superlative cam
paign—something I could never
do. And who can help but ad
mire Mindy?"
No Worse Than Fifth
I predict that Stone will do no
worse than fifth place, and may
even wind up in the final elec
tion to be held next week.
The student body is slowly
seeing through the typical ASSU
candidate with his cute little slo
gans like "Oh Schmidt." They've
had enough of his rush-like hand
shakes and his aft e r-dinner
speeches.
It's time for a change.

Mindy is going with a fraternity
man who is attending Loyola.
• Mindy lives on-campus (to
Roblc) and Bob lives off-campus.
• Bob is a sophomore, Mindy
is a freshman.
• Mindy is female, Bob is
male.
The last point may seem a bit
trite, but I must remind you
that it is traditional to have a
female vice-president. Clark
Brown is the first exception to
this rule in many years.
So much for politics.
Positive Ideas
Bob Stone has surprised me
by bringing forth many positive
ideas about changes in the struc
ture of the ASSU.
His suggestion that the book
store, Tresidder Union, and the
Tresidder Store be student-run
and managed is at first startling.
A little thought on the subject
brings the realization that it is
feasible, which is even more
startling.
Stone's idea that the ASSU
should serve the student body
socially instead of politically
brings forth the response, "Why
didn't somebody think of that
before?" Could it be that they
(the Little Establishment) were
too interested in personal glory
or that they had their hands in
the till?
I admire the boy for being
able to run a superlative cam
paign—something I could never
do. And who can help but ad
mire Mindy?"
No Worse Than Fifth
I predict that Stone will do no
worse than fifth place, and may
even wind up in the final elec
tion to be held next week.
The student body is slowly
seeing through the typical ASSU
candidate with his cute little slo
gans like "Oh Schmidt." They've
had enough of his rush-like hand
shakes and his aft e r-dinner
speeches.
It's time for a change.
I found a winner.
Don't get me wrong. I didn't
try to find a winner.
All I did was ask for a candi
date for student body president.
Bob Stone and Mindy Mathison
stepped forth and I had my can
didate.
Then the impossible happened.
Seven other candidates entered
the contest.
Political View
Let's look at the situation
from a strictly political point of
view.
Of the sixteen candidates run
ning for president and vice presi
dent on the eight tickets:
• Three are in fraternities.
This will split the fraternity
vote.

• Three are in eating clubs.
Another bloc is split.
• One is a Wilbur sponsor,
lessening the chance that the
freshmen will be swayed by the
garbage of the Little Establish
ment candidate.
• One is a graduate student,
tying up a few graduate votes.
• One is a Sternie, taking
more votes away from the Little
Establishment.
Perfect Ticket
But I stumbled onto the per
fect ticket.
Between Bob Stone and Mindy
Mathison, there are five differ
ent groups represented. These
groups are:
• Stone is from New York,
Mindy is from Hollywood — a
perfect geographical split.

• Bob is in an eating club,
Mindy is going with a fraternity
man who is attending Loyola.
• Mindy lives on-campus (to
Roblc) and Bob lives off-campus.
• Bob is a sophomore, Mindy
is a freshman.
• Mindy is female, Bob is
male.
