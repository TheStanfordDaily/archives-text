# 'Prism' Shows Promise
## 
### WENDY DORTORT 
The latest issue of "Prisim," the
freshman literary magazine, shows a
fair amount of creative promise in
the ranks of the newest generation
of Stanford imagists. Much of the
material is good, if at least in re
vealing some of the inner workings
of the freshman mind, and gives hope
for the "Sequoia's" of the future.
A freshman production cannot be
judged against more mature efforts
without appearing in many ways un
polished, juvenile, and limited. But the
important major themes are found
in "Prisim"; alienation, a seeking for
higher levels of consciousness, and an
attempt to find something good and

beautiful above the plane of uncon
cerned daily existence.
The most direct expression of alien
ation is found in Bruce MacKay's
"The Awakening?" which presents
the sensation of separateness pre- re
quisite to any creative assertion of
self. Almost all of the stories deal
with the escape of the protagonist
from what commonly surrounds him,
into a world of screaming sports cars,
chemical nightmare, or some form of
mystic or mythical symbolism.
An interesting experiment in imag
ery and horror is "Emotion and Orien
tation" by David Robertson, which at
tempts to describe the psychedelic hal
lucinations of a DMT "tryp." The
story itself is weak and exists only as
a vehicle for the fantastic imagination
(?) of the author. The images evoked
are vivid and bizarre, yet they have
been handled and developed consist
ently, and only break down toward
the end when the author's involve
ment seems to have gotten the better
of his control.
Possibly the best item in the maga
zine is "A Short Fable in Defense of
Man" by Lindsay Merriman. It is a
skillful blend of images and perspec
tives which leaves the reader quietly
wondering which side the author is
really on.
The poetry in the issue ranges from
the trite to the sensitive. Aside from
a few feeble attempts at humor which
fail from over-abruptness, the main
theme of the poems seems to be death.
This being one of the more common
themes of poetry through the ages,
there is here nothing very new said.
Most of the poems, however, are
technically quite proficient, and some
present images which are refresh
ingly original and at times almost
shocking. "Monterey Revisited," by
Mary Goodstein, is a fitting closure
for a production whose authors may
well someday be revisited on more
renowned pages.
