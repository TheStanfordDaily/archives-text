# Shorer Views Criticism
## 
### 
Mark Shorer, novelist, biographer,
anthologist, short story writer, and
literary critic, and at present, a pro
fessor at the University of California
at Berkeley, demonstrated his prow
ess as a speaker as well, last night.
In the program in the annual Haas
Memorial Lecture series, Shorer dealt
with "Criticism and the American Col
lege."
"Literature establishes a formal
truce between the warring elements.
The function of literary criticism is
to help us see that man as the artist
can create an order that did not before
exist in the Universe."
In developing this concept of litera
ture and criticism, Shorer discussed
evolution of the definitions of the
humanities. "Literature and criticism
have changed radically and violently
in the past one hundred years," said
Shorer.
An example of this development is
the fact that where, in the twenties,
scholars and writers existed in oppos
ing camps, many of the foremost writ
ers of the day are now working in the
university environment.
Shorer described living through
periods government by various liter
ary philosophies. He was educated in

the "literature as a body of social his
tory" satge. Then the Marxist con
cept of literature as a product of so
ciety and as a social weapon dominat
ed literary criticism. Then came the
period in which "everybody was busy
finding Christ everywhere."
He described the present state of
criticism as a concentration on styl
istic elements; the technique rather
than the social implications of litera
ture.
In his definition of criticism, Shorer
countered the idea of the great schism
between the arts and the sciences that
has been strengthened by the writings
of P. C. Snow and William Arrow
smith, who has charged that the hu
manities will be responsible for their
own downfall, the result of their "ser
vile imitation of the sciences."
The concept of criticism was given
its most topical focus when Shorer
described the "New Student" as being
the ideal candidate for the position
of literary critic. Following this ideal,
the "New Student," in his desire for
total freedom and his opposition to
all forms of censorship, has increased
the importance of literary criticism
as an expression of clarity, coherence
and disinterest.
