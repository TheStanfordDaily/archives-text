# Linkletter Comments On Show Biz, Politics
## 
### 
Radio-TV star Art Linkletter told
Stanford Graduate School of Business
students yesterday that he thinks it
would be "a mistake" to elect an en
tertainer to an administrative politi
cal position in which he is not exper
ienced.
In answer to a student question
about the trend of entertainers to
enter the political field, he named ac
tor Ronald Reagan, current candidate
for the Republican gubernatorial nom
ination, in the course of his comments.
"I see no reason why entertainers
shouldn't go into politics, just the
same as anyone else," he replied.
Interested And Informed
"If a man is interested in things,
and informed about them, he may be
well qualified. I would vote any day
for Ronnie Reagan or a George Mur
phy (former actcr and now U. S. Sen
ator) to take his place in a political
body, which thinks about issues and
discusses things, in helping to run
the country.
"But I'd hesitate to elect an enter
tainer without special experience to
be a governor or a mayor. It's a dif
ferent kind of job—more like running
General Motors nowadays than mak
ing speeches about the flag."
He said entertainers are at a dis
advantage in the political field initial
ly because their public "image" is not
that of being deep thinkers.
Business Symposium
Linkletter, speaking under sponsor
ship of the Student Symposium Com
mittee of Stanford's Graduate School
of Business on "The Financial Educa
tion of an Entertainer," talked freely
of making—and losing—millions in
his varied business ventures.
He sketched rapidly a poverty-rid

den childhood as an orphan, his strug
gle for survival during the depression
when he worked for his education at
San Diego State College, and learn
ing about business "the hard way" in
jobs ranging from deck hand to gam
bling casino shill. Then he told of suc
cess in radio and TV, of beginning to
make "good money" and then break
ing into the area where returns are
"fantastic." Then he could indulge his
flare for business ventures, not mind
ing whether he dropped $50,000 or
$60,000 casting about in "some of the
most terrible investments anybody
ever made."
Motive And Taxes
To another student question about
what motivates his continued activity
now that taxes take most of his in
come, he said.
"I'm just interested in things. I
am nuts about businesses. I guess I
just have to do it. You wouldn't be
lieve the list of stuff I'm in. And there
is never a business in this world that
doesn't have a load of problems."
One of the biggest problems in busi
ness today, he said, is the need for
"good people in management."
Just Pennies
Linkletter had .sharp words for the
"era of the increasing income tax,"
and being allowed to keep "3 or 4
cents of each dollar I earn," after a
certain amount. lie charged that taxes
are punishing the ablest enterpre
neurs and creating "a lot of shifty
people" in business circles, as prohi
bition did in all areas earlier.
Asked what ho considered a fair
tax structure would be, he said he
thought the rate should not rise
"higher than 40 per cent—that's high
enough."
