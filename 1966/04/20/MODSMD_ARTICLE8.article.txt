# Students Begin Balloting Today
## 
### JANIE ARIES 
Balloting for ASSU President and
Vice-President begins today and ends
tomorrow afternoon. Polling places
both days are: 94, TMU, Post Office
and Engineering Corner. From 9-12,
History Corner, Main Library and
Physics Tank.
The 16 candidates wound up cam
paigning yesterday with a debate at
Roble and speeches in White Memor
ial Plaza.
The second noon debate on White
Plaza brought together four ASSU
president candidates to discuss views
on tactics and ultimate goals. Carl
Schmidt, Dave Harris, Bob Klein and
Bob Fellmeth participated.
Discussion, prompted after the de
bate by questions from the gathering
of about 100, touched on issues from
philosophy of education and tactics
for change to contraceptives.
In response to a question, Harris
asserted that the ideal university is
a pure democracy with "freedom bor
dering on anarchy. There should be
so many things going on that the
place is constantly running the risk
of exploding."
Confrontation
Schmidt characterized the ideal uni
versity with the qualities of "open
ness and concern." He emphasized
that confrontation, as Harris advo
cates, and conciliation, as implied by
Klein and Fellmeth, are not compati
ble with these qualities.
Fellmeth reflected the question as
"unfair," but said the ideal university
would have changes in his platform.
Speaking for Klein, who had to
leave for a tour, Jan Jacobi asked for
a university "aware of the outside
world."
Stones Fly
Bob Stone, who had stepped up
from the audience to answer ques
tions, remonstrated his opponents for
not including all candidates in the
debates. He looked to the days of
Armin Rosenkranz and Ed Shaw for
the ideal academic community.
All candidates but Harris stated
that their goals are probably much
the same; the conflict seems to lie
in the tactics.
Harris has repeatedly expressed his
willingness to use radical means of
bringing about change, if the situa
tion should demand them. He dis
agreed with Fellmeth, who feels the
people—the administration —who cre
ated this system will aquiesce to
change it.
"That is simply not the fact. It is
unfortunate, but true, that the stu
dents must be the ones to change the
educational system.' '
Student Innovation
The student as an internal inno
vator is inherent in Schmidt's concep
tion of the university. He challenged
the image of students on committees
as simply sitting and nodding their

heads or disagreeing. They should
be involved and ambitious enough
to do the research necessary to create
and present solid proposals.
Stability and cooperation were em
phasized by Fellmeth as mandatory
to aid an administration which must
deal with a constantly changing spec
trum of student committees.
Off-campus Issues
The question of off-campus issues
was met with a variety of opinions.
According to Fellmeth, "anything le
gal should be allowed." Schmidt sees
the university in the role of critic and
innovator.
Harris pointed to the university's
social obligation to involve itself in
the controversial issues in a society
of which it is a part. Jacobi tried
to make a distinction between moral
issues with which the university
should concern itself, and political
questions, which it should stay out of.
Contraceptives
Two of the candidates commented
on the question of contraceptives and
the Health Service. Jacobi expressed
approval of the current referendum
but did not go much further, while
Stone recommended students take ad
vantage of the present system in
which students can see a local physi
cian who will tacitly distribute con
traceptives on the basis of age and
health.
