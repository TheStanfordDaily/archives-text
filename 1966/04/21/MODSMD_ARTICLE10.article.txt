# Sanford:
## Drinkers Constitute Subculture 
### 
Stanford is a drinking university,
and as such, is a participant in a
larger American culture.
Yet an American drinking pattern
as "the American way" of drinking
has not yet been formed, said Profes
sor Nevitt Sanford last night at Din
kelspiel in "How Natives Drink," the
first of three lectures on student
behavior.
"How we at Stanford drink belongs
in a large part to the United States'
culture of drinking which is differ
ent from other countries," said San
ford, "and how Stanford students
drink depends to a great extent on
the kinds of homes they come from."
In tracing the drinking patterns
of Stanford students, a questionnaire
was given to members of the fresh
man class in 1961 and the results
found that 78 per cent of the men
and 77 per cent of the women were
introduced to liquor before they start
ed college.
Other statistics on Stanford drink
ing patterns found that among a ran
dom sample of senior men in the class
of 1966, 68 per cent said they were
drunk once during the year, and 13
per cent were drunk more than 10
times.
Of Stanford fraternity men 80 per
cent were drunk once in the past
year and 27 per cent were drunk over
10 times. Sampling also found that
25 per cent of all Stanford men drank
beer once or more a week.
Sanford proposed that tp do some
thing about drinking in America, it
must be openly discussed. He sug
gests looking at drinking patterns
of groups or individuals, which he
finds can be classed as integrative,
drinking which has a meaningful
place in a larger group function or
for the individual is pleasurable; fa
cilitative, drinking that is common
at a cocktail party and helps personal
relations and communications, and
escapist, drinking in groups or by in
dividuals in order to erase unpleasant
experiences.
"In a drinking culture such as ours,
drinking among those who drink
should be in the integrative way,"
said Sanford, "a n d initiation into
drinking should favor integrative
drinking and avoid causing feelings
of rebellion or sinfulness."
Sanford indicated that moderation,
drinking in mixed company, and
drinking in the home may help inte
grative drinking, and in a discussion
period after his talk, he favored
changing Stanford drinking regula
tions as an aid to integrative drink
ing.
