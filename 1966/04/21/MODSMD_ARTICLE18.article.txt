# The 						Role Of Students In Governing The University
## 
### John R. McDonough 
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.

University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study

certain beginning and could come to play an

will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is

as others that they are advising, assisting and

acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put

tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved

ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.

terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting

this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under
consideration.
But the students are not asking alone for
the right to be consulted by University de
cision makers; they are asking also to par
ticipate in the process of judgment and de
cision itself.
The Question: Why?
The question presented, then, is whether
and why students should have a right to
decide or substantially to influence decision
not alone by persuasion byt by sheer voting
strength.
One conceivable answer to this question is
that students should be permitted to decide
because they are simply better qualified to
make sound decisions than faculty members
and administrators—or, to put the matter in
a somewhat more conciliatory way, that at
least a substantial number of decisions which
students were able to influence by their sheer
voting strength would be, to that extent,
sounder decisions.
Is such an assertion persuasive? What, if
any, are the students' qualifications for the
decision-making role they seek? What do they
have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi
tate to positions of power in campus politics,
not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
be outstandingly able, well-educated, experi
enced or mature. Is this group really quali
fied to displace, pro tanto, a portion of those
now having decision-making power in the
University?
Claim Of Superiority
Perhaps the student activists would answer
this question with a ringing affirmative—
they are no less self-confident than the rest
of us. I do not believe, however, that they
base their claim primarily on their superior
capacity to do the job. Rather, I think that
they, if pressed, would respond by asserting
that the primary reason why students should
participate in making decisions is because
they are affected by them. Much student
thinking about this matter appears to be
based on the assumption that University de
cision-making ought to be regarded as an
essentially democratic process in which the
students are entitled to be represented simply
because they are there —a kind of application
to academia of the principle: "one man, one
vote." To them, what is wrong with present
University decision-making is that it is gov
ernment without representation, insofar as
the students are concerned.
Is this asumption about the nature of a
University well founded?
It would be too harsh an answer, perhaps,
to respond to the students by pointing out to
them that we do not let the inmates run the
asylum. But it may not be too harsh and it
may be relevant to point out that we do not
let the patients manage the hospital; we do
not let clients manage the law firm; we do
not let the passengers manage the airlines;
and we do not let the consumers manage a
business enterprise. Is a University commun
ity really analagous to a civic community?
Or is it, correctly perceived, much more a
kind of ongoing educational enterprise, in re
lation to which students are essentially in the
position of patrons or consumers?
To take the enterprise view of the matter
is not to deny to students the right to make
decisions—and in doing so to affect substan
tially both the decisions of others and the
course of events within the University. It is,
however, to suggest that the student's power
to decide is essentially the patron's or con
sumer's traditional power to exert leverage
upon any enterprise—that is, his power to de
cide initially to go elsewhere or to decide to
discontinue his patronage if and when he
becomes dissatisfied with what the enterprise
has to offer. This is a remarkably effective
power, but it is a vastly different thing from

the power to manage the enterprise, which
is what the students are seeking.
Heart Of The Matter
Here, then, as I see it is the heart of the
matter: Will we accept the students' view of
the University, essentially as a kind of democ
racy in the councils of which they are en
titled to at least equal representation? Or will
we take the view that the University is essen
tially an educational enterprise, organized
and run by the trustees, administration and
faculty, which any student can take or leave,
as he sees fit, but which is is not entitled to
participate in managing while he is with us?
Of course ,this is not to suggest that a polar
view of the matter is necessary or even desir
able. Various accommodations and arrange
ments may and ought to be made in develop
ing a viable University community—accom
modations and arrangements which may vary
considerably from one University to another.
But, it seems to me, there is a fundamental
issue about the essential nature of a Univer
sity and of students in relation to it which
must be perceived, faced and decided in order
to provide both a context in which, and a ra
tionale upon which, particular decisions can
be made. Unless and until the University does
think this issue through, it will not be in a
position to respond intelligently to particular
requests or demands. Nor will it be able ra
tionally to determine where ultimately to
draw the lines in allocating powers and func
tions among its several constituencies.
It is not without hazard, in this day and age,
to question the assumption that a University
is essentially a democratic community of
which the student body Is a major constitu
ency. To argue that a student's tuition entitles
him, not to a share of voting stock in the
University enterprise but essentially to the
right to take or leave what the University
holds out by way of an educational oppor
tunity, could precipitate angry reaction.
The easier course is to try to find palliatives
and expedients by which to surmount imme
diate crises rather than to challenge the stu
dents' fundamental assumptions. Whether that
is the wise and responsible course to pursue
is, however, another matter.
Participation
Now, to return to the point which I reserved
earlier. In responding to the students' demand
for a role in decision-making I believe that we
might usefully make a distinction, familiar to

lawyers, between the right to participate in
the making of decisions and the right to be
heard before important decisions are taken
by duly-constituted decision-making bodies. In
society at large the power to make various
kinds of legally binding decisions, whether
legislative, administrative or judicial, is dele
gated to relatively few entities. Such entities
are usually representative in only a very gen
eral and remote sense of the individuals whose
lives, liberty, rights or property are signifi
cantly affected by the decisions they make.
On the other hand, by law and tradition, leg
islative, administrative and judicial decision
makers accord a right to be heard to those
whom their decisions will affect. This is done
both to assure that each direction made will
be a fully informed one and to enhance the
acceptability of the decision to those who will
be governed by it.
I believe that this kind of procedure ought
to be used in University decision-making more
often than it has been in the past. Students
often have valuable information to contribute.
They may have ideas and insights which ought
to be taken into account. And decision-makers
ought often to be aware of and give weight to
student attitudes simply to reach sound, work
able and fair decisions.
This is not to suggest that students should
be heard prior to all University decision-mak
ing. Offhand, for example, I see no reason to
elicit their views on the University's endow
ment investment policy or on the appointment
of new faculty members or on radiological
hazards control. Decisions in all of these areas
will affect students, among others. But the
contribution which students could make, if
heard, is simply not commensurate with the
complications engendered by hearing them.
Student Tenure
To implicate students in the decisional proc
ess does, of course, complicate it. Perhaps the
major complication arises out of the relative
shortness of the student's tenure at the Uni
versity.
First, it tends to give any problem, in the
eyes of the student, a greater urgency than the
problem intrinsically has. The student activist
will typically be involved as such only during
his last year or, at the most, his last two
years. He tends to demand action and accom
plishment while he is on the scene. He is im
patient with the more deliberative approach
of other constituencies.

Second, relatively short student tenure
means a high rate of turnover, which in turn
means that each new group of students must
be educated—taken patiently over ground long
familiar to other constituencies in order to
provide the background, insights and perspec
tive which are crucial to wise decisions. This
requires not only much time but no little pa
tience and endurance.
Third, and perhaps most important, the stu
dent's relatively brief tenure means that he
will not have to live with the decision; indeed,
that he will often be gone even before it is put
into effect. Yet, nothing is more conducive to
thoughtful decisions than the knowledge that
mistakes are costly and that the decision-mak
ers, among others, will have to pay for them.
Ex-Officio
Once the decision has been taken that stu
dents ought to be heard prior to particular
kinds of decisions, one means of providing
such a hearing is to include students among
the members of the decision-making body,
such as a Presidential, Academic Council or
Trustee committee. But, if and when this is
done students ought, I believe, to be ex officio
rather than voting members of such commit
tees, in order to make it clear to them as well
as others that they are advising, assisting and
advocating rather than deciding.
Moreover, it should be left for each commit
tee to decide for itself whether it chooses to
avail itself of this particular mechanism of
communication with the students or would
prefer to have student consultants, to hold
hearings, or to adopt other modes of com
munication.
In connection with this suggested distinc
tion between a student entitlement to be heard
and a student right to decide, a recent develop
ment at Stanford may be of some interest. A
series of inter-constituency discussions at the
University last year produced two resolutions,
dealing with a variety of problems, which
were found acceptable by the various consti
tuencies of the University and were adopted
by common consent. The resolutions included
one recommendation which I quote, in part:
All University constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to the formula
tion of University policies respecting mat
ters in which they have a legitimate Interest.
In order to provide a means of effectuating
this principle, while maintaining freedom of
decision and action by all constituencies. ..
A mechanism should be established through
which duly appointed representatives of the
President of the University, the Academic
Council and the Legislature meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a
view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations
to be made to their several appointing
powers. The group meeting for this purpose
. . . should not have power to make decisions
or to bind their several appointing powers
to make decisions.
You will note that the resolution begins with
a recitation, in effect, that students, among
others, have a right to be heard—not that they
have a right to decide. It proposed the creation
of a body having no power to decide anything
or to bind anybody else to decide anything. It
proposed a forum for discussion and held out
only the possibility of agreement in principle
and joint recommendation to the several con
stituencies of the University community.
Committee Of 15
The mechanism referred to wa6 established
at the beginning of this academic year and is
known on the campus as the Committee of
Fifteen. To date, the Committee has not ac
complished a great deal. It has been feeling its
way, trying to establish some operating prin
ciples and procedures, and beginning its study
of a number of thorny problems within the
University community.
The Committee has not moved as fast or
accomplished as much as many students ob
viously hoped it would, but, while Commit
tee has not got off to a roaring start and, in
deed, while it is too early to determine wheth
er it will work at all, I believe that the Com
mittee will probably survive its somewhat un
certain beginning and could come to play an
effective role within the University.
What is important for present purposes, in
my view, is that the 1965 recommendations
both asserted that students are entitled to be
heard on matters of legitimate interest to them
and did not assert that they should be given a
significantly enhanced role in the decision
making process itself. For myself—as present
ly advised—l would tend to maintain this dis
tinction quite carefully in the ordering of Uni
versity affairs.


Prof. John R. McDonough
(Editor's note: John R. McDonough, Pro
fessor of Law at Stanford and a member of
the Committee of 15, has prepared the follow
ing article for publication in The Daily. It is
based on a speech he presented in Los An
geles last Friday to the Stanford Law Society
of Southern California.)

Some students appear to hold the view that
what is fundamentally wrong with American
universities in general and Stanford in par
ticular is that a university is very largely
run or governed by a bureaucracy known as
the Administration. The Administration is per
ceived as either inadvertently or malevolently
making a large number of unwise decisions
relating both to educational policy and to
standards of student conduct.
Both students and faculty are regarded as
being largely subjugated by the Administra
tion and required to conduct themselves in
ways that are antithetical to the true values
and purposes of a University.
The ultimate solution proposed for this re
grettable state of affairs is the establishment,
as the premier governing and policy-making
entity within the University, of a kind of uni
cameral legislature in which faculty and stu
dents would be equally represented.
Another view held by many students—
which seems to be a variation of or exception
to the notion just expressed—is that students
should have sole power and responsibility for
fixing standards for student conduct.
The students who hold these views are cur
rently making demands for recognition, auto
nomy and participation in decision-making
which will move the University immediately
in the direction, and ultimately to the realiza
tion of the goals they have set. Their strate
gy and tactics seem currently to be taking
two major directions.
Monolithic Constituency
First they are endeavoring to organize the
student body, both undergraduate and grad
uate, into a monolithic political constituency.
Thus, we have witnessed in recent years the
emergence of the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University as the pre
eminent organ of student political action.
LASSU has aserted, and both the ASSU presi
dents and the student judicial councils ap
pear to have accepted, the view that LASSU
is predominant in the s.tudent political struc
ture.
During the current year LASSU has been
asserting influence over various student en
tities, boards and enterprises which were
formerly quite autonomous, thus further con
solidating the Legislature's ascendancy in the
student realm.
Second, the activists are demanding student
membership in various decision-making en
titles within the University community. The
LASSU has recently asserted that students
should be given voting memberships on the
various Presidential committees appointed by
Dr. Sterling and on the several committees
appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council. LASSU has also assert
ed that both students and faculty members
should be voting members of committees of
the Board of Trustees. And two weeks ago
The Daily suggested that there should per
haps be student members of the Board of
Trustees itself.
Voice, Not Vote
To date, it should be noted, these demands
have been for representation, as distinguished
from adequate representation— a voice, rather
than enough votes to give students control or
even to constitute a significant voting block.
But I have little doubt that once the princi
ple of the right to participate were estab
lished, it would be followed by a demand for
something at least approaching equal repre
sentation.
How ought the rest of the University com
munity to respond to this conception of the
Great University Society?
It seems to me that the other University
constituencies have no duty to accede to these
demands merely because the students are
making them—that we are entitled and, in
deed, bound to ask if and why changes of
this magnitude in the governance of the
University ought to be made. What, then, is
the case to be made for such enhancement of
student participation in University decision
making?
Let me at this point draw a sharp dis
tinction, to which I will return later. It may
well be that at least many decisions made
within a University community would be

sounder decisions if the people making them
took the trouble to consult students before
the decisions are made, both to ascertain
relevant facts and to learn what the attitudes
of the students are toward the matters under

But the students are not asking alone for

cision makers; they are asking also to par

have to offer, either absolutely or as com
pared with the faculty members and Univer
sity administrators in whose hands the power
of decision now rests?
Presumably, all would agree that a first
quarter freshman is hardly qualified for this
role. Presumably, the students would argue
that a last-quarter senior is qualified—and
that he became qualified at some point (per
haps quite early) during the intervening per
iod. But, are even the ablest and most per
ceptive students adequately equipped in
terms of education, experience, or maturity
to decide difficult questions of University
policy? And, are the ablest and most per
ceptive students those we are talking about?
As a practical matter, it seems to me, we
are talking about those students who gravi

not all of whom have, in the past, proved to
