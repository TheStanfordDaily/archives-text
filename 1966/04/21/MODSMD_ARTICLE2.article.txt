# Draft Test Date Nears
## 
### 
April 23 is the deadline for filing
applications to take the Selective Ser
vice Qualification Test. Application
blanks and explanatory bulletins are
available at the National Service Of
fice and at the Counseling and Test
ing Office.
Students wishing to take the test
must mail their applications to Sci
ence Research Associates of Chic~ 0 j
before Saturday. Appl cants will be
notified when and wl ere to report
for the test, which w II be given at
Stanford on May 14 and 21. Test
scores will be forward d to each stu
dent's Selective Servic Board.
All male college st '.dents, gradu
ate and undergraduate, may take the
test, which is also open to high school
seniors. The Selective Service urges
students to take this opportunity to
place additional information in their
Selective Service file to help their
local boards determine their eligibili
ty for deferment.
150 Questions
The three-hour, ap
titude test contains 150 questions,
divided into four parts. These involve
reading comprehension, verbal ability,
data interpretation, and simple math
ematics. The test is designed to show
general college ability, and the ques
tions do not favor any particular field
of study.
Scoring and class standing criteria
are expected to be patterned after
those used during the Korean War,
when a passing score was 70 out of
150 items for undergraduates, and
80 for graduate students. Class stand
ing generally required for deferment
at the end of the school year was:
freshmen in the upper half of their
sophomores in the upper two
thirds; and juniors in the upper
three-fourths. Seniors seeking to en
ter graduate school should be in the
upper fourth of their class.
Local Boards Decide
Each registrant's case will be con
sidered by his local board on its own
merits. However, the aptitude test
score and class standing reports will
be key parts of a college student's
record, according to the Selective Ser
vice announcement. A low score on
the test will not automatically can
cel an existing deferment, nor will
it rule out the granting of a new de
ferment. A high score will not auto
matically qualify a student for de
ferment, but the test score, plus the
student's academic record will assist
local boards in making their deci
sions.
