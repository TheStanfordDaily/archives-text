## Cagers In Germany 
### Roger Magnuson 
Germany's group XVl's principle individuating characteristic has
to be its surprising aptitude to hold its liquor.
Indeed, if actions speak louder than words (and the Rathskeller
is usually sold out of its beer supplies before ten o'clock) the classi
cal maxim "mens sana in corpore sano" is as popular here as Burg
Krankheit.
It was, then, with something less than Carnegian optimism that
our German group waved off a coterie of ten hard-core jocks, who
had grittily accepted an invitation from Cal's campus at Gottingen
to play a home and home basketball series for the "German Axe."
A Meshed Kaleidoscope
But the defenders of Burg jockmanship hung tough and quicker
than you could say Lohnes-Strothmann they were changing clothes
in a dingy, down-at-the-heels Gottingen locker room which made
Prague's water closets look like Rickey's. After donning the madras,
sweatshirts, high school football jerseys, and hush-puppies which
comprised their uniforms, they charged like an absurdist kaleido
scope onto the gym floor.
Where, one must add, they were greeted by a uniformed Cal squad
supported by a cheering section, band and yell-leaders. A sort of
groggy concern had adumbrations in the distended fac«»s of the
travel-weary "Gut" squad as they noted that the entire Cal front
line was taller than Stanford's tallest man.
Said leggy Stanford center John Brazil, as he looked around the
mammoth (see Anthropology) old—built in 1898—gymnasium (see
education): "Gee, nobody but nobody gets to play b-ball in a place
like this!"
Cal Off to Early Lead
It was, however, a predominantly German audience that watched
the opening tip-off, a basically pro-Stanford aggregation whose vo
tarian instincts became intensified as Cal raced to a 26-2 lead after
four minutes.
At 28 2, Captain and Jock Chairman Rich Werschkul wisely sur
mised that all was not kosher on the court and called a time-out.
After a short, international talk, he decided to go to his bench and
threw crack sub Tim Groves into the game. Charging down the
court on the first action after the time-out, Groves sprained his
ankle, let his man go in for the lay-up, and did a Charlie Chaplin
jog-step back to the bench.
A reverberating chorus of "dochs" arose from the German parti
sans. But the tide began to change. Werschkul, who scored between
35 and 39 points during the game—estimates vary—began to dazzle
the opposition with übermenschliche shooting from all depths and
angles. Brazil swept the boards clean with 18-20 bounds, and Stan
ford's Steve Harrell, Terry Bird, Larry Volment, Mike Vernon and
comrades began to play in an ambivalently inspired way.
Two Figures Shoot in Double Figures
Brazil, who shot somewhere in the double figures himself with
17-20 points, and Werschkul sharing most of the scoring burden,
the Burghers slowly crept into contention, but with only three min
utes remaining the Stanford squad was still down by 14 points.
The Cal timekeeper began to light a victory cigar; the Cal referee
began salivating into his whistle. But Stanford put on an amazing
comeback, using the fastbreak to edge ever closer to the bewildered
and visibly choking counterparts. ("Actually," confessed Wersh
kul, "they blew it.")
With about five seconds to go it was 68-65 Cal. Then, on a quick
ball steal it was 68-67 Cal with three seconds to go. Finally in a bog
gling melee which resulted from"The Gut's" full-counterpress,
Werschkul was fouled with a half-second to go ;he walked slowly to
the line to shoot the one and one. The first grazed the rim and fell
through. The second was perfect. "Doch," said the timekeeper,
"doch."
Stanford Emerges Triumphant, 69-68
And as Cal vainly tried to get another shot off, a fetching Ger
man girl was already bringing an axe and a kiss for Captain Wer
schkul, who had directed the 69-68 triumph.
But the second half of the home and home series is yet to be
played and the squad is already in training under the expert direc
tion of "Wild Bill" Rivers, co-worker and mentor. The team, how
ever, contemplates no major changes in pre-game preparations.
In the somewhat slurred diction of Werschkul, expostulating from
a stool on the floor of the Burg's makeshift gym in the Rathskeller,
"I should argue with success?"
