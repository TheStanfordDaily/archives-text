## 
### 
The Trojans of Southern California remain atop the CIBA
standings today, despite weekend losses to Stanford and Cal.
UCLA, also victim of the Indians and Bears last week, maintains
second spot with an 8-3 league record.

There have been outstanding
individual performers for Stan
ford. However, many players
have not reached their presea
son billing.
Coach Dutch Fehring's base
ball tribe narrowly missed a
three game sweep over the
Southland powers when the Tro
jans scored a run in the top of
the eighth to win the second
game of Saturday's doublehead
er, 3-2. A Stanford victory
would have given the Tribe a
chance of repeating as league
champs, but shoddy fielding, re
sulting in two unearned Trojan
runs, all but destroyed that pos
sibility.
