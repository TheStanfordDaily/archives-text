# Cricket Squad Beats Cal For Second Win
## 
### 
It was a close and exciting
match which Stanford's Cricket
Club won in the last over with
eight wickets down against Cal
here Sunday.
The Stanford eleven took 30
overs for a total of 240 balls
bowled before they finally over
took Berkeley's score to win
it 168-167.
This was the second victory
of the year for the Eleven in
as many times out. Last week
they shamed a poorly manned
UCLA side 55-54.
The victory over Cal featured
some fine fielding and defense
on the part of the victor. Of the
10 outs in their opponents' in
ning, Stanford's quick defend
ers ran 4. Cricket runouts are
similar to put-outs in baseball
but are much less frequent.
Several tremendous boundary
line catches by the host Eleven
also helped to keep the Berke
ley side down to 167 with all
out.
First and Most
The opening minutes of the
home inning saw Stanford's
first batsman, Captain Mark
Feldman, knock in 47 runs

which was to make him leading
scorer for the team.
After that the tally increased
slowly for Stanford and, as the
sun went down, it looked like
they would run out of overs
until Stanford's Jim Bird came
through in the clutch.
With 18 runs to get and only
3 overs left, Bird rallied with
four, six and four run shots in
rapid order.
The winning Stanford run
was edged in the last over, and
the Eleven extended their un
defeated slate.
Next Sunday Stanford will
meet the Del Monte Cricket
Club at noon in Carmel
