## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's best ever Frosh
baseball team will be fighting
Santa Clara's frosh this week
end in what should be the big
series of the year.
Stanford is leading the Bay
Area Freshmen League with a
12-0 record while Santa Clara is
half a game behind at 11-1. The
Broncos only loss came early in
the season to Stanford.
Friday the two teams will col
lide on Stanford's Frosh Dia
mond at 3:00 p.m. Saturday, the
two antagonists move to Santa
Clara for a 2:00 p.m. game.
San Jose Losses
Last Tuesday, the Frosh han
dled San Jose State's frosh, 13-3,
with the help of an 8-run eighth
inning. Ace thrower Don Rose
came in in relief in the seventh
to pick up the win. His record
is now 7-1. Rod Poteete started
against San Jose and threw five
runless frames.
Coach Ray Young plans to
start Sandy Vance on the mound
Friday and Potette Saturday.
Vance has been coming on
strong. He has a 6-0 slate.
One Boone to the team's hit
ting has been third baseman
Bob. Besides doing a good job
with the glove, Boone is hitting
over .400 in league. Another .400
plus hitter is outfielder Jack
Hodges.
Big Sticks
There are three hitters over
.300. First baseman Mark Mar
quess after coming alive during
the spring trip has been ripping
the ball in the upper .300's.
Leftfieler Chuck Hoffmeister
and shortstop Russ Tweet are
also in that select group.

In what has so far undoubted
ly been the best season ever by
a Stanford Frosh team, Coach
Young's squad has suffered only
one loss in 20 games. That loss
was literally a surprise game.
San Mateo City College came
over to play the J.V. team and
wound up playing the Frosh.
The Frosh lost that one, 5-1.
Crucial Series
After this weekend's show
down series with Santa Clara
there will be five league games

and one non-league game left on
the schedule.
The Frosh will play Cal four
times, San Francisco State once
and Menlo College once. The
Menlo game is the non-league
affair.
The next home game after this
weekend will be against Menlo.
It is scheduled for 3:00 p.m.
Tuesday on the Frosh Diamond.
The Frosh Diamond is next to
El Camino Real and on the far
side of the Rugby Field.
