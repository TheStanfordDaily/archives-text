# use IN SECOND
## UCLA Tops All Sports 
### 
With five of the nine events completed for 1965-66, UCLA has
taken a firm hold on first place in the All-Sports Cup competi
tion.
USC is second with 39 points, and the Trojans are traditionally
spring sports powers and are sure to mount a real run at UCLA
in track, crew, golf and tennis.
After the two leaders, a mere 4% points separate OSU in third
place with 31 points and Washington in eighth place with 26%
points. The competition is extremely close among six schools.
They line up as follows: OSU third with 31; WSU fourth with
28; Cal fifth with 27%; Stanford and Oregon tied for sixth with
27 ;and Washington eighth with 26%.
A year ago UCLA lost the AAWU All-Sports Cup—symbolic of
over-all excellence in the nation's toughest Conference—to USC
by a point and a half, 76% to 75.
