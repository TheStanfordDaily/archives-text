# Rep Provides 'Transitional Experience'
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor (Second in a Series 
The $300,000 Rockefeller grant brought pro
fessional drama to Stanford with the opening
of the Repertory Theater, but the grant also
established a forward-looking program in grad
uate theater arts.
The new Master of Fine Arts Program com
bines classroom work with practical experience
in the Repertory Theater's production. But the
student-teacher relationship has turned out to
be an educational experience for the MFA can
didate as well as for the professional actors in
the Rep company.
Gerald Hiken, who is a lecturer on the staff
of the Speech and Drama Department in addi
tion to his duties as a full time member of the
Rep, recently described the MFA Program as a
"transitional experience."
Breaking Down A Myth
"We have broken down the myth of what a
professional is by mixing the role of the profea
sional and student," Hiken said. "Students havu
a great opportunity of questioning what is go
ing on. They are learning pragmatically what
they are being taught in the classroom."
Hiken admits the new program is gruelling,

and he wonders when the MFA's find time to
study. All MFA classes are scheduled in the
morning, so that students may spend the rest of
the day with the professional company.
The MFA's day begins at 9 in the morning
and often does not end until 11:30 or 12 at night
when the Rep rehearsals break up.
Presently the program has 19 candidates in
acting, directing, and technical work, but it will
ultimately enroll 40 students.
MFA Over the Professional
MFA students are guaranteed roles in all of
the Rep productions, but students must try-out
for parts along with the professionals in the
company. On occasion directors have chosen
MFA's over professionals competing for the
same part.
"Directors do not cast students to coddle them,
but because they are best suited for a part,"
Hiken commented.
Unlike most repertory groups, the Stanford
Repertory does not have a full company of ac
tors. Nine full time actors are now associated
with the company compared with 20 or 30 in
other acting organizations.
Education Not Economies
Education and not economics is the logic be
hind cooperation and competition between stu

dents and professionals. "If the professional
actors completely filled the cast, they would
only perpetuate their bad habits," Hiken noted.
"The Repertory Theater is just as much an edu
cational experience for the members of the com
pany as for the MFA's."
The members of the Rep are only required to
act in 5 of the 6 plays which the company stages
each season. The holiday gives each professional
a chance to further his career, but surprisingly
most of the actors spend the time at Stanford
working with their students or in aiding under
graduate drama.
Although their contracts do not demand that
they take part in the classroom Hiken said the
professionals often attend class. "There is a real
involvement between the company and the
MFA's, and it has been educational for both
sides," he noted.
Doing Their Best
"Th professionals must do their best on stage
and in rehearsals because they arc being
watched by students whom they are concerned
about," Hiken commented.
Hiken compared the rapport between the pro
fessional and the student to that of master and
apprentice in the medieval guild system. He de
nied any feeling of condescension, for both pro

fessional and student are constantly reminded
that acting "is above all a human experience."
With $35,000 available in scholarships each
year, the Speech and Drama canvases the na
tion's colleges for prospective students. Profes
sor Robert Loper, Executive Head of the depart
ment, noted his staff "scouts young actors like
the football coach scouts young football play
ers."
In Competition With Themselves
Compared with similar programs at Yale and
other colleges, the MFA program takes fewer
students and generally is much more demand
ing in its selections. However the MFA's are in
competition only with themselves which takes
much of the pressure off the first year in the
three year program.
At Yale and Carnegie Technological Institute,
students are on probation for the first year, and
only 50 per cent are asked to return.
Considering the demanding work load of the
Stanford program, Hiken said students who
stick with the program are generally invited
back for the second year. "The student quickly
learns to criticize his own work, and criticism
si a daily fact of life in the theater," he com
mented.
