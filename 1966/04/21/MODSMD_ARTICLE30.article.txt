# IBM Learns To Love; Or, Is Op Match Contagious?
## 
### BOB EWEGEN The Collegiate Press Service 
There are many legends in academe, but none
is more touching than the legend of Randy, the
IBM machine with a heart.
Randy didn't always have a heart of course.
Originally she was simply computer model EVO
at the university data processing center. Her job
was simply to handle those myriad IBM cards
which daily spew forth and guide the destiny of
all 11,500 of us in the idyll.
Randy worked well. All her circuits knew their
task and she dilligently sorted out information
from the holes in the cards. Occasionally, when
so programmed, she would give back a detailed
answer to a question.
But of course, Randy never thought. Machines
are not supposed to think. She was a useful, re
sponsible member of the total university com
munity; she didn't have to think. Then one day
there was a short power outage. Not long after
wards, the trouble began.
The Fateful Day
Randy was programmed on that fateful day,
March 12, 1968, to handle discipline cases. Num
ber 241629's card was fed into her. 241629 was
a coed. She had stayed over night in a man's
dorm without permission. They were both adults.
No third party suffered any harm from what
they had done. They had conducted their affairs
in privacy.
In short they had harmed no one. But they
were caught. Naturally, the girl was being ex
pelled. Humans had sat in judgment and given
their decision. They had simply fed the cards to
Randy and left it up to her to handle the red tape
necessary to coordinate the girl's expulsion with
the affected administrators.
241629's card was fed into the machine. The
circuits hummed. Then a strange clicking sound
began. 241629's card never emerged from Randy.
The proper administrative bodies never learned
about the action they were to take. The coed
stayed in school.
Well, that was the first foulup. There were
others. A senior named 254043 was discovered
to be lacking in one course necessary for gradu
ation. It was not a course that was useful to his
career. It was not a course he was interested in.
He did not need the total hours. The two-hour
course was only necessary to fill an arbitrary re
quirement. Naturally, 254043 wouldn't graduate,
the administration decided.
Humming Circuits
254043's card went into the machine. It should
not have punched with the code to allow
him to graduate. Randy's circuits hummed. The
strange noise began again. The card emerged—
punched. 254043 graduated as planned in June.
Then there was the case of 269615. She wanted
to drop a course. It was a dull course. It was not
contributing anything real to her education. She
was working and could not spare the time to
properly prepare for it. She felt that since it was
her education, she had the right to take it at the
rate she thought most useful to her.
The University denied her request. No IBM
card should have issued forth. But the circuits
hummed. The clicking noise began. 269615 re
ceived her permission to drop the course.
Then an even more astonishing thing happened.
Randy was fed all 11,500 IBM cards for a routine
accounting. She spewed them out not only with
the matriculation number but with each person's
name!
Ix>ng Memorandum
Furthermore, Randy sent out a long memoran
dum explaining her action. And not in that pro

gramming code either. She used plain English!
Randy's memorandum said, in part:
"Men and women are not machines. They have
a deep need to be recognized as individuals. They
need to be dealt with as if they have personal
worth inherent within them. To reduce them to
the mass is to deny this dignity.
"To place them in interminable lines for the
sake of administrative convenience is to under
mine their basic identity. To consider them as
faceless equations to be manipulated as coldly
as one does a formula is to destroy something
precious within them.
"They are not programmed automatons who
can unthinkingly perform seemingly meaning
less tasks in service of a system which claims to
be for their benefit. They are not robot-like
minions of the state. They are not faceless cogs
in society. And they shall not be just numbers at
this University."
Community Stunned
All of the community was stunned by the mem
orandum, which rapidly was reprinted and
dubbed "The Randy Statement."
The University first tried to replace Randy.
But she cost $6 million and the trustees could
not afford a new one.
They tried to fix Randy. But no matter how
many times her circuits were inspected they
could find nothing wrong. Finally the adminis
tration decided they would have to live with her.
To the students Randy became a symbol of
hope—a court of last resort, an executive clem
ency for wrongs which knew no other redress.
And she continued to live up to their hopes.
The hours system broke down because she bar
bled the red tape. At last women students were
given the freedom the men had enjoyed all along
and the double standard was dead in academe.
Defiance
The registration system became so snarled that
the University had to liberalize its rule and re
quirements—Randy would just refuse to go along
with the more arbitrary scheduling rules.
Many students who were failing out but asked
for another chance got one. The financial aid sys
tem stopped penalizing those students who tried
to help themselves.
Soon a funny thing happened. Much of the ten
sion and nonsense disappeared from the Multi
versity. The atmosphere was like that of old
Greece, where men studied for love of learning
and not for cumulative grade points.
Students at last were treated as responsible and
free citizens.
Even the university realized that responsibility
is only part of the other side of the coin of free
dom. The rest of that side is the authority and
power to govern your own acts.
It was not Utopia. There were still problems.
But each student and faculty member at last felt
he was a separate, distinct, valuable person and
recognized as such, not as a number.
Lower Tuition
And because of all the administrative red tape
that was forcibly discarded, the trustees even
lowered tuition!
They never found out just why Randy went
astray that immortal day in March. Some say
the power failure subtly altered her circuits.
Some say a man in a black leather jacket and
a black beard who often stood near the machines
and stared with fierce eyes was responsible.
But deep in the lore of the students of the uni
versity is another theory. Somehow, someway,
they say, Randy developed a circuit that was
never programmed into her. She developed a
characteristic that IBM never meant to impart:
Randy the IBM machine learned to love.
