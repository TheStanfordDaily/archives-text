# The 						Capitol Scene
## Rambling Tech And The CIA 
### Art Buchwald 
It was revealed last week that
a study project on Vietnam at
Michigan State University was
in reality a cover for a CIA fi
nanced operation. It was charged
that the project, which lasted
from 1955 to 1959, was used to
set up the Diem government in
Vietnam and keep it in power.
The university has admitted
that it did go along with the
CIA and knew the agents were
on campus. But it denied an ar
ticle in Ramparts magazine that
it did anything wrong.
The revelation has caused a
certain amount of apprehension
in the academic world and no
body can be sure anymore who
is a legitimate student and who
is a member of the CIA.

Just the other day at Ram
bling Tech University a profes
sor of government called in one
of his students and said, "Mr.
Green, I don't understand this
essay. You handed in nothing
hut a blank sheet of paper."
"What's the matter, professor,
haven't you heard of invisible
ink?"
"Invisible ink?"
"I ran out of ink, so I had to
write with my other pen. Put it
in a pan of water. The essay's
all there."

The professor took the essay
over to his sink and poured wa
ter on it. "This is very strange.
Oh, yes, now I see it. The title
of the essay is 'Zink the Zonk
Government Zeek and Zak High
er Zip Education.'"
"That's right," Green said,
"you have to read every second
word."
"I don't understand."
"I can't help it. That's the
way they taught me to write in
high school."
No Notes
"Green, I notice you never
take any notes in my class. Can
you explain this to me?"
"It's because of my tie clasp.
You see, my tie clasp is really a
radio transmitter. I have a tape
machine back in my room and all
I do is tape your lectures. It
saves me writing with invisible
ink."
"Very ingenious, Green. Now
I noticed during the last test you
kept photographing the other
students' papers with a Minox
camera."
"Yeah, well, it was Just a
training exercise."
"A training exercise?"
"Yeah, I was thinking of
working for Xerox when I fin
ished school."
"Green, T don't want to seem

unreasonable, but the last book
report you handed in was on mi
crofilm."
"What's wrong with that?"
"Nothing except you left it in
a pumpkin behind your fraterni
ty house. I don't have time to
look for hidden book reports."
"I guess it's force of habit.
Look, I've got a meeting this af
ternoon with a courier, I mean
a fraternity brother. Is there
anything else?"
Flunk
"Yes, there is, Green. I'm go
ing to have to flunk you."
"Flunk me in government?"
"Flunk you in the CIA." The
professor whipped out a CIA
card. "I'm your superior, Green,
in charge of the operation at this
school and you've made a hash
of things."
"But how?"
"It turns out the sorority girl
you're dating works for the Stu
dents Against American Inter
vention in Vietnam. She's had
you bugged from the begin
ning."
"But how?"
"Take a close look at her so
rority pin which you're wear
ing."
"My gosh, you can't trust any
body anymore."

"Green, T don't want to seem

unreasonable, but the last book
report you handed in was on mi
crofilm."
"What's wrong with that?"
"Nothing except you left it in
a pumpkin behind your fraterni
ty house. I don't have time to
look for hidden book reports."
"I guess it's force of habit.
Look, I've got a meeting this af
ternoon with a courier, I mean
a fraternity brother. Is there
anything else?"
Flunk
"Yes, there is, Green. I'm go
ing to have to flunk you."
"Flunk me in government?"
"Flunk you in the CIA." The
professor whipped out a CIA
card. "I'm your superior, Green,
in charge of the operation at this
school and you've made a hash
of things."
"But how?"
"It turns out the sorority girl
you're dating works for the Stu
dents Against American Inter
vention in Vietnam. She's had
you bugged from the begin
ning."
"But how?"
"Take a close look at her so
rority pin which you're wear
ing."
"My gosh, you can't trust any
body anymore."
It was revealed last week that
a study project on Vietnam at
Michigan State University was
in reality a cover for a CIA fi
nanced operation. It was charged
that the project, which lasted
from 1955 to 1959, was used to
set up the Diem government in
Vietnam and keep it in power.
The university has admitted
that it did go along with the
CIA and knew the agents were
on campus. But it denied an ar
ticle in Ramparts magazine that
it did anything wrong.
The revelation has caused a
certain amount of apprehension
in the academic world and no
body can be sure anymore who
is a legitimate student and who
is a member of the CIA.

Just the other day at Ram
bling Tech University a profes
sor of government called in one
of his students and said, "Mr.
Green, I don't understand this
essay. You handed in nothing
hut a blank sheet of paper."
"What's the matter, professor,
haven't you heard of invisible
ink?"
"Invisible ink?"
"I ran out of ink, so I had to
write with my other pen. Put it
in a pan of water. The essay's
all there."

The professor took the essay
over to his sink and poured wa
ter on it. "This is very strange.
Oh, yes, now I see it. The title
of the essay is 'Zink the Zonk
Government Zeek and Zak High
er Zip Education.'"
"That's right," Green said,
"you have to read every second
word."
"I don't understand."
"I can't help it. That's the
way they taught me to write in
high school."
No Notes
"Green, I notice you never
take any notes in my class. Can
you explain this to me?"
"It's because of my tie clasp.
You see, my tie clasp is really a
radio transmitter. I have a tape
machine back in my room and all
I do is tape your lectures. It
saves me writing with invisible
ink."
"Very ingenious, Green. Now
I noticed during the last test you
kept photographing the other
students' papers with a Minox
camera."
"Yeah, well, it was Just a
training exercise."
"A training exercise?"
"Yeah, I was thinking of
working for Xerox when I fin
ished school."
"Green, T don't want to seem

unreasonable, but the last book
report you handed in was on mi
crofilm."
