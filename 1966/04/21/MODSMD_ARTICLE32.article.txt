Editor, The Daily:
For your information: Last
Sunday 600 students and 50
members of the faculty and
their wives participated in a
Symposium on education which
was largely the brainchild of
Bob Klein, candidate for ASSU
President. Only two days after
this program received headline
coverage in the Palo Alto Times,
a reporter on your staff wrote
that "Klein's past performance
does not show any concern for
student involvement in Educa
tion which his platform and
campaign have stressed."
You failed to even report this
symposium in your news sec
tion, but, what is far worse, you

have written editorial state
ments, in an effort to influence
the election results, that show
no knowledge of this creative
venture, which originated from
an ad hoc committee in which
Bob Klein was a driving force.
You might do well to ask some
of the faculty and students who
have worked with Bob about his
commitment to educational re
form before you make dispara
ging comments in your edito
rials. If the students who vote
today have a clear conception of
the candidates and their qualifi
cations, it is with no help from
The Daily.
