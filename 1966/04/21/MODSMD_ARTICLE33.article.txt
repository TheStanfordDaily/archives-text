# Today And Tomorrow
## US-France Quarrel Probably Negotiable 
### Walter Lippmann 
If our object is to preserve the
Western alliance, a rein should
be put on the zealots in the
State Department who are in
dulging in an all-out quarrel
with Gen. Charles de Gaulle. Un
til recently the President has
kept the zealots in check. But
recently, probably because the
President is so preoccupied else
where, they have taken charge
of our European policy.
They cry out that Gen. De
Gaulle's views on NATO are
nonsense, that they are a decla
ration that France is an unde
pendable ally and in general that
the future of the alliance de
pends on the defeat, if possible
the disappearance, of Gen. De
Gaulle.
France Indispenslble
For the preservation of the al
liance the willing adherence of
France is indispensible, and the
adherence of France will not
amount to much if the Gaullists,
who are the most high-spirited,
martial element in France, are
defeated, humiliated and aliena
ted.
The State Department should
remember that the main opposi
tion to Gen. De Gaulle does not
consist of the followers of M.
Jean Monnet and M. Lecanuet.
The main opposition is from the
left which includes the large
Communist bloc.
The coalition of leftist parties
is not one bit fonder of the
NATO organization than is Gen.
De Gaulle, and unlike him the
leftist coalition has no great
liking for the Western alliance
itself. Gen. De Gaulle may make
some of us as uncomfortable as
if we were in a frying pan, but
the popular front which might
come after him would be the fire
itself.
Negotiability
If what the French prime min
ister, M. Pompidou, and the
French foreign minister, M.
Couve de Murville, have been
saying in the past few weeks is
French policy, the issue raised
by Gen. De Gaulle is quite nego
tiable.
France, they say, wants to
preserve the Atlantic alliance
and takes with entire serious
ness the obligation under the al
liance to come to the defense of
the other members. France does
not intend, they assert repeated
ly, to reverse its alliances by
making an alliance with the So
viet Union.
France will not keep French
forces under the integrated gen
eral staffs set up by NATO. But,
said M. Pompidou on April 13,
"We are prepared to debate with
them (i.e. the other 14 NATO
partners), and particularly with
the United States and Germany,
the terms of application, wheth
er on the transfer of the general
staffs, the evacuation of the
American bases or the presence
of French troops in Germany.
Prepared to Negotiate
"We are prepared to negotiate
agreements on the facilities that
could be granted to the allies
and aimed at providing for par
ticipation by the French armed
forces in joint action in the event
of conflict in the framework of
the alliance."
The French may be mistaken,
even wrong-headed, in objecting
to integrated general staffs in
time of peace. There is room
here, as M. Pompidou's remarks
show, for careful negotiation as
to just how military planning
can be conducted and just how
joint planning among the gen
eral staffs can be made effective.
But there is not room for going
into tantrums of rage.
We must never forget that
the main military arm of the al
liance is U. S. strategic air
power and that it is not, and
probably never will be, placed
under an integrated general
staff. The passion of the State
Department for the integration
of the general staffs does not ex
tend to the integration of SAC.
New Perspective
If we study the French view
of the alliance, not only in the
rather Delphic pronouncements
of Gen. De Gaulle, but in the
speeches and interviews of his
principal ministers, we shall, I

believe, see in a new perspective
the dispute about the integrated
general staffs of the NATO or
ganization.
There is no evidence to sup
port the allegation that the issue
of integrated command has been
raised in order to disrupt the al
liance, to destroy the evolving
unity of Western Europe or to
separate Europe from America.
"It is inevitable and beneficial
to all," said M. Couve de Mur
ville on April 14, "that Europe
reassume its independence with
respect to America. It is inevita
ble that the latter conduct its
policy throughout the world and
that this policy, more and more,
be outside the European coun
tries.
Inevitable
"It is inevitable that relations
between East and West not re
main frozen in the situation they
were in 15 years ago and that,
as a result, the Russian-Ameri
can rivalry decrease at the same
time as distant prospects for a
peaceful and lasting European
settlement come into view.
"Finally, it is inevitable that,
in international policy, the new
factors that have appeared in the
past 15 years—that is, first the
mass of newly independent
countries and second the enor
mous Chinese power — make
their impact increasingly felt
and that the Atlantic alliance be
changed by this."
This is a view of the world
with which we can live.
