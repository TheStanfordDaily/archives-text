# Legislature To Confirm Vote Return
## Vote! 
### 
A new ASSU president could be
chosen by tonight. The major item
of business at LASSU tonight will
be the election returns.
The meeting will take place in room
320 at 8:00 tonight. The later time
is to provide for tabulating the re
sults. The returns will be announced
and appeals will be heard by the Elec
tion Commission at that time.
The Legislature must then pass on
the validity of the election for the
results to be made official. For of
fices that do not acquire the ma
jority in the primary, runoffs will
be held next week.
Five resolutions are scheduled to
be introduced and referred. The first
one, sponsored by the Cardinals
Board, suggests a price increase for
the May 1 ASSU movie to raise
money for the Con Home Drive. The
next resolution is an appropriation
of $350 to the Political Union for
bringing Paul Baran to campus for
a Socialist Caucus.
Jon Roise will ask for an under
write of $25 for the Western Students
Press Association in Denver. The
last appropriation is for $4501 to the
Executive Expense Account.
The Health Center announced ear
lier this week that they would con
tinue not to report LSD users in spite
of the recent government request. An
other proposed resolution commends
the policy as in keeping with the
Health Center's functions as a medi
cal advisor and not a law enforcement
agency.


Yesterday 1979 votes were cast in
the ASSU elections, one of the heav
iest first-day turnouts in years. A
fifth of the women have been polled
