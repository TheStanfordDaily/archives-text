columnist Ralph Gleason will host
the two-hour concert-discussion.

"Mojo"
Waters, who achieved success most
recently with a recording of his own
composition, "I Got My Mojo Work
ing," was discovered in the cotton
fields of his native Mississippi by
folklore expert Alan Lomax. Lomax
supervised the singer-guitarist-har
monica player's recordings for the
Library of Congress.
Influence On Stones
Many of the English rock groups,
like the Rolling Stones, call Waters
a great influence on their music.
He has performed in a folk music
concert at Carnegie Hall and at the
Newport Folk Festival, but is consid
ered a jazz artist as well, and has
appeared at the Newport and Down

Beat Jazz Festivals. He is said to have
incorporated rhythmic and harmonic
aspects of jazz into a "personal style
of tremendous appeal."
As his reputation grew, Waters
moved to Chicago, appeared in clubs
there, then began making nightclub
tours through the South, always at
tracting a larger and more enthusias
tic audience. He toured England with
great success in 1958.
