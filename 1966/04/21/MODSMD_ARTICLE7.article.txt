# LACOUTURE:
## French Writer To Talk On Politics In Vietnam 
### SUSAN KENT 
Jean Lacouture, author of Vietnam:
Between Two Truces (Le Vietnam En
tre Deux Paix), will offer his French
perspective on Vietnam today at 4:15
in Dinkelspiel. In addition to the
speech, "Politics Inside Vietnam," Po
litical Union will sponsor an informal
reception for Lacouture at 8:00 to
night in Tresidder Large Lounge.
A correspondent for Le Monde, M.
Lacouture tries to dispel the myths
surrounding the political struggle in
Vietnam. He rejects the "hysterical"
notions of the war as a critical con
test between communism and freedom
or between China and the Soviet Un
ion.
"Vietnam Lives"
Instead he concentrates on the ori
gin and forces of the conflict as a lo
cal political phenomenon. In the open
ing sentence of his book he announces
that, despite all, "Vietnam lives." And
he stresses that Vietnam is a place
where people live, not just an issue of
U. S. foreign policy.
About Diem, Lacouture states that
his regime was bound to fail because
it lacked sympathy for the pluralism
which would allow great scope for lo
cal differences. By following a policy
intolerant of these differences, the re
gime called forth the two forces that
were to hasten its downfall: a strong
military and a united Viet Cong.
Calls for Negotiations
Because the Vietnam struggle began
locally, Lacouture asserts that it can
only be ended by a settlement of local
Issues. He thus considers negotiations
between the Saigon government and
the Viet Cong a prerequisite for
peace.
Lacouture first went to Vietnam on
the Staff of General Leclerc in 1945.
Since then he has visited both North

and South Vietnam several times as a
Le Monde correspondent. His acquain
tance with the leading political fig
ures of the Hanoi and Saigon govern
ments and of the Viet Cong has en
riched his writing on Vietnam.
