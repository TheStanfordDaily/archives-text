# Hopefuls Debate Issues, Methods

### WENDY WEINER 
It was hard to determine just how
much of the heat that poured into
White Plaza yesterday noon was be
ing generated by the sun.
ASSU presidential and vice-presi
dential candidates vehemently debated
on their platforms while a large crowd
of Stanford students listened, cheered
and hissed.
Dave Harris began his remarks by
stating that he considers this election
an opportunity for students who feel
that "Stanford is going the wrong
way" to reverse its movement.
Harris countered the "paternal
model" of an educational institution
that was prsented by Professor John
McDonough in an article in Thurs
day's Daily. "Education must create
an independent, self-sufficient intellec
tual. Students should not, as McDon
ough suggested, merely accept educa
tion without becoming.involved. They
must protect themselves from the atti
tude that says 'you don't exist'," said
Harris.
Klein Questioned Utopian Ideals
Bob Klein, the other presidential
aspirant, called Harris's comments
"platitudes of consensus, not points
of contention in this race." He cited
past president Armin Rosencranz' con
cept of "a revolution of the moder
ates," stating that co-operation is the
way to bring about reform.
He questioned what he called the
two "pseudo-Utopian ideals" presented
by Dave Harris: the idea that the com
pletion of 180 units of work should be
the only critera for graduation, and
the one scholar-one vote concept.
Mike Collins, Harris's running mate,
accused Klein of merely "hitting at
symptoms" in his approach to student
government. He used Klein's position
on the pass-fail system of evaluation
as an example. "Eliminating grades in
fields outside of just one's major puts
pressure on students to declare a
major as soon as they arrive at Stan
ford," he said.
Quoting Yeats, Rosencranz, and an
anonymous Chinese poet, Klein's run
ning mate Jan Jacobi advocated work
ing within the present governmental
structure to accomplish platform
goals.
The platform of Harris and Collins
"stirs a great fear within me," he
stated." The power of students does
not rest on the University's fear of
bad publicity, but on their achieve
ment."
Rebuttal
"I am a human being, not an atom
bomb," said Harris in his own defense.
"To look on me as Attila the Hun,
sweeping across White Plaza, is a bit
paranoic."
When asked about his philosophy
of change, Klein stated that he feels
we can take advantage of committee
structure to affect change.
The candidates responded to a ques
tion concerning their attitudes toward
the results of the women's social regu
lations poll and the poll on contra
ceptives which had been included on
last week's ballot.
As far as social regulations are con
cerned, said Klein, only the opinion
of the women is important. And they
indicated that they want liberaliza
tion, not abolition, of the existing regu
lations.

Since students demonstrated "that
they wanted change in the contracep
tive issue we will work for it."
Harris stated that the vote on wo
men's social regulations was irrelev
ant. "You have certain rights, whether
or not students vote to let you have
these rights."
He asked that students put civil dis
obedience in its proper perspective.
"We've been using it for years. The
liquor decision was made after ten
years of civil disobedience by stu
dents. But I'm not sure what kind of
civil disobedience one should use on
the contraceptive issue," said Harris.
"Use your imagination."
Defined Education
At the request of Carl Schmidt, both
candidates described their definitions
of education.
Bob Klein cited the concept of edu
cation given by Dr. Otis Pease: a con
tinuous process of stimulating curios
ity and committment. He said that
he hoped to be able to reach this ideal
by working through the normal chan
nels.
Harris stated that there are two
qualities he feels are essential for
education. One of these is an equality
based on a pure democratic model. The
other is a system which offers free
dom bordering on anarchy.
In attaining this system, said Har
ris, the most important aspect is
time. "If we want changes in one year,
not five to ten years, we must act."

by Dave Harris: the idea that the com

the one scholar-one vote concept.
Mike Collins, Harris's running mate,
accused Klein of merely "hitting at
symptoms" in his approach to student
government. He used Klein's position
on the pass-fail system of evaluation
as an example. "Eliminating grades in
fields outside of just one's major puts
pressure on students to declare a
major as soon as they arrive at Stan

Quoting Yeats, Rosencranz, and an
anonymous Chinese poet, Klein's run
ning mate Jan Jacobi advocated work
ing within the present governmental
structure to accomplish platform
goals.
The platform of Harris and Collins
"stirs a great fear within me," he

not rest on the University's fear of
bad publicity, but on their achieve

"I am a human being, not an atom
bomb," said Harris in his own defense.
"To look on me as Attila the Hun,

paranoic."
When asked about his philosophy
of change, Klein stated that he feels
we can take advantage of committee
structure to affect change.
The candidates responded to a ques
tion concerning their attitudes toward
the results of the women's social regu
lations poll and the poll on contra
ceptives which had been included on
last week's ballot.
As far as social regulations are con
cerned, said Klein, only the opinion
of the women is important. And they
indicated that they want liberaliza
tion, not abolition, of the existing regu
lations.

Since students demonstrated "that
they wanted change in the contracep
tive issue we will work for it."
Harris stated that the vote on wo
men's social regulations was irrelev
ant. "You have certain rights, whether
or not students vote to let you have
these rights."
He asked that students put civil dis
obedience in its proper perspective.
"We've been using it for years. The
liquor decision was made after ten
years of civil disobedience by stu
dents. But I'm not sure what kind of
civil disobedience one should use on
the contraceptive issue," said Harris.
"Use your imagination."
Defined Education
At the request of Carl Schmidt, both
candidates described their definitions
of education.
Bob Klein cited the concept of edu
cation given by Dr. Otis Pease: a con
tinuous process of stimulating curios
ity and committment. He said that
he hoped to be able to reach this ideal
by working through the normal chan
nels.
Harris stated that there are two
qualities he feels are essential for
education. One of these is an equality
based on a pure democratic model. The
other is a system which offers free
dom bordering on anarchy.
In attaining this system, said Har
ris, the most important aspect is
time. "If we want changes in one year,
not five to ten years, we must act."

It was hard to determine just how
much of the heat that poured into
White Plaza yesterday noon was be

ASSU presidential and vice-presi

Dave Harris began his remarks by

that "Stanford is going the wrong

Bob Klein, the other presidential

The candidates responded to a ques
tion concerning their attitudes toward
the results of the women's social regu
lations poll and the poll on contra
ceptives which had been included on
last week's ballot.
As far as social regulations are con
cerned, said Klein, only the opinion
of the women is important. And they
indicated that they want liberaliza
tion, not abolition, of the existing regu
lations.

Since students demonstrated "that
they wanted change in the contracep
tive issue we will work for it."
Harris stated that the vote on wo
men's social regulations was irrelev
ant. "You have certain rights, whether
or not students vote to let you have
these rights."
He asked that students put civil dis
obedience in its proper perspective.
"We've been using it for years. The
liquor decision was made after ten
years of civil disobedience by stu
dents. But I'm not sure what kind of
civil disobedience one should use on
the contraceptive issue," said Harris.
"Use your imagination."
Defined Education
At the request of Carl Schmidt, both
candidates described their definitions
of education.
Bob Klein cited the concept of edu
cation given by Dr. Otis Pease: a con
tinuous process of stimulating curios
ity and committment. He said that
he hoped to be able to reach this ideal
by working through the normal chan
nels.
Harris stated that there are two
qualities he feels are essential for
education. One of these is an equality
based on a pure democratic model. The
other is a system which offers free
dom bordering on anarchy.
In attaining this system, said Har
ris, the most important aspect is
time. "If we want changes in one year,
not five to ten years, we must act."
