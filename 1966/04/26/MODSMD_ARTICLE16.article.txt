Speed Steel Paint Sky . . . the Fremont Drags on a Sunday after
noonâ€”standing room only.
If you can recall tuning your '56 Chevy in high school so you
could turn ninety on the local strip or just for the fun and glory of
shutting down the neighborhood screecher, then it shouldn't be too
hard to imagine a car built to accelerate to near 200 mph in a quar
ter mile.
If you are accustomed to spending your Sunday afternoons seren
ely whispering lines from Blake into the ears of a dollie on the shores
of Lagunita, or even if you prefer fighting flies in the stacks, the
Fremont Drags I'm sure, would come as a pleasant surprise. People
there are concerned with creating action, not reading or writing
about it, and problems are even more immediate to the mechanic in
the pit than to the student concerned with maintaining his 11-S
classification.
Full Of Color, Excitement
Imagine, if you will, a car reving up to about 6000 rpm and then
popping the clutch, connecting in that motion 427 horsepower to the
asphalt through Goodyear slicks twelve inches wide. The front ct
the car comes up off the ground, fire pours out of the exhaust pipes,
the squeal of the tires hides the sound of the engine and the smoke
of the burning rubber hides the entire cockpit from the spectators.
Imagine yourself to be a grog.
A grog is the affecionado of the dragstrip. Every Sunday he
hides his grey suit and dons the blue jeans and white shirt with the
subtly visible grease spot on the pocket and arrives at the strip the
minute the gates open in the morning.
Along with about three thousand other grogs, he will shout at
the top of his voice each time the loudspeaker yells "There they go!"
and he will moan as the "little stinkin' Chevys" leave the big Chrys
lers sucking fumes behind them.
In The Pits
If he is a real class grog, however, he will be in the pits tinkering
instead of yelling, only lifting his head to watch his own car race
or else to make a groggish comment like "That goer is a comer"
traceable to "El Cigaro" of Sacramento. The grog, in short, is where
the action is.
If you'd been out there Sunday, for instance, your eardrums
might have been shattered as Top Fuel Eliminator Don Cook of
Sacramento burned through the finish line at better than 220 mph
in 7.47 seconds.
Your breath would have stopped for a few seconds when you
learned that one of the cars' braking chutes had not opened, and
that the car had raced at 150 mph through a pasture fence at the
end of the strip, or you would have laughed out loud when a Chev
rolet transmission flew out the bottom of the car and all over the
track.
With everything from Hondas, Renaults and stinkin' little Chevys
to fire-eating, record-hunting, monster Chrysler dragsters, Fremont
gives the grog his money's worth.
