# Wither The 'New Era'?
## 
### 
The reactions of Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert J. Wert and a few Legislature
members to last week's referendum on contracep
tives are anything but conducive to what we
would like to believe is a new era of cooperation
between students and administrators.
The University, Wert said flatly on Friday, has
"no intention whatsoever" of allowing the Health
Service to dispense contraceptives upon request.
This came only hours after a student body vote
overwhelmingly urged that the Health Center
"be authorized to prescribe contraceptives to
any student desiring them."
If our memory serves us correctly, Dean Wert
gave a similarily definitive answer last quarter
to the Wilbur sponsors who found unacceptable
his proposal to alter the method of sponsor selec
tion. But, as it worked out, Wert later found
it necessary to capitulate to the combined opin
ion of the sponsors and a few influential faculty
members.
We would think that the good dean would
have learned from the experience.

We would tliink, too, that he might have
heeded the suggestion of Professors Rhinelander
and MeDonough that student demands be
thoroughly looked into; that administrators
"really listen" to students.
But such, apparently, is not the case.
Not that the reaction of a few people in stu
dent government has been much better. A sassy
resolution introduced on the floor of the Legis
lature last night would provide $300 of ASSU
funds for private medical examinations of Stan
ford women desiring contraceptives. Such an
approach unnecessarily widens the gulf existing
between students and the administration on the
subject. But then the other side hasn't shown
much desire for discussion either.
Perhaps the contraceptive issue is one that
should be placed before the Committee of Fif
teen, where, at least, it could be rationally dis
cussed. A Legislature resolution asking that the
Committee take up the case might go a long way
toward offsetting the effect of one closed-minded
dean and several overly enthusiastic students.
At least it wouldn't do any harm.
