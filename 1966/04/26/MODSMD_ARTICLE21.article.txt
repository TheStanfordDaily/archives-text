# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Last Word On Rush 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish that fraternity spokes
men like Mr. Peter Lake (The
Daily, April 22) would talk less
about fraternity "rights" and
think more about their responsi
bility to the rest of the Univers
ity community.
As far as I could tell from
Mr. Lake's letters, these so
called "rights" rest on shaky
ground indeed. His justification
is a sort of argument from an
alogy: since country clubs and
businesses in the "real' 'world
can choose their members, it is
unfair to deny that "right" to
fraternities.
As elsewhere, Mr. Lake is
confusing the ideals and pur
poses of a university with those
of a country club. I do not doubt
that many country clubs and
even businesses recruit their
members in the superficial and
discriminatory manner that fra
ternities do. But why should
Stanford University follow this
ignoble example?
Indeed, there are good reas
ons why Stanford should not.
Rush, as it stands, embodies the
"values" of snobbery, prejudice,
and anti-intellectualism which
are the true enemies of an aca
demic community. Professor
Meyerhof, in a letter which Mr.
Lake labeled "rhetorical gar
bage," aptly characterized rush
and hell week as practices that
"emphasize superficiality, uni
formity, conventionality, and
debase the dignity of the indi
vidual."
Mr. Lake, too, is in favor of
human dignity (while stating
that hell week is "irrelevant"),
but adds that "people can take
what they want up to a certain
point but then they must sub
mit to the prerogatives of oth
ers." I maintain that the prerog
atives that Mr. Lake and others
claim are "rights" have no place
whatsoever on a university cam
pus. They debase the university,
and anyone committed to the
ideals and purposes of an aca
demic community should look
forward to their elimination.

• The Need For Blood
Editor, The Daily:
The Palo Alto Area Chapter of
the American Red Cross is con
cerned over a misunderstanding
of the current need for blood by
the Department of Defense for
use in South Vietnam.
There is such an urgent need
for gamma globulin and serum
albumin that the Department of
Defense has asked the Ameri
can Red Cross, acting as Its
agent, to collect one quarter of
a million units of blood.
Unfortunately in the contro
versy raised over Vietnam, the
recruiting of donors has been
adversely affected by the raising
of doubts that there really is a
need for blood. We have been
assured by the Department of
Defense that the need is gen
uine.
It Is true that at this time
whole fresh blood is not being
shipped to South Vietnam be
cause this need is being met by
the military in the Far East.
However, blood fractions to

fight hepatitis and to combat
shock can best be supplied from
this country.
The American Red Cross has
every reason to be proud of its
national Blood Program and the
support it receives from the
public, and we feel certain that
we may expect continuing pub
lic support in meeting this addi
tional request from our govern
ment.

• Misdirected
Editor, The Daily:
People, it seems, always like
to complain. It's a known fact.
But it is also true that a very
large number of them voice their
complaints to the wrong people.
Vietnam peaceniks complain
most loudly to their friends (who
are most likely on their side
already); Stanford students com
plain about The Daily to their
roommates (who have probably
never even been near the Storke
Student Publications Building);
and Stern men complain to The
Daily about their food service
(when The Dally knows just
about as much about a food serv
ice as it does about journalism).
To a certain extent these be
moanings of the Stern men are
justified. There have been some
dishes, sometimes whole meals,
which no one has liked very
much. But how do these people
expect the food service to know
what they like and dislike if they
only go complaining their case
to those who have nothing to do
with it? The one time that Stern
men followed the right channels
and sent a letter (rather a peti
tion) to Miss Blue, they did get
the squash they were unhappy
about removed from the menu.
Those who complain about the
cost (which is going up $20 per
quarter next year), might be
challenged to find a place off
campus or a restaurant with
comparable prices. Take, for ex
ample, a usual lunch: two ham
burgers, potato chips, salad,
soup, dessert, and milk. Seconds,
unlimited, are allowed on milk,
chips, and soup. There are also
available assorted breads and
jelly, and punch. All this costs
a Stern resident only 82 cents!
The high charge, $1.25, for guests
is meant to discourage a large
volume of outside eaters (why
share a good thing?).
Clearly the men of Stern do
not fully understand the situa
tion. Miss Blue, Mrs. Howard,
Mrs. Trevellian are always will
ing to speak with those who feel
they have a legitimate claim. It
is in this manner that they may
get changes effected.

• This Is Better?
Editor, The Daily:
I was happy to read in The
Daily (April 25) that the new
liquor rule had been passed and
that a more realistic outlook
would be taken, until I read the
small print at the bottom con
cerning the fact that all drink
ing was to be restricted to resi
dences.
As most of the students here
who are over twenty-one don't
live in university residences, this
new rule hardly affects anyone
who actually is of legal age to
drink.
It seems a bit ridiculous that
inside our undergraduate resi
dences liquor will be freely
available, whereas a graduate
student can't even enjoy a cool
beer down at the lake. I'm just
curious what this new rule that
has made headlines everywhere
did accomplish.

• Wunderfehler
Editor, The Daily:
As members in good standing
of Germany XV, we were
shocked to note in The Daily
(April 21) a repeat of the ob
noxious misspelling of the name
of the most sacred institution on
the Burg. Ratskeller is a Ger
man word for which there is no
suitable English translation or
Anglicized spelling (Mr. Web
ster to the contrary). Therefore,
we kindly request that in the
future Ratskeller be spelled cor
rectly, without an "h".
Furthermore, should Tresidder
Union decide to pursue its idea
of establishing a "Rathskeller,"
we feel certain that this estab
lishment would be boycotted by
the majority of Burg alumni on
campus.

As unsuccessful aspirants for
the ASSU presidency and vice
presidency, we cast our support
to Mr. Bob Klein, who, we feel,
would make student government
both a farce and a fisasco.
