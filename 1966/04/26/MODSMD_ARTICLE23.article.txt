# Harris & The New Revolution
## 
### JON ROISE Editor 
Much has been said lately to
the effect that the revolution of
the American student is over.
As Edward D. Eddy, President
of Chatham College, said in a
recent address:
"The day of the negative beat
nik has begun to pass. It was he
who tried to break down the
college walls.
"His place is being taken by
the student who, tired of demon
strations, wants now to bridge
the gap, to find substance, to
overcome weakness, and to re
join the college community,
though it may be quite changed
from the community he left."
Until last Thursday, the same
might have been asserted with
out much reservation about
Stanford. It had been more than
a year since the Crow-Halverson
Report rocked the standstone
foundations of the University.
Restrictions on religious wor
ship and an anachronistic liquor
policy were quickly being dis
solved.
New Spirit
A new spirit had arisen—ex
emplified by the Committee of
Fifteen, demonstrated by a
growing willingness of the ad
ministration to consider the
needs and attitudes of students
in decision-making — a willing
ness that was evident most re
cently when the Deans' Office
promptly responded to a stu
dent study asking modifications
in the use and content of reports
on student conduct.
That was last Thursday . . .
And then, on a quiet Stanford
afternoon, a tall mustached stu
dent, bred in the ideals of Paul
Goodman, stunned a significant
faction of the community by
leading a field of eight candi
dates in the primary elections
for the ASSU presidency.
Most stunned, perhaps, was
Dave Harris himself. His candi
dacy had been a symbolic ges
ture, a protest.
But it caught on.
For some, Harris was "differ
ent."
"All the other candidates
souned exactly alike, he was
the only one with something new
to say," said one fraternity man
who voted for Harris in spite of
the candidate's condemnations of
the fraternity system. "All the
other candidates would spend
their time rebuting his points,
while he would just talk his
ideas."
His candid and outspoken
style was, for many, a welcome
relief to the usual drivel of stu
dent politics.

Others supported Harris in
the hope that next September
might bring an "interesting
year."
And in Wilbur, numerous
freshmen were enthused over
this sponsor of theirs who just
two months ago had been the
center of Faculty Master Eric
Hutchinson's attack on the spon
sor system.
Not All
But this does not explain it all,
for crusaders and "different"
candidates have run before, with
little success.
But this candidate, with his
long hair and articulate critic
isms, touched a raw nerve. He
hit upon the one area in which
all students of the University,
activists and athletes alike, are
affected: education.
He was benefactor to the trials
of the row girl in English forced
to take an irrelevant course in
historical geology; he won the
sympathies of the senior in polit
ical science who had to stick
around another quarter to take a
two-unit senior colloquim he had
not been able to fit into his
schedule the quarter before.
In short, he was the victim
of emotionalism —an emotional
ism that was fed up with Stan
ford's orthodox "craftsmanship"
attitude towards education.
The Question
And so we come back to the
original question: Is the stu
dent revolution over at Stan
ford?
The answer, if last Thursday's
vote is any indication, is another
question: Which revolution do
you mean?
For it seems that one revolu
tion, the revolution against out
moded standards of student con
duct and morality, the revolution
against a plethora of insulting
rules and regulations, is drawing
to a close.
In this conflict, it was the ad
ministration that had to fend
off, and finally relent to the
cries of hypocrisy that rose up
from the student body. And it is
this same administration, given

four years to absorb the philoso
phical impact of Armin Rosen
cranz in the ASSU presidency,
that has finally begun to treat
students as people.
Seeond Revolution
But the second revolution has
eome, and this one is directed
against the faculty — a faculty
that, with a few notable excep
tions, seems to regard education
as a highly structured memor
ization of facts, style, and
procedure.
And, except for its greater im
port, it seems likely that the edu
cational revolt will not differ
fundamentally from the battle
against outmoded rules and reg
ulations out of which it grew.
Bipolar power politics may
well once again have to come
into play, as it did beginning in
Rosencranz' era, in order to
make the faculty realize that
students are genuinely disturbed
about the educations they are
receiving, and that these same
students have a right to seek
to modify a structure which
seems to negate the very educa
tional goals toward which it
strides.
To quote President Eddy
again, before the second revolu
tion is over "the faculty mem
bers under attack will find some
cynical but sympathetic listen
ers from the ranks of adminis
tration."
After The Impact
And only after the impact—
the disruption, if you wish— has
passed, will the University be
able to pull itself back together
into something better than it
was before.
Which brings up the odd sim
ilarity between Rosencranz and
our present Mr. Harris. Both
gentlemen came along at times
when Stanford students were
deeply disturbed over conditions
in the University. Then it was
regulations, now it is education.
Both men came along at a
time when the student body
seemed to be in need of idealistic
leadership such as theirs to con
front those conditions.
And both men realized that
the bodies who would have to
recognize and react to that dis
content—then the administra
tion, now the faculty — were
extremely recalcitrant. And both
realized that a Madison Avenue
approach to this discontent by
students could at best only main
tain the status quo.
Not By Wishing
All of this is to say that for
these two men, it was and is
a truism that a revolution, es
pecially an essential revolution,
could not and cannot be begun
by wishful thinking alone.
They both had a solemn com
mittment to their ideals, foisted

on them by their consciences,
and not by what was politically
opportune. An it was this com
mittment that lead Rosencranz
to break the ice with the admin
istration and make way for re
form in regulations.
Harris seems to be willing to
pick up where the first revolu
tion ended. But then for every
Norman Mailer, there's a Calvin
Coolidge. Let's hope that the stu
dent body can discern the dif
ference.

students as people.
Seeond Revolution
But the second revolution has
eome, and this one is directed
against the faculty — a faculty
that, with a few notable excep
tions, seems to regard education
as a highly structured memor
ization of facts, style, and
procedure.
And, except for its greater im
port, it seems likely that the edu
cational revolt will not differ
fundamentally from the battle
against outmoded rules and reg
ulations out of which it grew.
Bipolar power politics may
well once again have to come
into play, as it did beginning in
Rosencranz' era, in order to
make the faculty realize that
students are genuinely disturbed
about the educations they are
receiving, and that these same
students have a right to seek
to modify a structure which
seems to negate the very educa
tional goals toward which it
strides.
To quote President Eddy
again, before the second revolu
tion is over "the faculty mem
bers under attack will find some
cynical but sympathetic listen
ers from the ranks of adminis
tration."
After The Impact
And only after the impact—
the disruption, if you wish— has
passed, will the University be
able to pull itself back together
into something better than it
was before.
Which brings up the odd sim
ilarity between Rosencranz and
our present Mr. Harris. Both
gentlemen came along at times
when Stanford students were
deeply disturbed over conditions
in the University. Then it was
regulations, now it is education.
Both men came along at a
time when the student body
seemed to be in need of idealistic
leadership such as theirs to con
front those conditions.
And both men realized that
the bodies who would have to
recognize and react to that dis
content—then the administra
tion, now the faculty — were
extremely recalcitrant. And both
realized that a Madison Avenue
approach to this discontent by
students could at best only main
tain the status quo.
Not By Wishing
All of this is to say that for
these two men, it was and is
a truism that a revolution, es
pecially an essential revolution,
could not and cannot be begun
by wishful thinking alone.
They both had a solemn com
mittment to their ideals, foisted

on them by their consciences,
and not by what was politically
opportune. An it was this com
mittment that lead Rosencranz
to break the ice with the admin
istration and make way for re
form in regulations.
Harris seems to be willing to
pick up where the first revolu
tion ended. But then for every
Norman Mailer, there's a Calvin
Coolidge. Let's hope that the stu
dent body can discern the dif
ference.
Much has been said lately to
the effect that the revolution of
the American student is over.
As Edward D. Eddy, President
of Chatham College, said in a
recent address:
"The day of the negative beat
nik has begun to pass. It was he
who tried to break down the
college walls.
"His place is being taken by
the student who, tired of demon
strations, wants now to bridge
the gap, to find substance, to
overcome weakness, and to re
join the college community,
though it may be quite changed
from the community he left."
Until last Thursday, the same
might have been asserted with
out much reservation about
Stanford. It had been more than
a year since the Crow-Halverson
Report rocked the standstone
foundations of the University.
Restrictions on religious wor
ship and an anachronistic liquor
policy were quickly being dis
solved.
New Spirit
A new spirit had arisen—ex
emplified by the Committee of
Fifteen, demonstrated by a
growing willingness of the ad
ministration to consider the
needs and attitudes of students
in decision-making — a willing
ness that was evident most re
cently when the Deans' Office
promptly responded to a stu
dent study asking modifications
in the use and content of reports
on student conduct.
That was last Thursday . . .
And then, on a quiet Stanford
afternoon, a tall mustached stu
dent, bred in the ideals of Paul
Goodman, stunned a significant
faction of the community by
leading a field of eight candi
dates in the primary elections
for the ASSU presidency.
Most stunned, perhaps, was
Dave Harris himself. His candi
dacy had been a symbolic ges
ture, a protest.
But it caught on.
For some, Harris was "differ
ent."
"All the other candidates
souned exactly alike, he was
the only one with something new
to say," said one fraternity man
who voted for Harris in spite of
the candidate's condemnations of
the fraternity system. "All the
other candidates would spend
their time rebuting his points,
while he would just talk his
ideas."
His candid and outspoken
style was, for many, a welcome
relief to the usual drivel of stu
dent politics.

Others supported Harris in
the hope that next September
might bring an "interesting
year."
And in Wilbur, numerous
freshmen were enthused over
this sponsor of theirs who just
two months ago had been the
center of Faculty Master Eric
Hutchinson's attack on the spon
sor system.
Not All
But this does not explain it all,
for crusaders and "different"
candidates have run before, with
little success.
But this candidate, with his
long hair and articulate critic
isms, touched a raw nerve. He
hit upon the one area in which
all students of the University,
activists and athletes alike, are
affected: education.
He was benefactor to the trials
of the row girl in English forced
to take an irrelevant course in
historical geology; he won the
sympathies of the senior in polit
ical science who had to stick
around another quarter to take a
two-unit senior colloquim he had
not been able to fit into his
schedule the quarter before.
In short, he was the victim
of emotionalism —an emotional
ism that was fed up with Stan
ford's orthodox "craftsmanship"
attitude towards education.
The Question
And so we come back to the
original question: Is the stu
dent revolution over at Stan
ford?
The answer, if last Thursday's
vote is any indication, is another
question: Which revolution do
you mean?
For it seems that one revolu
tion, the revolution against out
moded standards of student con
duct and morality, the revolution
against a plethora of insulting
rules and regulations, is drawing
to a close.
In this conflict, it was the ad
ministration that had to fend
off, and finally relent to the
cries of hypocrisy that rose up
from the student body. And it is
this same administration, given

four years to absorb the philoso
phical impact of Armin Rosen
cranz in the ASSU presidency,
that has finally begun to treat
students as people.

leading a field of eight candi
dates in the primary elections
for the ASSU presidency.
Most stunned, perhaps, was
Dave Harris himself. His candi
dacy had been a symbolic ges
ture, a protest.
But it caught on.
For some, Harris was "differ
ent."
"All the other candidates
souned exactly alike, he was
the only one with something new
to say," said one fraternity man
who voted for Harris in spite of
the candidate's condemnations of
the fraternity system. "All the
other candidates would spend
their time rebuting his points,
while he would just talk his
ideas."
His candid and outspoken
style was, for many, a welcome
relief to the usual drivel of stu
dent politics.

Others supported Harris in
the hope that next September
might bring an "interesting
year."
And in Wilbur, numerous
freshmen were enthused over
this sponsor of theirs who just
two months ago had been the
center of Faculty Master Eric
Hutchinson's attack on the spon
sor system.
Not All
But this does not explain it all,
for crusaders and "different"
candidates have run before, with
little success.
But this candidate, with his
long hair and articulate critic
isms, touched a raw nerve. He
hit upon the one area in which
all students of the University,
activists and athletes alike, are
affected: education.
He was benefactor to the trials
of the row girl in English forced
to take an irrelevant course in
historical geology; he won the
sympathies of the senior in polit
ical science who had to stick
around another quarter to take a
two-unit senior colloquim he had
not been able to fit into his
schedule the quarter before.
In short, he was the victim
of emotionalism —an emotional
ism that was fed up with Stan
ford's orthodox "craftsmanship"
attitude towards education.
The Question
And so we come back to the
original question: Is the stu
dent revolution over at Stan
ford?
The answer, if last Thursday's
vote is any indication, is another
question: Which revolution do
you mean?
For it seems that one revolu
tion, the revolution against out
moded standards of student con
duct and morality, the revolution
against a plethora of insulting
rules and regulations, is drawing
to a close.
In this conflict, it was the ad
ministration that had to fend
off, and finally relent to the
cries of hypocrisy that rose up
from the student body. And it is
this same administration, given

four years to absorb the philoso
phical impact of Armin Rosen
cranz in the ASSU presidency,
that has finally begun to treat
students as people.
Seeond Revolution
But the second revolution has
eome, and this one is directed
against the faculty — a faculty
that, with a few notable excep
tions, seems to regard education
as a highly structured memor
ization of facts, style, and
procedure.
And, except for its greater im
port, it seems likely that the edu
cational revolt will not differ
fundamentally from the battle
against outmoded rules and reg
ulations out of which it grew.
Bipolar power politics may
well once again have to come
into play, as it did beginning in
Rosencranz' era, in order to
make the faculty realize that
students are genuinely disturbed
about the educations they are
receiving, and that these same
students have a right to seek
to modify a structure which
seems to negate the very educa
tional goals toward which it
strides.
To quote President Eddy
again, before the second revolu
tion is over "the faculty mem
bers under attack will find some
cynical but sympathetic listen
ers from the ranks of adminis
tration."
After The Impact
And only after the impact—
the disruption, if you wish— has
passed, will the University be
able to pull itself back together
into something better than it
was before.
Which brings up the odd sim
ilarity between Rosencranz and
our present Mr. Harris. Both
gentlemen came along at times
when Stanford students were
deeply disturbed over conditions
in the University. Then it was
regulations, now it is education.
Both men came along at a
time when the student body
seemed to be in need of idealistic
leadership such as theirs to con
front those conditions.
And both men realized that
the bodies who would have to
recognize and react to that dis
content—then the administra
tion, now the faculty — were
extremely recalcitrant. And both
realized that a Madison Avenue
approach to this discontent by
students could at best only main
tain the status quo.
Not By Wishing
All of this is to say that for
these two men, it was and is
a truism that a revolution, es
pecially an essential revolution,
could not and cannot be begun
by wishful thinking alone.
They both had a solemn com
mittment to their ideals, foisted

on them by their consciences,
and not by what was politically
opportune. An it was this com
mittment that lead Rosencranz
to break the ice with the admin
istration and make way for re
form in regulations.
Harris seems to be willing to
pick up where the first revolu
tion ended. But then for every
Norman Mailer, there's a Calvin
Coolidge. Let's hope that the stu
dent body can discern the dif
ference.
Much has been said lately to
the effect that the revolution of
the American student is over.
As Edward D. Eddy, President
of Chatham College, said in a
recent address:
"The day of the negative beat
nik has begun to pass. It was he
who tried to break down the
college walls.
"His place is being taken by
the student who, tired of demon
strations, wants now to bridge
the gap, to find substance, to
overcome weakness, and to re
join the college community,
though it may be quite changed
from the community he left."
Until last Thursday, the same
might have been asserted with
out much reservation about
Stanford. It had been more than
a year since the Crow-Halverson
Report rocked the standstone
foundations of the University.
Restrictions on religious wor
ship and an anachronistic liquor
policy were quickly being dis
solved.
New Spirit
A new spirit had arisen—ex
emplified by the Committee of
Fifteen, demonstrated by a
growing willingness of the ad
ministration to consider the
needs and attitudes of students
in decision-making — a willing
ness that was evident most re
cently when the Deans' Office
promptly responded to a stu
dent study asking modifications
in the use and content of reports
on student conduct.
That was last Thursday . . .
And then, on a quiet Stanford
afternoon, a tall mustached stu
dent, bred in the ideals of Paul
Goodman, stunned a significant
faction of the community by
leading a field of eight candi
dates in the primary elections
for the ASSU presidency.
Most stunned, perhaps, was
Dave Harris himself. His candi

Both men came along at a
time when the student body
seemed to be in need of idealistic
leadership such as theirs to con
front those conditions.
And both men realized that
the bodies who would have to
recognize and react to that dis
content—then the administra
tion, now the faculty — were
extremely recalcitrant. And both
realized that a Madison Avenue
approach to this discontent by
students could at best only main
tain the status quo.
Not By Wishing
All of this is to say that for
these two men, it was and is
a truism that a revolution, es
pecially an essential revolution,
could not and cannot be begun
by wishful thinking alone.
They both had a solemn com
mittment to their ideals, foisted

on them by their consciences,
and not by what was politically
opportune. An it was this com
mittment that lead Rosencranz
to break the ice with the admin
istration and make way for re
form in regulations.
Harris seems to be willing to
pick up where the first revolu
tion ended. But then for every
Norman Mailer, there's a Calvin
Coolidge. Let's hope that the stu
dent body can discern the dif
ference.
Much has been said lately to
the effect that the revolution of
the American student is over.
As Edward D. Eddy, President
of Chatham College, said in a
recent address:
"The day of the negative beat
nik has begun to pass. It was he
who tried to break down the
college walls.
"His place is being taken by
the student who, tired of demon
strations, wants now to bridge
the gap, to find substance, to
overcome weakness, and to re
join the college community,
though it may be quite changed
from the community he left."
Until last Thursday, the same
might have been asserted with
out much reservation about
Stanford. It had been more than
a year since the Crow-Halverson
Report rocked the standstone
foundations of the University.
Restrictions on religious wor
ship and an anachronistic liquor
policy were quickly being dis
solved.
New Spirit
A new spirit had arisen—ex
emplified by the Committee of
Fifteen, demonstrated by a
growing willingness of the ad
ministration to consider the
needs and attitudes of students
in decision-making — a willing
ness that was evident most re
cently when the Deans' Office
promptly responded to a stu
dent study asking modifications
in the use and content of reports
on student conduct.
That was last Thursday . . .
And then, on a quiet Stanford
afternoon, a tall mustached stu
dent, bred in the ideals of Paul
Goodman, stunned a significant
faction of the community by
leading a field of eight candi
dates in the primary elections
for the ASSU presidency.
Most stunned, perhaps, was
Dave Harris himself. His candi
dacy had been a symbolic ges
ture, a protest.
But it caught on.
For some, Harris was "differ
ent."
"All the other candidates
souned exactly alike, he was
the only one with something new
to say," said one fraternity man
who voted for Harris in spite of
the candidate's condemnations of
the fraternity system. "All the
other candidates would spend
their time rebuting his points,
while he would just talk his
ideas."
His candid and outspoken
style was, for many, a welcome
relief to the usual drivel of stu
dent politics.

Others supported Harris in
the hope that next September
might bring an "interesting
year."
And in Wilbur, numerous
freshmen were enthused over
this sponsor of theirs who just
two months ago had been the
center of Faculty Master Eric
Hutchinson's attack on the spon
sor system.
Not All
But this does not explain it all,
for crusaders and "different"
candidates have run before, with
little success.
But this candidate, with his
long hair and articulate critic
isms, touched a raw nerve. He
hit upon the one area in which
all students of the University,
activists and athletes alike, are
affected: education.
He was benefactor to the trials
of the row girl in English forced
to take an irrelevant course in
historical geology; he won the
sympathies of the senior in polit
ical science who had to stick
around another quarter to take a
two-unit senior colloquim he had
not been able to fit into his
schedule the quarter before.
In short, he was the victim
of emotionalism —an emotional
ism that was fed up with Stan
ford's orthodox "craftsmanship"
attitude towards education.
The Question
And so we come back to the
original question: Is the stu
dent revolution over at Stan
ford?
The answer, if last Thursday's
vote is any indication, is another
question: Which revolution do
you mean?
For it seems that one revolu
tion, the revolution against out
moded standards of student con
duct and morality, the revolution
against a plethora of insulting
rules and regulations, is drawing
to a close.
In this conflict, it was the ad
ministration that had to fend
off, and finally relent to the
cries of hypocrisy that rose up
from the student body. And it is
this same administration, given

four years to absorb the philoso
phical impact of Armin Rosen
cranz in the ASSU presidency,
that has finally begun to treat
students as people.
Seeond Revolution
But the second revolution has
eome, and this one is directed
against the faculty — a faculty
that, with a few notable excep
tions, seems to regard education
as a highly structured memor
ization of facts, style, and
procedure.
And, except for its greater im
port, it seems likely that the edu
cational revolt will not differ
fundamentally from the battle
against outmoded rules and reg
ulations out of which it grew.
Bipolar power politics may
well once again have to come
into play, as it did beginning in
Rosencranz' era, in order to
make the faculty realize that
students are genuinely disturbed
about the educations they are
receiving, and that these same
students have a right to seek
to modify a structure which
seems to negate the very educa
tional goals toward which it
strides.
To quote President Eddy
again, before the second revolu
tion is over "the faculty mem
bers under attack will find some
cynical but sympathetic listen
ers from the ranks of adminis
tration."
After The Impact
And only after the impact—
the disruption, if you wish— has
passed, will the University be
able to pull itself back together
into something better than it
was before.
Which brings up the odd sim
ilarity between Rosencranz and
our present Mr. Harris. Both
gentlemen came along at times
when Stanford students were
deeply disturbed over conditions
in the University. Then it was
regulations, now it is education.
Both men came along at a
time when the student body
seemed to be in need of idealistic
leadership such as theirs to con
front those conditions.
And both men realized that
the bodies who would have to
recognize and react to that dis
content—then the administra
tion, now the faculty — were
