# Phi Kap Fire Blamed On Defective Wiring
## 
### KIRK HANEN Staff Editor 
Fire caused by faulty wiring gutted
the attic and entire third story of
the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity house
shortly after 11 a.m. yesterday, doing
an estimated $40,000 damage to the
structure.
There were no injuries reported. Ap
proximately half of the house's 44
members were in class at the time.
Four engines from the Stanford
Fire Department, led by Chief John
M. Marston, responded to a call for
help at approximately 11:22 a.m.
"The roof and attic were gone," said
Marston, recalling the situation as he
arrived at the scene after the alarm.
"All we could do was try to confine
the fire to its point of origin."
David Layne, resident assistant, dis
covered the fire and alerted the others
in the 50-year-old building, located at
Alvarado Row and Santa Ynez.
Not Rain
"It sounded like it was raining," he
said, describing the noise which awoke
him. "I looked up the stairway and
what seemed to be the whole roof
was in flames."
"When I first smelled smoke," said
Phi Kap Bob Waterman, "I thought
maybe Ben (the Phi Kap's cook) was
making hamburgers."
Fire extinguishers were broken out

but were reportedly inoperable be
cause of lack of water pressure.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books, and other be
longings out the windows. Layne him
self, was forced to leave two years of
law books behind as he fled.
Damage to personal property was
heavy, but as yet remains uncounted.
One resident reported losing at least
51.300 worth of valuables, largely
musical instruments, in the flames.
The blaze never got to the first and
second floors, but water and debris
did extensive damage to them. Only
the kitchen remained unharmed.
'Could Have Been Worse'
Marston was "thankful there wasn't
much wind. If there had been, the fire
could easily have spread to other
buildings."
With the help of Assistant Chiefs
Frank Jurian and Harry Lund and a
22-man force, Marston had the fire
under control in some ten minutes.
"It was probably the worst blaze
I've had to contend with since the Fiji
house fire in August, 1960. And that's
in 25 years experience here at Stan
ford."
Marston said he might have called
out part of the ten-man crew at the
SLAC sub-station, but that facility was

responding to a call at approximately
the same time.
Inspection Next
Since all fraternities are classed as
hotels and governed by the same build
ing codes, the Santa Clara County
Building Department will survey the
fire damage to determine alternatives
for restoration.
If it judges the structure to be over
50 per cent damaged, the entire house
will have to be torn down and rebuilt
in accord with State Fire Code re
quirements. If the extent of damage
ranges between 25 and 50 per cent,
Phi Kappa Sigma will have option of
remodeling only the burned out areas,
as long as building codes are followed.
Optimistic
C. William Russ, chairman of Phi
Kappa Sigma Building Corporation,
Inc., who is handling insurance mat
ters, estimated that it would be two
to three weeks before the companies
insuring the Phi Kaps would be able
to straighten the "tons of red tape"
involved.
He was doubtful, however, that the
brothers' personal belongings would
be covered by the house's policy. Most,
he said, would have to rely on policies
held by their parents.
Neighboring fraternities were plan
ning to take in the homeless until
proper housing can be found by the
Dean's Office.

"It was probably the worst blaze
I've had to contend with since the Fiji
house fire in August, 1960. And that's
in 25 years experience here at Stan
ford."
Marston said he might have called
out part of the ten-man crew at the
SLAC sub-station, but that facility was

responding to a call at approximately
the same time.
Inspection Next
Since all fraternities are classed as
hotels and governed by the same build
ing codes, the Santa Clara County
Building Department will survey the
fire damage to determine alternatives
for restoration.
If it judges the structure to be over
50 per cent damaged, the entire house
will have to be torn down and rebuilt
in accord with State Fire Code re
quirements. If the extent of damage
ranges between 25 and 50 per cent,
Phi Kappa Sigma will have option of
remodeling only the burned out areas,
as long as building codes are followed.
Optimistic
C. William Russ, chairman of Phi
Kappa Sigma Building Corporation,
Inc., who is handling insurance mat
ters, estimated that it would be two
to three weeks before the companies
insuring the Phi Kaps would be able
to straighten the "tons of red tape"
involved.
He was doubtful, however, that the
brothers' personal belongings would
be covered by the house's policy. Most,
he said, would have to rely on policies
held by their parents.
Neighboring fraternities were plan
ning to take in the homeless until
proper housing can be found by the
Dean's Office.
Fire caused by faulty wiring gutted
the attic and entire third story of
the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity house
shortly after 11 a.m. yesterday, doing
an estimated $40,000 damage to the
structure.
There were no injuries reported. Ap
proximately half of the house's 44
members were in class at the time.
Four engines from the Stanford
Fire Department, led by Chief John
M. Marston, responded to a call for
help at approximately 11:22 a.m.
"The roof and attic were gone," said
Marston, recalling the situation as he
arrived at the scene after the alarm.
"All we could do was try to confine
the fire to its point of origin."
David Layne, resident assistant, dis
covered the fire and alerted the others
in the 50-year-old building, located at
Alvarado Row and Santa Ynez.
Not Rain
"It sounded like it was raining," he
said, describing the noise which awoke
him. "I looked up the stairway and
what seemed to be the whole roof
was in flames."
"When I first smelled smoke," said
Phi Kap Bob Waterman, "I thought
maybe Ben (the Phi Kap's cook) was
making hamburgers."
Fire extinguishers were broken out

but were reportedly inoperable be
cause of lack of water pressure.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books, and other be
longings out the windows. Layne him
self, was forced to leave two years of
law books behind as he fled.
Damage to personal property was
heavy, but as yet remains uncounted.
One resident reported losing at least
51.300 worth of valuables, largely
musical instruments, in the flames.
The blaze never got to the first and
second floors, but water and debris
did extensive damage to them. Only
the kitchen remained unharmed.
'Could Have Been Worse'
Marston was "thankful there wasn't
much wind. If there had been, the fire
could easily have spread to other
buildings."
With the help of Assistant Chiefs
Frank Jurian and Harry Lund and a
22-man force, Marston had the fire
under control in some ten minutes.
