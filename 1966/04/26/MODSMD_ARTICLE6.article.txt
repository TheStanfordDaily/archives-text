# LASSU Ratifies Results Of Last Week's Primary
## 
### 
In a special session last night the
Legislature ratified the results of the
ASSU primary elections held last
Week.
It thereby prepared the way for fi
nal elections to be held Wednesday
and Thursday.
Roger Bounds, chairman of the
Elections Commission, reported to the
Legislature the results of a recount
of all presidential ballots. It showed
Dave Harris with 849 votes, Bob Klein
with 783 votes and Carl Schmidt with
748 votes.
The recount narrowed the margin
between Klein and Schmidt by six
votes over the original count, but it

still left Klein and Harris in the fi
nals.
Bounds also reported that there
were 49 more ballots counted than
signatures on the register. Each stu
dent is required to sign his name on
the register in order to receive a bal
lot.
The discrepancy, Bounds said, was
a result of the negligence of poll ten
ders and an "error that comes up in
every election." The results from the
election are legitimate, he said.
Law-School Representative Carl
Anderson disagreed. "Why should we
take the chance when the vote is this
close," he said.

The Legislature, however, approved
by a large majority the results from
the presidential and other elections.
By a special motion it certified the
election of four write-in candidates as
off-campus Legislature representa
tives, although none of them received
more than seven votes. They are Ran
dolph Bonner (7 votes), Mike Collins
(3 votes), Mark Edelston (3 votes),
and Bill French (3 votes.)
The following off-campus repre
sentatives were also approved by the
Legislature: William Pazdral, Harry
Parker, Michael P. Plouf, John B.
Scott, Peter M. Martin, Joseph K.
Toth, Greg Barney, Morgan White,
and Craig D. Venator.
