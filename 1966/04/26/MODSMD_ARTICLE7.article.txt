# Play Views Student Discontent
## 
### 
"The Miracle Wolf of Gubbio"
makes its premier performance in
Ram's Head Spring One Acts May
11 through 14 in The Nitery.
Set in an Italian university in the
Thirteenth Century, the drama writ
ten by Jim Bierman explores student
discontent, classic and contemporary.
Using the technique of a play
within-a-play, the plot revolves about
a student drama festival presented on
All Fools Night to honor Harliquino,
King of Fools.
Discontent because their university
fails to offer them opportunities to
develop individuality, the students at
first are eager to lose themselves in
the Passion Play as if assuming a pro
jected role would add to a definition
of their identities.
The festival offers a forced solution
to the students' despair, however, and
instead of creating happiness, it re

inforces discontent.
Director John Wright, a candidate
from the Department of Speech and
for the Master of Fine Arts Degree
Drama, feels that the play typifies
the situation facing contemporary uni
versities. Within the drama, the stu

dent who searches most intensely to
find the answer to his "identity crisis"
is typed a "loner" and then ignored by
the others.
Wright notes that this exemplifies
the need for inter personal communi
cation. The individual must discard
masks and "type-casting" before he
can honestly shape his own role in
life. Without communication, distrust
and hostility result.
Liturgical music with contemporary
lyric which is performed a capella
by the cast, serves to emphasize the
split between the Churches' concep
tion of how life ought to be and the
secular realization of the world as it
is.
Tickets to Spring One-Acts, which
will also later feature Tonnesee Wil
liams "10 Blocks on the Camino Real"
and "Valparaiss," are available for
$1.60 from the TMU Box Office.

Mayor Sam Yorty of I,os Angeles will
speak today at 4:15 in Dinkelsplel
Auditorium. Mayor Yorty, candidate
for the Democratic nomination for
Governor, will discuss ">lor«> Realistic
Relationship Between State and Local
Governments."
