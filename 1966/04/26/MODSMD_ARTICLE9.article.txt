# 'Let Africa Find Self' â€”Ngwiri
## 
### 
Africa's cultural problem is "to re
discover its identity," in the words of
Malawi's U.N. Representative John
Ngwiri, who delivered the keynote
speech for Stanford's "Africa Week"
last night in Cuhherley Auditorium.
In his speech, entitled "Africa in
Cultural Context," Ngwiri said that
"harmonization" should be "the
guide post of cultural development for
twentieth century Africa." He defined
"harmonization" as the effect of West
ern culutre's contact with Africa's
but noted that "contact" did not in
clude colonialism, which attempted
to force Western culture upon Afri
cans in place of their own.
"We cannot decolonize the outlook
of people who have been colonized for
years," he said, "unless we give them
something to replace it. And this is
our own indigenous cultural frame
work."
"I'm not implying that cross-cul
tural influences are not important or
not used," Ngwiri said, "but we must
have our own well-defined cultural
base." Africa needs "no wholesale imi
tation of foreigners," he added, "and
it's equally dangerous to look inward,
rejecting foreign influence. I believe
either extreme is dangerous."
Ngwiri expressed his hope that
Stanford's "Africa Week" discussions
might help his continent to "rediscover
itself."
"Africa Week" continues today with
a symposium on African Art and Cul
ture at 4:15 p.m., Room 214; and with
a lecture, "African Sculpture: Form
and Context," by Prof. Roy Siever
of the University of Indiana, at 7:45
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
