Everybody's talking about it. Everybody's doing it. Operation Match. It's camp.
It's campus. It's the modern way to meet. It whammo's blind dates.
It started at Harvard. The original Operation Match—featured in TIME, LOOK,
and the coming May GLAMOUR. Already there are over 100,000 ideal dates in
our computer's memory bank. Now's the time to line up your Spring Fling.
Let our IBM 7090 Computer (the world's most perfect boy/girl matcher) select
5 ideal dates for you—right from your campus area. (Now a gal can really choose
the kind of guy she wants, not just wait and hope he comes along I)
Just send us the coupon below ... we'll send you the Operation Match Quan
titative Personality Projection Test Questionnaire.
Answer the questions about yourself, what you're like, and what you like. Return
the questionnaire with $3.00. Then we put our 7090's memory bank to work. It
reads out the qualifications of every member of the opposite sex in your college
area, and programs 5 or more ideal dates for you. You receive names, addresses,
and phone numbers. Guys call the gals. You're just a telephone apart.
Also, your card is kept continuously active. You receive as many dates as the
7090 finds matches. The sooner you apply, the more dates you may get.
Let the 7090 take the blinds off blind dating. Get modern. Get electronic. Get
set quick with your ideal dates.
