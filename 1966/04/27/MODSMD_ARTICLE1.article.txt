# Hydrofollies, Contests Help Con Home Campaign
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
The forty-third annual Con Home Week will
begin with a splash Sunday as the Lake Lag
Hydrofollies, complete with human flying
kites and barefoot water skiers, start off the
"I Believe in Kids" week.
Aiming for a $12,00 contribution for the
Stanford Children's Convalescent Hospital,
events scheduled include a Bike Race and the
annual King and Queen contest followed by
the Searsville Shifazz.
Highlight of this year's drive will be the
Glenn Yarbrough-Vince Guarzaldi concert in
Frost Amphitheater Sunday, May 8, at 2 p.m.
Tickets for the double bill are now on sale
around Quad or at Tresidder Box Office, and
block reservations are still available.
The Convalescent Hospital, better known as
Con Home, was established in 1919 as a spe
cialized hospital and rehabilitation center for
children with chronic diseases and physical
disabilities. It is an independent, non-profit in
stittuion that offers its 65-bed services to all

children, regardless of race, creed, or economic
status. Because of the expense of the special
ized care, the hospital depends upon gifts and
donations.
King and Queen
General chairmen for this year's activities
are Betsy Haas, Judy Fletcher and Bill Tif
fany. In charge of publicity are Peter Haas,
Marty Norberg, Katrina Weber, Marshall
Hockett and Scott McGilvray.
Andre Botero, South American Water Ski
ing champion, will set the pace for stunts on
(and in) the sparkling clear water of Lake
Lag Sunday, May 1. Beginning at 2 p.m., the
Hydrofollies will also feature local talent in
the form of inter-house canoe races and the
inevitable sinking of the Phi Kap "life boat."
Frosh dollies will sell refreshments.
Projects beginning Monday and running
through the week include Off-campus Solici
tations, the traditional Freshman activity, On
campus Sales, sponsored by the women's liv
ing groups, and the King and Queen contest.

The door-to-door solicitations will constitute
one of the most ambitious projects of Con
Home Week. Last year freshmen collected ap
proximately $7,000. Frosh couples will go to
assigned areas in Palo Alto, Atherton, Red
wood City, Menlo Park, Woodside, Mountain
View, Portola Valley and Los Altos. The most
successful couples, named after the tabula
tions at the week's end, will receive free din
ners or tickets to shows at several places in
San Francisco or on the peninsula.
Living gr,up representatives are Pat Mul
len, Branner; Judy Hooker, Roble; Reid Mac-
Donald, Wilbur, and Dave Hernandez, Stern.
Carnival Planned
The women's living groups will turn White
Memorial Plaza into a week-long carnival with
booths offering a range from car washes to
psychiatric aid via Dr. Charlie Brown. The
house bringing in the most money will have
several professors serve as hashers for dinner
in the living residence.
To date, 12 houses have entered booths. Ad

ditional entries may be directed to Kay Nich
ols, On-campus chairman.
A little imagination plus 25 cents will bring
a nomination for Con Home King and Queen.
(In the past, nominations have included dogs,
strippers, R.A.'s and professors.)
The voting and tallying will be conducted by
Frosh dollies, will take place all day Monday-
Friday in Engineering Corner. Each "plus"
vote costs one cent and each "negative" vote
costs three cents. Winkie Belz and Ellie Jones
are in charge.

children as dinner guests on Tuesday May 3.
Further information about this program can

cialized hospital and rehabilitation center for
children with chronic diseases and physical
disabilities. It is an independent, non-profit in
stittuion that offers its 65-bed services to all

children, regardless of race, creed, or economic
status. Because of the expense of the special
ized care, the hospital depends upon gifts and
donations.

fany. In charge of publicity are Peter Haas,
Marty Norberg, Katrina Weber, Marshall
