A recital by Stanford Music Depart
ment student s,directed by Pro Musica
members, will be presented at 8:30
p.m., Friday, April 29.
During a ten-day visit at Stanford,
Pro Musica Director LaNoue Daven
port and members of the ensemble are
conducting teaching and coaching ses
sions in performance practice for mu
sic students.
Pro Musica's repertoire is the result
of extensive search through old Euro
pean monasteries, churches, and li
braries for forgotten or hidden musi
cal works of the 13th to 18th centur
ies. The music they found, much of
which had to be restored, annotated
and reconstructed for performance,
includes not only church music but
also much popular music.
To achieve the true sound of these
ancient scores, the Pro Musica re
cords and performs on the musical
instruments of the period during
which the works were composed.
Many of the instruments are origi
nals, others are hand-crafted repro
ductions.
Tickets are available at $3.00, gen
eral; and $2.50, student; at Tresidder
Box Office.
