# Golf Team Falls 17-10
## 
### 
A fine effort by Stanford's
varsity golfers fell short yester
day as they lost a 17-10 decision
to powerful San Jose State at
the Almaden Golf Course in San
Jose.
John Bottomley was low for
the Cards with a 72 but lost his
match by two shots to Ross Ran
dall of San Jose, two years Far
West champion.
Highlight of the day was a
brilliant comeback by Stanford's
Loy Martin. Trailing 1964 NCAA
champion Terry Small by three
with four holes to play, Martin
won four consecutive holes,
chipping in from the fringe on
the 18th to take the match one
up.
