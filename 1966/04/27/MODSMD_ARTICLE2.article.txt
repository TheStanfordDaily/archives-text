# Prof Talks On African Art Forms
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
Dr. Roy Sieber, professor of fine
arts at the University of Indiana, ex
plained the relationship among his
tory, form and content in African
sculpture in last night's Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture.
Tonight Professor Sieber will speak
on "The Royal Arts of Ghana" at 8
o'clock in the Physics Lecture Hall.
With slides to illustrate his lec
ture, Dr. Sieber developed the tecn
niques he uses in trying to piece var
ious traditions together in a logical
sequence.
Art Overlaps
"Using art only for arts sake or only
as a religious expression is to short
change the form," Sieber contended.
"Areas of society overlap in these cen
tral African art objects."
To illustrate his point, Dr. Sieber
interpreted an elaborate mask rep
resenting collective ancestors. "This
mask has many significances: relig
ious, agricultural, judge of capital
crimes and civil law," Sieber ex
plained. "But the one thing the mask
is not, to the people involved, is an
art object."
Distinctive Style
Professor Sieber developed the his
tory of Africa from the earliest known
Nigerian form, dating from over 2,000
years ago. By this time a distinctive
African style had developed as evi
denced by "a consistent body propor
tion."
"Present day tribal chiefs can iden
tify the royal costume on bronze fig
ures which date from the 12th cen
tury," Sieber said. "In 1897 the Brit
ish went into central Africa and
brought out a number of these heads
to sell in Europe.
"They took no data and we lost
valuable information about the sculp
tural tradition of the area. About all
we know for sure is that the heads
were royal and commemorative,"
Sieber commented.
From his own research in Africa,
Dr. Sieber believes "tourist art" dates
from the loth century.
