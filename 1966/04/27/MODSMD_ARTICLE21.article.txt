## Campaigning Resolves To Ideas Man Vs. Job Man 
### Tim Haight 
A candidate who is trying to
get elected sounds different
from one who cares first about
ideas. If you've been to the de
bates, you've heard the differ
ence. If you haven't, you still
may have gotten the idea.
The main difference between
the idea man and the office
seeker is that the office-seeker
is thinking about next year,
while the creative candidate is
thinking about making points
and stimulating though now.
The idea candidate believes
what he says, the job-man, in
getting elected.
Better Job
The ironic aspect of the dif
ference is that the idea man will
probably do a much better job
next year.
As Nevitt Sanford writes in
the latest issue of Stanford To
day, ". . . . college policy might
be better guided by theoretically
oriented studies of student de
velopment than by the kind of
institutional research that asks
its questions within the frame
work of the existing system and
focuses upon one question at a
time. The administrator is con
stantly in need of immediate
answers; he rarely is in a posi
tion to give much thought to
what causes the questions to be
raised in the first place."
By examining what is right
first and then looking for
the means to achieve it, argu
ments become clearer. This has
been lacking in student govern
ment. Leaders have said, "Sure,
we'd like to abolish social regs,
but the administration wouldn't
go along, so we're just going to
try for a later sign-out."
'Moderate' Attitude
This was very much the atti
tude of the "moderate" forces
for change last spring. Then a
group of "radicals" in the Legis
lature started making extreme
noises. This "far-out" point of
view gave students more room
in which to maneuver, and gave
them the goals, in terms of stu
dent freedom and responsibility,
on which they could build their
case.
Now the focus has switched
to education. Dave Harris talks
about having no General Studies
requirements or grading. This
proposal forces us to think
about the issues much more
than a watered-down approach
that makes people say, "Sure."
We begin to connect self-moti
vation with freedom from re
quirements and grade pressure.
This is why Dave Harris has
proposed ideas that aren't tai
lored to next yearâ€”he wants to
make you think, to find the best

answers to the deepest ques
tions. What will come next year
will be compromises between
what we feel to be right and
what the University, through
commitment or inertia, endorses.
But we won't do the compro
mising before we decide what
we want.
Means
Now what about means? Har
ris has said that he will use
every means possible to achieve
what he sets out to get. His
critics have been quick to over
simplify this to suggest that
Dave will lead a sit-in every
week. This is absurd.
First of all, you can't have
sit-ins without student support.
Second, its pretty silly to think
that if committee discussion
will do the job, we should sit-in,
just for the joy of it.
He's not proposing to kill
flies with shotguns, or to try
to get General Studies changed
by abducting Mr. Walker. What
he is saying is that enough mo
tivation and commitment is
needed to put some force behind
our suggestions.
The students are the only
body in the university who do
not have institutionalized re
course to power. This makes a
difference, because we are not
the only people at the Univer
sity who think better if we have
some motivation to think. If
anyone believes that the spectre
of the rabid Legislature was not
in the minds of some on inner
quad, he's kidding himself.
Dentist's Drill
The analogy of a dentist's
drill may be appropriate. A den
tist's drill needs a gentle hand
and considerable skill to keep
from seriously damaging the
patient. But the force to turn
the drill is just as essential.
This is what Dave Harris sug
gests, the force and the commit
ment to give us a bargaining po
sition, and then the best choice
of means, delicate or less so, for
the situation.
As Dave says, "I'm not an
atom bomb, I'm a human being."
He's not trying to blow up the
university, just trying to make
us think about what we really
want. And to get it, he's willing
to use whatever means possible.
But that's quite a range.
The specific goals and tactics
for next year will come out of
specific studies of how we can
best achieve our long-range
goals. Timing, personalities, al
liances, or mood are things im
possible to predict now. But the
impetus is there, the commit
ment to ideas is there, and the
motivating force is there, if we
elect Dave Harris.
