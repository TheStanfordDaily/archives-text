## Klein: The Realm Of Reality 
### Mike Couzens 
A confluence of many emo
tional factors has thrust David
Harris into this final election.
To say that they are emotional
neither dismisses them nor de
nies their validity. But it is use
ful to try to understand why his
appeal has been so effective.
Time perspective has been one
of his most useful attacks. The
Harris-Collins platform is ideal
ized. It is not a platform for
next year. So it presents a pro
gram which cannot be attacked
in terms of implementation.
Everyone knows that in one
year it can't be done.
What Objectives?
The question which has not
been raised, though, is exactly
what Harris and Collins do want
for next year. If they have real
objectives for the administra
tion they would create, no one
knows what they are.
Their proposals are thus dif
ficult to attack. On the near fu
ture they are mute. On the dis
tant future, they can match
their looks into the crystal ball
against the next person's.
They are technically wrong—
since the burden of proof rests
with them to show the useful
ness of their ideas in practice.
But they are emotionally right—
many of their suggestions ap
peal to me, and no one can deny
their attractiveness in terms of
student dignity alone.
Time Perspective
This time perspective has
given them another felicitous de
bating position in the area of
implementation. Their position
is such that people can believe
what they want:
• Perhaps Harris, by bellicose
demands, can actually achieve
parts of this idealized platform.
At least give him a chance. It
will be an exciting year.
• Harris will not "take to the
streets" unless his most impor

tant demands meet stubborn op
position. As he learns to handle
the structure, some of his goals
may come closer to completion.
It will be an interesting year.
• Harris will be so over
whelmed by the bureaucracy for
which he has contempt that it
will take him all year to catch
on. But his ideas are the attrac
tion, not his skills behind the
desk. It will be a dull yeax.
Tilting at Windmills
All these reasons to support
Harris are emotional—and legiti
mate. But they carry with them
a responsibility to know how
good his judgment is. He claims
on one hand that Bob Klein only
attacks symptoms, but he would
call a general strike of classes
if the United States bombed Ha
noi. This is not even a symp
tom —it tilts at windmills.
The problem with suggesting
an alternative to Harris-Collins
is that the debate is going on in
different terms. The platform
which Bob Klein and Jan Jacobi
published was the earliest of the
campaign, and it focused on edu
cation as the central issue.
Here the similarity ends.
Many of the Klein-Jacobi points
are similar to their opponents',
but less grandiose in their con
ception. They are talking about
realizable goals and thus are
open to discussion as to whether
or not these can be achieved.
Platform Comparison
To say that one platform is
better than the other is to com
pare 1984 with the Statistical
Abstract of the United States.
To say that one fundamental
ly disagrees with the other is to
infer a great deal about both.
The debate resolves itself into a
discussion about who is more
likely to achieve anything—and
this is where Klein and Jacobi
have a legitimate advantage.
Historically, the students have

been unable to achieve reforms
independently. It is only when a
consensus has been reached
with faculty and administration
that changes take place.
This was true of political ad
vocacy three years ago. It is also
true of the recent liquor change.
Only after the Committee of 15
approved the proposal of the
Subcommittee of Student Af
fairs and Service was the neces
sary consensus there. The
Crow-Halverson upheaval last
spring delayed the change for
over six months.
Disadvantage
Administrators are human. It
accounts for their mistakes. It
also accounts for their willing
ness to listen to a reasonable
point of view. But when they
feel pressured—and this applies
to faculty as well—the normal
response is to do nothing. This
always works to the student's
disadvantage.
Another problem is hardening
of the line. Administrators are
not a monolith. But nothing will
more quickly make them one
than to treat them as though
they were. They must be dealt
with on a personal basis. To
treat them as The Opposition
will generate the same reaction:
do nothing. Under fire, they can
have an even longer time pers
pective than David Harris. A
student is only here for four
years.
In the final analysis, politics
is the art of the palpable. Bob
Klein has worked for changes
within the system. His proposal
to create seminars for credit for
any group of students who
could round up a faculty mem
ber and a topic was accepted by
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education at its April 11
meeting. It is this kind of initia
tive which suggests that his plat
form would become a reality.
