## 'It'll Have To Be Harris' Over Phony Pragmatists 
### Steve Leopold 
At first glance, the candidacy
of one David Victor Harris for
the sacred citadel of student
power—the ASSU Presidency—
strikes the dispassionate obser
ver as outrageous.
It is.
For Dave Harris is not play
ing by the rules of the game. A
Wilbur sponsor and itinerant
evangelist — the two are not
mutually exclusive — Harris is
by nature a rager. Indeed, with
his unkept hair and work shirt
and levi attire, he appears the
perfect caricature of the cam
pus revolutionary.
Which he is.
But on a campus almost total
ly devoid of revolutionary cari
catures, much less the genuine
article, his very presence in the
finals is an affront to the self
styled pragmatic young men
earnestly endeavoring to con
vince the electorate that their
man and his plans are more
feasible, and, thus, more revo
lutionary.
The 'pragmatic revolutionar
ies' are, of course, not really
pragmatic, for the simple reason
that they have incorrectly eval
uated the limits of student
power — at least in the ASSU.
Unpowerful Post
The pragmatists, like most of
the student body, are seemingly
unaware that the Presidency of
the ASSU is no longer the most
powerful post in student govern
ment.
Back in Armin Rosencranz'
day, when the Legislature — a
collection of 24 quite unrepre
sentative souls—was half rub
ber-stamp and half farce, the
ASSU President, along with the
editor of The Dally had the
power.
In the last two years, or
rather, since the Crow-Halverson
Report, it is the Speaker of the
Legislature, again along with
the editor of The Daily, who
runs the show.
The President of the ASSU
is no longer a power broker and,
given the nature of the student
hierarchy, he can never hope to
be one to the extent the Speak
er is.
Presidential Powers
Yet if the President is no long
er the fountainhead of student
power in the Machiavellian
sense, he does have the powers
of advocacy, innovation, persua
sion and, yes, protest. Candidate
Harris seems aware of this
change — either by perception
or by instinct—and has thus
changed the rules.
In effect, he has forsaken poli
tics for honesty.
Under the old rules, it was
rankest folly for a presidential

candidate to even mention the
fraternity system except in gen
eralizations. Harris, however,
has willingly admitted that he
favors a universal draw system.
Why not? There is precious
little the ASSU President can
do about it except give an hon
est opinion.
Protest
Aside from perceiving that
pragmatic power politics are ir
relevant to the position of ASSU
President, Harris has realized
that a protest must be made
against the attempt to emascu
late the student revolution by
substituting rhetoric for action
and platitudes for concern.
A revolution can, and should,
be institutionalized to the extent
that a proper forum is provided
for dissent and legitimate chan
nels of communication and ne
gotiation are established be
tween student leaders, faculty
members and administrators.
But to institutionalize the pro
test itself by regurgitating the
same old formulas as if they
were liturgical chants is to kill
the revolution by boring every
one to death.
Problems New and Old
Unlike his Madison Avenue
adversary, Dave Harris is tack
ling new problems and recon
sidering the old ones. He is ques
tioning premises and asking for
some reflection about where we
—students, faculty and staff—
are taking the University and
why.
Thus, one can forgive Mr.
Harris for his occasional lapses
into social thought semantics
and SNCC shibboleths. The im
portant thing is that he is think
ing, and he is honest, which is
a good deal more than can be
said about the phony pragmat
ists.
He may appear to be a carica
ture of the student revolution
ary, but, to use Holden Caul
field's terminology, he is that
rarest of.all species—a genuine
phony. Since his opposition is
just plain phony, to the voters
'it has to be Harris.'
