# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## A 						Chicken In Every Pot? The Voters Write On 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Golly (Bob) Moses, Harris
sure is a good candidate! Just
about the only person who
would be as good is Joseph Con
rad's Karl Yundt, and of course
he can't run.
Old Karl and Young Dave have
a lot in common, though. Give a
listen to Karl's platform: "I
have always dreamed of a band
of men absolute in their resolve
to discard all scruples in the
choice of means, strong enough
to give themselves frankly the
name of destroyers, and free
from the taint of that resigned
pessimism which rots the world
. . . that's what I would like to
see."
Fortunately, at Stanford, Karl
couldn't, and Harris won't, find
such stout hearts. Here, self-in
terest reigns. Truly, Harris is all
things to all men. How can he
lose when he promises, in sum,
that we all can do what we damn
well please, 'cause it's our
right?
For those whom it pleases to
do nothing, he at least is "inter
esting" and promises an "inter
esting year," i.e. he's fun to
watch. The trouble is that it
pleases most of the studs and
dollies to do nothing, and Dave
is relying on (shudder) student
activism. So, don't woriy, Mr.
Klein, Harris is no Attila the
Hun; he's more of a Don
Quixote.
While the minority of us sit
calmly waiting for Young Dave
to play Icarus next year, the ma
jority (and Editor Roise) are
wedged in a dark alley with
Karl Yundt, who's giggling with
glee for his man Dave, "with a
faint black grimace of a tooth
less mouth."
And meanwhile, another year
goes by.

• Endorsement
Editor, The Daily:
The last four years have been
extremrly profitable ones for
student government at Stanford.
As people who have been deeply
interested in its progress, we
believe that David Harris is the
candidate who will continue to

make it a fruitful endeavor.
His election will precipitate
serious introspection about the
educational process throughout
the University.
We urge that David Harris be
elected,

• Radicalism
Editor, The Daily:
The campaign for the ASSU
presidency has clarified itself:
there are a lot of people
who find themselves with a
radical concern for education at
Stanford and who are probably
surprised at how well Dave Har
ris did in the primary balloting.
Harris has clearly put education
ahead of all the other common
issues as the most critical issue
with which the Stanford com
munity must deal next year.
Harris has run an articulate
campaign, promising to use radi
cal methods if necessary; his
articulation of the major issue
is already a radical method
which seems to have met with
reasonable success. It is clear
that Harris will be no trivial
politician, but that his experience
in educational conflicts will tem
per enthusiasm with fairly reas
onable diplomacy.
What is a radical method?
Legislative maneuvering is not
radical, but is the ordinary way
of "working things out." Harris'
radical method is articulate com
munication through the spoken
and written word, pointing with
increasing depth to the funda
mental problems of getting an
education at Stanford. He is
grasping the university in a way
that makes us listen.
Let us try to hear wluit he is
saying before we vote again.
Klein has said that he will try
to arouse some interest in "edu

cational reform"; his main
theme seems to be the personal
touch. Klein is out of touch with
the educational concern that
Harris's victory demonstrates;
the ASSU presidency does not
need the personal touch; the
job requires understanding of
the structure of university prob
lems and real diplomatic ability
to communicate this understand
ing to the persons who work to
gether here.

• Rumor Denied
Editor, The Daily:
In the past days of the elec
tion, there has been a rumor
spread to the effect that during
the Wilbur controversy over
sponsor selection, Dave Harris
urged all the sponsors to quit.
As Head Sponsor this year at
Wilbur, I know that such a
claim is completely unfounded.
Dave cast his vote with all the
other sponsors time and time
again for a moderate and con
sidered course of action.
Throughout the year, I have
been impressed with his ability
to both hold articulate educa
tional ideals and to relate them
practically to his work as a
sponsor. Some students are con
cerned that Dave will not be
able to work with people rea
sonably but instead will a priori
turn to conflict as the only
means to gaining his goals.
From working with him this
past year, I do not believe such
concerns are warranted.

• Mackenzie Speaks
Editor, The Dally:
As one who has been follow
ing the ASSU elections closely,
I have experienced some diffi
culty in making a choice this
week between the two finalists.
My considerable enthusiasm for
Carl Schmidt's candidacy has
not made the choice any easier.
I cannot, however, approve for
others anymore than for myself
the self indulgence which re
fuses to make the choice simply
because neither of the candi

dates very closely approximates
my ideal.
I have observed or been asso
ciated with both finalists and
their associates. On the bases of
these observations and my own
experience, I can say that Mr.
Harris has made by far the
stronger and better impression.
His understanding of the prob
lems facing student government
and the depth of his concern for
and ability to deal with the cur
rent issues in higher education
clearly qualifies him for the
post he seeks.
I therefore urge every student
to vote for Dave Harris as the
clearly superior of the two can
didates for the ASSU Presi
dency.

• Shibboleth & Slogan
Editor, The Daily:
As is customary in political
combat of any kind, the present
presidential campaign at Stan
ford has degenerated into a silly
polemic employing a wealth of
platitudes, slogans, and stereo
types. The blame is not the can
didates, but rather rests on the
shoulders of their supporters.
For example, Mr. Harris has
been described by many students
that I have spoken to as unfit
for the office he seeks because
of his unconventional habits of
dress, while Mr. Klein will, I am
confident, lose electoral support
because of his obvious resem
blance in political style to Rich
ard Nixon.
Another equally absurd result
of the campaign thus far is the
tendency of many students to
stereotype each candidate ac
cording to his living group af
filiation. Mr. Klein is universally
acknowledged to be the "Row's
candidate" while Mr. Harris is
seen as a member of that sub
versive clique of sponsors that
seeks to blow the minds of
Stanford freshmen.
Frankly, I'm a little weary of
the proliferation of such stereo
types and slogans.
As the president of a fraterni
ty, I have decided to support
Mr. Harris' candidacy not be

cause of his manner of dress
nor his living group affiliation,
but because his platform for the
most part coincides (by no
means exactly) with what I
would like to see Stanford be
come in the future. It's not par
ticularly original to those of us
who have read Growing up Ab
surd and A Community of Schol
ars and met Mr. Goodman in
person, but it articulates a
mood, a point of view, which
many students share (as evi
denced by the primary election
results).
To confuse the concrete issues
of the campaign by making ref
erence to irrelevent criteria for
judging the candidacy of each
presidential aspirant is to do a
disservice not only to them but
to the University at large.
BILL KEYLOR
• As The Farm Grows
Editor, The Daily:
The ASSU Presidential Elec
tion has brought the Stanford
educational system into focus.
It is apparent from the lead that
Dave Harris and Mike Collins
had in the primary election that
there are many students who
are aware that Stanford is not
the best of all possible worlds.
We have transferred to Stan
ford from a college that is based
on the reforms the Harris-Col

lins platform is advocating—no
grades, no required courses, and
voluntary declaration of a ma
jor. Having lived with this sys
tem, we can testify that educa
tion not only continues without
these devices, it improves.
Paragraph evaluations are
much more constructive and in
dicative of progress than are
letter grades. As for required
courses, both the General Studies
Program and requirements in
the field of one's major offer
only one advantage—they are an
easy way for a university ad
ministration to avoid the incon
venience of being responsible for
a close counseling program.
It is so easy to tell a student
to go read the catalogue. In this
wonderous book our academic
futures are nicely outlined for
us. But we dislike being told
that we must follow prescribed
steps, with no exceptions per
mitted. Every student should be
an exception! Every student is
an individual with unique in
terests and talents.
It's astounding how much

more is learned when studying
something one has chosen to
learn. And a "good, well-rounded
general education"? Students
are more apt to experiment with
unfamiliar subjects when they
don't have to worry about the
competition for grades.
Mr. Klein has stressed the im
portance of retaining a grading
system in the student's major
field. He feels that we must re
member the importance of these
grades to graduate schools.
If a school as large and as
well known as Stanford abol
ishes the grading system, grad
uate schools will simply have to
react by changing their methods
of evaluation. They certainly
won't cease their consideration
of all Stanford applicants.
Stanford has the potential to
offer a truly stimulating educa
tional experience. If Dave Harris
and Mike Collins get our sup
port, maybe next year we can
take part in a vital transforma
tion of "The Farm."

If a school as large and as

react by changing their methods
of evaluation. They certainly
won't cease their consideration
of all Stanford applicants.
Stanford has the potential to

Editor, The Daily:
Golly (Bob) Moses, Harris
sure is a good candidate! Just
about the only person who
would be as good is Joseph Con
rad's Karl Yundt, and of course
he can't run.
Old Karl and Young Dave have
a lot in common, though. Give a
listen to Karl's platform: "I
have always dreamed of a band
of men absolute in their resolve
to discard all scruples in the
choice of means, strong enough
to give themselves frankly the
name of destroyers, and free
from the taint of that resigned
pessimism which rots the world
. . . that's what I would like to
see."
Fortunately, at Stanford, Karl
couldn't, and Harris won't, find
such stout hearts. Here, self-in
terest reigns. Truly, Harris is all
things to all men. How can he
lose when he promises, in sum,
that we all can do what we damn
well please, 'cause it's our
right?
For those whom it pleases to
do nothing, he at least is "inter
esting" and promises an "inter
esting year," i.e. he's fun to
watch. The trouble is that it
pleases most of the studs and
dollies to do nothing, and Dave
is relying on (shudder) student
activism. So, don't woriy, Mr.
Klein, Harris is no Attila the
Hun; he's more of a Don
Quixote.
While the minority of us sit
calmly waiting for Young Dave
to play Icarus next year, the ma
jority (and Editor Roise) are
wedged in a dark alley with
Karl Yundt, who's giggling with
glee for his man Dave, "with a
faint black grimace of a tooth
less mouth."
And meanwhile, another year
goes by.

As people who have been deeply

His election will precipitate

• Radicalism
Editor, The Daily:
The campaign for the ASSU
presidency has clarified itself:
there are a lot of people
who find themselves with a
radical concern for education at
Stanford and who are probably
surprised at how well Dave Har
ris did in the primary balloting.
Harris has clearly put education
ahead of all the other common
issues as the most critical issue
with which the Stanford com
munity must deal next year.
Harris has run an articulate
campaign, promising to use radi
cal methods if necessary; his
articulation of the major issue
is already a radical method
which seems to have met with
reasonable success. It is clear
that Harris will be no trivial
politician, but that his experience
in educational conflicts will tem
per enthusiasm with fairly reas
onable diplomacy.
What is a radical method?
Legislative maneuvering is not
radical, but is the ordinary way
of "working things out." Harris'
radical method is articulate com
munication through the spoken
and written word, pointing with
increasing depth to the funda
mental problems of getting an
education at Stanford. He is
grasping the university in a way
that makes us listen.
Let us try to hear wluit he is
saying before we vote again.
Klein has said that he will try
to arouse some interest in "edu

cational reform"; his main
theme seems to be the personal
touch. Klein is out of touch with
the educational concern that
Harris's victory demonstrates;
the ASSU presidency does not
need the personal touch; the
job requires understanding of
the structure of university prob
lems and real diplomatic ability
to communicate this understand
ing to the persons who work to
gether here.

• Rumor Denied
Editor, The Daily:
In the past days of the elec
tion, there has been a rumor
spread to the effect that during
the Wilbur controversy over
sponsor selection, Dave Harris
urged all the sponsors to quit.
As Head Sponsor this year at
Wilbur, I know that such a
claim is completely unfounded.
Dave cast his vote with all the
other sponsors time and time
again for a moderate and con
sidered course of action.
Throughout the year, I have
been impressed with his ability
to both hold articulate educa
tional ideals and to relate them
practically to his work as a
sponsor. Some students are con
cerned that Dave will not be
able to work with people rea
sonably but instead will a priori
turn to conflict as the only
means to gaining his goals.
From working with him this
past year, I do not believe such
concerns are warranted.

Editor, The Dally:
As one who has been follow
ing the ASSU elections closely,
I have experienced some diffi
culty in making a choice this
week between the two finalists.
My considerable enthusiasm for
Carl Schmidt's candidacy has
not made the choice any easier.
I cannot, however, approve for
others anymore than for myself
the self indulgence which re
fuses to make the choice simply
because neither of the candi

dates very closely approximates
my ideal.
I have observed or been asso
ciated with both finalists and
their associates. On the bases of
these observations and my own
experience, I can say that Mr.
Harris has made by far the
stronger and better impression.
His understanding of the prob
lems facing student government
and the depth of his concern for
and ability to deal with the cur
rent issues in higher education
clearly qualifies him for the
post he seeks.
I therefore urge every student
to vote for Dave Harris as the
clearly superior of the two can
didates for the ASSU Presi

• Shibboleth & Slogan
Editor, The Daily:
As is customary in political
combat of any kind, the present
presidential campaign at Stan
ford has degenerated into a silly
polemic employing a wealth of
platitudes, slogans, and stereo
types. The blame is not the can
didates, but rather rests on the
shoulders of their supporters.
For example, Mr. Harris has
been described by many students
that I have spoken to as unfit
for the office he seeks because
of his unconventional habits of
dress, while Mr. Klein will, I am
confident, lose electoral support
because of his obvious resem
blance in political style to Rich
ard Nixon.
Another equally absurd result
of the campaign thus far is the
tendency of many students to
stereotype each candidate ac
cording to his living group af
filiation. Mr. Klein is universally
acknowledged to be the "Row's
candidate" while Mr. Harris is
seen as a member of that sub
versive clique of sponsors that
seeks to blow the minds of
Stanford freshmen.
Frankly, I'm a little weary of
the proliferation of such stereo
types and slogans.
As the president of a fraterni
ty, I have decided to support
Mr. Harris' candidacy not be

cause of his manner of dress
nor his living group affiliation,
but because his platform for the
most part coincides (by no
means exactly) with what I
would like to see Stanford be
come in the future. It's not par
ticularly original to those of us
who have read Growing up Ab
surd and A Community of Schol
ars and met Mr. Goodman in
person, but it articulates a
mood, a point of view, which
many students share (as evi
denced by the primary election
results).
To confuse the concrete issues
of the campaign by making ref
erence to irrelevent criteria for
judging the candidacy of each
presidential aspirant is to do a
disservice not only to them but
to the University at large.
BILL KEYLOR
• As The Farm Grows
Editor, The Daily:
The ASSU Presidential Elec
tion has brought the Stanford
educational system into focus.
It is apparent from the lead that
Dave Harris and Mike Collins
had in the primary election that
there are many students who
are aware that Stanford is not
the best of all possible worlds.
We have transferred to Stan
ford from a college that is based
on the reforms the Harris-Col

lins platform is advocating—no
grades, no required courses, and
voluntary declaration of a ma
jor. Having lived with this sys
tem, we can testify that educa
tion not only continues without
these devices, it improves.
Paragraph evaluations are
much more constructive and in
dicative of progress than are
letter grades. As for required
courses, both the General Studies
Program and requirements in
the field of one's major offer
only one advantage—they are an
easy way for a university ad
ministration to avoid the incon
venience of being responsible for
a close counseling program.
It is so easy to tell a student
to go read the catalogue. In this
wonderous book our academic
futures are nicely outlined for
us. But we dislike being told
that we must follow prescribed
steps, with no exceptions per
mitted. Every student should be
an exception! Every student is
an individual with unique in
terests and talents.
It's astounding how much

more is learned when studying
something one has chosen to
learn. And a "good, well-rounded
general education"? Students
are more apt to experiment with
unfamiliar subjects when they
don't have to worry about the
competition for grades.
Mr. Klein has stressed the im
portance of retaining a grading
system in the student's major
field. He feels that we must re
member the importance of these
grades to graduate schools.
If a school as large and as
well known as Stanford abol
ishes the grading system, grad

an individual with unique in

It's astounding how much

more is learned when studying
something one has chosen to
learn. And a "good, well-rounded
general education"? Students
are more apt to experiment with
unfamiliar subjects when they
don't have to worry about the
competition for grades.
Mr. Klein has stressed the im
portance of retaining a grading
system in the student's major
field. He feels that we must re
member the importance of these
grades to graduate schools.
If a school as large and as
well known as Stanford abol
ishes the grading system, grad
uate schools will simply have to
react by changing their methods
of evaluation. They certainly
won't cease their consideration
of all Stanford applicants.
Stanford has the potential to
offer a truly stimulating educa
tional experience. If Dave Harris
and Mike Collins get our sup
port, maybe next year we can
take part in a vital transforma
tion of "The Farm."

Editor, The Daily:
Golly (Bob) Moses, Harris
sure is a good candidate! Just
about the only person who
would be as good is Joseph Con
rad's Karl Yundt, and of course
he can't run.
Old Karl and Young Dave have
a lot in common, though. Give a
listen to Karl's platform: "I
have always dreamed of a band
of men absolute in their resolve
to discard all scruples in the
choice of means, strong enough
to give themselves frankly the
name of destroyers, and free
from the taint of that resigned
pessimism which rots the world
. . . that's what I would like to
see."
Fortunately, at Stanford, Karl
couldn't, and Harris won't, find
such stout hearts. Here, self-in
terest reigns. Truly, Harris is all
things to all men. How can he
lose when he promises, in sum,
that we all can do what we damn
well please, 'cause it's our
right?
For those whom it pleases to
do nothing, he at least is "inter
esting" and promises an "inter
esting year," i.e. he's fun to
watch. The trouble is that it
pleases most of the studs and
dollies to do nothing, and Dave
is relying on (shudder) student
activism. So, don't woriy, Mr.
Klein, Harris is no Attila the
Hun; he's more of a Don
Quixote.
While the minority of us sit
calmly waiting for Young Dave
to play Icarus next year, the ma
jority (and Editor Roise) are
wedged in a dark alley with
Karl Yundt, who's giggling with
glee for his man Dave, "with a
faint black grimace of a tooth
less mouth."
And meanwhile, another year
goes by.

As people who have been deeply

His election will precipitate

• Radicalism
Editor, The Daily:
The campaign for the ASSU
presidency has clarified itself:
there are a lot of people
who find themselves with a
radical concern for education at
Stanford and who are probably
surprised at how well Dave Har
ris did in the primary balloting.
Harris has clearly put education
ahead of all the other common
issues as the most critical issue
with which the Stanford com
munity must deal next year.
Harris has run an articulate
campaign, promising to use radi
cal methods if necessary; his
articulation of the major issue
is already a radical method
which seems to have met with
reasonable success. It is clear
that Harris will be no trivial
politician, but that his experience
in educational conflicts will tem
per enthusiasm with fairly reas
onable diplomacy.
What is a radical method?
Legislative maneuvering is not
radical, but is the ordinary way
of "working things out." Harris'
radical method is articulate com
munication through the spoken
and written word, pointing with
increasing depth to the funda
mental problems of getting an
education at Stanford. He is
grasping the university in a way
that makes us listen.
Let us try to hear wluit he is
saying before we vote again.
Klein has said that he will try
to arouse some interest in "edu

cational reform"; his main
theme seems to be the personal
touch. Klein is out of touch with
the educational concern that
Harris's victory demonstrates;
the ASSU presidency does not
need the personal touch; the
job requires understanding of
the structure of university prob
lems and real diplomatic ability
to communicate this understand
ing to the persons who work to
gether here.

• Rumor Denied
Editor, The Daily:
In the past days of the elec
tion, there has been a rumor
spread to the effect that during
the Wilbur controversy over
sponsor selection, Dave Harris
urged all the sponsors to quit.
As Head Sponsor this year at
Wilbur, I know that such a
claim is completely unfounded.
Dave cast his vote with all the
other sponsors time and time
again for a moderate and con
sidered course of action.
Throughout the year, I have
been impressed with his ability
to both hold articulate educa
tional ideals and to relate them
practically to his work as a
sponsor. Some students are con
cerned that Dave will not be
able to work with people rea
sonably but instead will a priori
turn to conflict as the only
means to gaining his goals.
From working with him this
past year, I do not believe such
concerns are warranted.

Editor, The Dally:
As one who has been follow
ing the ASSU elections closely,
I have experienced some diffi
culty in making a choice this
week between the two finalists.
My considerable enthusiasm for
Carl Schmidt's candidacy has
not made the choice any easier.
I cannot, however, approve for
others anymore than for myself
the self indulgence which re
fuses to make the choice simply
because neither of the candi

dates very closely approximates
my ideal.
I have observed or been asso
ciated with both finalists and
their associates. On the bases of
these observations and my own
experience, I can say that Mr.
Harris has made by far the
stronger and better impression.
His understanding of the prob
lems facing student government
and the depth of his concern for
and ability to deal with the cur
rent issues in higher education
clearly qualifies him for the
post he seeks.
I therefore urge every student
to vote for Dave Harris as the
clearly superior of the two can
didates for the ASSU Presi

• Shibboleth & Slogan
Editor, The Daily:
As is customary in political
combat of any kind, the present
presidential campaign at Stan
ford has degenerated into a silly
polemic employing a wealth of
platitudes, slogans, and stereo
types. The blame is not the can
didates, but rather rests on the
shoulders of their supporters.
For example, Mr. Harris has
been described by many students
that I have spoken to as unfit
for the office he seeks because
of his unconventional habits of
dress, while Mr. Klein will, I am
confident, lose electoral support
because of his obvious resem
blance in political style to Rich
ard Nixon.
Another equally absurd result
of the campaign thus far is the
tendency of many students to
stereotype each candidate ac
cording to his living group af
filiation. Mr. Klein is universally
acknowledged to be the "Row's
candidate" while Mr. Harris is
seen as a member of that sub
versive clique of sponsors that
seeks to blow the minds of
Stanford freshmen.
Frankly, I'm a little weary of
the proliferation of such stereo
types and slogans.
As the president of a fraterni
ty, I have decided to support
Mr. Harris' candidacy not be

cause of his manner of dress
nor his living group affiliation,
but because his platform for the
most part coincides (by no
means exactly) with what I
would like to see Stanford be
come in the future. It's not par
ticularly original to those of us
who have read Growing up Ab
surd and A Community of Schol
ars and met Mr. Goodman in
person, but it articulates a
mood, a point of view, which
many students share (as evi
denced by the primary election
results).
To confuse the concrete issues
of the campaign by making ref
erence to irrelevent criteria for
judging the candidacy of each
presidential aspirant is to do a
disservice not only to them but
to the University at large.

Editor, The Daily:
The ASSU Presidential Elec
tion has brought the Stanford
educational system into focus.
It is apparent from the lead that
Dave Harris and Mike Collins
had in the primary election that
there are many students who
are aware that Stanford is not
the best of all possible worlds.
We have transferred to Stan
ford from a college that is based
on the reforms the Harris-Col

lins platform is advocating—no
grades, no required courses, and
voluntary declaration of a ma
jor. Having lived with this sys
tem, we can testify that educa
tion not only continues without
these devices, it improves.
Paragraph evaluations are
much more constructive and in
dicative of progress than are
letter grades. As for required
courses, both the General Studies
Program and requirements in
the field of one's major offer
only one advantage—they are an
easy way for a university ad
ministration to avoid the incon
venience of being responsible for
a close counseling program.
It is so easy to tell a student
to go read the catalogue. In this
wonderous book our academic
futures are nicely outlined for
us. But we dislike being told
that we must follow prescribed
steps, with no exceptions per
mitted. Every student should be

the field of one's major offer
only one advantage—they are an
easy way for a university ad
ministration to avoid the incon
venience of being responsible for
a close counseling program.
It is so easy to tell a student
to go read the catalogue. In this
wonderous book our academic
futures are nicely outlined for
us. But we dislike being told
that we must follow prescribed
steps, with no exceptions per
mitted. Every student should be
an exception! Every student is
an individual with unique in
terests and talents.
It's astounding how much

more is learned when studying
something one has chosen to
learn. And a "good, well-rounded
general education"? Students
are more apt to experiment with
unfamiliar subjects when they
don't have to worry about the
competition for grades.
Mr. Klein has stressed the im
portance of retaining a grading
system in the student's major
field. He feels that we must re
member the importance of these
grades to graduate schools.
If a school as large and as
well known as Stanford abol
ishes the grading system, grad
uate schools will simply have to
react by changing their methods
of evaluation. They certainly
won't cease their consideration
of all Stanford applicants.
Stanford has the potential to
offer a truly stimulating educa
tional experience. If Dave Harris
and Mike Collins get our sup
port, maybe next year we can
take part in a vital transforma
tion of "The Farm."

Editor, The Daily:
Golly (Bob) Moses, Harris
sure is a good candidate! Just
about the only person who
would be as good is Joseph Con
rad's Karl Yundt, and of course
he can't run.
Old Karl and Young Dave have
a lot in common, though. Give a
listen to Karl's platform: "I
have always dreamed of a band
of men absolute in their resolve
to discard all scruples in the
choice of means, strong enough
to give themselves frankly the
name of destroyers, and free
from the taint of that resigned
pessimism which rots the world
. . . that's what I would like to
see."
Fortunately, at Stanford, Karl
couldn't, and Harris won't, find
such stout hearts. Here, self-in
terest reigns. Truly, Harris is all
things to all men. How can he
lose when he promises, in sum,
that we all can do what we damn
well please, 'cause it's our
right?
For those whom it pleases to
do nothing, he at least is "inter
esting" and promises an "inter
esting year," i.e. he's fun to
watch. The trouble is that it
pleases most of the studs and
dollies to do nothing, and Dave
is relying on (shudder) student
activism. So, don't woriy, Mr.
Klein, Harris is no Attila the
Hun; he's more of a Don
Quixote.
While the minority of us sit
calmly waiting for Young Dave
to play Icarus next year, the ma
jority (and Editor Roise) are
wedged in a dark alley with
Karl Yundt, who's giggling with
glee for his man Dave, "with a
faint black grimace of a tooth
less mouth."
And meanwhile, another year
goes by.

• Radicalism
Editor, The Daily:
The campaign for the ASSU
presidency has clarified itself:
there are a lot of people
who find themselves with a
radical concern for education at
Stanford and who are probably
surprised at how well Dave Har
ris did in the primary balloting.
Harris has clearly put education
ahead of all the other common
issues as the most critical issue
with which the Stanford com
munity must deal next year.
Harris has run an articulate
campaign, promising to use radi
cal methods if necessary; his
articulation of the major issue
is already a radical method
which seems to have met with
reasonable success. It is clear
that Harris will be no trivial
politician, but that his experience
in educational conflicts will tem
per enthusiasm with fairly reas
onable diplomacy.
What is a radical method?
Legislative maneuvering is not
radical, but is the ordinary way
of "working things out." Harris'
radical method is articulate com
munication through the spoken
and written word, pointing with
increasing depth to the funda
mental problems of getting an
education at Stanford. He is
grasping the university in a way
that makes us listen.
Let us try to hear wluit he is
saying before we vote again.
Klein has said that he will try
to arouse some interest in "edu

cational reform"; his main
theme seems to be the personal
touch. Klein is out of touch with
the educational concern that
Harris's victory demonstrates;
the ASSU presidency does not
need the personal touch; the
job requires understanding of
the structure of university prob
lems and real diplomatic ability
to communicate this understand
ing to the persons who work to
gether here.

• Rumor Denied
Editor, The Daily:
In the past days of the elec
tion, there has been a rumor
spread to the effect that during
the Wilbur controversy over
sponsor selection, Dave Harris
urged all the sponsors to quit.
As Head Sponsor this year at
Wilbur, I know that such a
claim is completely unfounded.
Dave cast his vote with all the
other sponsors time and time
again for a moderate and con
sidered course of action.
Throughout the year, I have
been impressed with his ability
to both hold articulate educa
tional ideals and to relate them
practically to his work as a
sponsor. Some students are con
cerned that Dave will not be
able to work with people rea
sonably but instead will a priori
turn to conflict as the only
means to gaining his goals.
From working with him this
past year, I do not believe such
concerns are warranted.

Editor, The Dally:
As one who has been follow
ing the ASSU elections closely,
I have experienced some diffi
culty in making a choice this
week between the two finalists.
My considerable enthusiasm for
Carl Schmidt's candidacy has
not made the choice any easier.
I cannot, however, approve for
others anymore than for myself
the self indulgence which re
fuses to make the choice simply
because neither of the candi

dates very closely approximates
my ideal.
I have observed or been asso
ciated with both finalists and
their associates. On the bases of
these observations and my own
experience, I can say that Mr.
Harris has made by far the
stronger and better impression.
His understanding of the prob
lems facing student government
and the depth of his concern for
and ability to deal with the cur
rent issues in higher education
clearly qualifies him for the
post he seeks.
I therefore urge every student
to vote for Dave Harris as the
clearly superior of the two can
didates for the ASSU Presi

• Shibboleth & Slogan
Editor, The Daily:
As is customary in political
combat of any kind, the present
presidential campaign at Stan
ford has degenerated into a silly
polemic employing a wealth of
platitudes, slogans, and stereo
types. The blame is not the can
didates, but rather rests on the
shoulders of their supporters.
For example, Mr. Harris has
been described by many students
that I have spoken to as unfit
for the office he seeks because
of his unconventional habits of
dress, while Mr. Klein will, I am
confident, lose electoral support
because of his obvious resem
blance in political style to Rich
ard Nixon.
Another equally absurd result
of the campaign thus far is the
tendency of many students to
stereotype each candidate ac
cording to his living group af
filiation. Mr. Klein is universally
acknowledged to be the "Row's
candidate" while Mr. Harris is
seen as a member of that sub
versive clique of sponsors that
seeks to blow the minds of
Stanford freshmen.
Frankly, I'm a little weary of
the proliferation of such stereo
types and slogans.
As the president of a fraterni
ty, I have decided to support
Mr. Harris' candidacy not be

cause of his manner of dress
nor his living group affiliation,
but because his platform for the
most part coincides (by no
means exactly) with what I
would like to see Stanford be
come in the future. It's not par
ticularly original to those of us
who have read Growing up Ab
surd and A Community of Schol
ars and met Mr. Goodman in
person, but it articulates a
mood, a point of view, which
many students share (as evi
denced by the primary election
results).
To confuse the concrete issues
of the campaign by making ref
erence to irrelevent criteria for
judging the candidacy of each
presidential aspirant is to do a
disservice not only to them but
to the University at large.

The ASSU Presidential Elec

It is apparent from the lead that

We have transferred to Stan
ford from a college that is based
on the reforms the Harris-Col

lins platform is advocating—no
grades, no required courses, and
voluntary declaration of a ma
jor. Having lived with this sys
tem, we can testify that educa
tion not only continues without
these devices, it improves.
Paragraph evaluations are
much more constructive and in
dicative of progress than are
letter grades. As for required
courses, both the General Studies
Program and requirements in
the field of one's major offer
only one advantage—they are an
easy way for a university ad
ministration to avoid the incon
venience of being responsible for
a close counseling program.
It is so easy to tell a student
to go read the catalogue. In this
wonderous book our academic
futures are nicely outlined for
us. But we dislike being told
that we must follow prescribed
steps, with no exceptions per
mitted. Every student should be
an exception! Every student is
an individual with unique in
terests and talents.
It's astounding how much

more is learned when studying
something one has chosen to
learn. And a "good, well-rounded
general education"? Students
are more apt to experiment with
unfamiliar subjects when they
don't have to worry about the
competition for grades.
Mr. Klein has stressed the im
portance of retaining a grading
system in the student's major
field. He feels that we must re
member the importance of these
grades to graduate schools.
If a school as large and as
well known as Stanford abol
ishes the grading system, grad
uate schools will simply have to
react by changing their methods
of evaluation. They certainly
won't cease their consideration
of all Stanford applicants.
Stanford has the potential to
offer a truly stimulating educa
tional experience. If Dave Harris
and Mike Collins get our sup
port, maybe next year we can
take part in a vital transforma
tion of "The Farm."

Editor, The Daily:
Golly (Bob) Moses, Harris
sure is a good candidate! Just
about the only person who
would be as good is Joseph Con
rad's Karl Yundt, and of course
he can't run.
Old Karl and Young Dave have
a lot in common, though. Give a
listen to Karl's platform: "I
have always dreamed of a band
of men absolute in their resolve
to discard all scruples in the
choice of means, strong enough
to give themselves frankly the
name of destroyers, and free
from the taint of that resigned
pessimism which rots the world
. . . that's what I would like to
see."
Fortunately, at Stanford, Karl
couldn't, and Harris won't, find
such stout hearts. Here, self-in
terest reigns. Truly, Harris is all
things to all men. How can he
lose when he promises, in sum,
that we all can do what we damn
well please, 'cause it's our
right?
For those whom it pleases to
do nothing, he at least is "inter
esting" and promises an "inter
esting year," i.e. he's fun to
watch. The trouble is that it
pleases most of the studs and
dollies to do nothing, and Dave
is relying on (shudder) student
activism. So, don't woriy, Mr.
Klein, Harris is no Attila the
Hun; he's more of a Don
Quixote.
While the minority of us sit
calmly waiting for Young Dave
to play Icarus next year, the ma
jority (and Editor Roise) are
wedged in a dark alley with
Karl Yundt, who's giggling with
glee for his man Dave, "with a
faint black grimace of a tooth
less mouth."
And meanwhile, another year
goes by.

• Radicalism
Editor, The Daily:
The campaign for the ASSU
presidency has clarified itself:
there are a lot of people
who find themselves with a
radical concern for education at
Stanford and who are probably
surprised at how well Dave Har
ris did in the primary balloting.
Harris has clearly put education
ahead of all the other common
issues as the most critical issue
with which the Stanford com
munity must deal next year.
Harris has run an articulate
campaign, promising to use radi
cal methods if necessary; his
articulation of the major issue
is already a radical method
which seems to have met with
reasonable success. It is clear
that Harris will be no trivial
politician, but that his experience
in educational conflicts will tem
per enthusiasm with fairly reas
onable diplomacy.
What is a radical method?
Legislative maneuvering is not
radical, but is the ordinary way
of "working things out." Harris'
radical method is articulate com
munication through the spoken
and written word, pointing with
increasing depth to the funda
mental problems of getting an
education at Stanford. He is
grasping the university in a way
that makes us listen.
Let us try to hear wluit he is
saying before we vote again.
Klein has said that he will try
to arouse some interest in "edu

cational reform"; his main
theme seems to be the personal
touch. Klein is out of touch with
the educational concern that
Harris's victory demonstrates;
the ASSU presidency does not
need the personal touch; the
job requires understanding of
the structure of university prob
lems and real diplomatic ability
to communicate this understand
ing to the persons who work to
gether here.

• Rumor Denied
Editor, The Daily:
In the past days of the elec
tion, there has been a rumor
spread to the effect that during
the Wilbur controversy over
sponsor selection, Dave Harris
urged all the sponsors to quit.
As Head Sponsor this year at
Wilbur, I know that such a
claim is completely unfounded.
Dave cast his vote with all the
other sponsors time and time
again for a moderate and con
sidered course of action.
Throughout the year, I have
been impressed with his ability
to both hold articulate educa
tional ideals and to relate them
practically to his work as a
sponsor. Some students are con
cerned that Dave will not be
able to work with people rea
sonably but instead will a priori
turn to conflict as the only
means to gaining his goals.
From working with him this
past year, I do not believe such
concerns are warranted.

Editor, The Dally:
As one who has been follow
ing the ASSU elections closely,
I have experienced some diffi
culty in making a choice this
week between the two finalists.
My considerable enthusiasm for
Carl Schmidt's candidacy has
not made the choice any easier.
I cannot, however, approve for
others anymore than for myself
the self indulgence which re
fuses to make the choice simply
because neither of the candi

dates very closely approximates
my ideal.
I have observed or been asso
ciated with both finalists and
their associates. On the bases of
these observations and my own
experience, I can say that Mr.
Harris has made by far the
stronger and better impression.
His understanding of the prob
lems facing student government
and the depth of his concern for
and ability to deal with the cur
rent issues in higher education
clearly qualifies him for the
post he seeks.
I therefore urge every student
to vote for Dave Harris as the
clearly superior of the two can
didates for the ASSU Presi

• Shibboleth & Slogan
Editor, The Daily:
As is customary in political
combat of any kind, the present
presidential campaign at Stan
ford has degenerated into a silly
polemic employing a wealth of
platitudes, slogans, and stereo
types. The blame is not the can
didates, but rather rests on the
shoulders of their supporters.
For example, Mr. Harris has
been described by many students
that I have spoken to as unfit
for the office he seeks because
of his unconventional habits of
dress, while Mr. Klein will, I am
confident, lose electoral support
because of his obvious resem
blance in political style to Rich
ard Nixon.
Another equally absurd result
of the campaign thus far is the
tendency of many students to
stereotype each candidate ac
cording to his living group af
filiation. Mr. Klein is universally
acknowledged to be the "Row's
candidate" while Mr. Harris is
seen as a member of that sub
versive clique of sponsors that
seeks to blow the minds of
Stanford freshmen.
Frankly, I'm a little weary of
the proliferation of such stereo
types and slogans.
As the president of a fraterni
ty, I have decided to support
Mr. Harris' candidacy not be

cause of his manner of dress
nor his living group affiliation,
but because his platform for the
most part coincides (by no
means exactly) with what I
would like to see Stanford be
come in the future. It's not par
ticularly original to those of us
who have read Growing up Ab
surd and A Community of Schol
ars and met Mr. Goodman in
person, but it articulates a
mood, a point of view, which
many students share (as evi
denced by the primary election
results).
To confuse the concrete issues
of the campaign by making ref
erence to irrelevent criteria for
judging the candidacy of each
presidential aspirant is to do a
disservice not only to them but
to the University at large.

erence to irrelevent criteria for
judging the candidacy of each
presidential aspirant is to do a
disservice not only to them but
to the University at large.

• As The Farm Grows
Editor, The Daily:
The ASSU Presidential Elec
tion has brought the Stanford
educational system into focus.
It is apparent from the lead that
Dave Harris and Mike Collins
had in the primary election that
there are many students who
are aware that Stanford is not
the best of all possible worlds.
We have transferred to Stan
ford from a college that is based
on the reforms the Harris-Col

lins platform is advocating—no
grades, no required courses, and
voluntary declaration of a ma
jor. Having lived with this sys
tem, we can testify that educa
tion not only continues without
these devices, it improves.
Paragraph evaluations are
much more constructive and in
dicative of progress than are
letter grades. As for required
courses, both the General Studies
Program and requirements in
the field of one's major offer
only one advantage—they are an
easy way for a university ad
ministration to avoid the incon
venience of being responsible for
a close counseling program.
It is so easy to tell a student
to go read the catalogue. In this
wonderous book our academic
futures are nicely outlined for
us. But we dislike being told
that we must follow prescribed
steps, with no exceptions per
mitted. Every student should be
an exception! Every student is
an individual with unique in
terests and talents.
It's astounding how much

more is learned when studying
something one has chosen to
learn. And a "good, well-rounded
general education"? Students
are more apt to experiment with
unfamiliar subjects when they
don't have to worry about the
competition for grades.
Mr. Klein has stressed the im
portance of retaining a grading
system in the student's major
field. He feels that we must re
member the importance of these
grades to graduate schools.
If a school as large and as
well known as Stanford abol
ishes the grading system, grad
uate schools will simply have to
react by changing their methods
of evaluation. They certainly
won't cease their consideration
of all Stanford applicants.
Stanford has the potential to
offer a truly stimulating educa
tional experience. If Dave Harris
and Mike Collins get our sup
port, maybe next year we can
take part in a vital transforma
tion of "The Farm."
