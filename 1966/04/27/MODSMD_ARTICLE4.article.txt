# Delegates Arrive For Model United Nations
## 
### 
At a time when most college stu
dents making the news are those par
ticipating in demonstrations, some
1200 students are to meet in San
Francisco to discuss some world
problems in a more conventional man
ner.
The occasion is the 16th annual
session of the Model United Nations,
to be hosted by Stanford University
in the Hilton Hotel today through Sat
urday.

The Model UN or MUN as it is re
ferred to, is made up of students from
110 colleges and universities through
out the western United States.
Four-Day Session
Each one of the participating
schools is assigned a country to repre
sent and sends a delegation to the 4
day session. For example, the Univer
sity of San Francisco this year will be
representing Sweden; San Jose State,
Albania; and the Air Force Academy,
Brazil.
The delegations are each responsible
for their country's policy on issues
which come before not only the Gen
eral Assembly but also the various
committees and the Security Council.
There is also an International Court
of Justice for delegations who feel
their country has a just claim.
China Vote
On this year's agenda are such prob
lems as the recognition of Commu
nist China and the division of the Jor
dan River waters. The body will also
draft a document concerning human
rights.
In past years the MUN has been a
bit more liberal than its "father", but
there has been a remarkable similari
ty in voting patterns.
The vote on Communist China's en
try has been closer in the MUN than
in the world body, and in 1962 the
MUN pased sanctions against the Un
ion of South Africa a year before the
UN voted the same sanctions.
Stuart Novick, a Stanford student
and this year's Secretary General, has
indicated most preparations for the
conference are proceeding according
to plan.
