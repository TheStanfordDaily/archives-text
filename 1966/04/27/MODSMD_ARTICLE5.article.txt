# Yorty's Reception
## Civil Rights Pickets Greet Yorty 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty,
Democratic primary candidate for
governor, was greeted by approxi
mately 75 picketers carrying placards
proclaiming "Yorty fiddled while
Watts burned," "Sam Yorty: Califor
nia Dixiecrat," "Watts wrong with
Yorty" when he spoke at Stanford
yesterday.
The demonstrators also accused

Yorty of blocking War on Poverty
funds for Los Angeles, opposing the
Delano strike, advocating limited use
of nuclear weapons in Vietnam, and
attacking candidate Kennedy in 1960
"as soft on communism."
Among those protesting was Peter
Keating, Ramparts publisher running
for U.S. Congress. Keating, in an in
terview with the Daily, attacked Yor
ty for being "intellectually dishonest
and a very vicious man. I recommend
that the good mayor change parties.
He is a disgrace to the Democratic
party and for that matter any party,"
Keating stated.
Emotion And Logic
Yorty, addressing an audience of
175, focused on criticism of Governor
Brown's administration and defended
his own political stands.
"I enjoyed the reception," the candi
date said. "I like to see what other
people think and how badly some
people can be fooled about a candi
date's background. It is difficult to
take an unpopular view because peo
ple would rather stick to emotion
than cold logical facts."
The mayor cited several instances
where he appointed Negroes and
members of minority groups to vari
ous commissions. Yorty also said that
reports show that Los Angeles is "the

best city in the United States for Ne
groes. This is why I said criminal
elements are responsible for the
Watts riots."
"We can't afford the 50 per cent on
the War on Poverty plans," Yorty ex
plained. He said furthermore that
Brown withdrew support from the
War on Poverty and"it fell apart."
Brown's Machine
Yorty rapped Governor Brown for
his political machine "which tries to
destroy every Democrat not a part of
the machine" and for several scandals
involving favoritism. He told of a lack
of support for local schools, stating
that there is "too high priority to
higher education, too low priority to
lower education."
Referring to the Delano strike,
Yorty said that "with real leadership,
the problem can be solved. What they
want is justice and decent housing."
The gubernatorial candidate thinks
the U. S. should be permitted to use
its best weapons in Viet Nam. "If the
military wants tactical nuclear weap
ons to destroy a bridge, they should
have them."
Yorty was queried as to possible
support from John Birch Society
members. "How could I have any
part in that group with my liberal
record for 25 years," he answered.


Demonstrators wait for Mayor Sam Yorty to arrive at Dink for his speech
yesterday afternoon. He pulled up in the "Yortywagon"â€”a red, white and blue
replica of a trolley car garnished with a shapely campaign staff. Picketers were
recruited at a noon rally held by the "Stanford Committee for War in
Vietnam," a satirical subsidary of the SCPV, featuring such speakers as Gen
eral Nomoreland, William Randolph Curse, and Professor Dracula of the
