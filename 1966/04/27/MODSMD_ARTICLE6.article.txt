# DAILY REVIEW
## African Journal 'Enjoyable' 
### PAT CRAIG McDERMID 
Joseph O. O. Okpaku, Editor of the
Journal of the New African Litera
ture, has produced a collection of
poetry, short stories, drama and criti
cism which should not be missed.

The critical importance of the col
lection and Mr. Okpaku's introductory
editorial alone are worth the price of
the issue.
Highpoints of the journal are Mr.
Okpaku's play, Born Astride the
Grave, and the poetry of Romanus
Egudu. Mr. Okpaku's character of the
Rev. Sam Powers has several fine mo
ments and much of the dialogue be
tween the two travellers, Bob and
Steve, brings to mind Beckett's Wait
ing for Godot with the characters'
comments on the universal through
bewilderment and misunderstanding
of their immediate environment.
Poetry Lacking
Generally, the poetry in the journal
lacks discipline and clarity. Mr. Egu
du's "The Journey" and "A Snake
Must A Snake Swallow" are excep
tions and by far the most successful
pieces.
The second poem, especially, with
its Yeatsian tones of upheaval and
strife ("They are all a tangle/Each
fending for itself. . . .") vividly re
flects the struggles within contempo
rary Africa and is the single most
impressive piece of writing in the
journal.
The Journal's short stories, "No t
Enough," "Amy's Case", and"The
Hole in the Dark" are only fair. Mr.
Okpaku's "The Hole in the Dark"
reads like the journals of Cotton

Mather and is more obscure than his
play.
Best Story
"Amy's Case," by Lemuel Johnson,
has some fine moments in a generally
familiar theme and stock presenta
tion. Joshua Ndlovu's "Not Enough"
is by far the best of the stories.
Although hampered by a rather self
conscious style, Mr. Ndlovu's effort
has originality and some exciting, ex
perimental elements in it.
Essays
The remainder of the issue contains
an essay by Prof. John Povey of
U.C.L.A. dealing with the more spe
cific issue of changing themes in the
Nigerian novel, a critique of Okpaku's
Born Astride the Grave by Mills un
dergraduate Benedicta Nwozomudo,
an essay on the organization of the
African orchestra by the University
of Chicago's Samuel Akpabot and an
essay of "Future Research in African
Art" by Dr. Daniel Crowley of U.C.
Davis which provides interesting
parallels between artistic and literary
development in Africa.
The journal is a comprehensive and
informative publication on an impor
tant area of the arts. Mr. Okpaku is
to be congratulated for making such
an informative and enjoyable collec
tion available on a subject dealt with
far too infrequently.

The second poem, especially, with
its Yeatsian tones of upheaval and
strife ("They are all a tangle/Each
fending for itself. . . .") vividly re
flects the struggles within contempo
rary Africa and is the single most
impressive piece of writing in the
journal.
The Journal's short stories, "No t
Enough," "Amy's Case", and"The
Hole in the Dark" are only fair. Mr.
Okpaku's "The Hole in the Dark"
reads like the journals of Cotton

Mather and is more obscure than his
play.
Best Story
"Amy's Case," by Lemuel Johnson,
has some fine moments in a generally
familiar theme and stock presenta
tion. Joshua Ndlovu's "Not Enough"
is by far the best of the stories.
Although hampered by a rather self
conscious style, Mr. Ndlovu's effort
has originality and some exciting, ex
perimental elements in it.
Essays
The remainder of the issue contains
an essay by Prof. John Povey of
U.C.L.A. dealing with the more spe
cific issue of changing themes in the
Nigerian novel, a critique of Okpaku's
Born Astride the Grave by Mills un
dergraduate Benedicta Nwozomudo,
an essay on the organization of the
African orchestra by the University
of Chicago's Samuel Akpabot and an
essay of "Future Research in African
Art" by Dr. Daniel Crowley of U.C.
Davis which provides interesting
parallels between artistic and literary
development in Africa.
The journal is a comprehensive and
informative publication on an impor
tant area of the arts. Mr. Okpaku is
to be congratulated for making such
an informative and enjoyable collec
tion available on a subject dealt with
far too infrequently.
Joseph O. O. Okpaku, Editor of the
Journal of the New African Litera
ture, has produced a collection of
poetry, short stories, drama and criti
cism which should not be missed.

The critical importance of the col
lection and Mr. Okpaku's introductory
editorial alone are worth the price of
the issue.
Highpoints of the journal are Mr.
Okpaku's play, Born Astride the
Grave, and the poetry of Romanus
Egudu. Mr. Okpaku's character of the
Rev. Sam Powers has several fine mo
ments and much of the dialogue be
tween the two travellers, Bob and
Steve, brings to mind Beckett's Wait
ing for Godot with the characters'
comments on the universal through
bewilderment and misunderstanding
of their immediate environment.
Poetry Lacking
Generally, the poetry in the journal
lacks discipline and clarity. Mr. Egu
du's "The Journey" and "A Snake
Must A Snake Swallow" are excep
tions and by far the most successful
pieces.
The second poem, especially, with
its Yeatsian tones of upheaval and
strife ("They are all a tangle/Each
fending for itself. . . .") vividly re
flects the struggles within contempo
