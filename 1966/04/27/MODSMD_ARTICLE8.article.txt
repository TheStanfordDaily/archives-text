# ASSU Campaign Reaches Climax
## 
### 
Presidential aspirants Bob Klein and
Dave Harris faced off for the final
time in Branner Hall last night in
preparation for the final ASSU elec
tions today and tomorrow.
With a crowd of about 200 watch
ing, Klein opened the debate by at
tacking Harris' proposal that gradua
tion requirements consist of an accu
mulation of 180 units with all courses
evaluated by an optional pass-fail sys
tem.
Klein called the concept impractical
in that Stanford students would be at
a disadvantage when applying to
graduate schools. He also attacked
Harris' proposal that Trustees be
elected by a "one scholar-one vote"
system.
'Paternalistic'
Calling Harris' attitude toward so
cial regulations "paternalistic", Klein
charged that Harris was trying to im
pose his own standards on Stanford
women.
Harris denied the charge, explain
ing that each woman should have the
right to determine her own existence,
regardless of what the majority of
women at Stanford might think.
Defending the pass-fail system for
all courses, Harris stated that not
having pass-fail in major courses
would force students to declare a ma
jor during their first quarter.
Later, Tim Haight queried Klein on
whether graduate schools would pena
lize Stanford students for not having
letter grades. Klein replied that pass
fail in courses outside the major
would not effect chances for admit
tance to graduate schools.
Majority
"Mr. Klein is not offering us any
thing new, just embellishments on the
present system," continued Harris.
"He is assuming that this system is
right."
Klein claimed that his educational
ideal was very similar to Harris'.
Harris responded, "I don't think our
platforms are the same at all. And I
know because I typed one of them."
He accused Klein of trying to "blend

the best of both worlds," and getting
nothing.
Candidates
The candidates were asked how
they would react if the administra
tion fired a faculty member, under
student protest. "Every time you
lose a good teacher, you are hurting
yourself," said Harris.
Klein responded to the same ques
tion, saying "if we couldn't get the
administration to keep this faculty
member by going through the normal
channels, I would do just what Dave
said he would do. We'd lobby. Then,
if necesary, we'd demonstrate."
