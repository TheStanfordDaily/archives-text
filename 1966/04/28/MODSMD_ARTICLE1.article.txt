# Blum Cites Increase In Student Drug Usage
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
There is no doubt that drugs are
being used more and more on college
campuses, according to Dr. Richard
H. Blum of the Institute for the Study
of Human Problems. "The big ques
tion," he asks, "is why?"
Blum, who recently was appointed a
consultant on dangerous drugs with
the President's Crime Commission,
will speak tonight in Cubberley Audi
torium at 7:30. His talk will include
special films of people under the in
fluence of drugs, and he says he will
take on all student questions concern
ing problems and benefits of drugs in
modern society.
Absence of Facts
"Right now the main problem in
this area of drugs is a remarkable ab
sence of facts," Blum stated in an in
terview with The Dally. "We really
don't know how many are using LSD,
marijuana, barbituates, and combina
tions of these. Nor do we know what
happens to those who do use them."
He noted that the present situation
combines this absence of facts with
expression of some extreme emotion

al feelings and has led to proposed
legislation far too stringent.
As a member of the Food and Drug
Administration's ad hoc committee on

hallucinogenics, consulting criminolo
gist for the San Mateo County Sher
iff's Department, and lecturer at the
Center for Training in Community
Psychiatry, Blum has wide back
ground in medical and legal implica
tions of drug usage. But he confesses
much still needs to be learned.
Increasing Problem
"We know drug usage at colleges
increases from year to year meas
ured even on a crude pound-for-pound
basis," Blum says.
The Stanford researcher has been
asked by the National Institute of
Health to survey drug use on campus
es around the country. The study will
focus on how students use drugs and
what happens in face of various risks.
Some students may wind up in auto
accidents, with psychotic and school
problems, or even in a life of crime.
"Clinical data show some of the be
havior that accompanies drug use,"
Blum said. "But no one knows the
rate." Accidental deaths are quite fre
quent, especially when a person com
bines barbituates with alcohol. "The
bugaboo risk," Blum said, "is becom

ing dependent on a drug. Students es
pecially have the attitude that 'it
can't happen to me,' but they become
hooked often when it is too late to
solve the problem on their own."
Early Research on LSD
Although LSD has received nation
al attention only within the last two
years, Blum has done research on it
for some time. He published a book
"Utopiate" in 1964 on LSD and found
that the drug was then confined to
professors, professional men in psy
chology, and some "creative types."
Since then he notes LSD has become
quite widespread. "This increased dis
tribution, like any ceremony that be
comes secularized, has led to greater
behavior variability," Blum said. "We
now have a wide range of results rang
ing from very good to extremely haz
ardous."
Blum noted very few cultures around
the world do not use drugs of some
type and numerous cross-culture sur
veys are now being conducted.
No Longer Absolute
"In the United States," he com
ments, "we have rejected the old ab

solutist standard 'Thou shalt not use
pot' but have not established an ac
ceptable code to replace this prohibi
tion.
"Students will have to set standards
for themselves on this issue. They will
have to answer the basic questions:
when, where, and how much." Blum
feels students, who have long desired
setting their own rules, have a re
markable opportunity to take action
in an area where there is a clear need
for concensus.
Blum said he personally would like
to see laws quite different from the
ones now on the books. "We have a
lot of stopgap measures in effect," he
said. "But the laws on marijuana are
too strict for what is being regulated.
On the other hand, laws on alcohol are
probably too lenient if we truly want
to save lives."
Second In Scries
Tonight's speech is co-sponsored by
the Stanford Today and Tomorrow
Committee and the Dean of Students
office. It is the second in a series of
three lecture-discussions on personal
behavior.

According to Associate Dean Joel
Smith, it is believed that "Stanford
students should be fully informed
about the consequences which may
attend the use of drugs. The health
risks of some drugs are well docu
mented. In addition, there are ex
tremely severe legal penalties which
must be taken seriously."
Smith noted under California law,
the mere possession of marijuana is
a crime punishable, as a first offense,
with a sentence from one to ten years.
Subsequent offenses carry more se
vere penalties.
Face Realities
"While it can be argued that such
laws are punitive and unwise," the
Dean said, "we must face the reality
that the laws exist and are enforced.
It is hoped this program will mark the
beginning of an effort by the entire
Stanford community to develop a re
sponsible and practical ethic regard
ing a problem which demands our at
tention."
The last speech in the series is sched
uled for May 18, when Dr. John Rule
of M.I.T. will discuss student prob
lems in sexual relations.
