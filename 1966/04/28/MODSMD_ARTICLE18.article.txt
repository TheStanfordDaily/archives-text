# Cricket Team Beats Monte In Last Over
## 
### 
Stanford's champion cricket team added a third win to their per
fect record Sunday in Carmel when they edged the Del Monte Crick
et Club with 74 for 9 wickets to 73.
Good cricket was hindered by a dangerously uneven bowling strip
which, in view of cricket's style of bouncing the ball to the batsman,
rendered the pitches unpredictable.

The Stanford squad was further
handicapped by the absence of 6
of the eleven regulars.
Poor pitching conditions kept
the scoring low, and extremely
close with Stanford's winning
run batted by the last man.
It was slow going in Del Mon*
te's inning at bat. Stanford's all
rounder Mike O'Meara bowled
tightly while teammate Andrew
Ma did the damage to Monte's
wickets. The Montes were kept
to 73 runs with all batsmen out.
Stanford's batting was justifi
ably under par. Dhanjoo Ghista,
batting first, showed the best
form and led the team tally with
33 runs.
The last two Stanford runs
came on a missed blocked ball—
meaning the pitch was deflected
from the wickets by the bats
man and missed by the fielder—
and a bye—similar to a steal in
baseball with the catcher behind
the wickets missing the bowled
ball.
Stanford's eleven will meet the
Golden Gate Cricket Club this
Sunday at noon in Tilden Park
in the hopes of extending their
winning skein. Most of the reg
ulars will be back in action for
this match.
At the same time the newly
formed second side of the Crick
et Club will be playing a practice
match at home on the Intramu
ral field against a very strong
Marin County Cricket Club
eleven.
