From the perspective of a sabbatical retreat, I
am prompted by the provocative essays of Jona
than Ketchum and others to forward a few notes
on what might be wrong with academic life at
Stanford.
Perhaps the real reason for the feeling of alie
nation between the fine faculty and the talented
student body (beyond the normal distance be
tween generations) lies not so much with ques
tions of research-versus-teaching as with a basic
imbalance and sentimentality in the prevailing
educational tone of Stanford.
European Example
By contrast, let me illustrate with a European
example: despite a certain lagging provinciality
and exclusiveness in French higher education,
on the whole the bright youth there have enjoyed
an inestimable advantage in the discipline, the
molding resistance provided by tough-mindedness.
There is a better balance between past and pres
ent, tradition and modernity, rigidity and flexi
bility.
One who has been through a long and difficult
apprenticeship—which will often appear to the
young as stifling routine, largely because all such
culturally-shaping forces go in part against the
his own civilized expression.
Moreover, the latter is not that dubious entity
"self-expression" but, like all enduring achieve
ment, a higher synthesis of self and other, of in
natural grain—emerges with a greater zest for
stinct and craft.
Rewards of Zest
Similarly, during the apprenticeship, there are
evolving rewards of zestful appreciation if the
"latest thing" is read under the table, so to
speak, with the classroom emphasis remaining
more dutiful.
This helps to explain why France continues to
produce far beyond its share of original artists
and thinkers in all domains. Their appetite for in
ventiveness and things of the mind has not been
dulled by a "progressive" and permissive modish
ness.
Students here may be immediately stimulated
by the "new wave" of this or that art or branch
of the humanities, but then what happens? They
are prematurely sophisticated, know all the re
cent answers and tend later (or as soon as school
is out) to abandon the symbolic realms of knowl
edge for the unvitiated challenges of life.
Anti-Intellectual Process
It is perhaps not too surprising, then, to learn
from the Sanford-Katz researches that the anti
intellectual process begins long before graduation
and that the majority of students considers social
activity to be the most meaningful aspect of
their experience at Stanford.
They are even encouraged in this abdication by
latterday Rousseauists, among professional edu
cators, e.g. Paul Goodman. Like the overly-indul
gent parent who himself has made it the hard
way, Goodman—who obviously managed to get a
good education somehow—ought to be resented,

not as an "academic kook" (as he calls himself)
but as a condescending "slob".
By the same token, it is a mistake for a uni
versity to be in the business of sending students
abroad.
Naturally, travelling and studying abroad are
good things in themselves, but it is a matter of
timing, of the delicate but all-important balance
we mentioned earlier. Like the "latest thing" read
outside of class, this is better left to the student's
own initiative and is more meaningful after a
sober program of undergraduate work.
Perhaps some office on campus could assist in
an informal way with information, arranging
chartered flights, even grants.
But, on the whole, this is dessert; it should
come after solid fare, when one has earned it.
Or it can be sneaked in between meals by the des
perate, for example during summer holidays,
with no illusions about where the real tasks lie.
'No Substitute'
To quote that committee sent by an interna
tional study organization to investigate the pro
grams abroad: "Osmosis is no substitute for edu
cation" (reported in Time).
And then there is the dangerous mess of trying
to keep a university going, let alone a genuine
esprit de corps; with its faculty scattered. This
has become something of a scandal —ask the grad
uate students whose dissertations are being "di
rected" by the faculty phantasmagoria.
The danger to the basic academic work be
comes further apparent when we read an admin
istrative report which gives precedence for this
kind of absence over serious research leaves.
Moreover, the faculty shows increasing signs of
substituting a taste for travel and "foreign ex
perience" for reading and thinking "in a room."
Not that we ought to make a scapegoat of the
campuses abroad; they are merely mild symp
toms of a deeper disorder.
Mitigating: Alienation
In sum, the only way to mitigate the aliena
tion of the "new generation," which faculty is al
ways musing about—or of enough of the young
to perpetuate a great tradition—is by challenging
them to become the (special) kind of men we are,
or are supposed to be, or once were.
Of course they will rebel, but that kind of re
bellion trying to outdo the older generation—is
gratifying. It is poles apart from alienation.
As Maurois remarked of Hugo's wife, she
feared not infidelity but repudiation. Have you
noticed the way intelligent Frenchmen speak of
their schools? Much the way they speak of mar
riage. The simile is definitely not repudiation. As
Richard Wilbur puts it: "O sweet frustrations,
I'll be back for more."
★ ★ ★
It may be objected that the French approach
can only work in a certain context of tradition
ahd national custom; that it would have to be
"airtight" or else the temptation to go elsewhere
would be strong; that the tightening ought to
begin in the earlier school years; etc. True, to a
point. But we have to start somewhere and at
least with an awareness of the true nature of
our problem.
