## Student To Supply Impetus For New Social Changes 
### Randolf Bonner 
It is my belief that Dr. Mc-
Donough's article, because of its
content and the proximity of
this content to the upcoming
ASSU presidential election, is in
dire need of critical examination.
The crux of his argument—
and his understanding of the
university—seems to be the ba
sic belief that the university is
"essentially an educational en
terprise." Consequentially, the
student's role should not be oth
er than that of the consumer's.
He is free to shop elsewhere if
he is dissatisfied, with the ser
vice, but he should not be so
presumptuous and unreasonable
as to want to take part in the
decision making processes.
It is only good business for
the "enterprise" to maintain a
good relationship with the non
voting stock holder, and to this
end occasional conferences
should be held so as to sound out
the feelings of said stockholder
on various issues which pertain
to him.
Wide Base Impractical
Dr. McDonough looks to "so
ciety at large" for a model of
the way in which "the power to
make various kinds of legally
binding decisions, whether legis
lative, administrative or judicial,
is delegated to relatively few en
tities."
I would suggest that the rea
son for this is not due to an in
herent superiority of the "few
entities" but rather to the im
practicality of a wider base of
policy formulators in a country
of the size of ours. The univer
sity is a small enough communi
ty to render viable a much
broader based, more democratic
participation.
Dr. McDonough goes on to
speak of the way in which these
decision-makers are required by
law to consult with those whom
their decisions will effect, prior
to the actual decision making.
What he does not seem to real
ize is that these bodies are an
swerable to their constituents
for their decisions. The situa
tion Dr. McDonough speaks of
at the university is therefore
not analagous to the situation
of "society at large." Students
do not choose their administra
tors, nor is there provision for
recall.
What then, are the premises
of his views on the students
role at the university?
Responsibilities
I have no doubt that Dr. Mc-
Donough would agree with me
in saying that the university has
a responsibility to both student,
by way of making an education
available to him, and to "society
at large," by way of providing
it with responsible and capable
citizens. I do not think he would
agree with me in my feelings as
to the effectiveness of Stanford
in living up to these two respon
sibilities today.
Stanford fails in enabling the
student to provide himself with
a valuable and pertinent educa
tion, and this being the case,
Stanford cannot hope to provide
"society at large" with useful
citizens.

Many of the reasons that edu
cation is not working at Stan
ford are the fault of our culture
for the sorts of goals and values
it provides us with. But the uni
versity is in a position to be able
to counteract these forces, rather
than to reenforce them, if it
could but see fit to.
Dean Wert recognizes this
problem when he speaks of ex
ploring "new approaches to
grading, intended to shift the
emphasis from GPA to learn
ing." (Stanford Today, Winter
1966) When education empha
sizes short • term quick-recall
rather than assimilation and
synthesis one might well won
der at the ability of an "edu
cated" man to cope with a new
problem.
This lack of ability might
tend to weigh heavily upon a na
tion in times such as these and
those of tomorrow.
It is for this reason that I
feel Stanford is not living up to
its role in the national commu
nity. I do not feel that the type
of training we, as students, are
subjected to acts to stimulate
the kind of self • sufficient
thought that is going to be neces
sary for survival in the present
day world. It may have sufficed
for yesterday, but it will not do
for tomorrow.
Dr. McDonough seems to feel
that the fact that the student is
an undergraduate for only a
short time causes him to tend
to overestimate the importance
of his problems. I would suggest
that it is exactly to the contrary.
I fear that because of its se
cure position in the university
the administration tends to lose
its understanding for the immi
nence of some of the problems
at hand.
Furthermore, the fact that the
student is in attendance for
only four years is of no real con
sequence. He must live with his
education for a lifetime, and by
the same token, he is expected
to support the university by way
of alumni contributions for the
rest of his life.
But more important, society
must live with him for a life
time.
Since the fabric of today's so
ciety has shown itself too stag
nant to cope with the problems
of today, I can see little hope
that it can sufficiently renovate
itself to the extent necessary to
cope with the problems of to
morrow unless it is able to gain
some sort of new perspective.
This impetus must be supplied
by the student who, as he is not
yet fully assimilated into "socie
ty at large," is best able to make
a critical appraisal.
That such change will have to
come about in our society is in
evitable. The question now per
tains to the smoothness of tran
sition. In order that change (evo
lution, if that is preferable) at
the national level can be a
smooth and relatively painless
process, it is necessary that the
student of today be capable. As
I have tried to show, capability
is not fostered by an "educa
tional enterprise" such as ours.
