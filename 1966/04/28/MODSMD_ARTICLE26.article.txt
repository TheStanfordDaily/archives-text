# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 'Bigotry' And Support Of Klein 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of a "democrat
ic" student body, I was complete
ly taken aback by the bigotry
of yesterday's Daily Editorial
page. I believe that each of us,
no matter where he stands,
should have been outraged at
this political indecency. The
Daily is a campus representa
tive newspaper and should be
published as such. But this in it
self is not the point of this let
ter.
I am worried—worried firstly
as a student, and not now as a
member of a fraternity. Grant
ed, Dave Harris has ideas, is
different, may offer a "new rev
olution." He may rebel; he may
strike; he may stir things up.
This approach appeals greatly to
the ideal-seeking Stanford mind.
I admit that even I feel a cer
tain flutter in my stomach as I
hear these ideas.
But then I step back. I look
at this situation with what I
hope to be a certain amount of
objectivity — I take a "second
look." I look in retrospect at
the new women's social regula
tions, the recently passed liquor
policy, the Freshmen Creative

Seminar Program, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education
—I look at these and other moves
and say to myself "How can we
rebel against an administration
which has made these types of
efforts?" If we had been denied
our wishes, I could see it. How
ever, I feel we have friends in
the administration, friends which
we should not back into a cor
ner, friends which we should not
put on the spot. I must agree
with Bob Klein's platform of co
operation rather than that plat
form of confrontation and rebel
lion which Dave Harris puts
forth.
Until our present channels
are closed, my instinct says that
we continue with them. Nobody
likes to stab his friends in the
back; our culture says "no." I
say "no" also. I urge you to
look objectively at our situation
and what is needed . . . and
then vote for the logical choice,
Bob Klein.

(Editor's note: Mr. McCarthy
is entitled to his views on the
ASSU presidential race, but his
charge of "bigotry" on The
Daily's editorial page, which we

assume to mean a lack of bal
ance, is deserving' of an answer.
The fact that no letters in
support of Mr. Klein appeared
on the page Wednesday was sim
ply because The Daily received
no letters In support of Mr.
Klein as of press time Tuesday
night. In fact, the letter above,
which was received last night, is,
with the exception of the letter
of Martin Gerry and Jim John
ston which appeared Tuesday,
the only one in support of Mr.
Klein which has been received.
Thus, it would appear that it is
Stanford's 1e 11 e r-to-the-editor
writers who are "bigoted." And
if expression of opinion Ls "big
otry," then something is dras
tically wrong—somewhere.
In regard to the fact that two
columns favoring Mr. Harris ap
peared, as opposed to one for Mr.
Klein: The Daily's editorial board
decided before the primary last
week that written columns in
support of one candidate or an
other be restricted to members
of the board, senior staff mem
bers, and regular columnists.
The columns by Mike Couzens
and Tim Halght, who are both
regular Daily columnists and as

well are campaign managers re
spectively for Mr. Klein and Mr.
Harris, were solicited two or
three days in advance in order
to insure that each candidate
would be represented in column
forfnat on the page. The column
by ex-Editor Leopold was volun
teered, and was printed because
he did not write a column for
the forum editorial page which
appeared April 20, the first day
of the primary elections. No oth
er columns from eligible writers
—or for that matter, from ineli
gible writers — were received.

Editor, The Dally:
Tuesday night around 1:00
a.m. we were putting banners on
automobiles for Bob Klein and
Jan Jacobi. We caught two van
dais removing a sign. They
claimed that it was the only one
they had touched but we later
discovered they had removed
three signs.
One of them was Sandy Mac
kenzie. The other was Bill Hem
berger, a member of the Elec
tions Board which makes rulings

on violations of campaign prac
tices (Mackenzie's appointee and
one of his campaign managers
a year ago).
We question the ethics of these
gentlemen, since no ruling had
been made concerning the legal
ity of our posters. Either they
took it upon themselves to pre
sume us guilty or, more likely,
they were a self-appointed RF
committee. At any rate, it
shows the spirit in which their
endorsement of the other candi
date should be read.
It also seems to us a fitting
climax for the Mackenzie admin
istration, as it reacts in a last
spasm to its detractors.

olution." He may rebel; he may
strike; he may stir things up.
This approach appeals greatly to
the ideal-seeking Stanford mind.
I admit that even I feel a cer
tain flutter in my stomach as I
hear these ideas.
But then I step back. I look
at this situation with what I
hope to be a certain amount of
objectivity — I take a "second
look." I look in retrospect at
the new women's social regula
tions, the recently passed liquor
policy, the Freshmen Creative

Seminar Program, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education
—I look at these and other moves
and say to myself "How can we
rebel against an administration
which has made these types of
efforts?" If we had been denied
our wishes, I could see it. How
ever, I feel we have friends in
the administration, friends which
we should not back into a cor
ner, friends which we should not
put on the spot. I must agree
with Bob Klein's platform of co
operation rather than that plat
form of confrontation and rebel
lion which Dave Harris puts
forth.
Until our present channels
are closed, my instinct says that
we continue with them. Nobody
likes to stab his friends in the
back; our culture says "no." I
say "no" also. I urge you to
look objectively at our situation
and what is needed . . . and
then vote for the logical choice,
Bob Klein.

(Editor's note: Mr. McCarthy
is entitled to his views on the
ASSU presidential race, but his
charge of "bigotry" on The
Daily's editorial page, which we

assume to mean a lack of bal
ance, is deserving' of an answer.
The fact that no letters in
support of Mr. Klein appeared
on the page Wednesday was sim
ply because The Daily received
no letters In support of Mr.
Klein as of press time Tuesday
night. In fact, the letter above,
which was received last night, is,
with the exception of the letter
of Martin Gerry and Jim John
ston which appeared Tuesday,
the only one in support of Mr.
Klein which has been received.
Thus, it would appear that it is
Stanford's 1e 11 e r-to-the-editor
writers who are "bigoted." And
if expression of opinion Ls "big
otry," then something is dras
tically wrong—somewhere.
In regard to the fact that two
columns favoring Mr. Harris ap
peared, as opposed to one for Mr.
Klein: The Daily's editorial board
decided before the primary last
week that written columns in
support of one candidate or an
other be restricted to members
of the board, senior staff mem
bers, and regular columnists.
The columns by Mike Couzens
and Tim Halght, who are both
regular Daily columnists and as

well are campaign managers re
spectively for Mr. Klein and Mr.
Harris, were solicited two or
three days in advance in order
to insure that each candidate
would be represented in column
forfnat on the page. The column
by ex-Editor Leopold was volun
teered, and was printed because
he did not write a column for
the forum editorial page which
appeared April 20, the first day
of the primary elections. No oth
er columns from eligible writers
—or for that matter, from ineli
gible writers — were received.

Tuesday night around 1:00
a.m. we were putting banners on
automobiles for Bob Klein and
Jan Jacobi. We caught two van
dais removing a sign. They
claimed that it was the only one
they had touched but we later
discovered they had removed
three signs.
One of them was Sandy Mac
kenzie. The other was Bill Hem
berger, a member of the Elec
tions Board which makes rulings

on violations of campaign prac
tices (Mackenzie's appointee and
one of his campaign managers
a year ago).
We question the ethics of these
gentlemen, since no ruling had
been made concerning the legal
ity of our posters. Either they
took it upon themselves to pre
sume us guilty or, more likely,
they were a self-appointed RF
committee. At any rate, it
shows the spirit in which their
endorsement of the other candi
date should be read.
It also seems to us a fitting
climax for the Mackenzie admin
istration, as it reacts in a last
spasm to its detractors.

of yesterday's Daily Editorial

rebel against an administration
which has made these types of
efforts?" If we had been denied
our wishes, I could see it. How
ever, I feel we have friends in
the administration, friends which
we should not back into a cor
ner, friends which we should not
put on the spot. I must agree
with Bob Klein's platform of co
operation rather than that plat
form of confrontation and rebel
lion which Dave Harris puts
forth.
Until our present channels
are closed, my instinct says that
we continue with them. Nobody
likes to stab his friends in the
back; our culture says "no." I
say "no" also. I urge you to
look objectively at our situation
and what is needed . . . and
then vote for the logical choice,
Bob Klein.

(Editor's note: Mr. McCarthy
is entitled to his views on the
ASSU presidential race, but his
charge of "bigotry" on The
Daily's editorial page, which we

assume to mean a lack of bal
ance, is deserving' of an answer.
The fact that no letters in
support of Mr. Klein appeared
on the page Wednesday was sim
ply because The Daily received
no letters In support of Mr.
Klein as of press time Tuesday
night. In fact, the letter above,
which was received last night, is,
with the exception of the letter
of Martin Gerry and Jim John
ston which appeared Tuesday,
the only one in support of Mr.
Klein which has been received.
Thus, it would appear that it is
Stanford's 1e 11 e r-to-the-editor
writers who are "bigoted." And
if expression of opinion Ls "big
otry," then something is dras
tically wrong—somewhere.
In regard to the fact that two
columns favoring Mr. Harris ap
peared, as opposed to one for Mr.
Klein: The Daily's editorial board
decided before the primary last
week that written columns in
support of one candidate or an
other be restricted to members
of the board, senior staff mem
bers, and regular columnists.
The columns by Mike Couzens
and Tim Halght, who are both
regular Daily columnists and as

well are campaign managers re
spectively for Mr. Klein and Mr.
Harris, were solicited two or
three days in advance in order
to insure that each candidate
would be represented in column
forfnat on the page. The column
by ex-Editor Leopold was volun
teered, and was printed because
he did not write a column for
the forum editorial page which
appeared April 20, the first day
of the primary elections. No oth
er columns from eligible writers
—or for that matter, from ineli
gible writers — were received.

Editor, The Dally:
Tuesday night around 1:00
a.m. we were putting banners on
automobiles for Bob Klein and
Jan Jacobi. We caught two van
dais removing a sign. They
claimed that it was the only one
they had touched but we later
discovered they had removed
three signs.
One of them was Sandy Mac
kenzie. The other was Bill Hem
berger, a member of the Elec
tions Board which makes rulings

on violations of campaign prac
tices (Mackenzie's appointee and
one of his campaign managers
a year ago).
We question the ethics of these
gentlemen, since no ruling had
been made concerning the legal
ity of our posters. Either they
took it upon themselves to pre
sume us guilty or, more likely,
they were a self-appointed RF
committee. At any rate, it
shows the spirit in which their
endorsement of the other candi
date should be read.
It also seems to us a fitting
climax for the Mackenzie admin
istration, as it reacts in a last
spasm to its detractors.

Editor, The Daily:
As a member of a "democrat
ic" student body, I was complete
ly taken aback by the bigotry
of yesterday's Daily Editorial
page. I believe that each of us,
no matter where he stands,
should have been outraged at
this political indecency. The
Daily is a campus representa
tive newspaper and should be
published as such. But this in it
self is not the point of this let
ter.
I am worried—worried firstly
as a student, and not now as a
member of a fraternity. Grant
ed, Dave Harris has ideas, is
different, may offer a "new rev
olution." He may rebel; he may
strike; he may stir things up.
This approach appeals greatly to
the ideal-seeking Stanford mind.
I admit that even I feel a cer
tain flutter in my stomach as I
hear these ideas.
But then I step back. I look
at this situation with what I
hope to be a certain amount of
objectivity — I take a "second
look." I look in retrospect at
the new women's social regula
tions, the recently passed liquor
policy, the Freshmen Creative

Seminar Program, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education
