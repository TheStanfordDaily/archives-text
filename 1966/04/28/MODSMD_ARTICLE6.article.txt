# Voters Shatter Past Records
## Say 'Ah' 
### JAN WELLS 
A record 2933 students cast ballots
in the first day of the election between
Bob Klein and Dave Harris for the
ASSU presidency yesterday.
The total, which includes results
from all foreign campuses except
Italy, exceeds the previous first-day
high of 2593 votes cast in the final
election of May, 1955.
No Car Posters
Candidate Klein has been deprived
of the privilege of displaying any pos
ters on any cars today as a result of
a ruling by Elections Commissioner
Roger Bounds. The ruling was upheld
by the Commission's Violations Sub
committee last night.
Bounds' ruling came after "Klein-
Jacobi" posters exceeding the maxi
mum size of 14 inches by 22 inches
were found on several cars on cam
pus early yesterday morning.
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
and Elections Commission member
Bill Hemberger removed several of
the signs shortly after they had been
posted.
Supporters of Klein claimed that
there was doubt as to the illegality
of the signs.
Legul Headquarters
At its meeting last night, the Vio
lations Subcommittee also overruled
a decision of the Election Commis
sioner that the location of Carl
Schmidt's campaign headquarters vio
lated the electioneering rules, on the
grounds that the rules were not
sufficiently explicit in this area.
An addendum concerning headquar
ters location will be placed in the
rules for future elections.
Voting will continue today at the
Post Office, Engineering Corner and
Tresidder from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the

Main Library and Physics Tank from
10 a.m. to noon; and at History Cor
ner from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
All graduate students and under
graduates are eligible to vote in the
election.
The election commission announced
that a total of 3163 votes were cast in
the primary elections last Wednesday
and Thursday.
Another Record?
If as many as 1061 voters turn out
to the polls today, the all-time record
for the total number of ballots cast in
either a primary or final election will
be broken.
The current record was set in 1955
when 3993 votes were cast in the elec
tion finals. The largest vote since that
time occured in 1962 when graduate
student Armin Rosencranz rode the
crest of a 3604-voter turnout into the
ASSU presidency.
In the primary elections last week,
Harris lead a field of eight candidates
with 846 votes. He was followed by
Klein with 784; Schmidt and Kit An
derton with 743; Bob Fellmeth and
David Bell, 367; Martin Gerry and Jim
Johnston, 179; Steve Ketchel and Don
Hemovich, 110; Bob Stone and Mindy
Mathison, 87; and Donald Bremme and
Ed Kaufman, 41.
Write-in candidates and unmarked
ballots accounted for another 157 bal
lots.
Klein, of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra
ternity, is running with junior Jan
Jacobi.
Harris is a sponsor in Wilbur Hall.
His vice-presidential partner is senior
Mike Collins.
