"Building 1000 latrines—or 100,000
—will not solve the problems of La
tin America," said Professor John J.
Johnson of the history department at
a Peace Corps panel discussion last
night.
Johnson, in discussing the actual
and potential impact of the Peace
Corps upon Latin American prob
lems, agreed that the area is ma
terially underdeveloped rather than
culturally lagging, but emphasized
inefficient use of available resources
as the major problem.
Untrained Bureaucrast
"The bureaucrats are untrained for
contemporary problems," said John
son, "they consider serving in an iso
lated village as bad as exile." He ar
gued that meaningful reforms will
not come about until the bureaucracy
itself is reformed.
Peace Corps Volunteer Paul Dillon,
returning from a Chilean island,
agreed that bureaucrats were often
j inefficient, but praised the local farm
' agent in his village. He explained that
white collar workers do not expect to
get their hands dirty.
Johnson believes that Peace Corps
men can help break down the bureau
acracy, by "getting their hands dirty."
Another problem has been the lack
of capital for loans to small business
men and farmers| It has been esti
mated that 20 percent of agricultural
products are lost thorugh waste, par
ticularly inadequate storage facilities.
Misuse Of Unman Resources
Nancy Laws, who worked with an
educational television project in Col
ombia, emphasized the misuse of hu
man resources.
In Colombia, for example, the 2 po
litical parties rotate in office. This
means a complete changeover in the
bureaucracy with every election.
More important, local villages dis
trust the national government. "The
national government may have teach
ing resource materials in the capital
city, but the local people will not take
the initiative to go to the capital to
get them," she pointed out.
Maury Sterns, involved in a Peace
Corps project to teach English at the
University of Zulia in the oil-produc
ing area of Venezuela, emphasized the
impact of informal contact."
Migel Casas Armengol, Dean of the
Faculty of Architecture of the Uni
versity of Zulia, commented that
Peace Corps volunteers created a bet
ter impression than the oil workers

"who could only drink a lot of whis
key, and never cared for contacts with
the Venezuelan culture."
He added that American diplomats
tend to communicate only with high
of the social elite, while the language
and cultural barriers of the oil work
ers have produced resentment. Only
Peace Corps volunteers reach all sociol
levels.
