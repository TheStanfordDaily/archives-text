# New Crisis For Cal Administators
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
Another student-administration con
flict is brewing at Cal this week, but
this one has nothing to do with the
war in Vietnam.
The conflict is expected to arise
over a referendum in which the Cal
student body is being asked to ratify
a new constitution for their student
government.
The new constitution is the work
of 60 student delegates who were
elected last November.
The conflict is evolving over the
fact that, under existing regulations,
the new constitution cannot go into
effect if ratified.
The Board of Regents of the State
of California has given the Chancellor
at Cal, Roger W. Heyns, ultimate re
sponsibility for two areas of student
government which the new constitu
tion would seek to change.
The administration believes that ul

timate authority must remain with
the Chancellor or "the chain of re
sponsibilities in the complex statewide
university system will break down."
Student liberals are quick to condemn
this attitude as indicative of a belief
in "sandbox" student government
which they feel is passe.
The two points of conflict deal
with those parts of the new constitu
tion which would create a new stu
dent government giving the students
"a preponderant voice in decisions on
rules governing student activities,"
both areas currently under the chan
cellor's jurisdiction.
There is an expressed middle view
on the debate which is held by many
students at Cal. According to Mike
Tigar, Editor of the California Law
Review, "The administration of Chan
cellor Heyns is progressive, but the
university still treats its students as
somehow less than people."
