# Harris Defeats Klein
## The 						President-Elect— Voice Of 'Radicalism' 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Managing Editor 
David Victor Harris personifies the
campus radical of his day .
For him this label has a particular
meaning.
"Yes, I'm a radical," the newly
elected ASSU president says, "in the
sense that radical means getting to
the roots of things."
That's why he entered the presi
dential race.
"Originally," he says, "We ruled out
the idea of winning. Our intention was
to make the rest of the candidates
speak to the important issues."
And in the process Harris has estab
lished himself as the symbol of stu
dent "radicalism" at Stanford—the
leader of the current surge of protest
and reform. He could hardly be seen
otherwise.
A "moderate democrat" when he
came to Stanford from a Fresno high
school, where he played center and
linebacker on the football team and
won state laurels as a debater, he
soon experienced a metamorphosis.
"I reached a position where I had to
think of things in my own terms and
I found the terms society had supplied
me with for years were far from my
own," he remarks in his clipped voice
that suggests the melodious Senator
Everett Dirksen.
But Harris's image is not one of a
politician.
Typically, he wears a wrinkled white
shirt, open wide at the neck, under
neath a blue sports coat, tan mocas
sins without socks, bluejeans and gold,
wire-rimmed prescription spectacles.
His hair, beatnik-style and straw
colored, crowns his neck, and he has
a moustache which he gre& when he
got tired of looking at himself in the
mirror.
"I enjoy having long hair," he
quips. "It is nice to run your hands
through. I dress as I do because it is
the most comfortable."
Harris's radicalism, however, goes
deeper than his appearance; it goes
perhaps to his roots.
Artistic Socialist
Calling himself an "artistic social
ist," he lists as his heroes Staughton
Lynd, Bob Moses, and Norman
Thomas. He took time off from school
fall quarter of last year to work for
civil rights in Mississippi, and he in
tends to apply for conscientious ob

jector status when he graduates from
Stanford.
"I do believe American society is
sick," he says. "Individuals within the
society have stopped looking at them
selves and the rest of humanity and
considering themselves in relation to
that."
He includes himself among the "un
derground education" at Stanford,
which he feels is "shallow and seg
mented."
Paternal Attitudes
A social thought major and Wilbur
sponsor—he was actively involved in
the controversy this year over sponsor
selection—he perceives a "paternal at
titude" in most administrators that
makes them unsympathetic to student
demands to be treated as equals.
"Virtually all of them are staid, and
their thoughts about education have
stagnated in their own perspective,"
he states.
Harris shares the tenacious com
mitment of the student radical to re
form and is willing to use to
achieve it.
"One begins with the obligation of
approaching administrators and ask
ing them to work with us in building
a better model of education, and if
that's impossible due to their ap
proach to both students and educa
tion, then one has the obligation to
push them into a position of openness
so that a meaningful change can take
place."
He denies that he adheres to a nega
tive philosophy or that he is rebelling
against authority for its own sake.
Rather, he speaks in terms of models
which he proposes as something to
work towards.
"When one gets involved in social
criticism, there is always the danger
of becoming negative," he admits,
"But I think the first step to affirma
tion is negation."
Pleased With Campaign
Sucking on a cigarette (Harris
smokes two packs a day but does not
worry about lung cancer since he has
so much else to worry about), he
commented on the success of his cam
paign:
"I guess Stanford students wanted
some kind of a figure to weld their
dissent around."
The figure they chose was a com
mitted and unorthodox individual—
one David Victor Harris.
