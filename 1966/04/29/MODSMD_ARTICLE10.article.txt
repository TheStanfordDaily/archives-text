# SDS Conducts Test

### 
CHICAGO (CPS) â€” Students
for a Democratic Society is plan
ning a nationwide distribution of
literature and a "counter draft
test" on each of the three dates
the Selective Service System has
chosen for its examination for
college students.
SDS National Secretary Paul
Booth estimated that two-and
one-half million students will
take the Selective Service exami
nation "because they don't want
to go to Vietnam." The results
from the tests will be used by
local draftboards to help deter
mine college deferments.
Chief among the material SDS
hopes to distribute at all of the
test sites is a two-page "examina
tion" on the war in Vietnam.
The leaflet will contain factual
questions about the war; an
swers will be included at the

bottom of the second page,
Booth said.
On another matter, Booth said
the promised FBI investigation
of his organization seems to be
underway.
Attorney General Nicholas
Katzenbach told a Chicago news
conference last October that
SDS was among groups figuring
in a Justice Department investi
gation into the anti-draft move
ment.
