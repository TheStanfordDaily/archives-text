# Critics Rave, Box Office Suffers
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
There are some very exciting
things going on at the Little
Theater through this Saturday.
The things in question are
three student-written, -produced
and -directed one-act plays, name
ly "The Coin," by Frale Leyph
(who turns out to be Ralph Lid
die and Lesley Crosten), direct
ed by Miss Crosten; "The Ful
fillment," written and directed
by Sheldon Feldner, and"The
Epitaph," written and directed
by Liddle.
No one, of course, will attend
these student productions ex
pecting professional, finished
theater (though "The Fulfill
ment" is not far away). But the
degree of polish and sophistica
tion, of the first two plays espe
cially, is surprising, gratifying,
and well worth postponing a
flick or keg party to observe.
In Absurdest Tradition
"The Coin" is more or less in
the absurdist tradition. On one
half of the stage, a Workman
(played by Liddle—there is not
much he hasn't a finger in in
these productions) wades phren
etically through a sea of paper,
folding and tearing the pieces in
an effort to devise a way to at
tain "The Fish," which, we are
to assume, represents some kind
of cosmic order or intelligence,
a higher state.
On the other half, a Sleeper
(Manny Freedman) rises each
day (or time segment) because
a light forces him to, fits all
distractions provided by the
Worker into the impersonal Pat
tern, and scoffs at the Worker's
ludicrous energy.
The script is the most impres
sive part of the play; it is gen
uinely funny, and the symbol
ism, although not overwhelm
ingly complex, is effective and
thought-provoking. Miss Cros
ten's direction is crisp, her pac
ing almost exactly right. Need
less to say, she has a nice grasp
of the author's intentions.
Liddle, a relative newcomer to
all the facets of drama in which
he is currently involved, has
made Seven - League - Boot - type
strides in all of them. He has
farthest to go as an actor; in
emotional moments, his delivery
is forced and breathy, giving
him an unfelicitous little boy
quality, and he tends to indicate

the feeling he is supposed to
convey, rather than evoking the
audience's belief that he does
indeed feel it. His comic timing,
though, is very subtle.
Freedman is a strong actor;
he relies on that strength rather
than inner conviction in "The
Coin," and falls back on funny
but facile comedic gestures and
intonations when he misses what
he is trying for emotionally.
Which is not to say that his per
formance is not good. Rather,
it is very good in spots, and that
quality points up the sloppiness
elsewhere. This is especially evi
dent at the climax of the play,
when he suspects the Workman
may have actually found The
Fish. This should be, in a comic
way, a terrifying moment. It is
only comic.
Feldner's play is superb. That
is an unqualified and unreserved
adjective. There is poetry in it
worth several times the price of
admission: rich, sensuous ima
gery that works its way into the
audience's innards and continues
to writhe there throughout the
evening.
The play is in the Noh tradi
tion of Japanese theater. It is
composed of two long solilo
quies, the first by a man who
has promised to kill the husband
of the woman he loves—the love
is sullied by fear and disgust at
his own weakness and carnality
—and the second by the woman,
who feels only contempt for her
self and the lover.
Chris Wilson Compelling-
Chris Wilson, as the lover,
gives a strong and compelling
performance. Emotionally, he is
always exactly right. He occa
sionally rushes his lines, and in
the process throws away too
much of the poetry. Further, his
performance should be slightly
more stylized; there is a shade
too much realism for a play
with as great a ritual content.
He is, nonetheless, eminently
convincing.
Barbara Epmeier, as his lover,
is uneven. At her best, the sense
of compromised, soiled sensuali
ty gone astray she conveys is
gripping, moving. But her dic
tion slips into little girlishness
sometimes, and the powerful ef
fect she has built up of an older
woman responsible for her own
debauchment with a younger

man is damaged. The part de
mands great rigidity, difficult
but absolutely essential to main
tain. Miss Epmeier is very, very
good. She needs to be perfect.
Also contributing mightily to
the success of the play is a fe
male player of a koto (a Japa
nese stringed instrument) whose
name this reviewer, like an idiot,
failed to get. She is a fine musi
cian, and provides a sensitive
counterpart to the spoken word.
Feldner's direction is airtight,
with the exception of the final
dramatic moment, which is
rushed, and the tension it should
have created is only half of what
it might be. It is, however—to
reiterate—a stunning piece of
theater, on any terms.
"Epitaph" Slightest of Three
"The Epitaph" is the slightest
script of the three. It consists of
a conversation between two
girls (Jane House and Nancy
Black) about Miss House's re
bellious and independent former
boyfriend. On a backdrop, the
silhouette of the boy acts as
complement or corrective to the
girls' observations about him.
Misses House and Black give
absolutely first - rate perform
ances. Miss Black alternately
cynical and compassionate is
saddled with dialogue the tone
of which fluctuates too wildly
to be believable. She does a fine
job of trying to even it out, but
it never gets there. The stiff

ness of Liddle's written conver
sational dialogue is more evi
dent here than in the first play,
because "The Epitaph" requires
at least a surface of realism.
Miss House, aiso Is superbly
involving as the sympathetic but
ultimately unsatisfactory com
panion to the rebel. She is, in
fact, so sympathetic that we are
unable to believe that she could
have failed him in any way, as
the playwright intended us to
She moves beautifully; at times,
she owns the stage. As with
Miss Black, she is kinder to the
dialogue than it deserves.
The play relies too heavily on
implication. On opening night,
the technical effects had little
or no success, and so much of
the meaning—and we cannot be
sure if there was a great deal
there to begin with—was lost.
The relation of one girl to the
other is unclear, as.well.
Of the three entirely student
produced endeavors, then, there
are one good and one exception
al play, several first-rate per
formances, . and some highly
competent direction throughout.
(Liddle in particular evinces
awe for his übiquity and mani
fold talents.) This is a rich har
vest. It is a rewarding evening.
Wednesday night, however,
there was an audience of 40,
about 10 of whom were stu
dents. One wonders, sometimes,
why Dave Harris even bothers.
