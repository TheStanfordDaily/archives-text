# A 						Slow Boat To Hong Kong Capsizes With 'Suzie Wong'
## 
### TACHI YAMADA 
The five dollar price of admis
sion to see "The World of Suzie
Wong" can be better invested in
reviving the Edsel for mass pro
duction.
The Circle Star Theatre's pro
duction is neither a good per
formance of a bad play non a bad
performance of a good play—it
is unmistakably atrocious in itsc
entirety.
The plot of "Suzie Wong" is
the same old story of a rich
boy who, against the will of his
more conservative father, tries
his luck at being an artist in
Hong Kong (of all places). Enter
stage-left, a whore with a heart
of gold and a son named Win
ston Wong (after Churchill, of
course). The hard-to-guess end
ing follows as in the best tra
dition of subtle neo-romanticism;
the boy and girl fall in love and
live happily ever after.
Evils Of White Slavery
If the play had not gone be
yond this honest, if trite, plot, it
might have been bearable. "Suzie
Wong", of course does not stop
here; rather, it goes on to make
pretentious implications about
the plight of poverty and the
evils of white slavery. The play
even goes so far as to dabble
with miscegenation and incest.
The playwrite, Paul Osborne
("On Borrowed Time" and "A
Bell for Adano") commits the
error of leaving his audience con
fused as to whether "Suzie
Wong" is a serious funny play
or a funny serious play. When
Suzie the whore refuses to go
to bed with her friend the artist
because no nice, normal white
girl would go to bed with her

boyfriend the first time asked,
the audience can laugh, but only
nervously.
Most of Osborne's dialogue is
corn, but when he runs out of
lines like, "I want to be with you
every moment of the day and
night," and, "Stay with me
whereever I go," he sprinkles in
so much bad language (14 hell's,
13 goddom's, 7 bastards, and 1
sonofabitch) that one wonders
why he bothered to leave out
some of the more descriptive
four-letter words.
Cast At Best, Adequate
The performance of "Suzie
Wong's" star-studded cast is at
best adequate. Frances Nuyen
seems rather bored with her
role as Suzie. As for Robert
Reed who plays the part of Lo
max, the artist, he is a blunder
ing as he ever was in "The De
fenders". The only bright spots
in the cast are Yuki Shimoda's
performance as Ah Tong, the
hotel-bar owner, and Howard
Morton's performance as a frus
trated businessman.
The set decorations were en
chanting but often so overly
elaborate as to be obstructive;
the lighting was either too dark
or too bright; the stage hands
were slow and noisy. Perhaps
the best aspect of entire play
was the costume designing or,
more specifically, the cheong
shams with the long, long slits
uncovering pretty, pretty legs.
Nevertheless, five dollars is
quite a sum to pay just to see
pretty legs considering that the
May issued of Playboy promises
to uncover much more than legs
and costs only seventy-five
cents!

why he bothered to leave out
some of the more descriptive
four-letter words.
Cast At Best, Adequate
The performance of "Suzie
Wong's" star-studded cast is at
best adequate. Frances Nuyen
seems rather bored with her
role as Suzie. As for Robert
Reed who plays the part of Lo
max, the artist, he is a blunder
ing as he ever was in "The De
fenders". The only bright spots
in the cast are Yuki Shimoda's
performance as Ah Tong, the
hotel-bar owner, and Howard
Morton's performance as a frus
trated businessman.
The set decorations were en
chanting but often so overly
elaborate as to be obstructive;
the lighting was either too dark
or too bright; the stage hands
were slow and noisy. Perhaps
the best aspect of entire play
was the costume designing or,
more specifically, the cheong
shams with the long, long slits
uncovering pretty, pretty legs.
Nevertheless, five dollars is
quite a sum to pay just to see
pretty legs considering that the
May issued of Playboy promises
to uncover much more than legs
and costs only seventy-five
cents!
The five dollar price of admis
sion to see "The World of Suzie
Wong" can be better invested in
reviving the Edsel for mass pro
duction.
The Circle Star Theatre's pro
duction is neither a good per
formance of a bad play non a bad
performance of a good play—it
is unmistakably atrocious in itsc
entirety.
The plot of "Suzie Wong" is
the same old story of a rich
boy who, against the will of his
more conservative father, tries
his luck at being an artist in
Hong Kong (of all places). Enter
stage-left, a whore with a heart
of gold and a son named Win
ston Wong (after Churchill, of
course). The hard-to-guess end
ing follows as in the best tra
dition of subtle neo-romanticism;
the boy and girl fall in love and
live happily ever after.
Evils Of White Slavery
If the play had not gone be
yond this honest, if trite, plot, it
might have been bearable. "Suzie
Wong", of course does not stop
here; rather, it goes on to make
pretentious implications about
the plight of poverty and the
evils of white slavery. The play
even goes so far as to dabble
with miscegenation and incest.
The playwrite, Paul Osborne
("On Borrowed Time" and "A
Bell for Adano") commits the
error of leaving his audience con
fused as to whether "Suzie
Wong" is a serious funny play
or a funny serious play. When
Suzie the whore refuses to go
to bed with her friend the artist
because no nice, normal white
girl would go to bed with her

boyfriend the first time asked,
the audience can laugh, but only
nervously.
Most of Osborne's dialogue is
corn, but when he runs out of
lines like, "I want to be with you
every moment of the day and
night," and, "Stay with me
whereever I go," he sprinkles in
so much bad language (14 hell's,
13 goddom's, 7 bastards, and 1
sonofabitch) that one wonders
why he bothered to leave out
some of the more descriptive
four-letter words.
