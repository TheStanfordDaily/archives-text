The Friday night Tresidder film, RIFIFI, is considered the orig

NIGHTS OF CABIRIA will hit the hallowed portals of Tresidder

Giulietta Masini, this recipient of Cannes Film Festival's highest
award is the story of a lonely street walker and her triumph over
alienation.
One of the main features of this week's Africa Week is the film
UNDER THE BLACK MASK to be shown Friday night in Cubber
ley Auditorium for admission of 30 cents.
The Sunday flicks is a classic of the intensive body movements
series starring that most intensive of all body movers, SHE, Ursula
Andress.
If you've nothing to do this weekend, make a point of seeing
A THOUSAND CLOWNS while it's still in the neighborhood at
the Bijou. It's one of the best-produced and entertaining films that
has ever been made (See review on this page).
OTHER
Perhaps the biggest hit of the weekend will be DAVE HARRIS,
newly elected foreman of "The Farm," and his victory party, where
ever and whenever that will be. Rumor has it that Tim Haight is
organizing the party so it will be entertaining if nothing else.
Flash statement from Hydrofollies' notorious MC, JOHN BOITAS
SOU: "Looks like the Con Home Hydrofollies is shaping up so well
that I think I might show up."
This Tuesday, a theater group satiring national politics and
especially the grape strike will be at White Memorial Plaza during
noontime.
