# Arts Festival Set To Bloom
## 
### WENDY WEINER 
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions" is the title of the third
of the Stanford Summer Festi
vals of the Arts.
The aims of the festival have
been expanding since its begin
ning in 1963. According to Steph
en Baffrey, producing manager,
the festival was created "to give
focus and enrichment to the
Stanford Summer Session." But,
"anxious to look beyond Stan
ford, we realized that we had to
serve the community as well."
Now, the most important func
tion of the festival has become
"the service it can do for the
arts," said Baffrey. "The Rocke
feller Report was a year behind
us in saying that business, gov
ernment, and private individuals
must support the arts. If they
don't we will lose the arts, or
our development in them will
end."
The Summer Festivals concept
embraces programs in each of
the University's humanities de
partments. It has been designed
to function as an "academic um
brella," stated Baffrey. Courses
and workshops have been sched
uled, focusing on the general
theme, "Twentieth Century In
novations."
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions" will be the first extensive
program to focus on this area.
The festival will be an explora
tion of the important changes in
style and form within the arts
from 1900-1939. It will look at
the works of this period with the
hope of being able to say, "these
works will live on; these works

will be the master creations of
the twentieth century," contin
ued Baffrey.
Stanford Summer Festivals of
the Arts have received wides
pread recognition in the past two
summers and have attracted an
international following. The
yearly festival was referred to
by the New York Times as, "one
of the major cultural enterprises
in the West."
The idea for the Arts Festivals
was conceived when Dr. Virgil
Whitaker, of the English depart
ment, became interested in de
signing a program at Stanford to
celebrate Shakespeare's 400 th
anniversary. Because of a large
donation to PACE, the Shake
spear Festival was able to grow
in projection and finally became
the first Summer Festival of the
Arts.
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions will differ from the prev
ious two summer festivals in
that it will focus on an era,
rather than an individual. "This
century does not revolve around
a single person, although I feel
that there are three individuals
who do characterize the period
from 1900-1939," stated Baffrey.
Ansermet, Stravinsky, Wright
The first of these is Ernest An
sermet, 'who has done more for
the music of that time than any
other man." The other two, con
tinued Baffrey, are the composer
Igor Stravinsky, and Frank
Lloyd Wright, for his contribu
tions to the visual arts.
Ansermet will be at Stanford
for the festival. He and his
Suisse Romande Orchestra will

be making their American debut.
The world's most extensively re
corded orchestra this group has
pioneered many important 20th
century works.
Several Other Debuts
Several other attractions will
be making debuts at Stanford
this summer. Bruno-Leonardo
Gelber, a young Argentinian
pianist and Ansermet's protegee,
will be performing for the first
time in this country.
From New Work and Pitts
burgh, the American Conserva
tory Theatre, directed by Wil
liam Ball, will make its first
West Coast appearance. The
company will present the reper
tory of plays that has earned it
national acclaim after only a
year in existence.
Other guest performers will be
pianist Grant Johannesen; so
prano Bethany Beardslee; the
Lenox String Quartet; and Jo
hannes Bruning, violinist and
concert master of the Stuttgart
Chamber Orchestra.
Public lectures will be given
by visiting scholars and per
formers including Hungarian
composer Aoltan Kodaly, drama
critic John Gassner, and poetry
critic Donald Davie.
"When you are presenting a
concert or a cultural program,"
said Baffrey, "you aren't just
looking for dollars. You are
looking for people to fill the
audience."
Tickets for the events of the
Stanford Summer Festivals are
on sale now at Tresidder Box
Office. There will be a $.75 dis
count on all student tickets.

don't we will lose the arts, or
our development in them will
end."
The Summer Festivals concept
embraces programs in each of
the University's humanities de
partments. It has been designed
to function as an "academic um
brella," stated Baffrey. Courses
and workshops have been sched
uled, focusing on the general
theme, "Twentieth Century In
novations."
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions" will be the first extensive
program to focus on this area.
The festival will be an explora
tion of the important changes in
style and form within the arts
from 1900-1939. It will look at
the works of this period with the
hope of being able to say, "these
works will live on; these works

will be the master creations of
the twentieth century," contin
ued Baffrey.
Stanford Summer Festivals of
the Arts have received wides
pread recognition in the past two
summers and have attracted an
international following. The
yearly festival was referred to
by the New York Times as, "one
of the major cultural enterprises
in the West."
The idea for the Arts Festivals
was conceived when Dr. Virgil
Whitaker, of the English depart
ment, became interested in de
signing a program at Stanford to
celebrate Shakespeare's 400 th
anniversary. Because of a large
donation to PACE, the Shake
spear Festival was able to grow
in projection and finally became
the first Summer Festival of the
Arts.
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions will differ from the prev
ious two summer festivals in
that it will focus on an era,
rather than an individual. "This
century does not revolve around
a single person, although I feel
that there are three individuals
who do characterize the period
from 1900-1939," stated Baffrey.
Ansermet, Stravinsky, Wright
The first of these is Ernest An
sermet, 'who has done more for
the music of that time than any
other man." The other two, con
tinued Baffrey, are the composer
Igor Stravinsky, and Frank
Lloyd Wright, for his contribu
tions to the visual arts.
Ansermet will be at Stanford
for the festival. He and his
Suisse Romande Orchestra will

be making their American debut.
The world's most extensively re
corded orchestra this group has
pioneered many important 20th
century works.
Several Other Debuts
Several other attractions will
be making debuts at Stanford
this summer. Bruno-Leonardo
Gelber, a young Argentinian
pianist and Ansermet's protegee,
will be performing for the first
time in this country.
From New Work and Pitts
burgh, the American Conserva
tory Theatre, directed by Wil
liam Ball, will make its first
West Coast appearance. The
company will present the reper
tory of plays that has earned it
national acclaim after only a
year in existence.
Other guest performers will be
pianist Grant Johannesen; so
prano Bethany Beardslee; the
Lenox String Quartet; and Jo
hannes Bruning, violinist and
concert master of the Stuttgart
Chamber Orchestra.
Public lectures will be given
by visiting scholars and per
formers including Hungarian
composer Aoltan Kodaly, drama
critic John Gassner, and poetry
critic Donald Davie.
"When you are presenting a
concert or a cultural program,"
said Baffrey, "you aren't just
looking for dollars. You are
looking for people to fill the
audience."
Tickets for the events of the
Stanford Summer Festivals are
on sale now at Tresidder Box
Office. There will be a $.75 dis
count on all student tickets.
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions" is the title of the third
of the Stanford Summer Festi
vals of the Arts.
The aims of the festival have
been expanding since its begin
ning in 1963. According to Steph
en Baffrey, producing manager,
the festival was created "to give
focus and enrichment to the
Stanford Summer Session." But,
"anxious to look beyond Stan
ford, we realized that we had to
serve the community as well."
Now, the most important func
tion of the festival has become
"the service it can do for the
arts," said Baffrey. "The Rocke
feller Report was a year behind
us in saying that business, gov
ernment, and private individuals
must support the arts. If they
don't we will lose the arts, or
our development in them will
end."

will be the master creations of
the twentieth century," contin

Stanford Summer Festivals of
the Arts have received wides
pread recognition in the past two
summers and have attracted an
international following. The
yearly festival was referred to
by the New York Times as, "one
of the major cultural enterprises
in the West."
The idea for the Arts Festivals
was conceived when Dr. Virgil
Whitaker, of the English depart
ment, became interested in de
signing a program at Stanford to
celebrate Shakespeare's 400 th
anniversary. Because of a large
donation to PACE, the Shake
spear Festival was able to grow
in projection and finally became
the first Summer Festival of the
Arts.
"Twentieth Century Innova
tions will differ from the prev
ious two summer festivals in
that it will focus on an era,
rather than an individual. "This
century does not revolve around
a single person, although I feel
that there are three individuals
who do characterize the period
from 1900-1939," stated Baffrey.
Ansermet, Stravinsky, Wright
The first of these is Ernest An
sermet, 'who has done more for
the music of that time than any
other man." The other two, con
tinued Baffrey, are the composer
Igor Stravinsky, and Frank
Lloyd Wright, for his contribu
tions to the visual arts.
Ansermet will be at Stanford
for the festival. He and his
Suisse Romande Orchestra will

be making their American debut.
The world's most extensively re
corded orchestra this group has
pioneered many important 20th
century works.
Several Other Debuts
Several other attractions will
be making debuts at Stanford
this summer. Bruno-Leonardo
Gelber, a young Argentinian
pianist and Ansermet's protegee,
will be performing for the first
time in this country.
From New Work and Pitts
burgh, the American Conserva
tory Theatre, directed by Wil
liam Ball, will make its first
West Coast appearance. The
company will present the reper
tory of plays that has earned it
national acclaim after only a
year in existence.
Other guest performers will be
pianist Grant Johannesen; so
prano Bethany Beardslee; the
Lenox String Quartet; and Jo
hannes Bruning, violinist and
concert master of the Stuttgart
Chamber Orchestra.
Public lectures will be given
by visiting scholars and per
formers including Hungarian
composer Aoltan Kodaly, drama
critic John Gassner, and poetry
critic Donald Davie.
"When you are presenting a
concert or a cultural program,"
said Baffrey, "you aren't just
looking for dollars. You are
looking for people to fill the
audience."
Tickets for the events of the
Stanford Summer Festivals are
