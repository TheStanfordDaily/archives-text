# MARCHING TO BOHEMIA
## 'Thousand Clowns' Is Success 
### ANDREW WILSON 
In days when Hollywood has
become synonomous in movies
with the conventional, the sen
timental and the fat, guaranteed
purse, while European avant
garde has come to suggest sur
realism upbeat, artsie and ex
perimental, the idea blending the
best of both worlds into one
movie seems about as likely as
inaugrating cultural exchange
programs on the Israeli border.
Yet that is precisely what "A
Thousand Clowns" has done
with uncompromising virtuosity.
Notwithstanding its inexcus
able ending, "A Thousand
Clowns" is one of the most im
aginative, hilarious and thor
oughly enjoyable films to hit the

American scene in many a year.
Converted from the smash
Broadway play of the same name
and keeping its leading actor, Ja
son Robards, "A Thousand
Clowns" could anticipate almost
sure box-office success. This it
has certainly had and by all
aesthetic criteria it has not failed
to meet its fondest expectations.
The hero of the movie is a
bohemian anti-hero named Mur
rey (Robards), who bows to no
man and is loved by all men, who
lives in a cramped one-room
apartment and makes New York
City his playground, and who,
above all, despises the eight-hour
a day grind and refuses to join
the millions of normal working
people he sees daily addicted to

it. He doesn't work and considers
all those rushing madly back and
forth to their jobs pathetic fools.
He seems, in fact, the perfect
American dream: an outgoing
indivualist with total leisure and
no pressing obligations.
But not quite. There is a catch.
The Social Welfare Board is
breathing down his neck about
his rights over a twelve-year old
nephew, Nick, who has been liv
ing with him for the past seven
years. Either Murrey sets aside
his derelict ways and take up
a steady job, or give up the child
to some more stable environ
ment
A Blind Expedient
At this point it would seem
that the movie sees no adequate
solution to its problem and so
blindly chooses upon the expedi
ent of whatever might seem
most dramatic for the time. Not
only does Murrey take a job,
but he grovels for a job with
the biggest creep around right
after this clod insults his
nephew. It is a complete about
face and doesn't jive with any
thing we've been brought to
admire in Murrey.
Photography and music are in
tegral and highly original facets
of the movie. Often they are
played against each other for
satirical comment, as when
rousing march music accompan
ied aerial shots of converging
rush hour crowds. .Rapid, extran
eous cutting is often used for
startling effect in much the
same fashion as in "A Hard
Day's Night."
However, beneath all the
avant-garde techniques and over
tones with bohemian wildlife,
there remains a richly sentimen
talized story, with stable old con
formity reaffirmed at the end.
"A Thousaand Clowns" is a fan
tastic movie that should appeal
to a wide range of taste.

oughly enjoyable films to hit the

American scene in many a year.
Converted from the smash
Broadway play of the same name
and keeping its leading actor, Ja
son Robards, "A Thousand
Clowns" could anticipate almost
sure box-office success. This it
has certainly had and by all
aesthetic criteria it has not failed
to meet its fondest expectations.
The hero of the movie is a
bohemian anti-hero named Mur
rey (Robards), who bows to no
man and is loved by all men, who
lives in a cramped one-room
apartment and makes New York
City his playground, and who,
above all, despises the eight-hour
a day grind and refuses to join
the millions of normal working
people he sees daily addicted to

it. He doesn't work and considers
all those rushing madly back and
forth to their jobs pathetic fools.
He seems, in fact, the perfect
American dream: an outgoing
indivualist with total leisure and
no pressing obligations.
But not quite. There is a catch.
The Social Welfare Board is
breathing down his neck about
his rights over a twelve-year old
nephew, Nick, who has been liv
ing with him for the past seven
years. Either Murrey sets aside
his derelict ways and take up
a steady job, or give up the child
to some more stable environ
ment
A Blind Expedient
At this point it would seem
that the movie sees no adequate
solution to its problem and so
blindly chooses upon the expedi
ent of whatever might seem
most dramatic for the time. Not
only does Murrey take a job,
but he grovels for a job with
the biggest creep around right
after this clod insults his
nephew. It is a complete about
face and doesn't jive with any
thing we've been brought to
admire in Murrey.
Photography and music are in
tegral and highly original facets
of the movie. Often they are
played against each other for
satirical comment, as when
rousing march music accompan
ied aerial shots of converging
rush hour crowds. .Rapid, extran
eous cutting is often used for
startling effect in much the
same fashion as in "A Hard
Day's Night."
However, beneath all the
avant-garde techniques and over
tones with bohemian wildlife,
there remains a richly sentimen
talized story, with stable old con
formity reaffirmed at the end.
"A Thousaand Clowns" is a fan
tastic movie that should appeal
to a wide range of taste.
In days when Hollywood has
become synonomous in movies
with the conventional, the sen
timental and the fat, guaranteed
purse, while European avant
garde has come to suggest sur
realism upbeat, artsie and ex
perimental, the idea blending the
best of both worlds into one
movie seems about as likely as
inaugrating cultural exchange
programs on the Israeli border.
Yet that is precisely what "A
Thousand Clowns" has done
with uncompromising virtuosity.
Notwithstanding its inexcus
able ending, "A Thousand
Clowns" is one of the most im
aginative, hilarious and thor
oughly enjoyable films to hit the

American scene in many a year.
