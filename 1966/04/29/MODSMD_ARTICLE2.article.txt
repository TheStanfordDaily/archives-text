# Blum Cites Dangers Of LSD
## 
### BOB FISHMAN Senior Staff Writer 
"I took LSD and tried to kill my
boyfriend — twice." "After taking
LSD I drove across the Bay Bridge—
at 70 miles per hour."
These were among the responses to
hallucenogenic drugs which Dr. Rich
ard H. Blum of the Human Problems
Institute recounted in a speech last
night.
Most of the reactions which Dr.
Blum described were less extreme.
"Most people we interview like them
selves more after taking LSD," he
commented.
"But many students change in ways
they cannot control."
Sources Of Trouble
Dr. Blum admitted that laymen and
even experts "know little and less"
about drugs. But he cited five possible
sources of trouble stemming from
drug use:
• Overdoses which might lead to
psychic derangement or even death.
• Accidents stemming from slow
reactions or faulty judgment while
under the influence of drugs.
• Suicides after a particularly in
tense emotional experience.
• Dependency or addiction.
• Arrest.

In spite of these dangers students
persist in taking drugs, as Dr. Blum
remarked, "for good reasons but with
bad consequences."
"Some people," he stated, "are
driven to drugs by a need to revolt.
They are testing their limits, and
drugs are the 'last taboo.' "
Students also see in LSD a means
of meeting their "religious and mys
tical needs which are not met in a
secular society."
Bored With Rational
"Students are bored with being ra
tional. They value new experiences,
and a sort of creativity which they
think is only obtainable through
drugs.'
Dr. Blum pointed out that many
people turn to drugs as "a matter of
courage. They want to show that
they're ready to do anything."
But studies made by Dr. Blum and
others indicate that those who take
drugs are oftent more worried about
consequences, and more sensitive to
criticism by their peers, than others
who refrain.
Dr. Blum called on students to work
together to "develop their own ethics"
to deal with the drug problem. He
asked that those students who had
any relevant experiences or insights
to make them known to Dr. Blum at
the Human Problems Institute.

The speech was interrupted to show
an eight-minute film dealing with the
experience of LSD users. An expand
ed version will be screened May 16 at
the Communication Department's
Monday Film Series.
In response to a question Dr. Blum
admitted that he had never taken LSD
himself. But he thought he could un
derstand the problem without actually
experiencing the LSD effect.

He also remarked that he believed
the present marijuana law to be "far
too punitive." He added that he be
lieved alcohol regulations to be "far
too lax."
"It's a general rule that the more
the drug's available, the greater the
addiction rate."
Conscious of Effects
He warned students to "remain con
scious of the possible ill effects of
hallucenogenic drugs." He remarked
that many of those who were unquali
fied in their advocacy of drugs were
"sorcerers masquerading as scien
tists."
The speech was co-sponsored by the
Stanford Today and Tomorrow Com
mittee and the Dean of Students Of
fice.
The last speech in the series is
scheduled for May 18, when Dr. John
Rule of M.I.T. will discuss student
problems in sexual relations.

"Students are bored with being ra
tional. They value new experiences,
and a sort of creativity which they
think is only obtainable through
drugs.'
Dr. Blum pointed out that many
people turn to drugs as "a matter of
courage. They want to show that
they're ready to do anything."
But studies made by Dr. Blum and
others indicate that those who take
drugs are oftent more worried about
consequences, and more sensitive to
criticism by their peers, than others
who refrain.
Dr. Blum called on students to work
together to "develop their own ethics"
to deal with the drug problem. He
asked that those students who had
any relevant experiences or insights
to make them known to Dr. Blum at
the Human Problems Institute.
Film Shown
The speech was interrupted to show
an eight-minute film dealing with the
experience of LSD users. An expand
ed version will be screened May 16 at
the Communication Department's
Monday Film Series.
In response to a question Dr. Blum
admitted that he had never taken LSD
himself. But he thought he could un
derstand the problem without actually
experiencing the LSD effect.

He also remarked that he believed
the present marijuana law to be "far
too punitive." He added that he be
lieved alcohol regulations to be "far
too lax."
"It's a general rule that the more
the drug's available, the greater the
addiction rate."
Conscious of Effects
He warned students to "remain con
scious of the possible ill effects of
hallucenogenic drugs." He remarked
that many of those who were unquali
fied in their advocacy of drugs were
"sorcerers masquerading as scien
tists."
The speech was co-sponsored by the
Stanford Today and Tomorrow Com
mittee and the Dean of Students Of
fice.
The last speech in the series is
scheduled for May 18, when Dr. John
Rule of M.I.T. will discuss student
problems in sexual relations.
"I took LSD and tried to kill my
boyfriend — twice." "After taking
LSD I drove across the Bay Bridge—
at 70 miles per hour."
These were among the responses to
hallucenogenic drugs which Dr. Rich
ard H. Blum of the Human Problems
Institute recounted in a speech last
night.
Most of the reactions which Dr.
Blum described were less extreme.
"Most people we interview like them
selves more after taking LSD," he
commented.
"But many students change in ways
they cannot control."
Sources Of Trouble
Dr. Blum admitted that laymen and
even experts "know little and less"
about drugs. But he cited five possible
sources of trouble stemming from
drug use:
• Overdoses which might lead to
psychic derangement or even death.
• Accidents stemming from slow
reactions or faulty judgment while
under the influence of drugs.
• Suicides after a particularly in
tense emotional experience.
• Dependency or addiction.
• Arrest.

In spite of these dangers students
persist in taking drugs, as Dr. Blum
remarked, "for good reasons but with
bad consequences."
"Some people," he stated, "are
driven to drugs by a need to revolt.
They are testing their limits, and
drugs are the 'last taboo.' "
Students also see in LSD a means
of meeting their "religious and mys
tical needs which are not met in a
secular society."
