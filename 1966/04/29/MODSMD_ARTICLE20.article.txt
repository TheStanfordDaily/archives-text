# TO DIE IN MADRID'
## Blood Flows Mainly On The Plain 
### BOB MENIFEE 
"To Die In Madrid" is a com
pilation documentary film, yet
it is also a feature film. We see
the cast of thousands, but they
are actual participators in a
war. We see scenes of battle and
destruction, but real bombs are
exploding. We see grief and
death, but the blood and tears
are really shed.
"To Die In Madrid" is the
story of the Spanish Civil War.
The film describes the events in
Spain from the end of mon
archy in 1936 to the eventual
dictatorship of Franco in 1939.
It is a unique and actual report
because original footage, ob
tained from Germany, Italy,
Russia and other countries, has
been re-edited into fast moving
sequences. The viewer is brought
onto the actual battlefield to see

the wounded and dying.
Frederick Rossif, the director,
alternates furious action with
beautiful scenes of still life. His
modern camera has found un
changed examples of life an -1 ar
chitecture which give the feeling
that the entire film was shot
during the war. The scenes of
pastoral Spain are superb in
visual content. Each shot of the
Spanish countryside is composed
like a still photograph. The cam
era does not move, but one beau
tiful picture cuts into another.
The direction of "To Die in
Madrid" is influenced by Sergei
Eisenstein's "Ten Days That
Shook the World," utilizing par
ticular individuals rather than
actors, rapid cutting, and a re
creation of events with a partic
ular political bias. Like Eisen
stein, Rossif builds tension and

drama around close-ups of peo
ple expressing grief, horror, en
thusiasm, and joy.
Narration Overdramatlc
The English narration is not
the original soundtrack, and it
is overdramatic while the pic
tures are striking enough. The
narrators are excellent in spots,
as when John Geilgud quotes
Garcia Lorca, but Irene Worth
is oversympathetic and moans
for the Republic. The narrators
become a critical chorus, forcing
emotion upon the audience rath
er than giving explanation.
The interplay between narra
tion and photography is some
times clever. During one scene
the narrator reads of a General's
demand for the surrender of a
Rebel stronghold, at the threat
of bombing the town. In answer,
the next scene focuses on air

planes blanketing the area with
bombs. The narration begins the
sequence, and the picture finish
es it.
Pity for Rubles
The great length of similar
fighting scenes makes the film
overlong, but the picture-like
quality of other shots increases
the reality of the film. The di
rector has made a historical
event dramatic and interesting
by quick action and rapid move
ment from sequence to sequence.
Franco is victorious, but the
narrators try to elicit pity for
the rebels.
"To Die in Madrid" recreates
the spirit of Civil War and even
teaches the audience something.
Perhaps the success of the film
lies in the scriptâ€”a script writ
ten by history and authenticated
in the Spanish charnel.
