# CRUCIAL MEET TODAY
## Frosh To Host JC 
### 
The undefeated frosh track
team faces its stiffest challenge
of the year when it meets Han
cock Junior College today at
4:00 on Angell Field.
Hancock's squad is ranked
among the top three junior col
lege teams in the state, but
Coach Jerry Barlands' Stanford
squad, winners of the Stanford
Relays and seven straight dual
meets, is a slight favorite.
On the basis of best times
there should be some interesting
individual duels this afternoon.
Stanford's outstanding sprinter,
Pat Morrison, may have to
break his own frosh record in
the 100 to beat Hancock's Tur
ner, who has done a 9.5.
In the distance events Han
cock expects to win both the
mile and the two mile, while

Stanford hopes to score in the
880. In that event Mike Donley
will need to run a 1:54 or 1:55
for first place.
Hancock's most decisive domi
nation is in the field events.
Their top weight man, Keshmiri
from Iran, has hurled the discus
an incredible 173'11V2" and has
put the shot over 54 feet. A 14
foot pole vaulter and a 45 foot
triple jumper should give the
visitors a clear edge in those
events as well.
Stanford is expected to win
both relays and both hurdles,
but the hurdles will be closely
contested. Tom Kommers' best
of 14.9 in the 120 highs and
38.6 in the intermediates should
be good enough for firsts, but
the points for second and third
place are up for grabs. If Terry
Barnett can take second to com
plete a one-two sweep in both
races, the frosh should clinch
the meet.
The javelin is an optional
event for Hancock. A team com
parison of best efforts in other
events gives the Stanford frosh
a slight edge.
