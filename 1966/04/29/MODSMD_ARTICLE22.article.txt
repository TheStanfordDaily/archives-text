# Lax Squad Meets Gap
## 
### 
The Indian Lacrosse team has
finally come home! After three
weeks in alien territory, the
crack Indian stickmen will show
their wares before a curious and
sure to be excited home crowd.
The Indians meet Peacock
Gap in a crucial contest this
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. on the
Farm's Harry Maloney Field.
The Gappers have already suc
cumbed to the Cards once on
their home field, 6-5. It took a
last minute goal by Clay Prim
rose to win that one for the In
dians, but the Tribe is expected
to take this one by a much
wider margin.
Peacock Gap could find itself
cast in the spoiler role for this
contest and could easily check
Stanford's battle with California
for second place in the NorCal
League race.
A tie last week between the
Indians and Bears clinched the
League title for the powerful
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club, and if
the Indians live through this
weekend's game the consolation
prize should be determined in
the Stanford-Cal showdown next
week.
The pride of the Peacock Gap
team is its attack, led by league
leading scorer Bucky Stevens.
But the Stanford defense proved
itself impenetrable in the Cal
contest and Stevens is symbolic
of an attack which is easily in
timidated.
Precision and calm should
contain any potential Peacock
Gap explosion.
