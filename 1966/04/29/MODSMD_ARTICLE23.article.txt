# Walsh-Williams Clash Tomorrow
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Stanford's track team is odds
to win tomorrow. However, we
can't discount the Tribe's dis
heartening performances
against USC, and UCLA—or the
likes of Washington's Dave Wil
liams, Bill Roe, and A 1 Pember
ton who certainly do count,
nearly 40 points worth.
Even though the Huskies
don't concentrate too heavily on
their track program, Washing
ton is still respected for turning
out fine athletes and Williams
can be cited as an example.
An All-Coast star in football
he will also be the featured per

former in five events tomorrow,
a big role for anyone. Stanford's
Bud Walsh although not casted
for the supporting role—perhaps
opposing role would be more ap
propriate — will, nevertheless
find it difficult to retain his title
of the most versatile performer.
He will compete in four events.
Besides the personal battles
between Williams and Walsh in
both hurdles and the long jump,
Bob Stoecker and Pemberton
will duel for honors in the shot
and discus. Less than two feet
separate the two in either
event. Pemberton has a slight
edge in the discus, 186-4 to 184-8,
with Stoecker the favorite in the

shot, 54-2 to 53-3.
Bill Roe will be challenging
for second place in the hurdles
against Walsh and also be scrap
ping for second with Roger Cox
in the 220. Roe is Washington's
top 220 man with a 22 flat.
Elsewhere in the dashes, there
are few question marks during
this period of the season as to
Stanford's supremacy not only
when compared to Washing
ton's best marks but also in the
entire conference. Stanford's
Larry Questad, Donn Forbes,
and Roger Cox are all under 10
seconds and should sweep the
100. Jim Ward should take the
440.

In the more time-consuming
events, the mile, 880, and two
mile, the Huskies, known for
their exceptional strength and
stamina, will have to pull for
all their worth. Stanford's Dave
Deubner will challenge the duo
of Dave Roberts and John Clems
in the mile and two-mile. Deub
ner should win the mile.
The relays are definitely con
trolled by Stanford which could
mean that Stanford's Coach
Payton Jordan may switch
some of hi 6 relay personnel sav-

ing them for their bests in their
individual events. The Indians
hold a second on Washington in
the 440 relay and almost eight
in the mile.
Besides the relay, the only
other "sure" victories are Stan

ford's Jim Eshelman and Chuck
Smith in the pole vault and
Washington's Gerry Pickering
in the high jump. Hi 6 best is
6-6.
So even though Stanford
should win the meet, recent
races at Stanford have produced
some surprising and, needless to
say, odd results.

ton's best marks but also in the
entire conference. Stanford's
Larry Questad, Donn Forbes,
and Roger Cox are all under 10
seconds and should sweep the
100. Jim Ward should take the
440.

In the more time-consuming
events, the mile, 880, and two
mile, the Huskies, known for
their exceptional strength and
stamina, will have to pull for
all their worth. Stanford's Dave
Deubner will challenge the duo
of Dave Roberts and John Clems
in the mile and two-mile. Deub
ner should win the mile.
The relays are definitely con
trolled by Stanford which could
mean that Stanford's Coach
Payton Jordan may switch
some of hi 6 relay personnel sav-

ing them for their bests in their
individual events. The Indians
hold a second on Washington in
the 440 relay and almost eight
in the mile.
Besides the relay, the only
other "sure" victories are Stan

ford's Jim Eshelman and Chuck
Smith in the pole vault and
Washington's Gerry Pickering
in the high jump. Hi 6 best is
6-6.
So even though Stanford
should win the meet, recent
races at Stanford have produced
some surprising and, needless to
say, odd results.
Stanford's track team is odds
to win tomorrow. However, we
can't discount the Tribe's dis
heartening performances
against USC, and UCLA—or the
likes of Washington's Dave Wil
liams, Bill Roe, and A 1 Pember
ton who certainly do count,
nearly 40 points worth.
Even though the Huskies
don't concentrate too heavily on
their track program, Washing
ton is still respected for turning
out fine athletes and Williams
can be cited as an example.
An All-Coast star in football
he will also be the featured per

former in five events tomorrow,
a big role for anyone. Stanford's
Bud Walsh although not casted
for the supporting role—perhaps
opposing role would be more ap
propriate — will, nevertheless
find it difficult to retain his title
of the most versatile performer.
He will compete in four events.
Besides the personal battles
between Williams and Walsh in
both hurdles and the long jump,
Bob Stoecker and Pemberton
will duel for honors in the shot
and discus. Less than two feet
separate the two in either
event. Pemberton has a slight
edge in the discus, 186-4 to 184-8,
with Stoecker the favorite in the

shot, 54-2 to 53-3.
Bill Roe will be challenging
for second place in the hurdles
against Walsh and also be scrap
ping for second with Roger Cox
in the 220. Roe is Washington's
top 220 man with a 22 flat.
Elsewhere in the dashes, there
are few question marks during
this period of the season as to
Stanford's supremacy not only
when compared to Washing
ton's best marks but also in the
entire conference. Stanford's
Larry Questad, Donn Forbes,
and Roger Cox are all under 10
seconds and should sweep the
100. Jim Ward should take the
440.
