Out of computers faster than the
eye can blink fly letters stacked
with names of males and fe
males—taped, scanned, checked,
and matched. Into the mails
speed the compatible pairs.
Eager males grab their phones.
Anxious females dialing paired
off mates—a thousand ring, ring,
rings jar the air. Matched pairs
exchange viewpoints. A nation
wide dating spree is on. Thou
sands of boys and girls who have
never met plan weekends to
gether.
WHY is computer dating
sweeping the nation? Through a
complex system of two-way
matching, the 1401 high-speed
computer does not pair a male
with his ideal female unless he
is also the female's ideal male,
thereby giving them assurance
of mutual compatibility.
