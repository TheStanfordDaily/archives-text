# The 						Harris Victory
## 
### 
"20,000 Stanford students can't be wrong,"
reads a liquor store advertisement on this page.
A year ago, the ad for the same establishment
declared that "20,000 fraternity men can't be
wrong."
In a much more dramatic fasliion, the elec
tion of Dave Harris to the ASSU presidency
yesterday is indicative of the deep transition
in thought and attitude that has been subtly
brewing within the Stanford student community
the past few years. Much will be written and
much will be said in the near future about the
significance of the Harris victory; at present,
perhaps a few general comments will suffice.
In a sense, the University was the real victor
in the election, for the major issue for both
candidates was the improvement of education
at Stanford. Even the campaign itself was edu
cational—there were invaluable bull sessions
not only among the freshmen in Wilbur, but
among many other students who have not given
serious thought to Stanford as an educational
institution since matriculation.
The decision facing the student body was one
of means: which approach to the University's
power structure would be most effective in
gaining the reforms the two candidates pro
posed? The answer, one that possibly will worry
many administrators and faculty members, was

that it cannot be an approach based fully on
consensus—that the various aspects of Stan
ford's educational system must be examined on
the basis of their inherent worth, and not with
reference to their acceptibility to the Trustees
or their contribution to "greatness." The student
body's answer to the educational issue reflected
a discontent the depth and extent of which were
unknown even to long-time Stanfordologists; it
can only be hoped that University decision
makers will not brush it off as the product of
2416 rash moments.
During the campaign, Harris emphasized
that his pronouncements were ideas rather than
proposals. We hope that during his term he
will continue to be mindful of the difference
between the two. For when one faces problems
as immense as those involved in absorbing an
education at Stanford, there are no easy
answers. An experimental attitude is a necessity,
and requires a rejection of dogmatism and ab
solutes. The solutions, if they are to be work
able ones, will have to be reached through a
dialectic of scholars.
We wish Mr. Harris success during his tenure,
and hope that during the coming year he can
inject into student government, into the student
body, and into the University that same excite
ment and the same discussion of ideas and
issues that accompanied his election.
