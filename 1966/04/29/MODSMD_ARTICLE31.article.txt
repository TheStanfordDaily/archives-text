# Klein Urges A New Dedication To Implement Further Reform
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following 1 is
the text of a statement released
to The Daily last night by Bob
Klein, who was defeated in the
final election for student body
president yesterday.)
I write with the realization
that Dave Harris will be elected
the new Student Body President,
and with a great deal of hope.
I have known Dave for eight
years and I greatly respect his
mind and his organizational
abilities. I agree with Dave's
general philosophy of the op
timal university. I disagreed
with several of his specific pro
posals and with his perspective
on the means for implementing
his ideas.
Confrontation and Change
I hope the administration and
faculty will not automatically
react negatively to Dave's bias
towards the need of confronta
tion for change. Dave is not
dogmatic by nature, although
his character occasionally re
flects some intransigence. If
given proof that the channels
for change are open, Dave will
modify hie perspective.
If initially faced with an ob
structionist, conservative reac
tion to his ideas, Dave's philoso
phy of confrontation will be in
delibly imprinted on most of his
administration. This is a time for
deep analysis of ideas, means,
and impressions, not a time for
reaction.
Yet, the threat of a Pavlovian
reaction to a radical stereotype
lies with the moderate students
as well as with the faculty and
administration. As moderates we
must not abandon our role in
the university although perhaps
partially alienated by the tenor
of the student body govern
ment.
The Moderate View
Only through a committment
to continued participation and
action can either the radical or
moderate viewpoint be com
municated. With the radical
viewpoint structurally institu
tionalized in the student body

presidency, moderates must ex
ert a special effort if their voice
is to be influential in the univer
sity.
Jan Jacobi and I put forth our
proposals with an integrity of
committment that necessitates a
continued effort towards achiev
ing them, whether as individual
students or as officers of the
association. Hopefully the mod
erates of this university who
have backed us will also accept
this same spirit of involvement.
We must remember that if
we, as moderates, now abdicate
our responsibility to action, we
condemn the system to the sta
tus quo or to the unchallenged
foreys of radicalism; and there
by, we forfeit all right to com
plaint or demand. Let us also
remember that "If Stanford is to
be a vital force in the society
outside us, we, as students,
must accept the responsibility of
a new and extended role with

the university," which will pre
pare us to accept the intelligen
sia's responsibility for leader
ship in society.
United Community
Today must be a day of hope
and dedication, not of dismay
and rejection. The students can
accomplish nothing as a com
munity of isolated, alienated
segments. They must form a
united community capable of
existing and improving through
internal dissent and debate.
This dynamic conflict of ideas
should be perceived as a stimu
lus to the structure, not as a
detracting force. Under the
leadership of Dave Harris this
student community must dedi
cate itself to a new emphasis on
educational reform within the
context of a larger educational
community containing faculty
and administrator who have
made a vocational dedication to
the same goals.
