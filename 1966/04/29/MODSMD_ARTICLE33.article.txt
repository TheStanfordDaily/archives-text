# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## An Invitation To Learn Stern's Food Problems 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Mr. Ken Creese (The
Daily, April 26) and the men of
Stern, who clearly do not fully
understand the Food Service sit
uation.
If the meal described by Mr.
Creese were indeed a "usual
lunch"; if the room-and-board
rate were expected to "go up
$20 per quarter next year" rath
er than the $40 per quarter that
is projected; and if "unlimited
seconds" were offered on salad,
dessert, and meat; then perhaps
Stern men would not be so in
clined to object.
To quote Mr. Johnson (The
Daily, April 19): "The question
is this: if a food service of com
parable size can provide such as
this [at Redlands] for $450 per
year, why can't Stern or any
other campus food service?"
And Mr. Thompson (The Daily,
April 15) asks: "How can a
school such as Stanford, which
prides itself on being a residence
university, expect people to
maintain residence while not
being fed well?" These are ques
tions, not complaints, and we
have followed what we feel is
the "right channel" in seeking
answers.
In Winter Quarter, 1965, Mr.
William Blevins, Director of
Stern Houses, organized a rep
resentative committee of stu
dents from the House of Stern,
to meet and discuss the Univer
sity Food Service. Since that
time, this committee has met on
several occasions with Mr. Ble
vins and Mies Blue, Directress of
the Stern Food Service. The
hope was that we could estab
lish a communication.
However, in Winter quarter of
the current year, it became evi
dent to the committee that
many of our basic questions re
garding budget and system were
not answerable at Miss Blue's
level. We extended an invitation
to Mr. Dwight Adams, Business
Manager of the University, to
meet with us, and we drew up a
list of questions and recommen
dations for his office to review
in preparation for the discus
sion.
Mr. Aams was unable to meet
with us until Friday, April 22.
Unfortunately, the meeting was
rather inconsequential. We hope
to meet again with Mr. Adams
on Thursday, May 5, when an
swers to the sort of questions
posed by Mr. Thompson and Mr.
Johnson may be offered.
Mr. Creese's point of view is
sadly naive, and his detail is not
entirely accurate; he is cordially
invited to wade in the channel
with us at the May 5 meeting.

• Gourmet's Delight
Editor, The Daily:
Up until just recently I have
read several letters in your news
paper criticizing the Stern food.
I do not take exception to these
letters—as a resident of Stern
I realize that they were justi
fied at the time. In fact I have
taken to skipping breakfast, eat
ing lunch from food machines,
and going to a restaurant for
dinner to escape the Stern food.
Wednesday, however, I hap
pened to be in Stern at noon and
decided, out of sheer laziness, to
eat lunch here. You can imag
ine my surprise to find that the
meal was not only edible but
quite tasty.
We were offered bread and
butter, crackers, bean soup, a
choice between pizza and cold
meat for sandwiches, another
choice between gingerbread cake
with whipped cream and pine
apple, milk and juice.
A new light seems to shine on
Stern food. Let's hope that the
era of the I*6 hot dogs is gone
forever and applaud the food
service for their great enlighten
ment.

• Pampered Peace
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Robert Fishman's letter
castigating fraternity spokes
man Pete Lake (The Daily,
April 26) is implicitly based on
the ideal of the University com
munity as a social womb, de
signed to carefully shelter its
members from the cruel and "ig

noble" realities of the world out
side.
Yet if the University environ
ment functions as a four-year
incubator, what will happen to
the pampered Stanfordite who,
stepping beyond its protective
walls, finds himself in a social
and cultural milieu for which he
is totally unprepared?
I can't help thinking that, like
the proverbial Fish out of water,
he undoubtedly would flounder.

• No Analysis
Editor, The Daily:
Law School faculty and stu
dents would agree, I think, that
anyone who undertakes to ex
plain or interpret as carefully
thought out a statement by Pro
fessor John R. McDonough as
appeared in The Daily is pre
sumptuous. Mr. McDonough said
precisely what he had in mind, a
trait for which he is well known
in the Law School.
The article pointed out that
there is a difference between
contributing to the information
available to a decision-making
body and participating in de
cision-making. Mr. McDonough's
personal conclusions are pre
mised upon his recognition of
that difference.
Publication of the views of Mr.
McDonough implies, I suppose,
an invitation to discussion and
argue about the existence of the
difference and the conclusion to
be drawn from its existence.
Mr. Randolph Bonner, in a
Guest Column in The Daily
April 28, tells us that the Mc
Donough "article ... is in dire
need of critical examination."
That may well be, but I hope
neither Mr. Bonner nor his read
ers think that such an examina
tion was contained in Thursday's
column.
Mr. Bonner's major thesis is
that Stanford fails to meet its
responsibility to (1) educate its
students and (2) prepare them
to make a contribution to soci
ety.
From this starting point, he
he argues that decisions have
been poorly made, else Stanford
would be meeting its responsi
bilities. Then he concludes that
if the decisions are "wrong,"
it must be because the wrong
people are making them.
This, I submit, does not con
stitute critical analysis of Mr.
McDonough's position. Notwith
standing Mr. Bonner's liberal
references to the McDonough
article he has neither analyzed
nor attacked the position taken
there.
In fact he has not even dealt
with the basic premise of Mr.
McDonough's views: the exist
ence of a distinction between be
ing heard before a decision is
made and making the decision.
The result of any decision
making process may be "wrong"
in any given instance. Mr. Bon
ner contends that the decision
making process at Stanford has
been wrong in an essential and
pervasive area. The McDonough
article has nothing to say about
the results of the decision-mak
ing process. It implicitly invites
comment on the process itself.
Mr. Bonner's assessment of
the need for critical analysis may
be quite correct, but he has only
cited a need; he has not filled it.

Editor, The Daily:
Re the letter of Messrs. Kley
meyer and Allison (The Daily,
April 25):
In a few weeks the directive
will be wafted down from the
ethereal "above", and the boys
from the corp yards will race
out with orders to knock down
the swallows nests, kill the baby
birds, and slop "goop" under all
the eaves to keep the birds from
"messing up" the walls.
