# Liquor Probe Launched
## 
### SUE HUDGENS 
The ASSU President, Speaker of the
Legislature, and a selected delegation
will discuss orderly implementation
of the new liquor regulations with
President Sterling.
The legislature referred to the Stu
dent Affairs Committee the preceding
resolution which would have allowed
consumption of alcoholic beverages
anywhere on the Stanford campus
with the exception of academic areas.
'Conflict' in Law
Sandy McKenzie, ASSU President,
agreed that the Board of Trustees did
not specify where students can have
liquor, but stated that a conflict in
law should be avoided.

"The decision of the Board of Trus
tees was a decisive victory," member
Martin Gerry stated. "We have been
sneaking it in for 65 years. Now we
can bring it in. We shouldn't try to
strongarm the administration."
Resolve Misunderstandings
According to McKenzie, the ASSU
committee will discuss the problem
with Sterling before May 10. He said
that if the group is unsuccessful, then
the first resolution will be brought out
of committee and presented to
LASSU. However, McKenzie stated, "I
have confidence that the misunder
standings can be resolved. I believe
we can convince them that our desires
are reasonable."
LASSU also passed a resolution to
refer the question of community gov
ernment to the Committee of Fifteen
to "explore the prospect and if possi
ble to develop a proposal." Sponsoreu
by the Speaker Jay Kadane, the legis
lation states that the establishment of
a community government would solve
many of the issues before the Com
mittee of Fifteen" and "would en
hance communications between the
various constituencies in the Univer
sity."
Election Ratified
The Legislature unanimously rati
fied the ASSU Presidential election
results, following a motion by Mike
Couzens, a representative and cam
paign manager for Bob Klein.

The Education Commission was ap
propriated $15 for a conference on
Methods of Undergraduate Instruc
tion to be held May 8. The meeting
will be concerned with senior collo
quia.
LASSU referred the following bills
to committee:
—A proposal to send NSA delegates
Sandy McKenzie and president-elect
David Harris to a meeting in Los An
geles.
—a definition of the role of the vice
speaker to by-laws.
—an amendment of sponsor selec
