# 'Aquawazoo' Rides Again
## 
### 

Hydrofolliea spectators will fret a wet reception Sunday at 2 p.m. as the Phi
Kap "Aquawazoo" makes its annual splashy appearance in Lag;. Initiated
in 1957 when a local boat company donated an old lifeboat, the event has be
come a regular feature of the Hydrofollies. The boat's water punips serve the
double duty of propelling' the boat and dousing the crowd. The annual "vic
tory" for the audience comes with the sinking of the craft. The present boat
is the third; its predecessors were unable to survive the rough treatment of
the sieges.
