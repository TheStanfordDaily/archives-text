In the heaviest voting in Stanford's
history, Dave Harris defeated Bob
Klein by a 565 vote margin, 2416 to
1851, for the ASSU presidency yester
day.
After the results were announced
at 6:30, Harris told The Daily "I think
that we are now at a point of history
where Stanford students have a beau
tiful opportunity to affect the course
of education at Stanford and in the
United States. Our move toward
change must be approached from the
attitude of thoughtful self-affirmation
that has characterized tins cam
paign."
Overseas Campus Vote
The total vote for both candidates
on the Stanford campus was Harris,
2352, Klein, 1733. All of the overseas
campuses, except Italy, reported their
results on Wednesday.
The results from Europe were:
Klein Harris
England 26 7
France 46 19
Germany 23 18
Austria 21 17
At Hopkins Marine Station in Mon
terey, four students cast ballots. The

results were two for Harris, two for
Klein.
Yesterday's vote total was 42%, the
largest for any student election ever
held at Stanford. The previous high
was 3993 for the 1955 final election.
3800 students turned out for last
year's election, which saw William
"Sandy" McKenzie win in a landslide.
In yesterday's election, approximate
ly 40 per cent of the student body
voted; in 1955, over 60 per cent voted.
Klein's Statement
Bob Klein, the defeated candidate,
said, "Under the leadership of Dave
Harris, this student community must
dedicate itself to a new emphasis on
educational reform within the context
of a larger educational community
containing faculty and administrators
who have made a vocational dedica
tion to the same goals."
Klein's running mate, Jan Jacobi,
made the following statement: "My
sincerest congratulations to Dave Har
ris on his election. I think he deserves
credit not only for his victory, but
also, and in my opinion, just as im
portant, for making this campaign the
most relevant and well conducted one
at Stanford in many years. We must
now close ranks behind Dave Harris
and support him in his efforts."
Problem-free Polls
Roger Bounds, elections commission
chairman, told The Daily, "There was
no trouble during the polling either
yesterday or the day before. A lot of
people expected Harris to win by a
larger margin, but I predicted a dif
ference of about 400 to 500 votes."
According to Bounds, the reason for
the record turnout was the character
of the two candidates. "They repre
sented two distinct and conflicting
sides of the student body," he said.
Twenty-nine ballots, added to the fi
nal total, were cast for write-in can
didates but were not counted in either
candidate's total due to a constitu
tional clause prohibiting write-in can
didates in a final election. One ab
sentee ballot was cast for Harris.
Student reaction to Harris' victory
was varied. A Roble freshman, Rissa
White, told this reporter, "I was so
excited I couldn't finish my dinner."
Mike Cohen, an El Capitan senior,
commented, "I thought Harris would
win by 75 per cent."
