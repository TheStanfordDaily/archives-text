# Student Report Studies Overseas Campuses
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
An ad hoc committee of the Overseas
Campus Board yesterday made public a report
calling for clarification of the goals of the
Overseas Campus Program and an overall re
evaluation of University policy concerning
the foreign campuses.
Steve Martindale, chairman of the com
mittee, told The Dally the report was the first
step in "initiating an informed dialogue" be
tween the alumni of the foreign campuses and
the Administration.
"The fact is that many people return from
an overseas campus dissatisfied and feeling
more could have been done," Martindale said.
Nation Rather Than European
While praising the overseas campuses as
"a forceful and thoughtful addition to the
undergraduate program," the committee re
port challenged the term "European experi
ence" as an adequate focus for the foreign
campus. "In essence, we suggest that the pro
gram should focus on the national, rather
than the European, experience," the report
concluded.
Overseas Campus Board, composed of

alumni from the various campuses, last fall
appointed the committee to review and evalu
ate the academic programs overseas. In the
past, Martindale noted, student criticism had
not been unified because of the lack of con
tinuity at overseas campuses.
"Dr. Walker gets more suggestions than
any other man on campus on how to do his
job," Martindale said. While acknowledging
the difficulty of dealing with individual criti
cisms, he said the committee report had estab
lished a starting point for further discussions.
Challenge Old Views
Citing the impossibility of exploring Euro
pean culture during six months at a foreign
campus, the report suggested a national focus
was better suited to challenge old views and
develop new perspectives.
"A close exploration of the traditions, cus
toms, culture, and values of a single cultural
area provides a much more concrete basis for
comparison with our own culture than does
a six month overview of Europe," the report
noted.
The committee blamed a lack of "clear
philosophical commitment" for the Univer

sity's frequent failure to emphasize areas of
the current program designed to take advan
tage of the culture of the host country. "While
there is a need for flexibility, there is no room
for ambiguity," the committee report main
tained.
Neither Final Nor Definitive
The report was sent to Robert Walker,
Director of the Overseas Campus Office, Dean
of Undergraduate Education Robert Wert, and

mittee's report appears on Page 4.

President Sterling late last month. Martin
dale's letter accompanying the report noted
that it was not meant to be "final or de
fintive," while expressing the committee's
strong support of the program.
Dr. Walker was unavailable for comment.
He is presently in Europe on his annual in
spection tour of the campuses and will return
this Thursday.
Turning to specific isues, the report called

for a more flexible academic program which
would allow students a choice of courses. Each
Stanford professor should teach two courses
per quarter with students being allowed to
choose between an advanced and an introduc
tory course.
Relevancy of CI ass work
The ad hoc committee also stressed the
importance of relevancy of classroom work
to the culture of the host nation. Declaring
"Stanford professors often cannot be found
to teach such relevant courses," the report
suggested instructors without tenure or native
professors be considered.
Among other proposals contained in the
report were the following:
• Elimination of the civilization course.
The course, given by native speakers, would
be replaced by a guest lecture series.
• An opportunity for indpendent work in
addition to the required language and lecture
courses.
• Field Trips. The director of each campus
should be given greater discretion in number,
location and length of field trips.
• Libraries. The size and quality of foreign

campus libraries should be increased with
funds from the University's general library
budget.
Isolation From Community
The report cited "isolation from the sur
rounding community" as a recurring problem
at some of the campuses. A member of the
faculty at each campus would be in charge
of getting information about the community
and assisting in family contacts.
In order to "initiate a focus on the culture
and current problem of the nation," the ad
hoc committee proposed all students be re
quired to take a two unit course in the civili
zation of their respective country prior to
going overseas.
"Too many students have such vague con
ceptions of what to expect at a foreign cam
pus that they spend a quarter and a half find
ing out what could have easily been learned
at Stanford," Martindale noted.
Martindale yesterday announced a discus
sion meeting of his ad hoc committee with
Stanford faculty members who have been to
the overseas campuses. The meeting is sched
uled for 8 p.m. May 10 in Tresidder Union.
