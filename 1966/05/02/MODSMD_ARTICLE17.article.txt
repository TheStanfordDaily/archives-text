# College Deferments: To Whose Advantage?
## 'Inequality' Of Draft System Makes Best Use Of Talent 
### DAVID HESKETT 
Before I begin "a defense of inequality let
me make two things clear.
In the first place I see no justification for
the draft, at least not in the terms usually
employed to defend it. If a military involve
ment is in the national interest presumably
the nationals will so decide by volunteering.
In the second place it seems to me that a
college student enjoys no superiority over his
less educated peers in any meaningful way:
moral, intellectual, or otherwise.
Assumptions
Let me begin with a series of assumptions:
1. In general a social system tries to provide
reward and privileges to an individual in pro
portion to the importance of his function in
society.
2. College trained personnel are vitally neces
sary to staff the hierarchy of this social order,
not only because they have been trained to do
so, but also, to put it crudely, because they
have acquired the manners of the managerial
class while at college.
3. There is a shortage of college trained per
sonnel. For an interesting discussion of this
problem see Monopoly Capital by Baran and
Sweezy. For empirical evidence see the "Help
Wanted" section of the local paper.
4. Students who are killed [after being
drafted] cannot perform tasks for this society
which vitally needs their services.
5. Students who survive the military experi
ence use their two years less productively
than they might.
â‚¬. Even if military service is in the national
interest, it is not the sole occupation which
helps the country.
Motivated to Finish
Points 1 and 2 mean that the social order
should encourage college training by the best
qualified. Draft deferment is an incentive,
and the more this is reduced, presumably, the
fewer individuals are motivated to finish their
education or the more motivated they are to
find other ways of obtaining a deferment.

The classic example of this is, or was, the
rush to get married prior to the expiration of
that deferment. Today one may get a defer
ment through parenthood; but the responsi
bilities and demands of fatherhood, such as
steady income, security, etc., often conflict
with the demands of education. Or one might
enlist for three or four years, but this also
discourages education, since even when the
student has a deferred status by reason of
prior service it is rather likely that he will
be in the reserves and again subject to call
with little prior notice.
A Talent Flow
Should the student-to-be die while serving,
his ability to produce or use his education
later does not exist. Thus the policy of an
nouncing students will be subject to the draft
may produce a talent flow into less educated
fields, or may end a student's education prior
to when he would have ended it of his own
free will.
Point three means that one does not aggra
vate a shortage if possible.
At some point of conflict highly trained per
sonnel may be all that is left, but until that
time arrives they should not be used, because,
points four and five, at best they are being
wasted or underutilized. If a student is killed,
about $10,000 invested in his education is lost,
not to mention his potential. If he is not killed
then two of his most productive years are not
used to their fullest.
Other Necessities
The finest point means that even if military
service is necessary, other things are at least
as necessary. On the domestic front there is a
real lack of trained personnel to carry out
such programs as are proposed for The Great
Society. College personnel could perform in
this area where often others could not.
Thus there are two reasons from society's
point of view for not drafting the college stu
dent.
In the first place it is a waste of personnel
who can least be wasted; at best it irrationally

underutilizes the college student; and, in the
second place, it utilizes him in the wrong way.
To draft a student into the army while domes
tic problems are blowing up in our faces
makes about as much sense as piping water
from our house to a neighbor's house while
our house is afire.
Other Uses
If national service in some institution is not
only necessary but must be compulsory, then
it seems to me that college students might be
compelled to serve in some way where their
training can be of real use. One might insti
tute some form of draft for VISTA or for the
proposed National Teacher Corps or allow a
student to fulfill his obligation by serving
SNCC or one of the organizations dedicated
to improving the society.
To demand, on the one hand, national ser
vice, and then, on the other hand, to limit it
to one form breeds waste. Although the coun
try can afford to waste some of its economic
resources, the waste of its human resources,
since there is not a glut on the market, can
only produce more ills, or allow the present
ones to build.
