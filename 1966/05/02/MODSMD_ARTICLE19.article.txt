# Students Suffer, But Better Able To Bear Draft Burden
## 
### CARL E. ANDERSON, JR 
If a debate over student exemption from
compulsory militaiy service—the draft—is to
have any value, it must at all times remain
within hailing distance of reality.
As a consequence, two facts must be recog
nized at the outset.
First, the draft exists and will continue to
exist regardless of whether or not students
are exempt. Those who wish to challenge the
draft per se would do well to choose another
line of attack rather than urging the exten
sion of student deferment from the draft.
Second, the United States is presently en
gaged in a large-scale military action which
requires the maintenance of a sizable force.
The government has expressed its intention to
continue this action and therefore to expand
the size of the military. If students are ex
cused from any obligation to serve, then more
persons will have to be called from other
areas.
Fait Accompli
We are thus faced in part with a fait ac
compli. The draft exists and, under present
conditions, is being fully utilized.
There are two possible reasons why students
should be exempt from the draft.
First, students might be said to be less pro
ficient at military service, that others would
be better able to carry out the duties. This is
not very likely. In any case, there is no evi
dence to this effect.
Second, arguably the work students are do
ing in school is of such importance as to ex
ceed the value they would have in the mili
tary. This second "reason" is, I think, the crux
of the debate.
Loss to Academe
There is little question that the academic
community suffers when capable students are
taken from their studies. But it is likewise
true that any enterprise suffers when capable
personnel are removed and any person suffers
when his activities are interrupted by an in
voluntary absence of any kind.

I contend that students are in most cases
better able to stand the sacrifice that military
service entails. Leaving school is less of a
burden than leaving a job. The student has a
wider range of alternatives open to him upon
discharge from the service and thus faces less
of a transition.
Further, the existing student deferment has
had a deleterious effect on the academic com
munity. That is, it has encouraged many per
sons to continue in attendance at school even
though they were not motivated by anything
resembling a desire to learn.
This tends to lower the level of interest in
scholarly development and acts to the detri
ment of the entire university. An absolute
student exemption would increase the number
of such parasites.
If we are to have compulsory military ser
vice, the manner of selection should be con
ducted in such a way as to have a minimal
effect on the outside decisions normally made
by the individuals affected.
'Buying' Way Out
Finally, an absolute student deferment
would serve to return the United States to a
system in which the more economically af
fluent classes could "buy" substitutes for mili
tary service, albeit indirectly. Despite the
seemingly endless list of foundations and
scholarships, it is costly and difficult to stay
in college until age 26.
I do not expect that many students will
share my view that students should not be
deferred from military service. The natural
instinct of self-interest dictates that one stay
away from the military until the last possible
moment —in the hope of avoiding the draft
somehow.
But I ask all to consider carefully the im
plications and results of student deferment.
Are we really so important? Does the stu
dent deferment work to the detriment of the
academic community? Are we, by our defer
ments, forcing someone else to a greater hard
ship?
