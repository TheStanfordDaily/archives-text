# Provost Admits CIA Research At Stanford
## 
### KIRK HANEN Staff Editor 
Hubert Heffner, associate provost
for research and professor of elec
trical engineering, denied yesterday
that Stanford's contract with the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency involves Uni
versity researchers in producing ma
terials for the war in Vietnam.
In a telephone interview with The
Daily, Heffner branded the story as
speculation but said that he was not
at liberty to disclose the nature of
the contract.
He reaffirmed reports that Stan
ford has a classified contract with the
CIA for engineering research.
"It involves nothing overseas," Heff
ner said of the agreement.
He categorically denied any "covert
or clandestine activities," adding
that the work "differed very little"
from the University's usual line of re
search.
John G. Linvill, Executive Head of
the Department of Electrical Engin
eering was out of town and unavail
able for comment.
However, the department's Associ
ate Head, Prof. Ralph Smith ex
pressed surprise when told of the ex
istence of such a contract:
"If something like this has come
up," he said, "it's news to me."
Non-Committal
In a statement issued last Thurs
day, Heffner had declined to reveal
the type of research involved or the
amount of the contract.
"All research contracts are re
viewed for their appropriateness to
the academic program by the depart
ments concerned before they are ac
cepted by Stanford."
"Further, Stanford will not know
ingly accept any contract or grant
in which the University is used as a
cover to clandestine activities," he
added.
Speculation about the nature of re
lations between the CIA and the na
tion's universities was raised early in
April by an article in Ramparts, a
Menlo Park-based magazine run by
Congressional hopeful Edward Keat
ing.
Front For CIA
The article named Michigan State
University as a front for CIA affairs
in Southeast Asia.
In later developments in the situ
ation, Dr. Max Millikan of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology re
vealed last Tuesday that his Center of
International Studies will have term
inated all CIA contracts by June.
Dr. Millikan said that the non-sec
ret contracts, which called for re
search on Communism and .Red China,
were terminated because they had
been "subject to misinterpretation."
