# Induction Day Begins A New Life
## Ticket To Ride 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Once a month a gi'oup of young
men gather in front of a nonde
script building in San Mateo.
It is the start of a new life for
them. Within six hours they will
be inducted into the military. By
the end of the day they will be
at Fort Ord or Camp Pendleton.
A former Stanford student,
who wishes to remain anony
mous, was part of the San Mateo
draft board's quota for April
Wednesday morning.
The Stanford student dropped
out of school last year. He had
been working in the student
bookstore since December, wait
ing to be drafted. His "Greet
ings" came a month ago, naming
April 27 as his day to join the
armed forces.
Days Start Early
This reporter, along with a
Daily editor and a photographer,
escorted the Stanford student
last Wednesday.

The day starts early for the
Army and we had to be at the
draft board at 6 a.m.
It has been said that pathos is
the main element of these month
ly draft board induction days,
but we underestimated what this
particular day was to mean to
168 draftees, their families, and
friends.
With Friends
The draftees arrived between
5:30 to 6:30, carrying overnight
bags filled with one change of
clothing, as required by the in
duction center. Sometimes they
came with friends, who dropped
them off and drove on. Others
came with their families or
wives. One draftee told a friend,
"I'v been married only seven
months."
Red Cross volunteers brought
two mobile units to the draft
board and served free coffee to
the inductees. They have been
serving coffee every induction

day at San Mateo since 1942.
During World War 11, they also
served coffee to the troop trains
going through San Mateo.
Mrs. Ruth Miles, a Red Cross
worker, said she has participated
in the program for the last
years. "This is one of the largest
groups I have ever seen," she
commented. Before the Vietnam
conflict was escalated, only 20 to
40 men were drafted each month
from San Mateo.
Small Conversation
Three other Red Cross mem
bers helped Mrs. Miles serve
coffee and make small conversa
tion with the draftees. One of
them was Rev. Robert Moran, of
Mt. Carmel Church, a Catholic
priest.
Some of the draftees appeared
to be not overly worried about
their induction and stood in
small groups talking and laugh
ing. Others kept to themselves,

obviously not overjoyed about
the two years that lay ahead.
At 6 a.m., the draft board em
ployees opend the doors and the
men streamed in to report and
pick up their bus tickets to the
Armed Forces Examining Sta
tion in Oakland.
•No Round trip Tickets'
The Stanford student mention
ed that all of these tickets were
an Army innovation. 'It's a
ticket to ride," he said, "And
there are no round-trip tickets."
The inductee in front of the
Stanford student had lost his in
duction orders. The Selective
Service staff solved the prob
lem by taking his number from
his draft card, then searching
through the 168 names until they
found the correct number. The
draftee appeared surprised that
his entry on the "delivery list"
was located so quickly. "You're
awfully nice about it,"he mum
bled.
Five Greyhound buses pulled
up, the draftees boarded them
for the ride to Oakland and
within minutes all 168 of them
were on their way to a two year
hitch in the armed forces.
Sworn In
When the inductees arrive in
Oakland, they are given hearing
and color blindness tests, then
are sworn into either the Army
or Marine Corps. The Marines
are taking approximately one
out of ten draftees of the April
quota.
By the end of the day all of
the men have been shorn, uni
formed, and tucked into bed by
their sergeants.
It was then 6:30 a.m. and the
draft board was empty with the
exception of three Daily report
ers and three draft board em
ployees.
The Stanford student was
gone.

smile he noted, "They only give you a one-way
ticket on this line."

Once a month a gi'oup of young
men gather in front of a nonde
script building in San Mateo.
It is the start of a new life for
them. Within six hours they will
be inducted into the military. By
the end of the day they will be
at Fort Ord or Camp Pendleton.
A former Stanford student,
who wishes to remain anony
mous, was part of the San Mateo
draft board's quota for April
Wednesday morning.
The Stanford student dropped
out of school last year. He had
been working in the student
bookstore since December, wait
ing to be drafted. His "Greet
ings" came a month ago, naming
April 27 as his day to join the
armed forces.
Days Start Early
This reporter, along with a
Daily editor and a photographer,
escorted the Stanford student
last Wednesday.

The day starts early for the
Army and we had to be at the
draft board at 6 a.m.
It has been said that pathos is
the main element of these month
ly draft board induction days,
but we underestimated what this
particular day was to mean to
168 draftees, their families, and
friends.
With Friends
The draftees arrived between
5:30 to 6:30, carrying overnight
bags filled with one change of
clothing, as required by the in
duction center. Sometimes they
came with friends, who dropped
them off and drove on. Others
came with their families or
wives. One draftee told a friend,
"I'v been married only seven
months."
Red Cross volunteers brought
two mobile units to the draft
board and served free coffee to
the inductees. They have been
serving coffee every induction

day at San Mateo since 1942.
During World War 11, they also
served coffee to the troop trains
going through San Mateo.
Mrs. Ruth Miles, a Red Cross
worker, said she has participated
in the program for the last
years. "This is one of the largest
groups I have ever seen," she
commented. Before the Vietnam
conflict was escalated, only 20 to
40 men were drafted each month
from San Mateo.
Small Conversation
Three other Red Cross mem
bers helped Mrs. Miles serve
coffee and make small conversa
tion with the draftees. One of
them was Rev. Robert Moran, of
Mt. Carmel Church, a Catholic
priest.
Some of the draftees appeared
to be not overly worried about
their induction and stood in
small groups talking and laugh
ing. Others kept to themselves,

obviously not overjoyed about
the two years that lay ahead.
At 6 a.m., the draft board em
ployees opend the doors and the
men streamed in to report and
pick up their bus tickets to the
Armed Forces Examining Sta
tion in Oakland.
•No Round trip Tickets'
The Stanford student mention
ed that all of these tickets were
an Army innovation. 'It's a
ticket to ride," he said, "And
there are no round-trip tickets."
The inductee in front of the
Stanford student had lost his in
duction orders. The Selective
Service staff solved the prob
lem by taking his number from
his draft card, then searching
through the 168 names until they
found the correct number. The
draftee appeared surprised that
his entry on the "delivery list"
was located so quickly. "You're
awfully nice about it,"he mum
bled.
Five Greyhound buses pulled
up, the draftees boarded them
for the ride to Oakland and
within minutes all 168 of them
were on their way to a two year
hitch in the armed forces.
Sworn In
When the inductees arrive in
Oakland, they are given hearing
and color blindness tests, then
are sworn into either the Army
or Marine Corps. The Marines
are taking approximately one
out of ten draftees of the April
quota.
By the end of the day all of
the men have been shorn, uni
formed, and tucked into bed by
their sergeants.
It was then 6:30 a.m. and the
draft board was empty with the
exception of three Daily report
ers and three draft board em
ployees.
The Stanford student was
gone.

Once a month a gi'oup of young
men gather in front of a nonde
script building in San Mateo.
It is the start of a new life for
them. Within six hours they will
be inducted into the military. By
the end of the day they will be
at Fort Ord or Camp Pendleton.
A former Stanford student,
who wishes to remain anony
mous, was part of the San Mateo
draft board's quota for April
Wednesday morning.
The Stanford student dropped
out of school last year. He had
been working in the student
bookstore since December, wait
ing to be drafted. His "Greet
ings" came a month ago, naming
April 27 as his day to join the
armed forces.
Days Start Early
This reporter, along with a
Daily editor and a photographer,
escorted the Stanford student
last Wednesday.

The day starts early for the
Army and we had to be at the
draft board at 6 a.m.
It has been said that pathos is
the main element of these month
ly draft board induction days,
but we underestimated what this
particular day was to mean to
168 draftees, their families, and
friends.
With Friends
The draftees arrived between
5:30 to 6:30, carrying overnight
bags filled with one change of
clothing, as required by the in
duction center. Sometimes they
came with friends, who dropped
them off and drove on. Others
came with their families or
wives. One draftee told a friend,
"I'v been married only seven
months."
Red Cross volunteers brought
two mobile units to the draft
board and served free coffee to
the inductees. They have been
serving coffee every induction

day at San Mateo since 1942.
During World War 11, they also
served coffee to the troop trains
going through San Mateo.
Mrs. Ruth Miles, a Red Cross
worker, said she has participated
in the program for the last
years. "This is one of the largest
groups I have ever seen," she
commented. Before the Vietnam
conflict was escalated, only 20 to
40 men were drafted each month
from San Mateo.
Small Conversation
Three other Red Cross mem
bers helped Mrs. Miles serve
coffee and make small conversa
tion with the draftees. One of
them was Rev. Robert Moran, of
Mt. Carmel Church, a Catholic
priest.
Some of the draftees appeared
to be not overly worried about
their induction and stood in
small groups talking and laugh
ing. Others kept to themselves,

obviously not overjoyed about
the two years that lay ahead.
At 6 a.m., the draft board em
ployees opend the doors and the
men streamed in to report and
pick up their bus tickets to the
Armed Forces Examining Sta
tion in Oakland.
•No Round trip Tickets'
The Stanford student mention
ed that all of these tickets were
an Army innovation. 'It's a
ticket to ride," he said, "And
there are no round-trip tickets."
The inductee in front of the
Stanford student had lost his in
duction orders. The Selective
Service staff solved the prob
lem by taking his number from
his draft card, then searching
through the 168 names until they
found the correct number. The
draftee appeared surprised that
his entry on the "delivery list"
was located so quickly. "You're
awfully nice about it,"he mum
bled.
Five Greyhound buses pulled
up, the draftees boarded them
for the ride to Oakland and
within minutes all 168 of them
were on their way to a two year
hitch in the armed forces.
Sworn In
When the inductees arrive in
Oakland, they are given hearing
and color blindness tests, then
are sworn into either the Army
or Marine Corps. The Marines
are taking approximately one
out of ten draftees of the April
quota.
By the end of the day all of
the men have been shorn, uni
formed, and tucked into bed by
their sergeants.
It was then 6:30 a.m. and the
draft board was empty with the
exception of three Daily report
ers and three draft board em
ployees.
The Stanford student was
