# Text Of Report On Overseas Campuses
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the report of the Ad-Hoc
Committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board on Academic Affairs.
The Committee, oomponed of
approximately 30 undergradu
ates and chaired by Steve Mar
tindale, was formed Autumn
Quarter at the request of the
Overseas Campus Board.)
Goals Of Program
The primary purpose of the
Overseas Campus program is to
further the liberal education of
Stanford students as an exten
sion of the General Studies pro
gram.
As such, the program of study
abroad must be seen as an edu
cative process and must not be
considered merely an opportuni
ty for tourism or for an ex
tended vacation.
By including a foreign study
program in its liberal education
process, Stanford intends to de
velop new perspectives and in
sights in the students, especially
toward themselves and toward
their own American culture.
To provide these new perspec
tives, the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, as now de
fined, is designed to promote a
"European Experience," as well

as a closer academic community.
Although we understand that
the term "European Experience"
serves as a convenient capsule
description of the Overseas Cam
pus program, we question the
term's value as a focus for the
direction of that program. For
it seems that there are two pos
sible approaches to study in Eu
rope: one can attempt to take
on Europe as a whole, or one can
concentrate on the host country'
and its culture as a part of Eu
rope.
In essence, we suggest that
the program should focus on the
national, rather than the Euro
pean, experience.
In evaluating the program's
emphasis, two main questions
must be considered:
Which emphasis — national or
European — is more feasible for
the Stanford program, and
which approach will contribute
more to a liberal education and
the development of a new pers
pective toward our American
culture?
Experience Too Broad
Concerning the feasibility of a
European experience within the
six months at a Stanford center,
it is important to note that the

students must spend their time
primarily within their respective
countries.
Time limitations and the spe
cific locations of the campuses
discourage longdistance travel.
These limitations, along with the
language barrier, make personal
contact with people in other
countries most difficult.
By contrast, student contact
and travel within the given na
tional, or in the case of Austria,
cultural, area of each Stanford
center has proved most fruitful.
An academic program which
attempts to deal with Europe
as a whole is an undertaking far
too broad for the six month pe
riod. Furthermore, such an at
tempt fails to make full use of
the potential for a meaningful
study of one culture.
Primary Goal
In the end we must look back
to the primary goal of the pro
gram: the development of new
perspectives and insights in
Stanford students.
New perspectives arise only
when old views are challenged.
A close exploration of the tradi
tions, customs, culture, and val
ues of a single cultural area pro
vides a much more concrete

basis for comparison with our
own culture than does a six
month overview of Europe. A
thorough introduction to one
country can stimulate the pro
found thinking which is the
basis of a liberal education.
In addition then to being the
most feasible direction of the
program, the national emphasis
would contribute the most to a
liberal education.
National Emphasis
It is true that Stanford has
already adapted much of its pro
gram to the national emphasis.
Courses tend to pertain to the
host country, local staff are
hired to teach the language, and
the University aims to promote
good relations with the local
community.
But because no clear philoso
phical commitment supports
these tendencies, the national fo
cus is often not achieved. While
there is a need for flexibility,
there is no room for ambiguity.
An ambiguous University pol
icy can only lead to confusion
and disappointment among its
students.
R«*-Evaliiat.ion Essential
Since over half of Stanford's
undergraduates will now have

the oportunity to attend Stan
ford centers abroad, the direc
tion of the program must be
made clear. We feel that a re
evaluation of University policy
is essential.
Although this report is writ
ten from the students' perspec
tive, it is hoped that it will pro
vide a starting point for further
exploration and policy changes
on the part of the faculty and
administration.
Topics For Discussion
COURSE RELEVANCE: Cour
ses taught at the Overseas Cam
puses should always be relevant
to the native culture. While we
hope that Stanford profes
sors would be the first to be
sought, they often cannot be
found to teach such relevant
courses.
Other sources, then, should be
tapped. These could include for
eign professors or Stanford in
structors without tenure who
are enthusiastic and recognized
as being capable men.
In order to implement the
above policy we propose a com
mittee to evaluate the current
process of professor selection.
This committee should consist
of two students, two faculty

members and two administra
tors.
FLEXIBLE ACADEMIC PRO
GRAM: Broader choice of
courses at the Overseas Campus
es would allow for a greater
range of student interests. A
student is likely to be more high
ly motivated when he has some
role in the planning of his aca
demic program.
A fully prescribed set of
courses is often viewed as a
kind of academic prison, and
can stifle active participation in
course work.
All students going overseas,
unless given special permission,
should be required to take be
fore departure a two unit course
concerning the civilization of
their respective countries.
Such a course would give the
student some idea of the culture
to which he is to be exposed,
and would hopefully inspire in
terest in specific topics or issues,
leading to a more directed ap
proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.
Alternative Courses
Each Stanford professor should
offer two courses instead of one.
This would both recognize the
needs of the more advanced stu
dents and provide more oppor
tunity for small group work.
One of the courses should
most often deal with a more
general topic, like "Introduction
to the French Novel," while the
other should be more specific,
for example: "Marccl Proust."
If the general course is of
fered at home the student
should be allowed to take it, so
that he has the necessary back
ground to pursue advanced work
overseas.
But whether or not the stu
dent has taken the general
course at home, he should have
the option to take the advanced
course overseas; there are many
cases where the student has
studied beyond the point of the
general course offered overseas
without having taken it.
If an imbalance in the number
of students enrolled in each
class arises, so much the better.
The seminar format is uniquely
suited to the Overseas Campus
atmosphere with its close con
tact between student and pro
fessor.
We suggest that one way to
implement this program would
be to have each professor over
lap two groups, and teach the
same courses to each group. The
professors would still teach a
total of two courses, either both
lecture, or one lecture and one
seminar, depending on the en
rollment.
Optional Course
Since the civilization course
would be taught before depar
ture, we propose in its stead an
optional two to three unit
course each quarter, to be
taught by a native professor.
In addition there should be
offered in the second quarter
another course taught in the for
eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal
of relevance to the cultural
area.
The professor would generally
be the Academic Director. If he
could not, or would not, teach
such courses, then a native pro
fessor should be hired.
14 Units Total
In summary, 14 units would
be required of each student, six
in the foreign language, and
four each in the courses he
elects to take from the Stanford

professors. Elective units beyond
this might consist of:
• The optional courses men
tioned above.
• Directed reading.
• Papers in the c o u r s e s of
fered.
• Continuation of home cam
pus honors programs
• Senior Colloquia.
FIELD TRIPS: Different
countries have different possi
bilities for field trips. We pro
pose, therefore, that within the
academic requirements of a
Stanford quarter, the number,
location, length and scheduling
of field trips be determined for
each campus by its local direc
tors.
COMMUNITY' AND CULTUR
AL RELATIONS: A recurring
problem at each of the campuses
has been isolation from the sur
rounding community. In order
to encourage greater contact,
we make the following propo
sals:
Community Relations
That community relations be
organized to provide continuity
from group to group.
Responsibility for getting in
formation about community ac
tivities should be delegated to
some specific person on each
campus, such as Mile, de Renus
son at Tours. Resident Assist
ants and secretaries are other
possibilities.
Contact with surrounding uni
versities should be established
on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni
ties available at each campus
in the Stanford office so that
students may anticipate and
plan for activities outside of the
formal program.
Students participating in any
regularly scheduled community
activity should receive activity
credit.
Guest Lecturers
Since the guest lecture will no
longer be a part of the civiliza
tion program, we propose that
the time and effort spent in
gathering many guest lecturers
could be better spent on a guest
in-residence program.
Getting to know a few people
and their ideas well is far more
valuable to the student than the
superficial contact afforded by
a series of one hour lectures.
IMPROVEMENT OF LI
BRARIES: If the proposed aca
demic program is to be feasible,
much better libraries will be
needed.
A committee composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration
and library staff members
should be formed to investigate
possibilities for improving the
current library system. This
committee should be authorized
to effect such changes as it
deems necessary and to main
tain high quality libraries
through periodic review.
Book Catalogue
Present book purchasing pro
cedures often entail unnecessary
cost and duplication. To facili
tate more efficient purchase of
books and planning of courses,
a catalogue of books at each of
the libraries should be made
available to students and profes
sors at the home campus.
With over half of Stanford
undergraduates now spending
two quarters abroad, the added
costs of library improvement
are certainly warranted. We pro
pose that instead of relying
solely on the Overseas Campus
budget, the foreign campus li
braries should be allocated a
share of the general library
budget.

on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni
ties available at each campus
in the Stanford office so that
students may anticipate and
plan for activities outside of the
formal program.
Students participating in any
regularly scheduled community
activity should receive activity
credit.
Guest Lecturers
Since the guest lecture will no
longer be a part of the civiliza
tion program, we propose that
the time and effort spent in
gathering many guest lecturers
could be better spent on a guest
in-residence program.
Getting to know a few people
and their ideas well is far more
valuable to the student than the
superficial contact afforded by
a series of one hour lectures.
IMPROVEMENT OF LI
BRARIES: If the proposed aca
demic program is to be feasible,
much better libraries will be
needed.
A committee composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration
and library staff members
should be formed to investigate
possibilities for improving the
current library system. This
committee should be authorized
to effect such changes as it
deems necessary and to main
tain high quality libraries
through periodic review.
Book Catalogue
Present book purchasing pro
cedures often entail unnecessary
cost and duplication. To facili
tate more efficient purchase of
books and planning of courses,
a catalogue of books at each of
the libraries should be made
available to students and profes
sors at the home campus.
With over half of Stanford
undergraduates now spending
two quarters abroad, the added
costs of library improvement
are certainly warranted. We pro
pose that instead of relying
solely on the Overseas Campus
budget, the foreign campus li
braries should be allocated a
share of the general library
budget.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the report of the Ad-Hoc
Committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board on Academic Affairs.
The Committee, oomponed of
approximately 30 undergradu
ates and chaired by Steve Mar
tindale, was formed Autumn
Quarter at the request of the
Overseas Campus Board.)
Goals Of Program
The primary purpose of the
Overseas Campus program is to
further the liberal education of
Stanford students as an exten
sion of the General Studies pro
gram.
As such, the program of study
abroad must be seen as an edu
cative process and must not be
considered merely an opportuni
ty for tourism or for an ex
tended vacation.
By including a foreign study
program in its liberal education
process, Stanford intends to de
velop new perspectives and in
sights in the students, especially
toward themselves and toward
their own American culture.
To provide these new perspec
tives, the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, as now de
fined, is designed to promote a
"European Experience," as well

as a closer academic community.
Although we understand that
the term "European Experience"
serves as a convenient capsule
description of the Overseas Cam
pus program, we question the
term's value as a focus for the
direction of that program. For
it seems that there are two pos
sible approaches to study in Eu
rope: one can attempt to take
on Europe as a whole, or one can
concentrate on the host country'
and its culture as a part of Eu
rope.
In essence, we suggest that
the program should focus on the
national, rather than the Euro
pean, experience.
In evaluating the program's
emphasis, two main questions
must be considered:
Which emphasis — national or
European — is more feasible for
the Stanford program, and
which approach will contribute
more to a liberal education and
the development of a new pers
pective toward our American
culture?
Experience Too Broad
Concerning the feasibility of a
European experience within the
six months at a Stanford center,
it is important to note that the

students must spend their time
primarily within their respective
countries.
Time limitations and the spe
cific locations of the campuses
discourage longdistance travel.
These limitations, along with the
language barrier, make personal
contact with people in other
countries most difficult.
By contrast, student contact
and travel within the given na
tional, or in the case of Austria,
cultural, area of each Stanford
center has proved most fruitful.
An academic program which
attempts to deal with Europe
as a whole is an undertaking far
too broad for the six month pe
riod. Furthermore, such an at
tempt fails to make full use of
the potential for a meaningful
study of one culture.
Primary Goal
In the end we must look back
to the primary goal of the pro
gram: the development of new
perspectives and insights in
Stanford students.
New perspectives arise only
when old views are challenged.
A close exploration of the tradi
tions, customs, culture, and val
ues of a single cultural area pro
vides a much more concrete

basis for comparison with our
own culture than does a six
month overview of Europe. A
thorough introduction to one
country can stimulate the pro
found thinking which is the
basis of a liberal education.
In addition then to being the
most feasible direction of the
program, the national emphasis
would contribute the most to a
liberal education.
National Emphasis
It is true that Stanford has
already adapted much of its pro
gram to the national emphasis.
Courses tend to pertain to the
host country, local staff are
hired to teach the language, and
the University aims to promote
good relations with the local
community.
But because no clear philoso
phical commitment supports
these tendencies, the national fo
cus is often not achieved. While
there is a need for flexibility,
there is no room for ambiguity.
An ambiguous University pol
icy can only lead to confusion
and disappointment among its
students.
R«*-Evaliiat.ion Essential
Since over half of Stanford's
undergraduates will now have

the oportunity to attend Stan
ford centers abroad, the direc
tion of the program must be
made clear. We feel that a re
evaluation of University policy
is essential.
Although this report is writ
ten from the students' perspec
tive, it is hoped that it will pro
vide a starting point for further
exploration and policy changes
on the part of the faculty and
administration.
Topics For Discussion
COURSE RELEVANCE: Cour
ses taught at the Overseas Cam
puses should always be relevant
to the native culture. While we
hope that Stanford profes
sors would be the first to be
sought, they often cannot be
found to teach such relevant
courses.
Other sources, then, should be
tapped. These could include for
eign professors or Stanford in
structors without tenure who
are enthusiastic and recognized
as being capable men.
In order to implement the
above policy we propose a com
mittee to evaluate the current
process of professor selection.
This committee should consist
of two students, two faculty

members and two administra
tors.
FLEXIBLE ACADEMIC PRO
GRAM: Broader choice of
courses at the Overseas Campus
es would allow for a greater
range of student interests. A
student is likely to be more high
ly motivated when he has some
role in the planning of his aca
demic program.
A fully prescribed set of
courses is often viewed as a
kind of academic prison, and
can stifle active participation in
course work.
All students going overseas,
unless given special permission,
should be required to take be
fore departure a two unit course
concerning the civilization of
their respective countries.
Such a course would give the
student some idea of the culture
to which he is to be exposed,
and would hopefully inspire in
terest in specific topics or issues,
leading to a more directed ap
proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.
Alternative Courses
Each Stanford professor should
offer two courses instead of one.
This would both recognize the
needs of the more advanced stu
dents and provide more oppor
tunity for small group work.
One of the courses should
most often deal with a more
general topic, like "Introduction
to the French Novel," while the
other should be more specific,
for example: "Marccl Proust."
If the general course is of
fered at home the student
should be allowed to take it, so
that he has the necessary back
ground to pursue advanced work
overseas.
But whether or not the stu
dent has taken the general
course at home, he should have
the option to take the advanced
course overseas; there are many
cases where the student has
studied beyond the point of the
general course offered overseas
without having taken it.
If an imbalance in the number
of students enrolled in each
class arises, so much the better.
The seminar format is uniquely
suited to the Overseas Campus
atmosphere with its close con
tact between student and pro
fessor.
We suggest that one way to
implement this program would
be to have each professor over
lap two groups, and teach the
same courses to each group. The
professors would still teach a
total of two courses, either both
lecture, or one lecture and one
seminar, depending on the en
rollment.
Optional Course
Since the civilization course
would be taught before depar
ture, we propose in its stead an
optional two to three unit
course each quarter, to be
taught by a native professor.
In addition there should be
offered in the second quarter
another course taught in the for
eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal
of relevance to the cultural
area.
The professor would generally
be the Academic Director. If he
could not, or would not, teach
such courses, then a native pro
fessor should be hired.
14 Units Total
In summary, 14 units would
be required of each student, six
in the foreign language, and
four each in the courses he
elects to take from the Stanford

professors. Elective units beyond
this might consist of:
• The optional courses men
tioned above.
• Directed reading.
• Papers in the c o u r s e s of
fered.
• Continuation of home cam
pus honors programs
• Senior Colloquia.
FIELD TRIPS: Different
countries have different possi
bilities for field trips. We pro
pose, therefore, that within the
academic requirements of a
Stanford quarter, the number,
location, length and scheduling
of field trips be determined for
each campus by its local direc
tors.
COMMUNITY' AND CULTUR
AL RELATIONS: A recurring
problem at each of the campuses
has been isolation from the sur
rounding community. In order
to encourage greater contact,
we make the following propo
sals:
Community Relations
That community relations be
organized to provide continuity
from group to group.
Responsibility for getting in
formation about community ac
tivities should be delegated to
some specific person on each
campus, such as Mile, de Renus
son at Tours. Resident Assist
ants and secretaries are other
possibilities.
Contact with surrounding uni
versities should be established
on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni

eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal
of relevance to the cultural
area.
The professor would generally
be the Academic Director. If he
could not, or would not, teach
such courses, then a native pro
fessor should be hired.
14 Units Total
In summary, 14 units would
be required of each student, six
in the foreign language, and
four each in the courses he
elects to take from the Stanford

professors. Elective units beyond
this might consist of:
• The optional courses men
tioned above.
• Directed reading.
• Papers in the c o u r s e s of
fered.
• Continuation of home cam
pus honors programs
• Senior Colloquia.
FIELD TRIPS: Different
countries have different possi
bilities for field trips. We pro
pose, therefore, that within the
academic requirements of a
Stanford quarter, the number,
location, length and scheduling
of field trips be determined for
each campus by its local direc
tors.
COMMUNITY' AND CULTUR
AL RELATIONS: A recurring
problem at each of the campuses
has been isolation from the sur
rounding community. In order
to encourage greater contact,
we make the following propo
sals:
Community Relations
That community relations be
organized to provide continuity
from group to group.
Responsibility for getting in
formation about community ac
tivities should be delegated to
some specific person on each
campus, such as Mile, de Renus
son at Tours. Resident Assist
ants and secretaries are other
possibilities.
Contact with surrounding uni
versities should be established
on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni
ties available at each campus
in the Stanford office so that
students may anticipate and
plan for activities outside of the
formal program.
Students participating in any
regularly scheduled community
activity should receive activity
credit.
Guest Lecturers
Since the guest lecture will no
longer be a part of the civiliza
tion program, we propose that
the time and effort spent in
gathering many guest lecturers
could be better spent on a guest
in-residence program.
Getting to know a few people
and their ideas well is far more
valuable to the student than the
superficial contact afforded by
a series of one hour lectures.
IMPROVEMENT OF LI
BRARIES: If the proposed aca
demic program is to be feasible,
much better libraries will be
needed.
A committee composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration
and library staff members
should be formed to investigate
possibilities for improving the
current library system. This
committee should be authorized
to effect such changes as it
deems necessary and to main
tain high quality libraries
through periodic review.
Book Catalogue
Present book purchasing pro
cedures often entail unnecessary
cost and duplication. To facili
tate more efficient purchase of
books and planning of courses,
a catalogue of books at each of
the libraries should be made
available to students and profes
sors at the home campus.
With over half of Stanford
undergraduates now spending
two quarters abroad, the added
costs of library improvement
are certainly warranted. We pro
pose that instead of relying
solely on the Overseas Campus
budget, the foreign campus li
braries should be allocated a
share of the general library
budget.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the report of the Ad-Hoc
Committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board on Academic Affairs.
The Committee, oomponed of
approximately 30 undergradu
ates and chaired by Steve Mar
tindale, was formed Autumn
Quarter at the request of the
Overseas Campus Board.)
Goals Of Program
The primary purpose of the
Overseas Campus program is to
further the liberal education of
Stanford students as an exten
sion of the General Studies pro
gram.
As such, the program of study
abroad must be seen as an edu
cative process and must not be
considered merely an opportuni
ty for tourism or for an ex
tended vacation.
By including a foreign study
program in its liberal education
process, Stanford intends to de
velop new perspectives and in
sights in the students, especially
toward themselves and toward
their own American culture.
To provide these new perspec
tives, the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, as now de
fined, is designed to promote a
"European Experience," as well

as a closer academic community.
Although we understand that
the term "European Experience"
serves as a convenient capsule
description of the Overseas Cam
pus program, we question the
term's value as a focus for the
direction of that program. For
it seems that there are two pos
sible approaches to study in Eu
rope: one can attempt to take
on Europe as a whole, or one can
concentrate on the host country'
and its culture as a part of Eu
rope.
In essence, we suggest that
the program should focus on the
national, rather than the Euro
pean, experience.
In evaluating the program's
emphasis, two main questions
must be considered:
Which emphasis — national or
European — is more feasible for
the Stanford program, and
which approach will contribute
more to a liberal education and
the development of a new pers
pective toward our American
culture?
Experience Too Broad
Concerning the feasibility of a
European experience within the
six months at a Stanford center,
it is important to note that the

students must spend their time
primarily within their respective
countries.
Time limitations and the spe
cific locations of the campuses
discourage longdistance travel.
These limitations, along with the
language barrier, make personal
contact with people in other
countries most difficult.
By contrast, student contact
and travel within the given na
tional, or in the case of Austria,
cultural, area of each Stanford
center has proved most fruitful.
An academic program which
attempts to deal with Europe
as a whole is an undertaking far
too broad for the six month pe
riod. Furthermore, such an at
tempt fails to make full use of
the potential for a meaningful
study of one culture.
Primary Goal
In the end we must look back
to the primary goal of the pro
gram: the development of new
perspectives and insights in
Stanford students.
New perspectives arise only
when old views are challenged.
A close exploration of the tradi
tions, customs, culture, and val
ues of a single cultural area pro
vides a much more concrete

basis for comparison with our
own culture than does a six
month overview of Europe. A
thorough introduction to one
country can stimulate the pro
found thinking which is the
basis of a liberal education.
In addition then to being the
most feasible direction of the
program, the national emphasis
would contribute the most to a
liberal education.
National Emphasis
It is true that Stanford has
already adapted much of its pro
gram to the national emphasis.
Courses tend to pertain to the
host country, local staff are
hired to teach the language, and
the University aims to promote
good relations with the local
community.
But because no clear philoso
phical commitment supports
these tendencies, the national fo
cus is often not achieved. While
there is a need for flexibility,
there is no room for ambiguity.
An ambiguous University pol
icy can only lead to confusion
and disappointment among its
students.
R«*-Evaliiat.ion Essential
Since over half of Stanford's
undergraduates will now have

the oportunity to attend Stan
ford centers abroad, the direc
tion of the program must be
made clear. We feel that a re
evaluation of University policy
is essential.
Although this report is writ
ten from the students' perspec
tive, it is hoped that it will pro
vide a starting point for further
exploration and policy changes
on the part of the faculty and
administration.
Topics For Discussion
COURSE RELEVANCE: Cour
ses taught at the Overseas Cam
puses should always be relevant
to the native culture. While we
hope that Stanford profes
sors would be the first to be
sought, they often cannot be
found to teach such relevant
courses.
Other sources, then, should be
tapped. These could include for
eign professors or Stanford in
structors without tenure who
are enthusiastic and recognized
as being capable men.
In order to implement the
above policy we propose a com
mittee to evaluate the current
process of professor selection.
This committee should consist
of two students, two faculty

members and two administra
tors.
FLEXIBLE ACADEMIC PRO
GRAM: Broader choice of
courses at the Overseas Campus
es would allow for a greater
range of student interests. A
student is likely to be more high
ly motivated when he has some
role in the planning of his aca
demic program.
A fully prescribed set of
courses is often viewed as a
kind of academic prison, and
can stifle active participation in
course work.
All students going overseas,
unless given special permission,
should be required to take be
fore departure a two unit course
concerning the civilization of
their respective countries.
Such a course would give the
student some idea of the culture
to which he is to be exposed,
and would hopefully inspire in
terest in specific topics or issues,
leading to a more directed ap
proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.
Alternative Courses
Each Stanford professor should
offer two courses instead of one.
This would both recognize the
needs of the more advanced stu
dents and provide more oppor
tunity for small group work.
One of the courses should
most often deal with a more
general topic, like "Introduction
to the French Novel," while the
other should be more specific,
for example: "Marccl Proust."
If the general course is of
fered at home the student
should be allowed to take it, so
that he has the necessary back
ground to pursue advanced work
overseas.
But whether or not the stu
dent has taken the general
course at home, he should have
the option to take the advanced
course overseas; there are many
cases where the student has
studied beyond the point of the
general course offered overseas
without having taken it.
If an imbalance in the number
of students enrolled in each
class arises, so much the better.
The seminar format is uniquely
suited to the Overseas Campus
atmosphere with its close con
tact between student and pro
fessor.
We suggest that one way to
implement this program would
be to have each professor over
lap two groups, and teach the
same courses to each group. The
professors would still teach a
total of two courses, either both
lecture, or one lecture and one
seminar, depending on the en
rollment.
Optional Course
Since the civilization course
would be taught before depar
ture, we propose in its stead an
optional two to three unit
course each quarter, to be
taught by a native professor.
In addition there should be
offered in the second quarter
another course taught in the for
eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal

proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.
Alternative Courses
Each Stanford professor should
offer two courses instead of one.
This would both recognize the
needs of the more advanced stu
dents and provide more oppor
tunity for small group work.
One of the courses should
most often deal with a more
general topic, like "Introduction
to the French Novel," while the
other should be more specific,
for example: "Marccl Proust."
If the general course is of
fered at home the student
should be allowed to take it, so
that he has the necessary back
ground to pursue advanced work
overseas.
But whether or not the stu
dent has taken the general
course at home, he should have
the option to take the advanced
course overseas; there are many
cases where the student has
studied beyond the point of the
general course offered overseas
without having taken it.
If an imbalance in the number
of students enrolled in each
class arises, so much the better.
The seminar format is uniquely
suited to the Overseas Campus
atmosphere with its close con
tact between student and pro
fessor.
We suggest that one way to
implement this program would
be to have each professor over
lap two groups, and teach the
same courses to each group. The
professors would still teach a
total of two courses, either both
lecture, or one lecture and one
seminar, depending on the en
rollment.
Optional Course
Since the civilization course
would be taught before depar
ture, we propose in its stead an
optional two to three unit
course each quarter, to be
taught by a native professor.
In addition there should be
offered in the second quarter
another course taught in the for
eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal
of relevance to the cultural
area.
The professor would generally
be the Academic Director. If he
could not, or would not, teach
such courses, then a native pro
fessor should be hired.
14 Units Total
In summary, 14 units would
be required of each student, six
in the foreign language, and
four each in the courses he
elects to take from the Stanford

professors. Elective units beyond
this might consist of:
• The optional courses men
tioned above.
• Directed reading.
• Papers in the c o u r s e s of
fered.
• Continuation of home cam
pus honors programs
• Senior Colloquia.
FIELD TRIPS: Different
countries have different possi
bilities for field trips. We pro
pose, therefore, that within the
academic requirements of a
Stanford quarter, the number,
location, length and scheduling
of field trips be determined for
each campus by its local direc
tors.
COMMUNITY' AND CULTUR
AL RELATIONS: A recurring
problem at each of the campuses
has been isolation from the sur
rounding community. In order
to encourage greater contact,
we make the following propo
sals:
Community Relations
That community relations be
organized to provide continuity
from group to group.
Responsibility for getting in
formation about community ac
tivities should be delegated to
some specific person on each
campus, such as Mile, de Renus
son at Tours. Resident Assist
ants and secretaries are other
possibilities.
Contact with surrounding uni
versities should be established
on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni
ties available at each campus
in the Stanford office so that
students may anticipate and
plan for activities outside of the
formal program.
Students participating in any
regularly scheduled community
activity should receive activity
credit.
Guest Lecturers
Since the guest lecture will no
longer be a part of the civiliza
tion program, we propose that
the time and effort spent in
gathering many guest lecturers
could be better spent on a guest
in-residence program.
Getting to know a few people
and their ideas well is far more
valuable to the student than the
superficial contact afforded by
a series of one hour lectures.
IMPROVEMENT OF LI
BRARIES: If the proposed aca
demic program is to be feasible,
much better libraries will be
needed.
A committee composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration
and library staff members
should be formed to investigate
possibilities for improving the
current library system. This
committee should be authorized
to effect such changes as it
deems necessary and to main
tain high quality libraries
through periodic review.
Book Catalogue
Present book purchasing pro
cedures often entail unnecessary
cost and duplication. To facili
tate more efficient purchase of
books and planning of courses,
a catalogue of books at each of
the libraries should be made
available to students and profes
sors at the home campus.
With over half of Stanford
undergraduates now spending
two quarters abroad, the added
costs of library improvement
are certainly warranted. We pro
pose that instead of relying
solely on the Overseas Campus
budget, the foreign campus li
braries should be allocated a
share of the general library
budget.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the report of the Ad-Hoc
Committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board on Academic Affairs.
The Committee, oomponed of
approximately 30 undergradu
ates and chaired by Steve Mar
tindale, was formed Autumn
Quarter at the request of the
Overseas Campus Board.)
Goals Of Program
The primary purpose of the
Overseas Campus program is to
further the liberal education of
Stanford students as an exten
sion of the General Studies pro
gram.
As such, the program of study
abroad must be seen as an edu
cative process and must not be
considered merely an opportuni
ty for tourism or for an ex
tended vacation.
By including a foreign study
program in its liberal education
process, Stanford intends to de
velop new perspectives and in
sights in the students, especially
toward themselves and toward
their own American culture.
To provide these new perspec
tives, the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, as now de
fined, is designed to promote a
"European Experience," as well

as a closer academic community.
Although we understand that
the term "European Experience"
serves as a convenient capsule
description of the Overseas Cam
pus program, we question the
term's value as a focus for the
direction of that program. For
it seems that there are two pos
sible approaches to study in Eu
rope: one can attempt to take
on Europe as a whole, or one can
concentrate on the host country'
and its culture as a part of Eu
rope.
In essence, we suggest that
the program should focus on the
national, rather than the Euro
pean, experience.
In evaluating the program's
emphasis, two main questions
must be considered:
Which emphasis — national or
European — is more feasible for
the Stanford program, and
which approach will contribute
more to a liberal education and
the development of a new pers
pective toward our American
culture?
Experience Too Broad
Concerning the feasibility of a
European experience within the
six months at a Stanford center,
it is important to note that the

students must spend their time
primarily within their respective
countries.
Time limitations and the spe
cific locations of the campuses
discourage longdistance travel.
These limitations, along with the
language barrier, make personal
contact with people in other
countries most difficult.
By contrast, student contact
and travel within the given na
tional, or in the case of Austria,
cultural, area of each Stanford
center has proved most fruitful.
An academic program which
attempts to deal with Europe
as a whole is an undertaking far
too broad for the six month pe
riod. Furthermore, such an at
tempt fails to make full use of
the potential for a meaningful
study of one culture.
Primary Goal
In the end we must look back
to the primary goal of the pro
gram: the development of new
perspectives and insights in
Stanford students.
New perspectives arise only
when old views are challenged.
A close exploration of the tradi
tions, customs, culture, and val
ues of a single cultural area pro
vides a much more concrete

basis for comparison with our
own culture than does a six
month overview of Europe. A
thorough introduction to one
country can stimulate the pro
found thinking which is the
basis of a liberal education.
In addition then to being the
most feasible direction of the
program, the national emphasis
would contribute the most to a
liberal education.
National Emphasis
It is true that Stanford has
already adapted much of its pro
gram to the national emphasis.
Courses tend to pertain to the
host country, local staff are
hired to teach the language, and
the University aims to promote
good relations with the local
community.
But because no clear philoso
phical commitment supports
these tendencies, the national fo
cus is often not achieved. While
there is a need for flexibility,
there is no room for ambiguity.
An ambiguous University pol
icy can only lead to confusion
and disappointment among its
students.
R«*-Evaliiat.ion Essential
Since over half of Stanford's
undergraduates will now have

the oportunity to attend Stan
ford centers abroad, the direc
tion of the program must be
made clear. We feel that a re
evaluation of University policy
is essential.
Although this report is writ
ten from the students' perspec
tive, it is hoped that it will pro
vide a starting point for further
exploration and policy changes
on the part of the faculty and
administration.
Topics For Discussion
COURSE RELEVANCE: Cour
ses taught at the Overseas Cam
puses should always be relevant
to the native culture. While we
hope that Stanford profes
sors would be the first to be
sought, they often cannot be
found to teach such relevant
courses.
Other sources, then, should be
tapped. These could include for
eign professors or Stanford in
structors without tenure who
are enthusiastic and recognized
as being capable men.
In order to implement the
above policy we propose a com
mittee to evaluate the current
process of professor selection.
This committee should consist
of two students, two faculty

members and two administra
tors.
FLEXIBLE ACADEMIC PRO
GRAM: Broader choice of
courses at the Overseas Campus
es would allow for a greater
range of student interests. A
student is likely to be more high
ly motivated when he has some
role in the planning of his aca
demic program.
A fully prescribed set of
courses is often viewed as a
kind of academic prison, and
can stifle active participation in
course work.
All students going overseas,
unless given special permission,
should be required to take be
fore departure a two unit course
concerning the civilization of
their respective countries.
Such a course would give the
student some idea of the culture
to which he is to be exposed,
and would hopefully inspire in
terest in specific topics or issues,
leading to a more directed ap
proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.

ford centers abroad, the direc
tion of the program must be
made clear. We feel that a re
evaluation of University policy
is essential.
Although this report is writ
ten from the students' perspec
tive, it is hoped that it will pro
vide a starting point for further
exploration and policy changes
on the part of the faculty and
administration.
Topics For Discussion
COURSE RELEVANCE: Cour
ses taught at the Overseas Cam
puses should always be relevant
to the native culture. While we
hope that Stanford profes
sors would be the first to be
sought, they often cannot be
found to teach such relevant
courses.
Other sources, then, should be
tapped. These could include for
eign professors or Stanford in
structors without tenure who
are enthusiastic and recognized
as being capable men.
In order to implement the
above policy we propose a com
mittee to evaluate the current
process of professor selection.
This committee should consist
of two students, two faculty

members and two administra
tors.
FLEXIBLE ACADEMIC PRO
GRAM: Broader choice of
courses at the Overseas Campus
es would allow for a greater
range of student interests. A
student is likely to be more high
ly motivated when he has some
role in the planning of his aca
demic program.
A fully prescribed set of
courses is often viewed as a
kind of academic prison, and
can stifle active participation in
course work.
All students going overseas,
unless given special permission,
should be required to take be
fore departure a two unit course
concerning the civilization of
their respective countries.
Such a course would give the
student some idea of the culture
to which he is to be exposed,
and would hopefully inspire in
terest in specific topics or issues,
leading to a more directed ap
proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.
Alternative Courses
Each Stanford professor should
offer two courses instead of one.
This would both recognize the
needs of the more advanced stu
dents and provide more oppor
tunity for small group work.
One of the courses should
most often deal with a more
general topic, like "Introduction
to the French Novel," while the
other should be more specific,
for example: "Marccl Proust."
If the general course is of
fered at home the student
should be allowed to take it, so
that he has the necessary back
ground to pursue advanced work
overseas.
But whether or not the stu
dent has taken the general
course at home, he should have
the option to take the advanced
course overseas; there are many
cases where the student has
studied beyond the point of the
general course offered overseas
without having taken it.
If an imbalance in the number
of students enrolled in each
class arises, so much the better.
The seminar format is uniquely
suited to the Overseas Campus
atmosphere with its close con
tact between student and pro
fessor.
We suggest that one way to
implement this program would
be to have each professor over
lap two groups, and teach the
same courses to each group. The
professors would still teach a
total of two courses, either both
lecture, or one lecture and one
seminar, depending on the en
rollment.
Optional Course
Since the civilization course
would be taught before depar
ture, we propose in its stead an
optional two to three unit
course each quarter, to be
taught by a native professor.
In addition there should be
offered in the second quarter
another course taught in the for
eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal
of relevance to the cultural
area.
The professor would generally
be the Academic Director. If he
could not, or would not, teach
such courses, then a native pro
fessor should be hired.
14 Units Total
In summary, 14 units would
be required of each student, six
in the foreign language, and
four each in the courses he
elects to take from the Stanford

professors. Elective units beyond
this might consist of:
• The optional courses men
tioned above.
• Directed reading.
• Papers in the c o u r s e s of
fered.
• Continuation of home cam
pus honors programs
• Senior Colloquia.
FIELD TRIPS: Different
countries have different possi
bilities for field trips. We pro
pose, therefore, that within the
academic requirements of a
Stanford quarter, the number,
location, length and scheduling
of field trips be determined for
each campus by its local direc
tors.
COMMUNITY' AND CULTUR
AL RELATIONS: A recurring
problem at each of the campuses
has been isolation from the sur
rounding community. In order
to encourage greater contact,
we make the following propo
sals:
Community Relations
That community relations be
organized to provide continuity
from group to group.
Responsibility for getting in
formation about community ac
tivities should be delegated to
some specific person on each
campus, such as Mile, de Renus
son at Tours. Resident Assist
ants and secretaries are other
possibilities.
Contact with surrounding uni
versities should be established
on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni
ties available at each campus
in the Stanford office so that
students may anticipate and
plan for activities outside of the
formal program.
Students participating in any
regularly scheduled community
activity should receive activity
credit.
Guest Lecturers
Since the guest lecture will no
longer be a part of the civiliza
tion program, we propose that
the time and effort spent in
gathering many guest lecturers
could be better spent on a guest
in-residence program.
Getting to know a few people
and their ideas well is far more
valuable to the student than the
superficial contact afforded by
a series of one hour lectures.
IMPROVEMENT OF LI
BRARIES: If the proposed aca
demic program is to be feasible,
much better libraries will be
needed.
A committee composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration
and library staff members
should be formed to investigate
possibilities for improving the
current library system. This
committee should be authorized
to effect such changes as it
deems necessary and to main
tain high quality libraries
through periodic review.
Book Catalogue
Present book purchasing pro
cedures often entail unnecessary
cost and duplication. To facili
tate more efficient purchase of
books and planning of courses,
a catalogue of books at each of
the libraries should be made
available to students and profes
sors at the home campus.
With over half of Stanford
undergraduates now spending
two quarters abroad, the added
costs of library improvement
are certainly warranted. We pro
pose that instead of relying
solely on the Overseas Campus
budget, the foreign campus li
braries should be allocated a
share of the general library
budget.
(Editor's note: Following' is the
text of the report of the Ad-Hoc
Committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board on Academic Affairs.
The Committee, oomponed of
approximately 30 undergradu
ates and chaired by Steve Mar
tindale, was formed Autumn
Quarter at the request of the
Overseas Campus Board.)
Goals Of Program
The primary purpose of the
Overseas Campus program is to
further the liberal education of
Stanford students as an exten
sion of the General Studies pro
gram.
As such, the program of study
abroad must be seen as an edu
cative process and must not be
considered merely an opportuni
ty for tourism or for an ex
tended vacation.
By including a foreign study
program in its liberal education
process, Stanford intends to de
velop new perspectives and in
sights in the students, especially
toward themselves and toward
their own American culture.
To provide these new perspec
tives, the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, as now de
fined, is designed to promote a
"European Experience," as well

as a closer academic community.
Although we understand that
the term "European Experience"
serves as a convenient capsule
description of the Overseas Cam
pus program, we question the
term's value as a focus for the
direction of that program. For
it seems that there are two pos
sible approaches to study in Eu
rope: one can attempt to take
on Europe as a whole, or one can
concentrate on the host country'
and its culture as a part of Eu
rope.
In essence, we suggest that
the program should focus on the
national, rather than the Euro
pean, experience.
In evaluating the program's
emphasis, two main questions
must be considered:
Which emphasis — national or
European — is more feasible for
the Stanford program, and
which approach will contribute
more to a liberal education and
the development of a new pers
pective toward our American
culture?
Experience Too Broad
Concerning the feasibility of a
European experience within the
six months at a Stanford center,
it is important to note that the

students must spend their time
primarily within their respective
countries.
Time limitations and the spe
cific locations of the campuses
discourage longdistance travel.
These limitations, along with the
language barrier, make personal
contact with people in other
countries most difficult.
By contrast, student contact
and travel within the given na
tional, or in the case of Austria,
cultural, area of each Stanford
center has proved most fruitful.
An academic program which
attempts to deal with Europe
as a whole is an undertaking far
too broad for the six month pe
riod. Furthermore, such an at
tempt fails to make full use of
the potential for a meaningful
study of one culture.
Primary Goal
In the end we must look back
to the primary goal of the pro
gram: the development of new
perspectives and insights in
Stanford students.
New perspectives arise only
when old views are challenged.
A close exploration of the tradi
tions, customs, culture, and val
ues of a single cultural area pro
vides a much more concrete

basis for comparison with our
own culture than does a six
month overview of Europe. A
thorough introduction to one
country can stimulate the pro
found thinking which is the
basis of a liberal education.
In addition then to being the
most feasible direction of the
program, the national emphasis
would contribute the most to a
liberal education.
National Emphasis
It is true that Stanford has
already adapted much of its pro
gram to the national emphasis.
Courses tend to pertain to the
host country, local staff are
hired to teach the language, and
the University aims to promote
good relations with the local
community.
But because no clear philoso
phical commitment supports
these tendencies, the national fo
cus is often not achieved. While
there is a need for flexibility,
there is no room for ambiguity.
An ambiguous University pol
icy can only lead to confusion
and disappointment among its
students.

undergraduates will now have

and travel within the given na
tional, or in the case of Austria,
cultural, area of each Stanford
center has proved most fruitful.
An academic program which
attempts to deal with Europe
as a whole is an undertaking far
too broad for the six month pe
riod. Furthermore, such an at
tempt fails to make full use of
the potential for a meaningful
study of one culture.
Primary Goal
In the end we must look back
to the primary goal of the pro
gram: the development of new
perspectives and insights in
Stanford students.
New perspectives arise only
when old views are challenged.
A close exploration of the tradi
tions, customs, culture, and val
ues of a single cultural area pro
vides a much more concrete

basis for comparison with our
own culture than does a six
month overview of Europe. A
thorough introduction to one
country can stimulate the pro
found thinking which is the
basis of a liberal education.
In addition then to being the
most feasible direction of the
program, the national emphasis
would contribute the most to a
liberal education.
National Emphasis
It is true that Stanford has
already adapted much of its pro
gram to the national emphasis.
Courses tend to pertain to the
host country, local staff are
hired to teach the language, and
the University aims to promote
good relations with the local
community.
But because no clear philoso
phical commitment supports
these tendencies, the national fo
cus is often not achieved. While
there is a need for flexibility,
there is no room for ambiguity.
An ambiguous University pol
icy can only lead to confusion
and disappointment among its
students.
R«*-Evaliiat.ion Essential
Since over half of Stanford's
undergraduates will now have

the oportunity to attend Stan
ford centers abroad, the direc
tion of the program must be
made clear. We feel that a re
evaluation of University policy
is essential.
Although this report is writ
ten from the students' perspec
tive, it is hoped that it will pro
vide a starting point for further
exploration and policy changes
on the part of the faculty and
administration.
Topics For Discussion
COURSE RELEVANCE: Cour
ses taught at the Overseas Cam
puses should always be relevant
to the native culture. While we
hope that Stanford profes
sors would be the first to be
sought, they often cannot be
found to teach such relevant
courses.
Other sources, then, should be
tapped. These could include for
eign professors or Stanford in
structors without tenure who
are enthusiastic and recognized
as being capable men.
In order to implement the
above policy we propose a com
mittee to evaluate the current
process of professor selection.
This committee should consist
of two students, two faculty

members and two administra
tors.
FLEXIBLE ACADEMIC PRO
GRAM: Broader choice of
courses at the Overseas Campus
es would allow for a greater
range of student interests. A
student is likely to be more high
ly motivated when he has some
role in the planning of his aca
demic program.
A fully prescribed set of
courses is often viewed as a
kind of academic prison, and
can stifle active participation in
course work.
All students going overseas,
unless given special permission,
should be required to take be
fore departure a two unit course
concerning the civilization of
their respective countries.
Such a course would give the
student some idea of the culture
to which he is to be exposed,
and would hopefully inspire in
terest in specific topics or issues,
leading to a more directed ap
proach to his overseas experi
ence.
This course would be graded
on a pass-fail basis.
Alternative Courses
Each Stanford professor should
offer two courses instead of one.
This would both recognize the
needs of the more advanced stu
dents and provide more oppor
tunity for small group work.
One of the courses should
most often deal with a more
general topic, like "Introduction
to the French Novel," while the
other should be more specific,
for example: "Marccl Proust."
If the general course is of
fered at home the student
should be allowed to take it, so
that he has the necessary back
ground to pursue advanced work
overseas.
But whether or not the stu
dent has taken the general
course at home, he should have
the option to take the advanced
course overseas; there are many
cases where the student has
studied beyond the point of the
general course offered overseas
without having taken it.
If an imbalance in the number
of students enrolled in each
class arises, so much the better.
The seminar format is uniquely
suited to the Overseas Campus
atmosphere with its close con
tact between student and pro
fessor.
We suggest that one way to
implement this program would
be to have each professor over
lap two groups, and teach the
same courses to each group. The
professors would still teach a
total of two courses, either both
lecture, or one lecture and one
seminar, depending on the en
rollment.
Optional Course
Since the civilization course
would be taught before depar
ture, we propose in its stead an
optional two to three unit
course each quarter, to be
taught by a native professor.
In addition there should be
offered in the second quarter
another course taught in the for
eign language, which could, but
would not have to be, also
taught in English.
The topic would be at the dis
cretion of the professor, within,
of course, the overriding goal
of relevance to the cultural
area.
The professor would generally
be the Academic Director. If he
could not, or would not, teach
such courses, then a native pro
fessor should be hired.
14 Units Total
In summary, 14 units would
be required of each student, six
in the foreign language, and
four each in the courses he
elects to take from the Stanford

professors. Elective units beyond
this might consist of:
• The optional courses men
tioned above.
• Directed reading.
• Papers in the c o u r s e s of
fered.
• Continuation of home cam
pus honors programs
• Senior Colloquia.
FIELD TRIPS: Different
countries have different possi
bilities for field trips. We pro
pose, therefore, that within the
academic requirements of a
Stanford quarter, the number,
location, length and scheduling
of field trips be determined for
each campus by its local direc
tors.
COMMUNITY' AND CULTUR
AL RELATIONS: A recurring
problem at each of the campuses
has been isolation from the sur
rounding community. In order
to encourage greater contact,
we make the following propo
sals:
Community Relations
That community relations be
organized to provide continuity
from group to group.
Responsibility for getting in
formation about community ac
tivities should be delegated to
some specific person on each
campus, such as Mile, de Renus
son at Tours. Resident Assist
ants and secretaries are other
possibilities.
Contact with surrounding uni
versities should be established
on a continuous basis, with spe
cific scheduled activities for
each group such as seminars and
athletic competition.
The Overseas Campus office
should post a list of opportuni
ties available at each campus
in the Stanford office so that
students may anticipate and
plan for activities outside of the
formal program.
Students participating in any
regularly scheduled community
activity should receive activity
credit.
Guest Lecturers
Since the guest lecture will no
longer be a part of the civiliza
tion program, we propose that
the time and effort spent in
gathering many guest lecturers
could be better spent on a guest
in-residence program.
Getting to know a few people
and their ideas well is far more
valuable to the student than the
superficial contact afforded by
a series of one hour lectures.
IMPROVEMENT OF LI
BRARIES: If the proposed aca
demic program is to be feasible,
much better libraries will be
needed.
A committee composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration
and library staff members
should be formed to investigate
possibilities for improving the
current library system. This
committee should be authorized
to effect such changes as it
deems necessary and to main
tain high quality libraries
through periodic review.
Book Catalogue
Present book purchasing pro
cedures often entail unnecessary
cost and duplication. To facili
tate more efficient purchase of
books and planning of courses,
a catalogue of books at each of
the libraries should be made
available to students and profes
sors at the home campus.
With over half of Stanford
undergraduates now spending
two quarters abroad, the added
costs of library improvement
are certainly warranted. We pro
pose that instead of relying
solely on the Overseas Campus
budget, the foreign campus li
braries should be allocated a
share of the general library
budget.
