# Morrison, Kommers Star As Frosh Humble Hancock
## 
### JIM WHITEHEAD 
Record breaking perform
ances by Pat Morrison and Tom
Kommers carried the unbeaten
frosh track team to a decisive
91-44 victory over a powerful
Hancock JC squad last Friday
afternoon.
The highlight of the meet was
the individual duel between Mor
rison and Hancock's Turner in
the sprints. Turner, whose best
time of 9.5 in the hundred would
win most varsity races, had run
9.6 in four straight meets be
fore trying his luck at Stanford.

Morrison had not run better
than 9.7 all year, but Friday
he pulled away to win in 9.6.
Morrison's time broke the
frosh standard he held jointly
with Larry Questad and Roger
Cox. His 21 flat in the 220 also
established a new frosh record,
erasing Questad's 1962 mark of
21.3. Turner ran a fast 21.6 but
was no match for Morrison in
the final 50 yards.
Kommers Wins Hurdles
Before the excitement over
Morrison's performance had sub
sided the hurdles events pro

vided additional thrills. Tom
Kommers ran away from the
pack in the 120 highs to win
in 14.5, thus tying the 1950 rec
ord of the legendary Bob Ma
thais.
Tom was no less impressive
in the intermediates. He broke
stride between the first and sec-

ond hurdles but still managed a
38.2, three tenths under Greg
Ford's old record.
Mike Lemons responded to
the Hancock challenge with a
personal best of 14 feet even in
the pole vault. Peter Boyce won
the high jump easily at SI 1 /*",
Kearney Buskirk took the triple
jump, and Greg Williams took
a second in the broad jump.
Frosh Sweep Distance Events
The frosh swept the mile and
two mile, as Hancock's outstand
ing distance man, Duggan, was
unable to compete. The half
mile saw Dick Douglass pace
Mike Donley to an easy 1:56.4
victory. Mike later doubled on
the winning mile relay quartet
with Dan Woodruff, Kommers,
and Morrison, who after win
ning the dashes ran a remark
able 49.5 anchor leg.
Friday's triumph left the frosh
with an impressive 8-0 record in
dual competition. Next Saturday
the squad journeys to Berkeley
for an 11:30 clash with Cal.
