# Tracksters Win, 83-62
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
A relatively modest score of
83-62 against Washington Sat
urday discloses a Stanford track
victory but not the subtle advan
ces that were made preparing
for next week's big track meet
against Cal.
Stanford, needless to say, was
not at full strength, but the
strength they had was working
overtime against the out-manned
Huskies.
Stanford's Dave Deubner
along along with Washington's
Dave Williams were in perpet
ual motion. Once in competition
they moved from one event to
another performing in outstand
two firsts and two seconds and
ran on the 440 relay squad.
Deubner who supposedly was
to compete in only one distance
event took first in the 880 and
two-mile and finished second in
the mile.
Deubner's Moves For Victory
Deubner began his onslaught
against Washington's great dis
tance runner Dave Roberts in
the mile finishing about two
yards back of Roberts for sec
ond in 4:12.2. Deubner then
heated up in the 880 winning it
with a 1:52.8. Roberts did not
compete in this event.
Then came the two-mile with
Deubner and Washington's John
Celms and Roberts fighting for
the victory. Not more than a
yard separated the runners until
the climatic final lap. Then
Deubner made his move which
seemed at the time to be to
soon and too quick. However,
Dave kept up the torrid pace
and finished about 25 yards
ahead of Clems in a meet record
time of 9:10.7.
Stanford's Bud Walsh did not
compete heeding doctor's advice
in his fight against a virus.
Behind The Scenes Moves
Behind the scenes maneuvers
by Coach Jordan moved Jim
Ward from his usual 440 spot
to the 220 which will hopefully
help him improve his already
excellent 47.1 440 time. Ward
looked great in the 220 finish
ing second behind Larry Ques
tad in 21.5
Another move was Bob Stoeck
er, competing only in the discus,
concentrated there to beat A 1
Pemberton. Stoecker won with
his best toss of the year,
Pemberton won the shot.
All of these moves were calcu
lated risks against a relatively
weak squad in hopes of defeat
ing the relatively strong Bear
squad next weekend.
Next Week: Toss-Up
Hopefully Walsh will feel bet
ter next week in a meet that Jor
dan predicts as a toss-up. With
first and second in the high
jump, triple jump, and both hur
dles. Walsh would have defin
itely broken up some of these
monopolies had he competed.
Stanford took first and sec
ond in the 440, 100, 220, and the
pole vault all with relatively
modest performances.
Bill Roe and Williams were
clocked in identical meet rec
ord times of 14.3 in the 120
high hurdles. Roe nipped Wil
liams at the finish for the win.
Williams also set a meet record
in the 440 intermediate hurdles.
Stanford Wins Relays
In the 440 relays the meet

almost started disastrously for
Stanford who were heavy fav
orites to win. Questad on the
final leg against Dave Dupree
had to make up two yards and
won in heroic fashion by a yard.
The final time was 40.9.
In the mile relay Stanford
pulled out in front at the start

and stayed there to win easily
in 3:16.5.
Nine Meet Records
Because Stanford and Wash
ington haven't met for four
years there were nine meet rec
ords. However, none of the
marks registered was excep
tional. Eshelman barely missed
at 16-6 in the pole vault but set
tled for first at 15-11.
Other winners for Stanford
were Terry Fredrickson in the
440, (48.4), Craig Vaughan in
the long jump, WSAVz), George
Porter in the javelin (222-10),
and Questad in the 100 (9.8),
For Washington other firsts
included Williams in the triple
jump (47-10V2) and Gerry Pick
ering in the high jump (6-5V£).

Deubner who supposedly was
to compete in only one distance
event took first in the 880 and
two-mile and finished second in
the mile.
Deubner's Moves For Victory
Deubner began his onslaught
against Washington's great dis
tance runner Dave Roberts in
the mile finishing about two
yards back of Roberts for sec
ond in 4:12.2. Deubner then
heated up in the 880 winning it
with a 1:52.8. Roberts did not
compete in this event.
Then came the two-mile with
Deubner and Washington's John
Celms and Roberts fighting for
the victory. Not more than a
yard separated the runners until
the climatic final lap. Then
Deubner made his move which
seemed at the time to be to
soon and too quick. However,
Dave kept up the torrid pace
and finished about 25 yards
ahead of Clems in a meet record
time of 9:10.7.
Stanford's Bud Walsh did not
compete heeding doctor's advice
in his fight against a virus.
Behind The Scenes Moves
Behind the scenes maneuvers
by Coach Jordan moved Jim
Ward from his usual 440 spot
to the 220 which will hopefully
help him improve his already
excellent 47.1 440 time. Ward
looked great in the 220 finish
ing second behind Larry Ques
tad in 21.5
Another move was Bob Stoeck
er, competing only in the discus,
concentrated there to beat A 1
Pemberton. Stoecker won with
his best toss of the year,
Pemberton won the shot.
All of these moves were calcu
lated risks against a relatively
weak squad in hopes of defeat
ing the relatively strong Bear
squad next weekend.
Next Week: Toss-Up
Hopefully Walsh will feel bet
ter next week in a meet that Jor
dan predicts as a toss-up. With
first and second in the high
jump, triple jump, and both hur
dles. Walsh would have defin
itely broken up some of these
monopolies had he competed.
Stanford took first and sec
ond in the 440, 100, 220, and the
pole vault all with relatively
modest performances.
Bill Roe and Williams were
clocked in identical meet rec
ord times of 14.3 in the 120
high hurdles. Roe nipped Wil
liams at the finish for the win.
Williams also set a meet record
in the 440 intermediate hurdles.
Stanford Wins Relays
In the 440 relays the meet

almost started disastrously for
Stanford who were heavy fav
orites to win. Questad on the
final leg against Dave Dupree
had to make up two yards and
won in heroic fashion by a yard.
The final time was 40.9.
In the mile relay Stanford
pulled out in front at the start

and stayed there to win easily
in 3:16.5.
Nine Meet Records
Because Stanford and Wash
ington haven't met for four
years there were nine meet rec
ords. However, none of the
marks registered was excep
tional. Eshelman barely missed
at 16-6 in the pole vault but set
tled for first at 15-11.
Other winners for Stanford
were Terry Fredrickson in the
440, (48.4), Craig Vaughan in
the long jump, WSAVz), George
Porter in the javelin (222-10),
and Questad in the 100 (9.8),
For Washington other firsts
included Williams in the triple
jump (47-10V2) and Gerry Pick
ering in the high jump (6-5V£).

the victory. Not more than a
yard separated the runners until
the climatic final lap. Then
Deubner made his move which
seemed at the time to be to
soon and too quick. However,
Dave kept up the torrid pace
and finished about 25 yards
ahead of Clems in a meet record
time of 9:10.7.
Stanford's Bud Walsh did not
compete heeding doctor's advice
in his fight against a virus.
Behind The Scenes Moves
Behind the scenes maneuvers
by Coach Jordan moved Jim
Ward from his usual 440 spot
to the 220 which will hopefully
help him improve his already
excellent 47.1 440 time. Ward
looked great in the 220 finish
ing second behind Larry Ques
tad in 21.5
Another move was Bob Stoeck
er, competing only in the discus,
concentrated there to beat A 1
Pemberton. Stoecker won with
his best toss of the year,
Pemberton won the shot.
All of these moves were calcu
lated risks against a relatively
weak squad in hopes of defeat
ing the relatively strong Bear
squad next weekend.
Next Week: Toss-Up
Hopefully Walsh will feel bet
ter next week in a meet that Jor
dan predicts as a toss-up. With
first and second in the high
jump, triple jump, and both hur
dles. Walsh would have defin
itely broken up some of these
monopolies had he competed.
Stanford took first and sec
ond in the 440, 100, 220, and the
pole vault all with relatively
modest performances.
Bill Roe and Williams were
clocked in identical meet rec
ord times of 14.3 in the 120
high hurdles. Roe nipped Wil
liams at the finish for the win.
Williams also set a meet record
in the 440 intermediate hurdles.
Stanford Wins Relays
In the 440 relays the meet

almost started disastrously for
Stanford who were heavy fav
orites to win. Questad on the
final leg against Dave Dupree
had to make up two yards and
won in heroic fashion by a yard.
The final time was 40.9.
In the mile relay Stanford
pulled out in front at the start

and stayed there to win easily
in 3:16.5.
Nine Meet Records
Because Stanford and Wash
ington haven't met for four
years there were nine meet rec
ords. However, none of the
marks registered was excep
tional. Eshelman barely missed
at 16-6 in the pole vault but set
tled for first at 15-11.
Other winners for Stanford
were Terry Fredrickson in the
440, (48.4), Craig Vaughan in
the long jump, WSAVz), George
Porter in the javelin (222-10),
and Questad in the 100 (9.8),
For Washington other firsts
included Williams in the triple
jump (47-10V2) and Gerry Pick
ering in the high jump (6-5V£).
