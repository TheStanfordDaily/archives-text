# Laxmen Beat Peacock Gap
## 
### 
Although playing spotty la
crosse, particularly in the first
quarter, Stanford finally put to
gether a potent scoring punch
to go with its defense and ran
the Peacock Gap contigent into
the ground Saturday before a
home crowd.
Indian speed, conditioning, and
teamwork proved too much for
the Gold and Green. The Stan
ford offensive was so balanced
against the tired Gappers that
it was difficult to tell the three
midfield lines apart. Midfielder
Sandy Saxton tickled the nets
twice, along with attacknrten
Clay Primrose and Doug Ram
sey
Midfielders Bob Murphy, Sill
Sanders, Tom Hecht, and Monty
Orr contributed single scores.
Hugh Scott and Bob Heaton
scored for Peacock Gap, though
the Stanford goalies had a leis
urely afternoon.
