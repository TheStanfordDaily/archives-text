# On Filling The Void

### 
The decision of the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUE) to add student
"consultants" to that body is a most welcome
move. It should insure that the student view
point will at least be present when decisions
regarding undergraduate life are made, and it
should go far toward heading off hasty actions
such as the Committee's moves to close Union
Residence and to change the method of select
ing sponsors for Wilbur Hall.
However, the fact that students on CUE will
be in an ex officio position, without the power
of vote, brings up the larger question of what
roles the three constituencies—student, fac
ulty, and administrative—within the University
will play in the impending academic revolution.
For it seems that if the revolution is to be a
successful one, it will require in its final solu
tion a situation in which the three groups will
be able to work with one another under a rule
of mutual cooperation and respect—and the
idea that a given member of the University
community is a "student", "faculty member",
or "administrator" will have to be subordinated
to the goal of improving Stanford's educational
set-up.
The University's present structure, however,
works against this end. The ASSU governs stu
dent life, insofar as the powers that be allow
it to do so; the Academic Council regulates cer
tain aspects of faculty members' existences and
of the Stanford curriculum; and the adminis
tration oversees the logistical aspects of main
taining a university and acts as a buffer be
tween academe and the larger society. Such
a structure would be adequate if the needs
of the constituencies did not overlap. But there
are areas of mutual concern—community life,
education, and the applications of education to
thought and action —which at present are rele
gated piecemeal to nondescript committees

witliin each of the constituencies. As a result,
where there should be a feeling for the whole,
a feeling for the University as an integral part
of life, there is only a void.
But such need not necessarily be so. Professor
John McDonough, in a recent artilce in The
Daily, expressed a strong desire for good gov
ernment within the University, and opened the
way for discussion on how this might come
about. And ASSU President-Elect Dave Harris
has declared that the entire University struc
ture should be reconsidered as it has proven to
be an obstacle to real improvement within the
University.
The Legislature passed a significant resolu
tion last Thursday that foreshadows the be
ginning of a possible new era. Sponsored by
Speaker Jay Kadane, the resolution calls for the
Committee of 15 to explore the prospect of
developing a community government at Stan
ford to "enhance communications between the
various constituencies in the University, and
thus enhance education and hopefully lead to
better government for the University." The pos
sible composition of such a government has yet
to enter the discussion stage, but it seems cer
tain that its basic premise would be that people
are individuals and scholars first, and members
of a given constituency second.
The establishment of such a government
would break down the present view of the
University as an arena for tri-polar power poli
tics and would allow the needs of the commun
ity to come before the wants of the individual
constituencies. Dickering over student repre
sentation on a multitude of committees would
draw to a close. And in the process, Stanford
might even slip past the "edge of greatness."
We hope that the proposal will be given ser
ious consideration. It could well push Stan
ford out of the realm of in-fighting and into
the world of true academic life.

will play in the impending academic revolution.
For it seems that if the revolution is to be a
successful one, it will require in its final solu
tion a situation in which the three groups will
be able to work with one another under a rule
of mutual cooperation and respect—and the
idea that a given member of the University
community is a "student", "faculty member",
or "administrator" will have to be subordinated
to the goal of improving Stanford's educational
set-up.
The University's present structure, however,
works against this end. The ASSU governs stu
dent life, insofar as the powers that be allow
it to do so; the Academic Council regulates cer
tain aspects of faculty members' existences and
of the Stanford curriculum; and the adminis
tration oversees the logistical aspects of main
taining a university and acts as a buffer be
tween academe and the larger society. Such
a structure would be adequate if the needs
of the constituencies did not overlap. But there
are areas of mutual concern—community life,
education, and the applications of education to
thought and action —which at present are rele
gated piecemeal to nondescript committees

witliin each of the constituencies. As a result,
where there should be a feeling for the whole,
a feeling for the University as an integral part
of life, there is only a void.
But such need not necessarily be so. Professor
John McDonough, in a recent artilce in The
Daily, expressed a strong desire for good gov
ernment within the University, and opened the
way for discussion on how this might come
about. And ASSU President-Elect Dave Harris
has declared that the entire University struc
ture should be reconsidered as it has proven to
be an obstacle to real improvement within the
University.
The Legislature passed a significant resolu
tion last Thursday that foreshadows the be
ginning of a possible new era. Sponsored by
Speaker Jay Kadane, the resolution calls for the
Committee of 15 to explore the prospect of
developing a community government at Stan
ford to "enhance communications between the
various constituencies in the University, and
thus enhance education and hopefully lead to
better government for the University." The pos
sible composition of such a government has yet
to enter the discussion stage, but it seems cer
tain that its basic premise would be that people
are individuals and scholars first, and members
of a given constituency second.
The establishment of such a government
would break down the present view of the
University as an arena for tri-polar power poli
tics and would allow the needs of the commun
ity to come before the wants of the individual
constituencies. Dickering over student repre
sentation on a multitude of committees would
draw to a close. And in the process, Stanford
might even slip past the "edge of greatness."
We hope that the proposal will be given ser
ious consideration. It could well push Stan
ford out of the realm of in-fighting and into
the world of true academic life.
The decision of the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUE) to add student
"consultants" to that body is a most welcome
move. It should insure that the student view
point will at least be present when decisions
regarding undergraduate life are made, and it
should go far toward heading off hasty actions
such as the Committee's moves to close Union
Residence and to change the method of select
ing sponsors for Wilbur Hall.
However, the fact that students on CUE will
be in an ex officio position, without the power
of vote, brings up the larger question of what
roles the three constituencies—student, fac
ulty, and administrative—within the University
will play in the impending academic revolution.
