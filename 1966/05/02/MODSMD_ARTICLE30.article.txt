# The 						Martindale Report
## 
### 
The semi-annual turnover of students at
the overseas campuses has long stifled critic
ism, both constructive and otherwise, of the
Overseas Campus Program. But the report of
the Martindale Committee on the Overseas
Campuses, released yesterday, has laid the
groundwork for a student-administration re
evaluation of the program.
The Committee's questioning of the goals of
the program comes at a significant time, for
with the addition of the Semmering and Har
laxton campuses, more than fifty per cent of
Stanford undergraduates will be attending one
of the five campuses during their college car
eers. We concur with the Committee's empha
sis that the program be a "national experience"
rather than a "European experience." Intensive
contact with the culture and tradition of one
nation is more meaningful, in terms of stimu
lating thought and the development of new
perspectives, than six months of junketeering
across the continent. While this view may seem
to be tinged with chauvinism—and a trans
planted chauvinism at that—in an age which
considers so many problems in an international
context, nevertheless six months is barely
enough time to make an acquaintance with one
nation's heritage, save a continent's.
The necessary machinery for emphasizing the
culture surrounding the foreign campus is al
ready present. "But," as the report underlines,
because no clear philosophical commitment
supports these tendencies, the national focus
is often not achieved." In making concrete sug

gestions for changes in courses, choice of field
trips, and library facilities, the report offers
reasonable and workable improvements for the
program.
A colorful booklet published last year by the
alumni of one of the campuses noted that "a
successful European study trip required more
than ticket and a registration card." Unfortun
ately it takes many students a quarter in Europe
to realize this. The two-unit civilization course
proposed by the report would direct the stu
dent's attention on the culture and current
problems of the particular nation prior to go
ing overseas.
Frequent complaints that foreign campuses
are isolated from the activities of the commun
ity is as much the fault of the reticent student as
of the lack of local contacts. However, we
strongly agree with the report that each campus
should have a Mile de Renusson to coordinate
information about the local community. (Ma
demoiselle ably handles contacts with French
families and students at the Tours campus.)
We hope that the Martindale Report will
merit careful reading by the Director of the
Overseas Campuses, the Dean of Undergrad
uate Education, and the student body.
The Overseas Campuses Program is probably
one aspect of Stanford about which students,
collectively, are as well informed as the admin
istrators and faculty members who supervise it.
Therefore, it stands to reason that the report
should bring about some truly constructive stu
dent-faculty-administrative interaction.

to realize this. The two-unit civilization course
proposed by the report would direct the stu
dent's attention on the culture and current
problems of the particular nation prior to go
ing overseas.
Frequent complaints that foreign campuses
are isolated from the activities of the commun
ity is as much the fault of the reticent student as
of the lack of local contacts. However, we
strongly agree with the report that each campus
should have a Mile de Renusson to coordinate
information about the local community. (Ma
demoiselle ably handles contacts with French
families and students at the Tours campus.)
We hope that the Martindale Report will
merit careful reading by the Director of the
Overseas Campuses, the Dean of Undergrad
uate Education, and the student body.
The Overseas Campuses Program is probably
one aspect of Stanford about which students,
collectively, are as well informed as the admin
istrators and faculty members who supervise it.
Therefore, it stands to reason that the report
should bring about some truly constructive stu
dent-faculty-administrative interaction.

The semi-annual turnover of students at
the overseas campuses has long stifled critic
ism, both constructive and otherwise, of the
Overseas Campus Program. But the report of
the Martindale Committee on the Overseas
Campuses, released yesterday, has laid the
groundwork for a student-administration re
evaluation of the program.
The Committee's questioning of the goals of
the program comes at a significant time, for
with the addition of the Semmering and Har
laxton campuses, more than fifty per cent of
Stanford undergraduates will be attending one
of the five campuses during their college car
eers. We concur with the Committee's empha
sis that the program be a "national experience"
rather than a "European experience." Intensive
contact with the culture and tradition of one
nation is more meaningful, in terms of stimu
lating thought and the development of new
perspectives, than six months of junketeering
across the continent. While this view may seem
to be tinged with chauvinism—and a trans
planted chauvinism at that—in an age which
considers so many problems in an international
context, nevertheless six months is barely
enough time to make an acquaintance with one
nation's heritage, save a continent's.
The necessary machinery for emphasizing the
culture surrounding the foreign campus is al
ready present. "But," as the report underlines,
because no clear philosophical commitment
supports these tendencies, the national focus
is often not achieved." In making concrete sug

gestions for changes in courses, choice of field
trips, and library facilities, the report offers
reasonable and workable improvements for the
program.
A colorful booklet published last year by the
alumni of one of the campuses noted that "a
successful European study trip required more
than ticket and a registration card." Unfortun
ately it takes many students a quarter in Europe
to realize this. The two-unit civilization course
proposed by the report would direct the stu
dent's attention on the culture and current
problems of the particular nation prior to go
ing overseas.
