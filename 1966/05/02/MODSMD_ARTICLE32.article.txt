## Contraceptive Campaign Hard To Take Seriously 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Despite a propensity for un
derstanding and supporting stu
dent aspirations, I confess I find
the campaign for contraceptives
difficult to take seriously.
Not one unmarried Stanford
woman in 500 leads so active a
sexual life that scrupulously
taking pills 20 days every month
is an appropriate solution to the
pregnancy problem, particularly
when there remain doubts about
how many years the pills may
be safely ingested.
Furthermore, any woman can
purchase, without prescription,
in any good drug store, contra
ceptive preparations that are far
superior in safety and conveni
ence to the mechanical devices
which have improved family
planning measurably for many
years.
One must conclude that the
campaign has no practical im
port and consider the principles
involved. It is argued that, in re
fusing to prescribe contracep
tives, the Health Service is op
posing premarital sex. But is it
not then equally true that by
dispensing them the University
could be regarded as recom
mending or promoting inter
course?
If err it must, its present er
ror seems less perilous. The ob
stacles and inhibitions to intima
cy on the campus (and else
where) are a matter of concern
to many of us, but the conse
quences of any lack of sexual
intimacy are of trivial signifi
cance compared with the long
term destructive results of the
dearth of emotional or psycho
logical intimacy which students
suffer.
The danger is that the clamor
for free contraceptives, like the
"filthy speech" campaign at
Berkeley, will dissipate support
for legitimate student concerns
and divert .attention from more
crucial — and more difficult —
problems of student life.

• Unfair Tax On Sex
Editor, The Daily:
The issue of free "pills" for
unmarried coeds has an interest
ing interpretation that should
help to clarify this difficult
question.
Assuming that unwanted preg
nancy has a high psychological
and economic cost to the individ
ual, then if contraceptives are
not provided free, the women
will obtain them privately, pay
ing private medical fees and
drug store prices. This consti
tutes, in effect, a tax on sexual
activity.
While the imposition of such
a tax is not in itself offensive
(we manage to live somehow
with similar taxes on cigarettes
and liquor), the tax is regres
sive in that it affects poor coed
and rich coed equally.
Leon Keyserling, in a recent
article ("Taxes from Whom, for
What?", The New Republic,
April 23, 1966) discusses the is
sue of increasing tax burdens on
low income individuals. He com
ments: "The inequity is even
worse today, due to sharp in
creases in most types of regres
sive taxes at all levels since
1960 . . ."
Faculty and student Liberals
who may be at sea with respect
to the issue of "the pills" might
consult their traditional and
cherished attitudes toward re
gressive taxation for a resolu
tion of their confusion.

• Rejuvenation
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to join in spirit with
those who are dancing in the
streets over the election of Dave
Harris to the ASSU presidency.
For me, the election results
had the effect of someone throw
ing open the windows in a stuf

fy room. One feels refreshed
and gathers strength to tackle
difficult problems from a re
newed sense of the possibilities
for excellence at Stanford.
Mr. Harris is full of provaca
tive ideas, many of them no
doubt unworkable, but his hon
esty and enthusiasm are expres
sive of something new in the
air.
I believe that students are be
ginning to understand what it
means to be educated; they are
becoming concerned with some
thing more profound than aca
demic gamesmanship.
In this developing atmosphere
of renewed concern with ulti
mate values, faculty and admin
istrators alike have the oppor
tunity to consider new responses
to old problems.
I hope we will take advantage
of it.

• Significant Step
Editor, The Daily:
Re the election results: at last
Stanford has taken a significant
step toward that edge of great
ness which so many like to ima
gine we have been tottering on
for so long. The air is cleaner.

Editor, The Daily:
Re: The article on Professor
Parson's study of California dis
crimination in the March 31
Daily.
J ,iving in an agricultural town
in central California, I was very
interested in Professor Parson's
charges of racial discrimination
in California communities. I re
ferred the article to two elemen
tary school principals in my
town (Visalia).
They both felt, as I did, that
the situation described in "Gua
dalupe" is not typical of Califor
nia communities, and that, as
one principal put it,"it is gross
ly unfair to generalize that all
our communities and school sys
tems foster this kind of un-
American activity."
And the other continued, say
ing, "Green Acres [a school
whose students are approximate
ly one-half Mexican-Americans]
has had some very fine Mexican
leaders . . . student body presi
dents, queens, leaders of all
kinds!"
More importantly, however,
one of the principals enclosed a
list of educational projects of
which he is the coordinator. A
few of them which might be of
interest to you, and which are
pertinent to the question of dis
crimination, are the following:
• To provide needy students
with adequate clothing, shoes,
hot lunches, etc.
• To acquire the services of a
social worker to assist with
home problems and special stu
dent needs.
• To acquire the services of a
health consultant to assist with
health problems of the disadvan
taged children.
• To provide in-service train
ing of teachers, including: as
sisting teachers in evaluating
student progress; giving teach
ers specific help in teaching
English as a foreign language;
and developing and improving
curriculum for the educational
ly deprived.
• To provide tutoring services
to any student needing them.
• To provide parent education
classes to instruct parents in
dropout problems, parent-school
cooperation, etc.
• To free teachers of clerical
tasks in order to provide time
for assisting individual students
and working with parents of
educationally deprived children.
In short, the Visalia Public
School System believes in help
ing in every way possible to
give children of all races and
economic groups the best educa
tion possible.
