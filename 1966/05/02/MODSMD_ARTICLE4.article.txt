# Representing One's God Called 'Crisis In Theism'
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associated Editor 
The reality of the God-relationship
as utterly personal and utterly central
is not at issue in contemporary theol
ogy. The immediate question, rather,
is how that experienced reality is to
be represented and given expression
in a way of understanding the world
which makes it central.
This was the analysis of the current
"crisis in theism" offered by Bishop
John A. T. Robinson yesterday after
noon in the first of three West Lec
tures on "Exploration into God." The
lecture, entitled "The Displacement
Effect in Theism" was delivered to an
audience of a thousand in Memorial
Auditorium.
The task of theology, the bishop ex
plained, "is a form of map-making—
trying to represent the mystery of
'theos (the incommunicable, spiritual
reality) by a 'logos' or word-picture
which can be used for the purposes of
communication. It involves a transla
tion or transposition from one dimen
sion to another: a projection."
The difficulty involved in repre
senting the spiritual reality as a Being
in another realm "is that it is made
unreal and remote for vast numbers
of people today. Not only do they
take the projection for the reality and
demand 'evidence' for the existence of
such a Being; but the projection has
the further effect of rendering God
marginal and peripheral."
The consequence of speaking of God
as a supernatural Being is 4 that the
Church "seems to be framing the is
sue in an unreal way and asking men
for a commitment they do not find
meaningful."
Thus the question for theology be
comes 'how to represent and com
municate what is real in a meaningful
way?' In the history of man so far,
this has been done in three ways. In
the period of 'myth', "the inner and
outer worlds are not yet understood
as separate entities but continuously
interpenetrate."
"Secondly, there is the period of
'ontology', when the supernatural be
comes disentangled from the natural,
subject stands over against object,
man separates to the city and the di
vine forces to the heavens."
cal world-view, to threaten a serious
loss. But the fact is that it is being
abandoned—'The Lord above' is taken
with almost as little seriousness as the
Devil. As a result, we must start out
thinking about God from what is most
real for men rather than from what is
most unreal."
A God who is presented as the en
emy of secularization, who depends on

ontological existence for his reality,
"is merely inviting secularism. If he
can no longer 'work' in a functional
society, if he can survive only as a
metaphysical entity like 'the soul,'
then place will not be left for him
and society will go on without him."
Bishop Robinson lectures Tuesday
evening at 7:45 on "Locating the
Reality of God," and again Wednesday
afternoon at 4:15 on "An Exercise in

Re-centering." Both lectures are in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Third, there is the period of 'func
tional thinking. "Substances and su
pernatural entities are eliminated as
unreal. Things are what they do or
what can be done with them." In this
new world, the word 'God' can no
longer function as a metaphysical en
tity, as a supernatural Being.
"In the ontological period, the way
to make God real was to give him an
essence and existence of his own. In a
functional age, it is to show he 'comes
in,' how he 'works' in the processes of
nature and history, rather than be
hind or between them."
A similar process could befall
'God', he said. "The abandonment of

A God who is presented as the en

ontological existence for his reality,
"is merely inviting secularism. If he
can no longer 'work' in a functional
society, if he can survive only as a
metaphysical entity like 'the soul,'
then place will not be left for him
and society will go on without him."

pernatural entities are eliminated as

what can be done with them." In this
new world, the word 'God' can no
longer function as a metaphysical en
tity, as a supernatural Being.
"In the ontological period, the way
to make God real was to give him an
essence and existence of his own. In a
functional age, it is to show he 'comes
in,' how he 'works' in the processes of
nature and history, rather than be
hind or between them."
A similar process could befall

The reality of the God-relationship
as utterly personal and utterly central
is not at issue in contemporary theol
ogy. The immediate question, rather,
is how that experienced reality is to
be represented and given expression
in a way of understanding the world
which makes it central.
This was the analysis of the current
"crisis in theism" offered by Bishop
John A. T. Robinson yesterday after
noon in the first of three West Lec
tures on "Exploration into God." The
lecture, entitled "The Displacement
Effect in Theism" was delivered to an
audience of a thousand in Memorial
Auditorium.
The task of theology, the bishop ex
plained, "is a form of map-making—
trying to represent the mystery of
'theos (the incommunicable, spiritual
reality) by a 'logos' or word-picture
which can be used for the purposes of
communication. It involves a transla
tion or transposition from one dimen
sion to another: a projection."
The difficulty involved in repre
senting the spiritual reality as a Being
in another realm "is that it is made
unreal and remote for vast numbers
of people today. Not only do they
take the projection for the reality and
demand 'evidence' for the existence of
such a Being; but the projection has
the further effect of rendering God
marginal and peripheral."
The consequence of speaking of God
as a supernatural Being is 4 that the
Church "seems to be framing the is
sue in an unreal way and asking men
for a commitment they do not find
meaningful."
Thus the question for theology be
comes 'how to represent and com
municate what is real in a meaningful
way?' In the history of man so far,
this has been done in three ways. In
the period of 'myth', "the inner and
outer worlds are not yet understood
as separate entities but continuously
interpenetrate."
"Secondly, there is the period of
'ontology', when the supernatural be
comes disentangled from the natural,
subject stands over against object,
man separates to the city and the di
vine forces to the heavens."

loss. But the fact is that it is being
abandoned—'The Lord above' is taken
with almost as little seriousness as the

thinking about God from what is most

most unreal."
