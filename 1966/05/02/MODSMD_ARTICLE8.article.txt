# UNIVERSITY OF OREGON
## Students Join Faculty Senate 
### 
(CPS)—The Faculty Senate at the
University of Oregon has voted to al
low two student representatives to at
tend its meetings and speak if they
wish.
The move, which has long been
sought by the Associated Students of
(he University of Oregon, came on a
119-45 vote after several hours debate
and a number of amendments to the
original motion.
ASUO had requested that two rep
resentatives be allowed to attend
meetings and that they be allowed to
speak if a majority of faculty agreed.
One of the amendments liberalized
the motion to allow the students to
speak just by being recognized by the
chairman of (he faculty.
Amended Motion
The much-amended motion gave
the two student representatives all of
the rights of members of the senate —
except for voting power.

The two representatives will be the
ASUO president, or the vice president
in his absence, and a second student
appointed by the president of the
university on the nomination of the
ASUO president.
One faculty member presented what
was designed as a substitute motion
that would have made the number of
student representatives on the faculty
equal to the number of ASUO sen
ators and would have given each a
vote.
The motion was ruled "not ger
mane" by the chairman when it was
presented, and this ruling was upheld
by a vote of the senate when it was
challenged.
Open Meeting's
This meeting marked the first time
that Faculty Senate meetings at Ore
gon have been opened on a regular
basis and if the members of the sen
ate have their way, the meetings may

be open to everybody.
Leaders of the faculty have dis
cussed a motion to open the senate
with University President Arthur S.
Fleming, and the motion was formal
ly presented at the last meeting. It
would open the senate meetings to all
who wish to attend for a three-year
trial period.
A final vote is expected at the May
meeting.
The same representation may be
due the students at the University of
California at Irving if a new set of
by-laws for the Irving Academic Sen
ate is approved by the Acedemic Sen
ate for the University of California's
statewide system.
The proposed by-laws would allow
two students, o"ne undergraduate and
one graduate, to be elected by the
student body to represent them on the
senate. They would be allowed to
speak freely but would have no vote.

ASUO president, or the vice president
in his absence, and a second student
appointed by the president of the
university on the nomination of the
ASUO president.
One faculty member presented what
was designed as a substitute motion
that would have made the number of
student representatives on the faculty
equal to the number of ASUO sen
ators and would have given each a
vote.
The motion was ruled "not ger
mane" by the chairman when it was
presented, and this ruling was upheld
by a vote of the senate when it was
challenged.

(CPS)—The Faculty Senate at the
University of Oregon has voted to al
low two student representatives to at
tend its meetings and speak if they
wish.
The move, which has long been
sought by the Associated Students of
(he University of Oregon, came on a
119-45 vote after several hours debate
and a number of amendments to the
original motion.
ASUO had requested that two rep
resentatives be allowed to attend
meetings and that they be allowed to
speak if a majority of faculty agreed.
One of the amendments liberalized
the motion to allow the students to
speak just by being recognized by the
chairman of (he faculty.
Amended Motion
The much-amended motion gave
the two student representatives all of
the rights of members of the senate —
except for voting power.

The two representatives will be the
ASUO president, or the vice president
