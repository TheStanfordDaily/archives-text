# Students Will Be Advisors To CUE
## 
### 
Three students will serve on the
faculty Committee on Education as
"consultants," Speaker of the Legisla
ture Jay Kadane announced yester
day.
"This is a step forward in student
faculty relations," Kadane comment
ed. "This was the last faculty com
mittee of interest to students that did
not include student members."
As on the other faculty committees,
students will attend meetings but will
not have voting privileges.
Next Step
According to Kadane, securing the
right to vote on faculty committees
is the "next step for student gov

ernment." Students on Presidential
committees already have that right.
Proposal by Wert
The action to admit student mem
bers was originally taken one week
ago at the Committee's regular meet
ing. According to Professor D. F.
Tuttle, also a member of the Commit
tee, the change was first proposed by
Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert J. Wert.
"The motion met with no opposi
tion," Professor Tuttle recalls.
Dean Wert notified ASSU President
Sandy Mackenzie of the Committee's
action in a letter dated April 28.
Interesting: And Capable
In the letter, Dean Wert called on
Mackenzie to choose "three interest
ing and capable students" as mem
bers of the Committee.
Mackenzie is now working with
ASSU President-elect Dave Harris in
selecting the nominees. Their choices
are subject to approval by the Legis
lature.
The movement to give student mem
bers on Committees of the Academic
Council was given impetus by the
Legislature last fall when it passed
a resolution urging that students be
placed on faculty committees. The
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council later authorized this
change and suggested to the other
Committees that they adopt it.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Education was the last important
"holdout" from this policy. Students
had consulted with certain of its sub
committees, but never with the full
Committee itself.
Faculty members now on the Com
mittee include R. J. Wert, A. G. Grom
mon, J. G. Gurley, A. H. Hastorf, D.
Kennedy, R. W. Lyman, T. C. Moser,
D. F. Tuttle, and R. A. Walker.
