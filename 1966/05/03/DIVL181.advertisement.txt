In a world where the predominant philosophy is "if
you can't lick 'em, join 'em," it's refreshing to find a
maverick legislator who believes "if you can't join
'em, lick 'em!" Last summer, when Congress refused
to hold Vietnam hearings, Wisconsin's Representative
Robert W. Kastenmeier held them on his home ground.
Vietnam Hearings: I'oices from the Grass Roots
($1.95 Doubleday paperback) is a transcript of testi
mony given at Mr. Kastenmeier's hearings. "It is,"
writes the reviewer in Harper's magazine, "an ex
traordinary cross section of witnesses, committees,
and individuals who took great trouble and thought to
organize and express their opinions."
Here is what professors, army officers, scientists,
physicians, ADA members, Young Republicans, Amer
ican Legionnaires, and people from every segment of
American life say about the war. Every shade of opin
ion is represented, giving full justice to both sides of
the question. There's a good deal of food for thought
in this unique hearing which The New York Times
calls a "new political phenomenon."
Student freedom and student rebellion at the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley were issues that
brought one of the world's most famous centers of
learning to the edge of collapse. Of lasting interest
and value, The Berkeley Student Revolt: Facts
ami Interpretations ($1.95, an Anchor Original) was
edited by two professors, then at Berkeley, Seymour
Martin Lipset and Sheldon S. Wolin. It is particularly
interesting because the editors themselves reflect so
vividly the split in opinion of the faculty as well as
the students.
"Mr. Lipset takes a dim view of the uprising," writes
A. H. Raskin in the N. Y. Times Boole Review. "He 1
sees it as a portent that all universities may be forced
to capitulate to the coercive tactics of radical minori- ]
ties . . . Mr. Wolin seems to feel that such a develop
ment would be far from disaster . . . Fascinating."
'I he N. 1 . Herald Tribune, in discussing what they call
"The Varsity Snag," says,"The editors . . . seem to
have chosen to collaborate precisely because they took
opposite roles in the controversy and see its meaning
differently. Their selections are indeed scrupulously
balanced ... it amounts to a genuine documentary that
merits close attention . . . The merit of The Berkeley
student Revolt, however, is that it is not bound by the
perspective of either of its editors. Its selections'pro
vide the terms for subsequent debate about the broad
est questions that grew out of the free speech crisis."
