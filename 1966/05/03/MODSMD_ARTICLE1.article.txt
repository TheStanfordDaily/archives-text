# Rep Asks For Greater Audience Response
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor (Last in a Series 
If the Stanford Repertory Theater
can be adventurous in its staging and
choice of productions, why can't the
theater-going audience be equally ad
venturous in its response?
Gerald Hiken, a member of the Rep
company and instructor in the Speech
and Drama Department, recently
raised this question in an interview
with The Daily.
"American audiences tend to be po
lite, and the middle way is terrible,"
Hiken noted. Passive but polite audi
ences fail to challenge the company.
However, it is the challenge of an in
volved audience which forces actors
to do their best, he allowed.
Myth of Inviolability
Blaming "the myth of the inviola
bility of the artist," Hiken has found
Rep audiences, like most Broadway
audiences, are afraid to get involved
in a play. He castigated the average
theater-goer who would prefer to sit
through an inaudible performance

rather than simply saying, "Louder,
please!"
With an involved audience each per
former is forced to bring clarity to
his performance, to search for the
nuances in his role and project them
before his audience, he noted.
"We would like a few raspberries
and cow-bells every now and then be
cause it would keep us honest," Hiken
commented. Yet it is not with squelch
es and nightclub cuteness that the
Rep company would respond, but with
greater clarity in its acting.
Girls Chewing Bubble Gum
Hiken recalled a matinee perform
ance of "All's Well," which was at
tended by several hundred students
from Ravenswood High School. He
said the youngsters were talking
throughout most of the play, and he
could hear little girls in the front row
chewing bubble gum.
Hiken and the other members of the
Rep found the afternoon a real chal
lenge, but one they enjoyed greatly.
Forced by their audience to bring out
the meaning of the play, the company
could not settle for an arid reading

which might occur in the wake of a
long run and a passive audience.
By the end of the Shakespearian
comedy the company had captured its
audience, and Hiken believed the
youngsters enjoyed the experience.
Fault of the Audience
If the critics claim American drama
is dying, part of the blames has to go
to contemporary audiences, he main
tained.
In part, the Repertory Theater was
founded to interest more people in
dramas, those who had avoided live
theater because of high ticket prices
or lack of opportunity. Selling more
than 2,000 season tickets, the company
has done much to stir interest in the
Bay Area.
However, Hiken said the Rep would
like to see a mixed audience, especial
ly one with more students. Student
attendance has run around ten per
cent, but Rep officials hope to in
crease the number with a broader
discount program for next season.
Becoming - Involved
By holding special previews and dis
cussions with the Rep actors, the com

pany is encouraging student theater
goers to become involved in drama.
Some of the Rep's adventurous spirit
has spilled over into student drama,
but the number and extent of student
productions have had to be reduced.
A University report issued in fall
1964 noted "limitations of space would
necessarily curtail productions open to
all students, regardless of training and
major."
In concrete terms this has meant
the elimination of Ram's Head's
spring musical because of scheduling
conflicts in Memorial Auditorium.
Ram's Head's usual trilogy of one-act
plays has been shifted from winter
quarter to replace the musical.
A Lack of Facilities
Bob Stone, business manager for
the student drama organization told
The Daily, "No group which provides
entertainment and education for the
students should have to suffer for a
lack of facilities."
The reduction in student drama has
caused some bitterness toward the
Repertory Theater, but Hiken main
tains it was never the Rep's intention

to displace undergraduate drama at
Stanford.
Ram's Head was not consulted dur
ing this year's scheduling of events in
Memorial Auditorium, and hence was
disquieted to find Rep Theater events
had already been assigned. However,
the pre-empting of Ram's Head's nor
mal scheduling was due to pressure
from the Rockefeller Foundation to
open the Repertory Theater this sea
son. Scheduling has also worked
against the Rep, for it was forced to
play during dead week on occasion.
In the long run, the presence of a
professional company should assist
Ram's Head and undergraduate
drama in general. When the Rep
moves into its new theater, Memorial
Auditorial will be free for student pro
ductions.
The Rep has already made a contri
bution to livelier undergraduate pro
duction. Each actor is given one play
off during the season. Gerald Hiken
spent his vacation from "Prometheu
Bound" staging a avant-garde produc
tion of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night"
in Tresidder Union.

The Ram Head's spring one-acts are
being directed by graduate students
in the Master of Fine Arts Program
who spend most of their time with the
Rep.
Due to the strenuous rehearsal
schedules, Hiken said undergraduates
participation in Rep productions was
almost impossible. However, the pres
ence of the Rep assures that student
drama will no longer be dominated by
graduate students.
Delegation From Rain's Head
Other colleges with permanent rep
ertory groups, such as Michigan and
Princeton, have found a flowering of
both student and professional drama.
A delegation of Ram's Head mem
bers is presently working with Jack
Fisher, who handles public relations
for the Rep, in an effort to eliminate
the mechanical problems raised by
the advent of the Rep.
If the Rep is successful in stimu
lating the University community's in
terest in live drama, Hiken and others
agree both the Rep and undergradu
ate drama will be in a stronger posi
tion.
