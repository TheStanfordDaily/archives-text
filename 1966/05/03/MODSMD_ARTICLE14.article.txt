# NINE STRONG
## Indian Varsity, Frosh Win 
### 
Notoriously unlucky on road
trips, the Stanford Indians made
an abrupt about face last week
end when they beat UCSB, 6-3,
and demolished UCLA, 18-0 and
7-0.
Frank Klinger went all nine
innings against Santa Barbara
to pick up the win. Pete Middle
kauff, who played flawlessly in
the field all three games, hit a
home run to help Klinger along.
The combined margin of vic
tory, 25 runs, against UCLA is
the largest in a doubleheader by
10 runs in the entire history of
the CIBA.
John Mason and Terry Docken
pitched excellent ball against the
Bruins and each picked up a win
for their efforts.
Mason threw the 18-0 game,
and he also contributed five of
those runs. He blasted two home
runs for five RBIs.
The big stick of the day was
undoubtedly Jim Hibbs. Hibbs

had three home runs and 10
RBIs for the day. In the ninth
of the first game he hit a three
run homer and then got up again
in the same inning to hit a
grand slam home run.
Hi Lewis and Frank Duffy
also added homers. Duffy did
his usual outstanding job in the
field, too.
Mike Schomaker, Steve Hov
ley, and Hibbs bombed Bruin
pitchers for home runs in the
second game which the Indians
won, 7-0.
Stanford batters got 18 hits
in the first game against UCLA
and 12 more in the second con
test.
Frosh Score Big
Scoring fifteen runs in the
last three innings and sending
the San Francisco coach to the
bullpen for help four times,
Stanford's frosh baseball team
tore through their opponents for
a total of 17 runs to only 3
yesterday afternoon.
Things looked dull up until the
fifth inning, when SF State led
by a score of 3-2. Both infields
played errorless ball throughout

the entire game, but fans crave
runs, and had to wait until the
sixth, when Stanford broke loose
on Shotts' first home run of the
afternoon with one on, and had
it followed by Krause's two-run
homer.
In the seventh, the Frosh went
on a nine run rampage that saw
Shotts hit his second homer of

the game and pitcher Rose send
it the distance for a grand-slam.
Relief pitcher Buck of Stan
ford held the S.F. State team
scoreless in the last two in
nings.
This afternoon the Stanford
varsity meets the San Diego
Marines at 3:00 in the Sunken
Diamond.
