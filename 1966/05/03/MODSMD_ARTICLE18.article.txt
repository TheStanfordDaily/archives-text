# Contracts And The CIA
## 
### 
The revelation that Stanford's Department of
Electrical Engineering Is involved in secret re
search for the Central Intelligence Agency
poses some interesting questions — questions
which we feel should be answered for the bene
fit of the University community. For although
Stanford's research for the CIA, insofar as can
be determined, is not by nature much different
from other University research, there are ques
tions of policy and principle involved.
To begin with, should the University accept
contracts of any nature for secret research? The
University traditionally is a place for free and
open inquiry in which knowledge is pursued
from a disinterested, nonpartisan viewpoint.
When secret research in support of political
and ideological causes becomes a part of the
campus scene, is not one of the fundamental
responsibilities accompanying academic free
dom violated? Understandably, such questions
may have been cast aside during the Korean
War when Stanford involved itself in research
which a fledgling electronics industry could not
handle, but circumstances are different now
and perhaps a re-evaluation of the policy is
called for.
More specifically, if the University makes
the decision to accept secret contracts, should

the CIA contracts be included among them?
America's biggest spy bureau has never been
too popular at home where its penchant for
secrecy seems to contradict the values of a
free democracy, and it has been even less popu
lar abroad where the CIA reportedly has aided
in the overthrow of more than one democrat
ically-elected government. The University
should ask itself if it wants to condone this
type of organization through contracted re
search.
Finally comes the question of which bodies
and individuals within the University should
review contracts before they are accepted. At
present this function is fulfilled by the deans
of the individual schools, the Controller's Office
and the Provost's Office. However, the fact that
even members of Stanford's top faculty group,
the Executive Committee of the Academic
Council, did not know of the contract in ques
tion until yesterday would seem to indicate an
inadequacy in the present decision-making
process—at least insofar as research contracts
are concerned. The University might consider
bringing the faculty into the process by having
a faculty group, perhaps one appointed by the
Executive Committee, review contracts of a
controversial nature.
