## P.A. Times Okays Liquor Change 
### 
Stanford University trustees
have approved a historic change
in policy in authorizing students
over 21 to drink alcoholic bev
erages in campus residences.
The change in theory is larger
than the change in practice. Uni
versity authorities have been
frank to concede that the old
prohibition was routinely vio
lated and was largely unenforce
able. It became embarrassing
after the opening of a new fac
ulty club with bar service.
Still, as drinking in campus
residences by those old enough
to do so legally becomes coun
tenanced rather than forbidden,
there will be practical changes.
University President Wallace
Sterling voiced "particular con
cern" about the effects on stu
dents under 21 in his announce
ment of the new policy. Well he
might, for anyone can see that
enforcing the remaining ban on

the under-21s when the beer bar
rel's being tapped at the fratern
ity house will be little easier
than enforcing the old ban. Pre
sumably the change will bring
some students under 21 into con
tact with liquor who otherwise
would not have encountered it.
The task of regulating use of
booze in each campus residence
has been handed to that resi
dence. Its members will set the
conditions and become responsi
ble for compliance. In this, the
administration may have swung
its best stroke of the battle. The
tedious round of instituting
"regs" and reviewing and
amending them later could drain
off enough student energy to
undercut wilder, stickier pro
tests.
President Sterling also pro
vided a splendid motto, fit to
hang on the wall of every cam
pus rumpus room. He 6aid:

. . when alcoholic beverages
are used at all, they should be
used in moderation and . . . the
conduct of students on the Stan
ford campus shall at no time be
disorderly or otherwise offens
ive due to immoderate use of
alcohol or for any other reason."
Sons of the Stanford Red will
drink to that!
On another point, Sterling
said alcoholic beverages shall
not be sold on the Stanford cam
pus. This rejects a suggested
ratskeller. Let's hope Stanford
will perpetuate this part of the
policy.
Finally, the statement said
nothing of a proposal that Stan
ford join other universities in
asking the legislature to cut the
minimum age for drinking from
21 to 18. It is safe to assume
that students will have more to
say on this.
