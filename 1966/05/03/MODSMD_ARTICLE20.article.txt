# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Exchange Editorial Comment 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I found your editorial regard
ing the Palo Alto Times editorial
which addressed the Stanford
liquor policy re-examination
(The Daily, April 6) to be very
intelligent and pertinent.
The reason I found it pertin
ent is as follows. I believe it
pointed up the fact that the sep
aration between the Stanford
community and the Palo Alto
community is in fact much
greater than the physical mile

of Palm Drive. The differences
between the communities may
be superficially measured by the
differences between the editorial
positions of their respective
newspapers. The differences may
be more accurately measured by
comparing, over time, the letters
to the respective editors.
Occasionally there appears a
letter in the Times from a pro
fessor or his wife. The only re
ciprocal communication that
ever seems to reach the ears of
the Stanford community at
large seems to be from occasion
al little old ladies on the issues
of liquor, sex, etc. (the Stanford
View sort of thing). This ap
pears to be the extent of inter
communication.
Since I think mutual aware
ness of the opinions and feel
ings of the constituents of both
communities is desirable to
wards stimulating thought and
understanding on the parts of
both communities, I feel that
there is a real need for broader
channels of communication.
Therefore, I would suggest
that one day a week there be

an exchange of editorials be
tween the two newspapers. Per
haps these would draw comment
from the citizens of the two
communities and there could fol
low letters addressing the edi
torials of the previous week.
The details would need to be
refined and worked out, but the
basic idea points to a very poten
tially stimulating exchange. I
wonder if the editor could brief
ly address the feasibility of such
an exchange.

receptive to the idea, and will
reprint editorials from the Palo
Alto Times that are of interest

The Daily has talked to the
editors of the Times, who are
not overly enthusiastic about
the idea. Hence, the Times' let
ters-to-the-editor department and
infrequent reprinting of Daily
editorials will remain as the
main source of the Stanford
viewpoint flowing into the Palo
Alto community.)

communication.
Since I think mutual aware
ness of the opinions and feel
ings of the constituents of both
communities is desirable to
wards stimulating thought and
understanding on the parts of
both communities, I feel that
there is a real need for broader
channels of communication.
Therefore, I would suggest
that one day a week there be

an exchange of editorials be
tween the two newspapers. Per
haps these would draw comment
from the citizens of the two
communities and there could fol
low letters addressing the edi
torials of the previous week.
The details would need to be
refined and worked out, but the
basic idea points to a very poten
tially stimulating exchange. I
wonder if the editor could brief
ly address the feasibility of such
an exchange.

receptive to the idea, and will
reprint editorials from the Palo
Alto Times that are of interest
to the Stanford community. One
such editorial Ls reprinted on
this page today.
The Daily has talked to the
editors of the Times, who are
not overly enthusiastic about
the idea. Hence, the Times' let
ters-to-the-editor department and
infrequent reprinting of Daily
editorials will remain as the
main source of the Stanford
viewpoint flowing into the Palo

Editor, The Daily:
I found your editorial regard
ing the Palo Alto Times editorial
which addressed the Stanford
liquor policy re-examination
(The Daily, April 6) to be very
intelligent and pertinent.
The reason I found it pertin
ent is as follows. I believe it
pointed up the fact that the sep
aration between the Stanford
community and the Palo Alto
community is in fact much
greater than the physical mile

of Palm Drive. The differences
between the communities may
be superficially measured by the
differences between the editorial
positions of their respective
newspapers. The differences may
be more accurately measured by
comparing, over time, the letters
to the respective editors.
Occasionally there appears a
letter in the Times from a pro
fessor or his wife. The only re
ciprocal communication that
ever seems to reach the ears of
the Stanford community at
large seems to be from occasion
al little old ladies on the issues
of liquor, sex, etc. (the Stanford
View sort of thing). This ap
pears to be the extent of inter
communication.
Since I think mutual aware
ness of the opinions and feel
ings of the constituents of both
communities is desirable to
wards stimulating thought and
understanding on the parts of
both communities, I feel that
there is a real need for broader
channels of communication.
Therefore, I would suggest
that one day a week there be

an exchange of editorials be
