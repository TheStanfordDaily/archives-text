# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## Universality And History 
### HARALD OHLENDORF DAVID CORNBERG 
(Editor's note: This Ls the
fifth in a leisurely series of ar
ticles on education at Stanford.
The authors of this installment
attempt to provide a radical his
torical perspective for viewing
American education tlirough the
Stanford context.)

One of the methods for com
ing to understand any idea
more deeply is to look into its
history, both noting its varia
tions and trying to grasp its fun
damental and durable identity.
We propose to put forth the
concepts of education and uni
versality in a really radically
historical way, and to suggest
that some of our professors who
have also expressed interest and
concern in these problems and
their implications have failed to
grasp them at their roots.
The result of this failure, we
maintain, is to destroy the pos
sibility for the depth of concern
these professors encourage, and
to cultivate that very atmo
sphere of superficiality which
they would like to inhibit.
Unrest And Universality
Prof. Rhinelander, for exam
ple, in his recent article, "Stu
dent Unrest," expresses an inter
est and concern for the forma
tive role of the student in uni
versity affairs.
He quotes the medievalist,
Hoskins, as stating that, "His
torically, the word university
has no connection with the uni
verse of the universality of
learning; it denotes only the to
tality of a group, whether of
barbers, carpenters, or students
did not matter."
Prof. Rhinelander, then, if we
understand him correctly, grasps
the term 'university' as a name
for a group of people with so
cial power. Though he writes of
"the crisis in values" and"the
void at the center," he dismisses
the suggestion that this crisis or
void might have anything to do
with the universality of knowl
edge.
Truth and Power
Though that view of the uni
versity is correct to the letter of
the term, and true to one aspect
of the idea, it plays false to an
other aspect, and in a danger
ously anarchistic way.
One of the modern motiva
tions for knowledge is expressed
in Francis Bacon's famous state
ment, "Knowledge is power."
He means social power, and
he presumes that this power will
be employed for the advantage
of mankind if it is invested in
those with ethical concern—and
if they truly know what their
ethical concerns are.
Rhinelander's view seems to
be in accord with this Baconian
view.
Another motivation for knowl
edge, the classical one especial
ly as it is expressed by Plato,
points in a quite different direc
tion, which the Baconian in his
ethical enthusiasm often finds
difficult to grasp. It is the view
that all knowledge begins with
wonder.
To this attitude of wonder
Plato gives the name 'theory',
and that is the word used in
Greek drama to denote the spec
tator's detached amazement at
the spectacle of the tragedy he
is watching—to denote, in other
words, that there is something
about our ethical nature which
really needs to be understood be
fore proper social action, truly
advantageous to man, can be un
dertaken.
Ancients and Medievals
These words—theory, amaze
ment, wonder—indicate the abil
ity of the spectator to detach
himself from his ethical pas
sions and find a deeper under
standing of truth. Philosophy
begins with wonder, according
to the ancients, and philosophy
provides a means of uniting all
the other disciplines into a uni
versality of knowledge.
If we had only to consider the
medieval idea of the university,
Prof. Rhinelander's view could
perhaps stand as correct.
But that university had al
ready at its foundations the
Greek idea of the academy, with
its interest in the universality of
knowledge which Mr. Wedin has
already explicated in this series.
The identification of the term
'university' with the Greek ideal
of the universality of knowledge
simply gave a new name to a
view of education which was al
ready deeply rooted in the cul
ture.
Specialization and Prejudice
It is often argued that though
the concept of the universality
of knowledge was once a possi
bility, the tremendous progress
of modern science and technolo
gy has now ruled it out; the de

mand for special knowledge, and
the quantity of material, even in
the humanities, is said to pre
clude the possibility for a gen
eral and synoptic view of the
culture, or at the very least, to
reduce the synoptic task to a
corporate effort, removing it
from the sphere of capability of
any one individual; the day of
the 'renaissance man' is thus
thought to be over.
But the desire for universality
does not die so easily, and when
it is banished from the intellect
it has a way of reinstating itself
in emotions and prejudices.
The physicist may suppose
that all other disciplines can be
reduced to his own; he assumes
a materialist position on a phil
osophical issue which he has not
studied. Or the scholar of litera
ture, setting the discipline of
philosophy aside, builds his lit
erary interpretations on his own
uncriticized ethical dogmas. Or
the professional philosopher, set
ting philology and the classics
aside, reinterprets the ancient
texts to conform with his mod
ern prejudices.
Far from abandoning the
ideal of universality, such schol
ars assume that they have al
ready achieved it.
The Smorgasbord View
Now, another argument runs,
the ideal of universality has been
neither abandoned nor dog
matically assumed; it has been
accepted as a fundamental chal
lenge in the university, and is
responsible for the general edu
cation programs whose purpose
is to produce not only a special
ist, but a well-rounded man in
the bargain.
But is this general education
truly general? Does it not rath
er amount to a smorgasbord of
tidbits from the special disci
plines?
Are we certain that, though it
appears comprehensive and syn
optic to the casual glance of the
specialist in one morsel, this
general education will not dis
integrate into a meaningless
mas of fragments for the person
who tries to grasp it in its uni
versality?
And, if we are convinced that
this is not the case, is the con
viction based on real insight into
the problem of generality, or is
it not rather based on the social
conviction that the system is
working pretty well?
Affirm the last answer, and
you will find yourself taking
Bacon's position against Plato's.
And it would be a strange uni
versality which would exclude
its own foundations in Greek
thought.
Intellectual Alienation
Back again to the beginning:
the term 'univeristy', we main
tain, is infused with the ideal of
universality from the start;
Profs. Rhinelander and Hoskins
are true to the letter, but false
to the spirit.
Their view of universality is
founded on the Baconian view of
social power, not on the Platonic
view of the fundamental unity
of knowledge.
Lacking appreciation for the
latter view, they will not be able
to distinguish between a smor
gasbord which is a generaliza
tion assembled from special tid
bits, and the intrinsic unity of
truly general knowledge. They
may even want to deny the pos
sibility of the latter. If so, we
will serve us up a smorgasbord

of general education as a sec
ond best.
Then we, for our part, will ex
perience a certain unrest called
variously, "alienation," "crisis of
values," or "void in the center,"
and we will have difficulty get
ting ourselves out of this mood,
so long as we feel that our doc
tors are administering us the
disease instead of the cure.
If this contentiousness of ours
is really what is meant by
'alienation', and if we are right
in describing its cause as a
frustrated desire for universality
in our education, we will try to
break the bonds of intellectual
dogmatism, just as others press
for social reforms when they
feel that their rights are be
ing restricted.
Somebody will probably try to
write us off as intellectual an
archists, because we are unwill
ing to accept the present struc
ture of education, along with its
modern ethical foundations.
The Radical Conservative
Somebody else, on the other
hand, will call attention to what
Messrs. Moses and Ketchum
wrote last week, and accuse us
of absentmindedness: "Scratch a
liberal," they said, "and you'll
find a conservative underneath."
We will be made out to be
totalitarians in disguise, tyrants
of the mind, who put some fan
atic Platonic ideal of unity ahead
of true and deep concern for
present issues, and they will de
fend Profs. Rhinelander and
Hoskins against our unreason
able attacks.
( We have to write these critic
isms of ourselves, because the
community of scholars has been
too languid to refute us.)
Perhaps we are in some sense
conservatives. We promised at
the start, at any rate, to try to
put forth the concepts of edu
cation and universality in a
really radical historical way.
We pointed to a Greek ideal
(though we might also have ex
pressed it in one of a number of
modern ways), and affirmed a
classical view of education: phil
osophy, the love of wisdom, be
gins in amazement and theory,
and set forth an ideal of the
universality of knowledge.
We consider the Banconian
view of knowledge, with its in
sistence on social power and its
ethical dogmatism, not only in
ferior to the calssical view, but
also already effectively critic
ised by Plato, in his attack on
the ethical dogmatism of Prota
goras, as well as in his attack
on the poymathia, or knowledge
smorgasbord of Hippias.
These two positions are sym
ptomatic of the American view
of the university today: ethical
dogmatism and intellectual frag
mentation. The modern view
has, to put it in Kierkegaard's
phrase, surpassed the ancients
(by not getting as far).
Conspiracy Of Silence
Prof. Rhinelander has pointed
to an effective method for deal
ing with student unrest, and
also mentioned the most "devas
tating riposte": to do nothing at
all about it.
Now, social unrest is one
thing, but intellectual um-est is
another.
For our part, we have not
found that attitude of theory,
wonder, or amazement espec
ially restful.
At the same time, we find that
such a conflict as that between
Plato and Bacon lies very deep

within the structure of human
personality, and seems to be in
terrelated with the unrest we
feel; yet these conflicts are
necessarily raised when we try
to grasp education and univers
ality in a really radical way.
The response of most of the
scholars so far has been that
most "devastating riposte," no
response at all.
Dialogue, dissent, discussion,
and controversy in this sphere—
the understanding of the uni
versality of education—seems
uncongenial on this campus,
where student and teacher
would rather affirm the value
of their polymathia, or play out
their energies entirely in ethical
enthusiasms.
The atmosphere (if we could
venture such a generalization)
resembles that of the cradle
or the farm rather more than
that of the university.
