# UC Chancellor Wins Duel With Liberal Constitution
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
ASSU President-elect Dave Harris
is not the only person who feels that
students should have a larger part in
the decision-making of a university.
Last week at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, students voted on
a referendum which would have given
the ASUC a new constitution. The
referendum, which needed a two
thirds majority to pass, was defeated
soundly. The final vote was 41.1 per
cent in favor, 58.9 per cent opposed.
The referendum had precipitated
much ill-will between campus liberals
and the administration. According to
the Regents of the State of California,
the creation of a student government
on the Cal campus is the responsibili
ty of the Chancellor, and he alone has
the power to create such a govern
ment.
Increased Participation
Another area of contention was
part of the proposed constittuion
which would have given students an
increased voice in the area of decision
making. This is a second area in
which the Chancellor reigns supreme.
Nearly 50 per cent of the Cal stu
dent body voted on the referendum.
Even so, the vote was termed illegal
by the administration. University
Chancellor, Roger Heyns called the

election only an indication of student
opinion.
The new constitution had been pro
posed by Slate, a group of political
activists (whose name derives from
the fact that they have always put up
a slate of candidates for student elec
tions,) and the Graduate Co-ordinat
ing Committee.
Slate and G.C.C. Reaction
Reaction to the defeat of the refer
endum was violent on both sides of
the issue. Slate is expected to with
draw from all campus politics for the
rest of the year. The GCC is expected
to campaign actively against the up
coming election for new ASUC offi
cers, in an attempt to give the elec
tion as little legitimacy as possible.
In last year's election Slate capturcd
all but eight of the seats in the stu
dent senate.
The Cal Conservatives for Political
Action (CCPA) have gone on record
as being "glad to see it (the referen
dum) defeated." The administration,
while happy about the outcome, never
theless realize that the unusually
large vote on the referendum indi
cates a large dissatisfaction with the
current student government.
The Cal administration has con

ceded that a vast majority favors re
form and that a "change is needed."
Students at U.C. are concerned about
getting seats on the Academic Coun
cil, a group similar to Stanford's Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education.
Out of the residue of last week's
referendum has come what the Daily
Californian refers to as the "other"
constitution. This document was writ
ten by ASUC Senate Minority Leader
Dave Engel, and is expected to be on
the regular ASUC ballot in May. This
second constitution faces the same
problems as the original in being rati
fied, since, at this moment, it has not
received administration approval. Ac
cording to the Daily Californian,
"there is a growing dissatisfaction
with the part that students here are
allowed to play in determining what
their education will be."
"What part this dissatisfaction will
play in the future of student govern
ment," the Daily Californian contin
ued, "cannot be judged at the present
time. It is well known, however, that
all Slate referendums have eventually
been approved by the student body.
There is no reason to believe that a
new constitution for the ASUC will
not become a reality also."

increased voice in the area of decision

Nearly 50 per cent of the Cal stu
dent body voted on the referendum.
Even so, the vote was termed illegal
by the administration. University
Chancellor, Roger Heyns called the

election only an indication of student
opinion.
The new constitution had been pro
posed by Slate, a group of political
activists (whose name derives from
the fact that they have always put up
a slate of candidates for student elec
tions,) and the Graduate Co-ordinat
ing Committee.
Slate and G.C.C. Reaction
Reaction to the defeat of the refer
endum was violent on both sides of
the issue. Slate is expected to with
draw from all campus politics for the
rest of the year. The GCC is expected
to campaign actively against the up
coming election for new ASUC offi
cers, in an attempt to give the elec
tion as little legitimacy as possible.
In last year's election Slate capturcd
all but eight of the seats in the stu
dent senate.
The Cal Conservatives for Political
Action (CCPA) have gone on record
as being "glad to see it (the referen
dum) defeated." The administration,
while happy about the outcome, never
theless realize that the unusually
large vote on the referendum indi
cates a large dissatisfaction with the
current student government.
The Cal administration has con

ceded that a vast majority favors re
form and that a "change is needed."
Students at U.C. are concerned about
getting seats on the Academic Coun
cil, a group similar to Stanford's Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education.
Out of the residue of last week's
referendum has come what the Daily
Californian refers to as the "other"
constitution. This document was writ
ten by ASUC Senate Minority Leader
Dave Engel, and is expected to be on
the regular ASUC ballot in May. This
second constitution faces the same
problems as the original in being rati
fied, since, at this moment, it has not
received administration approval. Ac
cording to the Daily Californian,
"there is a growing dissatisfaction
with the part that students here are
allowed to play in determining what
their education will be."
"What part this dissatisfaction will
play in the future of student govern
ment," the Daily Californian contin
ued, "cannot be judged at the present
time. It is well known, however, that
all Slate referendums have eventually
been approved by the student body.
There is no reason to believe that a
new constitution for the ASUC will
not become a reality also."
ASSU President-elect Dave Harris
is not the only person who feels that
students should have a larger part in
the decision-making of a university.
Last week at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, students voted on
a referendum which would have given
the ASUC a new constitution. The
referendum, which needed a two
thirds majority to pass, was defeated
soundly. The final vote was 41.1 per
cent in favor, 58.9 per cent opposed.
The referendum had precipitated
much ill-will between campus liberals
and the administration. According to
the Regents of the State of California,
the creation of a student government
on the Cal campus is the responsibili
ty of the Chancellor, and he alone has
the power to create such a govern
ment.
