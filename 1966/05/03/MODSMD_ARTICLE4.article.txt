# Committee Analyzes Social Regs
## 
### 
Social Regulations Committee will
conclude its work on this year's evalu
ation of the present system of wom
en's regulations with a report to the
Student Affairs and Services Commit
tee, an advisory group to President
Sterling.
This analysis, composed of three
sections, has been prepared by the
Social Regulations Committee with
the help of Women's Council and the
Auxiliary House Councils, said Ellen
Otto, committee chairman. "Almost
two quarters of planning and work
have gone into the production of this
report," she said.
First Evaluation
Last spring when the present social
regulations were adopted bv the Trus
tees, the AWS Social Regulations
Committee was directed to prepare an
extensive evaluation each Spring
Quarter for the next three years. The
survey which is now in its final prep
aratory stages is the first of this se
ries.
A Committee questionnaire sent to
one-third of Stanford's women under
graduates inquired about the present
regulations—specifically how satisfac-

Tory they are, and how they might be
improved.
Barbara Miller, committee member
who arranged the survey, said that the
questionnaire developed from ques
tions raised during last year's debate
over policy change, and from sugges
tions of women students.
Professor Nathan Maccoby of the
Communications Department helped
with the writing of the questions.
Tabulation Of Late leaves
A tabulation of the average number
of overnights used, of six o'clock sign
ins by seniors and juniors, and of
freshman late leaves has been made.
The auxiliary committees in the wom
en's residences also prepared their
own comments on the administration
involved in the hour regulations.
The final part of the evaluation is a
report on interviews held with the di
rectors and residence assistants in all
of the women's dormitories, in which
staff members were asked about
problems which they encountered this
year.
Copies of the evaluation will be sent
to the Student Affairs Committee of

LASSU as well as the presidential
committee. Recommendations for
changes in the system which result
from this study will be included in
the report.
In addition, the LASSU committee
will discuss the results of the prefer
ential poll made during the presiden
tial primary. Elections Commission
Chairman, Roger Bounds, submitted
the results of this poll last week.

Auxiliary House Councils, said Ellen
Otto, committee chairman. "Almost
two quarters of planning and work
have gone into the production of this
report," she said.
First Evaluation
Last spring when the present social
regulations were adopted bv the Trus
tees, the AWS Social Regulations
Committee was directed to prepare an
extensive evaluation each Spring
Quarter for the next three years. The
survey which is now in its final prep
aratory stages is the first of this se
ries.
A Committee questionnaire sent to
one-third of Stanford's women under
graduates inquired about the present
regulations—specifically how satisfac-

Tory they are, and how they might be
improved.
Barbara Miller, committee member
who arranged the survey, said that the
questionnaire developed from ques
tions raised during last year's debate
over policy change, and from sugges
tions of women students.
Professor Nathan Maccoby of the
Communications Department helped
with the writing of the questions.
Tabulation Of Late leaves
A tabulation of the average number
of overnights used, of six o'clock sign
ins by seniors and juniors, and of
freshman late leaves has been made.
The auxiliary committees in the wom
en's residences also prepared their
own comments on the administration
involved in the hour regulations.
The final part of the evaluation is a
report on interviews held with the di
rectors and residence assistants in all
of the women's dormitories, in which
staff members were asked about
problems which they encountered this
year.
Copies of the evaluation will be sent
to the Student Affairs Committee of

LASSU as well as the presidential
committee. Recommendations for
changes in the system which result
from this study will be included in
the report.
In addition, the LASSU committee
will discuss the results of the prefer
ential poll made during the presiden
tial primary. Elections Commission
Chairman, Roger Bounds, submitted
the results of this poll last week.
