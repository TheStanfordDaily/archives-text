# Pickets Invade Quad, Protest CIA Contract
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Armed with pickets declaring "The
Winds ol Freedom Get Hotter All the
Time," "The University and the CIA
Have No Common Business," and
"Come to the Inner City—F in d the
CIA," approximately 35 students and
faculty members gathered outside the
office of Associate Provost for Re
search Hubert Heffner shortly after
1 p.m. yesterday.
The group distributed statements
protesting the Electrical Engineering
Department's contract with the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency. Refering to
a statement appearing in yesterday's
Daily by Heffner, the release stated:
"We protest because Dr. Heffner's
statements express a patent self-con
tradiction —if the University is not en
gaged in convert or clandestine activi
ties, why is he 'not at liberty to dis
close the nature of the contract?'"
Demonstrators sat quietly for about
20 minutes before Heffner appeared.
Citing student concern over the Stan
ford contract with the CIA, Heffner
stated, "Most of us have our doubts
as to whether the CIA is operating in
the national interest. Theoretically it
cannot operate within the United
States; there is some question as to
whether it does or not."
Aura of CIA
He said that the present anxiety
was chiefly due to the "aura" sur
rounding the CIA and stated that if
the students knew the nature of the
local contract, they would no be so
concerned about it.
Donald Grace, associate director of
the systems-technique lab, reinforced
Heffner's view in a telephone inter
view with The Daily. He explained
that the present CIA contract has
been in existence for several years
and "has nothing whatsoever to do
with international relations, humani
ties, or the like.
"This is purely an engineering
research project and is indis
tinguishable from the other endeavors
under study in the school of engineer
ing. The situation has absolutely no
similarities with the recent controver
sy at Michigan State University,"
Grace concluded.
One student in the group asked if
"The University should ally itself with
an organization that has been known
to lie and often has required public
officials to do the same." He contin
ued, "Do we have any way of knowing
what they will do with our findings,

or even if what they propose as their
purpose is true?"
Heffner replied. "Given the proper
guidelines for determining the type
of research the University ought to
undertake, the question of whether or
not we should accept contracts from
the CIA seems to be an issue of tactics
and consequences as opposed to the
morality of the ClA's reputation."
Tom Forstenzer, graduate student
in history, commented that "in order
to maintain the academic enterprise
at Stanford, the line has to be drawn
somewhere."
Contract Criteria
Heffner stated the following criteria
the University considers when accept
ing classified contracts:
• Contracts should meet the quali
fications applied to any research proj
ect. They should represent some bona
fide study that is academically justi
fiable and should represent some new
contribution to the field of knowledge.
• The sponsor of the contract
should be known to either the Univer
sity President or his representatives
prior to the initiation of the contract.
• The contract should not contain
any overseas activities.
• Contracts must not require the
University to be a cover for any type
of clandestine activities.
Not An Arm of CIA
"We have strenuously attempted to
avoid inferrence that the University
is an arm of the CIA," Heffner con
tinued. "We accept grants from don
ors with whom we do not particularly
care to be allied, but we will not re

fuse a gift if its objectives are worth
while."
When asked if he would suggest
the formation of a faculty committee
to review classified contracts, Heffner
replied, "I will. Its function will be
to give me the opportunity to learn
faculty sentiment and also to channel
projects that might be of special in
terest to certain departments. There
has been no request for a body of this
kind from the faculty until now."
In a later telephone interview Pro
fessor Kenneth Arrow of the econom
ics department and a member of the
Executive Committee of the Academic
Council revealed that the committee
was not aware of the CIA contract.
"The article in The Daily was the first
I've heard about this. Of course, the
issue came up after our last meeting,
and I'm certain that it will be dis
cussed when we meet again next
week."
Key Questions
Barton Bernstein, assistant profes
sor of history, summed up the re
quests of the demonstrators. "We
would like to know how many classi
fied contracts, exist, what kind they
are, how they were selected, how
much money is involved, and if any
contracts have been refused."
Heffner informed the group that
Stanford has refused to accept offers
from the Agency for International De
velopment (AID). These contracts de
manded the right to review and re
fuse publication, to screen University
personnel, and to recall researchers
sent overseas.
