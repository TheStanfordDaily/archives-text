# Bellow Discusses Challenges To Today's Aspiring Writers
## 
### BOB FISHMAN Senior Staff Writer 
The man proclaimed by many crit
ics to be America's best living novel
ist sat down yesterday with some of
Stanford's aspiring writers to discuss
the nature of his craft.
Perched on the edge of a desk in
the Jones Room of the Main Library,
his collar loosened and the sleeves of
his blue shirt rolled up, Saul Bellow
talked about the challenges facing
young writers in the United States to
day.
"You're like the Ancient Mariner
when you're writing," he said. "You're
stopping somebody on the way to a
wedding. If you haven't anything rele
vant to tell him, you shouldn't be
stopping him."
One of the major responsibilities
which Bellow saw facing the young
writer today is that of self-definition.
"This task is such a burden that some
times nothing is left for art," he said.
Another problem which Bellow de
scribed was the "posture" which mod
ern writers should take towards
American society. He remarked that
most modern writers and critics have
followed Joyce, Yeats, Eliot, and D.H.
Lawrence in providing an "aesthetic"
critique of modern society.
"But suppose this sort of 'Waste
land' analysis is no longer relevant?"
he asked.
Separation Is Privileg-e
The separation of the sensitive in
dividual from his society also occu
pied Bellow's attention.
"The intelligent man today feels he
is separated from the society in which
he lives. But he thinks of his estrange
ment as a mark of distinction. The
intellectual class accepts its impotence
as if it were a privilege."
Another trend which drew comment
from Mr. Bellow was "the tendency to
make a virtue out of vulnerability.
The problem is to keep your feelings

open without being an idiot."
He cited his own book, Seize the
Day, as an attempt to describe a char
acter for whom "vulnerability is a
praiseworthy thing. He is a hero of
the feeling heart, who wages war in
his own small way to recall others to
feeling. But, seen objectively, he is a
slob and frightfully obstinate about
his own failings."
"Thoughts About Fiction"
Bellow will be on campus today and
tomorrow as a guest of the Creative
Writing Center. Tomorrow evening at
7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
he will deliver a public lecture on
"Fond and Wayward Thoughts about
Fiction."

times nothing is left for art," he said.
Another problem which Bellow de
scribed was the "posture" which mod
ern writers should take towards
American society. He remarked that
most modern writers and critics have
followed Joyce, Yeats, Eliot, and D.H.
Lawrence in providing an "aesthetic"
critique of modern society.
"But suppose this sort of 'Waste
land' analysis is no longer relevant?"
he asked.
Separation Is Privileg-e
The separation of the sensitive in
dividual from his society also occu
pied Bellow's attention.
"The intelligent man today feels he
is separated from the society in which
he lives. But he thinks of his estrange
ment as a mark of distinction. The
intellectual class accepts its impotence
as if it were a privilege."
Another trend which drew comment
from Mr. Bellow was "the tendency to
make a virtue out of vulnerability.
The problem is to keep your feelings

open without being an idiot."
He cited his own book, Seize the
Day, as an attempt to describe a char
acter for whom "vulnerability is a
praiseworthy thing. He is a hero of
the feeling heart, who wages war in
his own small way to recall others to
feeling. But, seen objectively, he is a
slob and frightfully obstinate about
his own failings."
"Thoughts About Fiction"
Bellow will be on campus today and
tomorrow as a guest of the Creative
Writing Center. Tomorrow evening at
7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
he will deliver a public lecture on
"Fond and Wayward Thoughts about
Fiction."
The man proclaimed by many crit
ics to be America's best living novel
ist sat down yesterday with some of
Stanford's aspiring writers to discuss
the nature of his craft.
Perched on the edge of a desk in
the Jones Room of the Main Library,
his collar loosened and the sleeves of
his blue shirt rolled up, Saul Bellow
talked about the challenges facing
young writers in the United States to
day.
"You're like the Ancient Mariner
when you're writing," he said. "You're
stopping somebody on the way to a
wedding. If you haven't anything rele
vant to tell him, you shouldn't be
stopping him."
One of the major responsibilities
which Bellow saw facing the young
writer today is that of self-definition.
"This task is such a burden that some
times nothing is left for art," he said.
Another problem which Bellow de
scribed was the "posture" which mod
