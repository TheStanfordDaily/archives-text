# Sick Of TMU? Eat At Encina
## 
### 
Encina Commons will open a
"limited public cafeteria" at
noon Monday, Mrs. Dorothy Bell,
director of Stanford University
Food Services, announced today.
Purpose is to provide an addi
tional luncheon spot for off-cam
pus students, faculty and staff,
Mrs. Bell said, in order to ease
the heavy customer load on both
Tresidder Union cafeteria and
the Encina basement snack bar.
The Commons cafeteria will be
open from noon until 1 p.m.
Monday through Friday on a
"trial run" basis. If demand
warrants, Mrs. Bell said, the
service will be expanded next
fall.
The soup and hot meal will be
the same served to students,
with a choice of salad, sand
wiches, beverages, and desserts.
Customers may enter the cafe
teria line through Room 4 on
the Commons and proceed to
Room 5 with their trays.
