# Bishop Of Woolwich Locates The 'Reality Of God'
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
To speak of 'God' is to refer neither
to a Being outside one's experience
nor to simply one's own way of look
ing at the world. Rather, it is "to ac
knowledge a relationship, a confronta
tion at the heart of one's very consti
tution as a human being, of which one
is compelled to say, 'This is it. This
is the most real thing in the world.' "
Thi6 was Bishop John A. T. Robin
son's effort at "Locating the Reality
of God," in a speech delivered last
night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium as the
second West lecture on "Explorations
into God." The concluding lecture,
"An Exercise in Re-centering" will be
given this afternoon in Dinkelspiel at
4:15.
A problem for current theology, the
Bishop of Woolwich, England, ex

plained, is that it attempts to repre
sent God as a Being. "Personifying
the reality of God as the existence of
a Being rather than strengthening
and sustaining this reality has the ef
fect in this age of displacing it and
evacuating it of power. It has con
tributed much to 'the death of God'
by removing him spiritually to an
area in which people no longer live
with any important part of their be
ing."
But on the other extreme, Bishop
Robinson also rejects the representa
tion of God an "how things are for a
man who sees a certain piece of his
tory in a certain wa" " The reality
described by Paul var B \ren and oth
er God -is - Dead theologians "is the
reality of a man's own conviction, the
ultimacy for him of a certain way of
viewing life."

He doubts that "by swinging over
from a completely objective, metaphy
sical answer to the question of the
reality indicated by the word 'God' to
a completely subjective, experimental
one" has really given a sufficient ac
count of what theological language is
trying to describe.
"What is involved in the way of ul
timacy of commitment is an essential
element in deciding the meaning of
any affirmation about what is real,"
he said. "But I am not happy about
the equation of 'test' and 'meaning'.
To determine everything by the quali
ty of the commitment is to say noth
ing of what has evoked that commit
ment."
Conscious Encounter
Statements about God, he believes,
are statements about relationship be
tween God and man. "Integral to any

God-statement in the consciousness of
being encountered, seized, held by a
prevenient reality, undeniable in its
objectivity, which seeks one out in
grace and demand and under the con
straint of which a man finds himself
judged and accepted for what he truly
is."
"To say of this or that situation, as
the Biblical wri 4 rr r»id, that God is in
it is not to make a abatement about
some supposed metaphysical entity
outside it or beyond it; nor is it to
say simply, 'This piece of history is of
fundamental importance for my life.' "
"It is to say that in and through
this event or person there meets me
a claim, a mystery, a grace, whose
overriding, transcendent, uncondition
al character can but be expressed by
responding with the prophet, Thus
saith the Lord.' "

The Bishop used the term 'the reali
ty of God' in preference either to the
existence or to the experience of God,
bcause 'reality contains within it both
the idea of objectivity and of subjec
tivity—for what is real must always
be real for someone."
There is great difficulty in speaking
of God, but "what we can speak of
from our human situation is the
awareness of being addressed, claimed
and sustained. We can testify to the
relationship, utterly personal in its
demand and succour, in which we
know ourselves held."
"We can say that however much
this awareness seems to come from
within, from the ground of our very
being, it confronts us also with an
otherness to which we can only re
spond as 'I' to 'Thou.' "
