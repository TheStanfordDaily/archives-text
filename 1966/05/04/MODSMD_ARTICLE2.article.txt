# Workers' Plays Aid In Strike
## 
### 
The Farm Worker's Theater (El
Teatro Campesino) conducted a noon
rally yesterday in support of the De
lano Grape Strike. Using original skits
and songs, the strikers of the National
Farm Workers Association (NFWA)
portrayed scenes from the strike in
cluding a skit showing a confrontation
among a Striker, a Scab (a non-union
worker), and a Grower. The Striker
wins.
The Teatro Campesino was orga
nized by Luis Valdez soon after the
strike began in September of last
year. Valdez is a farm worker turned
actor who was formerly with the San
Francisco Mime Troupe. Then, he
went to Delano to write, direct, and
perform in the one-act plays produced
by the Company.
Boycott Publicity
The current tour of the theater
group is designed to help publicize a
nation-wide boycott on the products of
the DiGiorgia Corporation, the largest
in the Delano area. The object of the
boycott is to bring Di Giorgio to the
bargaining table with no pre-condi
tions. Currently the Corporation is de
manding that there be no strike dur
ing the harvest season and that a
county-wide union, suspected by the
Farm Workers of being Di Giorgio
controlled, be represented in any elec
tion among the workers.
There are now more than 3000 fami
lies in the NFWA. Two growers,
Schenley of Delano and Christian
Brothers of Napa Valley, have recog
nized the union as a bargaining agent.
If none of the other growers agrees
to talk with the union by the harvest
season in September, the NFWA plans
to make it difficult or impossible for
the growers to harvest their grapes
by "talking the scabs right out of the
fields."
Words Are Weapons
According to Valdez, "our only
weapons are words." The "word" will
be spread this summer by roving
teams of farm workers and students.
They plan to go wherever there are
migrant workers in the southwestern
United States and northern Mexico.
Gene Boutilier, head of the NFWA
summer project, says"The power we
will have when we finally sit down
across the table from the growers will
depend on how well we have kept
workers out of the fields. We must
show that we represent the worker
and we must tell workers in other
parts of this state and the rest of the
agricultural Southwest what is hap
pening in Delano."
In the rally today one hundred forty
dollars was collected to support to the
families of the strikers and to help
defray legal costs. A meeting will be
held this evening at 9:30 p.m. in Tre
sidder, Rm. 274, to plan this Friday's
action on the Di Giorgio boycott.
