A victory in last weekend's
West Coast eliminations has
moved Stanford into the finals

Sailing Association's "Flying

Kim Desenberg won the A di
vision for Stanford, and Fred
Hess and George Twist's com
bined total placed them near the
top in the B division.
Stanford and the second-place
team, Long Beach State, will
take part in the finals at Kings
Point, N. Y., June 13-17.
