# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Inner City's Whore? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
President Sterling likened the
university to an Inner City. Vir
gin -like, universitas was to
guard her treasure of youth and
idealism, shutting the gates
against the stupid cruel world.
Safe behind ivied walls, the uni
versity could remain free to
teach the humanities which an
industrialized one - dimensional
society could not consume.
Now Dean Arbuckle, who now
wears Sterling's hat as chair
man of the Stanford Research
Institute, reveals in The Daily
of April 13 a hitherto unsus
pected mode of the Inner City's
operation. It opens its gates and
lays open its treasures, whore
like, for the enjoyment of indus
try, big business, the military,
Cold War demonologists, etc.
Hoover Institute, SRI, SLAC,
Studies of the Communist Sys
tem, are only some of the chan
nels created to facilitate such
entry.
I agree with Dean Arbuckle
that the military-industrial com
plex as defined by Eisenhower
in 1960 no longer exists. What
we may more realistically talk
of now is the military-industrial
multiversity complex, as exem
plified by Stanford University
getting 30 per cent of its annual
budget from the military, and
SRI being the fifth largest non
profit military conrtactor.
CIA participation in Stanford,
a la MSU and MIT, would be a
more normal relationship be
tween university and society
than the present virgin-whore
extremes.
KEITH LOWE
• Harris & The CIA
Editor, The Daily:
There was a fascinating irony
in the timing of two events that
took place at Stanford last
week.
Almost simultaneously we
learned that David Harris was
elected president of the student
body, and that a University de
partment is currently engaged
in "secret research" for the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Harris' campaign state
ments emphasized the idea that
a university's function is to pro
mote intellectual enrichment,
the spirit of free inquiry, and
the development of meaningful

freedom and dignity for the in
dividual.
Since the students voted to en
dorse his position, their work
seems to be cut out for them.
It is probably idealistic to re
gret that Stanford has seen fit
to cooperate in any way with an
organization that clearly oper
ates outside the bounds of mor
ality and law.
According to recent New York
Times reports the CIA has
helped to overthrow elected lea
ders of sovereign nations, has
given aid to dictators, and has
enlisted mercenary armies to
fight in Africa.
Presumably these activities
were designed to bring peace
and freedom to the world, the
goals of our current foreign pol
icy, so I will not cavil at them
here.
But a strong objection can be
made to Stanford's arrangement
with CIA on grounds that when
a university engages in secret
research — for anyone, for any
reason — it denies its basic pur
poses.
The winds of freedom can
hardly blow through a labora
tory where scientists must con
ceal information rather than
share it, and where only those
with security clearance can par
ticipate in the work.
A number of Stanford physi
cists have steadfastly refused to
work on projects that require
secrecy. Presumably they be
lieve that such research is in
compatible with the aims of free
scientific inquiry.
Secret research projects are
clearly also incompatible with
the goals of a university, espe
cially in view of the way those
goals are currently defined by a
majority of the students.

• Need For Cooperation
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Harris has been given the
chance to put his money where
his mouth is, and to replace
ethereal promises with concrete
and constructive action.
The question, however, is
whether or not he will be able
to deliver in the clutch. His suc
cess, or lack thereof, will rest
in large part on how willing he
is to pick up where the first rev

olution, initiated by Armin Ro
sencranz, ended.
It was Mr. Rosencranz who,
realizing the need for reforms,
established a foundation of crea
tive student-administration in
teraction which resulted in the
remodeling of outmoded rules
and regulations.
The Rosencranz revolution was
a cooperative one, emphasizing
mutual understanding as a
means of winning tangible re
sults. The extensive reforms
enacted argue for the soundness
of its principles; its philosophi
cal heritage provides a construct
for future action.
Hopefully, Mr. Harris wi 11
realize the significance of coop
eration within the university
community and make it the bas
is for a second revolution de
signed to work for the resolu
tion of Stanford's contemporary
educational and social needs.
Failing in this realization, Mr.
Harris might present to the stu
dents what so many of them
voted for, an interesting year;
innocuous, unproductive, but in
teresting.

• Technology Important
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wedin has written a quite
interesting article on education
at Stanford (The Daily, April
22). There is certainly a need
for education in a pure form,
like in the Zen Buddhist monas
teries. But in a world where
two-thirds of the people are near
starvation and the other third
near nuclear annihilation, tech
nology and "social power" are
important commodities, and I
hope that the real thinkers in
the universities will contribute
to the wise use of both.

Editor, The Dally:
Regarding Mr. Menifee's re
view of To Die in Madrid (The

pointed out that the "rebels" in

Franco and the Fascists. The

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Harris has been given the
chance to put his money where
his mouth is, and to replace
ethereal promises with concrete
and constructive action.
The question, however, is
whether or not he will be able
to deliver in the clutch. His suc
cess, or lack thereof, will rest
in large part on how willing he
is to pick up where the first rev

olution, initiated by Armin Ro
sencranz, ended.
It was Mr. Rosencranz who,
realizing the need for reforms,
established a foundation of crea
tive student-administration in
teraction which resulted in the
remodeling of outmoded rules
and regulations.
The Rosencranz revolution was
a cooperative one, emphasizing
mutual understanding as a
means of winning tangible re
sults. The extensive reforms
enacted argue for the soundness
of its principles; its philosophi
cal heritage provides a construct
for future action.
Hopefully, Mr. Harris wi 11
realize the significance of coop
eration within the university
community and make it the bas
is for a second revolution de
signed to work for the resolu

Mr. Wedin has written a quite
interesting article on education
at Stanford (The Daily, April
22). There is certainly a need
for education in a pure form,
like in the Zen Buddhist monas
teries. But in a world where
two-thirds of the people are near
starvation and the other third
near nuclear annihilation, tech
nology and "social power" are
important commodities, and I
hope that the real thinkers in

Editor, The Dally:
Regarding Mr. Menifee's re
view of To Die in Madrid (The

Franco and the Fascists. The

PAUL GOLDSTEIN
Editor, The Daily:
President Sterling likened the
university to an Inner City. Vir
gin -like, universitas was to
guard her treasure of youth and
idealism, shutting the gates
against the stupid cruel world.
Safe behind ivied walls, the uni
versity could remain free to
teach the humanities which an
industrialized one - dimensional
society could not consume.
Now Dean Arbuckle, who now
wears Sterling's hat as chair
man of the Stanford Research
Institute, reveals in The Daily
of April 13 a hitherto unsus
pected mode of the Inner City's
operation. It opens its gates and
lays open its treasures, whore
like, for the enjoyment of indus
try, big business, the military,
Cold War demonologists, etc.
Hoover Institute, SRI, SLAC,
Studies of the Communist Sys
tem, are only some of the chan
nels created to facilitate such
entry.
I agree with Dean Arbuckle
that the military-industrial com
plex as defined by Eisenhower
in 1960 no longer exists. What
we may more realistically talk
of now is the military-industrial
multiversity complex, as exem
plified by Stanford University
getting 30 per cent of its annual
budget from the military, and
SRI being the fifth largest non

CIA participation in Stanford,

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wedin has written a quite
interesting article on education
at Stanford (The Daily, April
22). There is certainly a need
for education in a pure form,
like in the Zen Buddhist monas
teries. But in a world where
two-thirds of the people are near
starvation and the other third
near nuclear annihilation, tech
nology and "social power" are
important commodities, and I
hope that the real thinkers in
the universities will contribute
to the wise use of both.

• To Live In Error
Editor, The Dally:
Regarding Mr. Menifee's re
view of To Die in Madrid (The
Daily, April 29), it should be
pointed out that the "rebels" in
the Spanish Civil War were
Franco and the Fascists. The
leftist Popular Front was the
legally elected government of
the Spanish Republic.
PAUL GOLDSTEIN
Editor, The Daily:
President Sterling likened the
university to an Inner City. Vir
gin -like, universitas was to
guard her treasure of youth and
idealism, shutting the gates
against the stupid cruel world.
Safe behind ivied walls, the uni
versity could remain free to
teach the humanities which an
industrialized one - dimensional
society could not consume.
Now Dean Arbuckle, who now
wears Sterling's hat as chair
man of the Stanford Research
Institute, reveals in The Daily
of April 13 a hitherto unsus
pected mode of the Inner City's
operation. It opens its gates and
lays open its treasures, whore
like, for the enjoyment of indus
try, big business, the military,
Cold War demonologists, etc.
Hoover Institute, SRI, SLAC,
Studies of the Communist Sys
tem, are only some of the chan
nels created to facilitate such
entry.
I agree with Dean Arbuckle
that the military-industrial com
plex as defined by Eisenhower
in 1960 no longer exists. What
we may more realistically talk
of now is the military-industrial
multiversity complex, as exem
plified by Stanford University
getting 30 per cent of its annual
budget from the military, and
SRI being the fifth largest non
profit military conrtactor.
CIA participation in Stanford,
a la MSU and MIT, would be a
more normal relationship be
tween university and society
than the present virgin-whore
extremes.

• Harris & The CIA
Editor, The Daily:
There was a fascinating irony
in the timing of two events that
took place at Stanford last
week.
Almost simultaneously we
learned that David Harris was
elected president of the student
body, and that a University de
partment is currently engaged
in "secret research" for the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Harris' campaign state
ments emphasized the idea that
a university's function is to pro
mote intellectual enrichment,
the spirit of free inquiry, and
the development of meaningful

freedom and dignity for the in
dividual.
Since the students voted to en
dorse his position, their work
seems to be cut out for them.
It is probably idealistic to re
gret that Stanford has seen fit
to cooperate in any way with an
organization that clearly oper
ates outside the bounds of mor
ality and law.
According to recent New York
Times reports the CIA has
helped to overthrow elected lea
ders of sovereign nations, has
given aid to dictators, and has
enlisted mercenary armies to
fight in Africa.
Presumably these activities
were designed to bring peace
and freedom to the world, the
goals of our current foreign pol
icy, so I will not cavil at them
here.
But a strong objection can be
made to Stanford's arrangement
with CIA on grounds that when
a university engages in secret
research — for anyone, for any
reason — it denies its basic pur
poses.
The winds of freedom can
hardly blow through a labora
tory where scientists must con
ceal information rather than
share it, and where only those
with security clearance can par
ticipate in the work.
A number of Stanford physi
cists have steadfastly refused to
work on projects that require
secrecy. Presumably they be
lieve that such research is in
compatible with the aims of free
scientific inquiry.
Secret research projects are
clearly also incompatible with
the goals of a university, espe
cially in view of the way those
goals are currently defined by a
majority of the students.

• Need For Cooperation
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Harris has been given the
chance to put his money where
his mouth is, and to replace
ethereal promises with concrete
and constructive action.
The question, however, is
whether or not he will be able
to deliver in the clutch. His suc
cess, or lack thereof, will rest
in large part on how willing he
is to pick up where the first rev

olution, initiated by Armin Ro
sencranz, ended.
It was Mr. Rosencranz who,
realizing the need for reforms,
established a foundation of crea
tive student-administration in
teraction which resulted in the
remodeling of outmoded rules
and regulations.
The Rosencranz revolution was
a cooperative one, emphasizing
