# Spy Cases Classics Dept. For Clues On The CIA
## 
### Bob Fisbman 
"I just got the word: the Clas
sics Department is a front for
the CIA."
My editor muttered these
words while inhaling deeply on
a Kool cigarette.
"I want you to check it out,"
he added.
"Don't worry, Chief," I re
plied. "I'll get the scoop."
He stared at me intently with
his olive-green eyes while his
lighted cigarette burned a small
hole in the story he was editing.
He nodded. I understood. This
was going to be a dangerous as
signment.
Inconspicuous
I had to look inconspicuous,
so I put on my trenchcoat, and,
for insurance, picked up a copy
of Seneca's Greatest Tragedies
in translation.
I headed straight for the Clas
sics Department where I hid be
hind a pillar by the entrance and
carefully observed everyone go
ing in ar-j out. No one did.
Since this tactic was proving
unproductive, I decided to take
the risk of entering the build
ing itself. My heart pounded
like a sheet of tin underneath a
drip after a hard rain. Stealth
ily, I approached my first objec
tive: the bulletin board.
The Clue
Sure enough, on a 3xlo typed
index card attached with paper
clips to a Miles Davis poster
was the clue I was looking for.
The card read: "Secret Meeting
for all CIA Agents at 8:30 p.m.
tonight at the La Honda YMCA
Camp (Cabin D). Please be sure
to attend."
They'll have an extra man at
that meeting, I thought surrep
titiously. I set out immediately,
since my only means of trans
portation was a bike. It was a
long pedal.
I feared nothing, since I was
prepared for everything. I car
ried three pads and five pencils
in case it was a long meeting. In
addition, I had two false ID's,
one giving my age as 28, the
other as 13. In case all else
failed I had my press card.
Ix>st and Late
I reached the camp late, since
I got lost. (When I had to stop
at a gas station three times to
ask directions and each time it
was the same gas station, I
knew something was wrong.)
The meeting was in full swing
when I stumbled through the
underbrush towards Cabin D.
After one glance through the
window, I knew this was no or-

dinary Classics Department con
clave. First, everyone was sober.
Second, everyone was dressed
neatly. Third, everyone was
dressed.
It looked suspicious.
I pressed my nose intently
against the windowpane to hear
what they were saying. After a
short while, the outline of the
dastardly plot became clear.
Infiltration
They were planning to infil
trate the Vietnam Peace Move
ment. Operatives disguised as
beatniks would worm their way
into influential positions and
then begin dressing like normal
people and making sensible pro
posals.
The Movement would lose all
its support in no time.
Before I had a chance to med
itate on the import of this dia
bolical plan, I hear a rustling in
the underbrush behind me. Two
huge TA's had spotted me. I
tried to hide behind a drainpipe
but it was too late.
I knew what they would do.
Under pain of death they would
make me memorize Latin de
clensions. If I got through that,
I would have to face the irregu
lar verbs. If still sane, they
would then set me on Virgil.
There was no escape.
Too Much
The thought of these tortures
was too much even for me. I
fainted dead away.
I must have been out for a
long time. All I remember was
hearing a scuffle, and then hav
ing cold Clam Chowder poured
on my face.
I awoke, and realized I was
saved. Some GCC operatives had
trailed me to the camp, thinking
I was on my way to an opium
den. They quickly realized the
nature of the situation and ra
dioed to Escondido Village for
reinforcements. In no time they
sent the classicists to flight.
We sped back to the campus.
I rushed into the newspaper of
fice, already savoring the con
gratulations I would receive.
Glassy Stare
My editor fixed me with a glas
sy stare as I entered. "You've
missed your dead 1 in e," he
barked. "One more slipup like
this and we'll ship you to Chap
pie."
I was crushed. The immensity
of my disgrace yawned before
me like a vast hole. I rushed
home, downed three Seven-Ups
and a glass of Cream Sherry,
and then fell into bed like a sod
den meteorite.

sics Department is a front for

people and making sensible pro
posals.
The Movement would lose all
its support in no time.
Before I had a chance to med
itate on the import of this dia
bolical plan, I hear a rustling in
the underbrush behind me. Two
huge TA's had spotted me. I
tried to hide behind a drainpipe
but it was too late.
I knew what they would do.
Under pain of death they would
make me memorize Latin de
clensions. If I got through that,
I would have to face the irregu
lar verbs. If still sane, they
would then set me on Virgil.
There was no escape.
Too Much
The thought of these tortures
was too much even for me. I
fainted dead away.
I must have been out for a
long time. All I remember was
hearing a scuffle, and then hav
ing cold Clam Chowder poured
on my face.
I awoke, and realized I was
saved. Some GCC operatives had
trailed me to the camp, thinking
I was on my way to an opium
den. They quickly realized the
nature of the situation and ra
dioed to Escondido Village for
reinforcements. In no time they
sent the classicists to flight.
We sped back to the campus.
I rushed into the newspaper of
fice, already savoring the con
gratulations I would receive.
Glassy Stare
My editor fixed me with a glas
sy stare as I entered. "You've
missed your dead 1 in e," he
barked. "One more slipup like
this and we'll ship you to Chap
pie."
I was crushed. The immensity
of my disgrace yawned before
me like a vast hole. I rushed
home, downed three Seven-Ups
and a glass of Cream Sherry,
and then fell into bed like a sod
den meteorite.
"I just got the word: the Clas
sics Department is a front for
the CIA."
My editor muttered these
words while inhaling deeply on
a Kool cigarette.
"I want you to check it out,"
he added.
"Don't worry, Chief," I re
plied. "I'll get the scoop."
He stared at me intently with
his olive-green eyes while his
lighted cigarette burned a small
hole in the story he was editing.
He nodded. I understood. This
was going to be a dangerous as
signment.
Inconspicuous
I had to look inconspicuous,
so I put on my trenchcoat, and,
for insurance, picked up a copy
of Seneca's Greatest Tragedies
in translation.
I headed straight for the Clas
sics Department where I hid be
hind a pillar by the entrance and
carefully observed everyone go
ing in ar-j out. No one did.
Since this tactic was proving
unproductive, I decided to take
the risk of entering the build
ing itself. My heart pounded
like a sheet of tin underneath a
drip after a hard rain. Stealth
ily, I approached my first objec
tive: the bulletin board.
The Clue
Sure enough, on a 3xlo typed
index card attached with paper
clips to a Miles Davis poster
was the clue I was looking for.
The card read: "Secret Meeting
for all CIA Agents at 8:30 p.m.
tonight at the La Honda YMCA
Camp (Cabin D). Please be sure
to attend."
They'll have an extra man at
that meeting, I thought surrep
titiously. I set out immediately,
since my only means of trans
portation was a bike. It was a
long pedal.
I feared nothing, since I was
prepared for everything. I car
ried three pads and five pencils
in case it was a long meeting. In
addition, I had two false ID's,
one giving my age as 28, the
other as 13. In case all else
failed I had my press card.
Ix>st and Late
I reached the camp late, since
I got lost. (When I had to stop
at a gas station three times to
ask directions and each time it
was the same gas station, I
knew something was wrong.)
The meeting was in full swing
when I stumbled through the
underbrush towards Cabin D.
After one glance through the
window, I knew this was no or-

dinary Classics Department con
clave. First, everyone was sober.
Second, everyone was dressed
neatly. Third, everyone was
dressed.
It looked suspicious.
I pressed my nose intently
against the windowpane to hear
what they were saying. After a
short while, the outline of the
dastardly plot became clear.
Infiltration
They were planning to infil
trate the Vietnam Peace Move
ment. Operatives disguised as
beatniks would worm their way
into influential positions and
then begin dressing like normal
people and making sensible pro
posals.
The Movement would lose all
its support in no time.

Sure enough, on a 3xlo typed
index card attached with paper
clips to a Miles Davis poster
was the clue I was looking for.
The card read: "Secret Meeting
for all CIA Agents at 8:30 p.m.
tonight at the La Honda YMCA
Camp (Cabin D). Please be sure
to attend."
They'll have an extra man at
that meeting, I thought surrep
titiously. I set out immediately,
since my only means of trans
portation was a bike. It was a
long pedal.
I feared nothing, since I was
prepared for everything. I car
ried three pads and five pencils
in case it was a long meeting. In
addition, I had two false ID's,
one giving my age as 28, the
other as 13. In case all else
failed I had my press card.
Ix>st and Late
I reached the camp late, since
I got lost. (When I had to stop
at a gas station three times to
ask directions and each time it
was the same gas station, I
knew something was wrong.)
The meeting was in full swing
when I stumbled through the
underbrush towards Cabin D.
After one glance through the
window, I knew this was no or-

dinary Classics Department con
clave. First, everyone was sober.
Second, everyone was dressed
neatly. Third, everyone was
dressed.
It looked suspicious.
I pressed my nose intently
against the windowpane to hear
what they were saying. After a
short while, the outline of the
dastardly plot became clear.
Infiltration
They were planning to infil
trate the Vietnam Peace Move
ment. Operatives disguised as
beatniks would worm their way
into influential positions and
then begin dressing like normal
people and making sensible pro
posals.
The Movement would lose all
its support in no time.
Before I had a chance to med
itate on the import of this dia
bolical plan, I hear a rustling in
the underbrush behind me. Two
huge TA's had spotted me. I
tried to hide behind a drainpipe
but it was too late.
I knew what they would do.
Under pain of death they would
make me memorize Latin de
clensions. If I got through that,
I would have to face the irregu
lar verbs. If still sane, they
would then set me on Virgil.
There was no escape.
Too Much
The thought of these tortures
was too much even for me. I
fainted dead away.
I must have been out for a
long time. All I remember was
hearing a scuffle, and then hav
ing cold Clam Chowder poured
on my face.
I awoke, and realized I was
saved. Some GCC operatives had
trailed me to the camp, thinking
I was on my way to an opium
den. They quickly realized the
nature of the situation and ra
dioed to Escondido Village for
reinforcements. In no time they
sent the classicists to flight.
We sped back to the campus.
I rushed into the newspaper of
fice, already savoring the con
gratulations I would receive.
Glassy Stare
My editor fixed me with a glas
sy stare as I entered. "You've
missed your dead 1 in e," he
barked. "One more slipup like
this and we'll ship you to Chap
pie."
I was crushed. The immensity
of my disgrace yawned before
me like a vast hole. I rushed
home, downed three Seven-Ups
and a glass of Cream Sherry,
and then fell into bed like a sod
den meteorite.
"I just got the word: the Clas
sics Department is a front for
the CIA."
My editor muttered these
words while inhaling deeply on
a Kool cigarette.
"I want you to check it out,"
he added.
"Don't worry, Chief," I re
plied. "I'll get the scoop."
He stared at me intently with
his olive-green eyes while his
lighted cigarette burned a small
hole in the story he was editing.
He nodded. I understood. This
was going to be a dangerous as
signment.
Inconspicuous
I had to look inconspicuous,
so I put on my trenchcoat, and,
for insurance, picked up a copy
of Seneca's Greatest Tragedies
in translation.
I headed straight for the Clas
sics Department where I hid be
hind a pillar by the entrance and
carefully observed everyone go
ing in ar-j out. No one did.
Since this tactic was proving
unproductive, I decided to take
the risk of entering the build
ing itself. My heart pounded
like a sheet of tin underneath a
drip after a hard rain. Stealth
ily, I approached my first objec
tive: the bulletin board.
