A fire which started in a waste-pa
per basket last night left a wood
panel wall in the History Department
Office badly charred.
"If it had not been discovered in
another five minutes, we would have
had a major building fire on our
hands," commented Assistant F i r e-
Chief Frank Jurian, who investigated
the incident.
He said the conditions in the build
ing were "ideal" for a serious fire.
The cause of the fire is under investi
gation.
Willy Scott, custodian of the build
ing, had already doused the blaze with
a fire extinguisher before the arrival
of four trucks from the Stanford Fire
Department.
He was alerted by Jerry King, a
graduate student in sociology, who
also turned in the alarm to the fire
department.
King was studying in his office on
the third floor of the building at
about 8:50, when he smelled smoke.
He then sniffed his way to the history
office on the second floor.
"I looked in the window and there
were flames like mad," he said. "The
door was locked so I went for help."
