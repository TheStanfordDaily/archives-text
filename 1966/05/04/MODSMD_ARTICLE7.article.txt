# Temporary Sectarian Worship Approved
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
The University approved yesterday
interim implementation of sectarian
worship on campus.
The action reversed the position
held by the University since February
that services could not begin until
next fall.
That policy followed a declaration
of the Board of Trustees that such
services be allowed on campus. Imple
mentation, it was explained at that
time would await the arrival of the
new Dean of the Chapel, B. Davie
Napier.
Yesterday's statement explained "no
comprehensive scheduling of denomi
national services is possible until Dr.
Napier comes. In the meantime, how
ever, any denominational groups
wanting to hold worship services
(with or without the participation of

clergy) may make arrangements with
Chaplain Robert Minto to use Memo
rial Church." In addition interim ar
rangements for Jewish groups to use
the Women's Clubhouse have been
made.
"Everyone in the community must
understand," the statement contin
ued, "any arrangements made this
spring are not precedents applicable
to the religious program for next year
which will be worked out with Dr.
Napier's participation."
Effective Right Away
The new policy will go into effect
"right away," Chaplain Minto told
The Daily last night. The chaplain and
the denominational ministers are hav
ing their regular weekly meeting to
day and "will try to work out some
thing at the meeting," the chaplain
said.
Impetus for changing the policy

came from a group of Jewish students
who have been holding daily services
in the basement of the Women's Club
house for some weeks. On April 19.
they approached associate dean of stu
dents Joel Smith and appraised him
of their activities.
He asked if they could worship ei
ther off-campus or in one of the
rooms of Memorial Church. They re
plied negatively to both, explaining
1) they were performing the tradi
tional Jewish afternoon service as
"part of our daily existence and not
something we should have to go off
campus to do"; and 2) Memorial
Church was objectionable because of
its Christian symbolism. "Some mem
bers of the group feel it distasteful to
worship in a Christian building," a
member of the group explained.
"Further, it seemed another example
of a community trying to impose its
will on Jewish people. There is a his
tory of attempts at such coercion."
Official Authorization
Official authorization for the stu
dents to make arrangements to use
the clubhouse was given through
Dean Smith on April 22. The students
procoded to make the proper arrange
ments and now hold kadish services
daily at 5:30 in the basement of the
Clubhouse.
Left undecided by yesterday's policy
change was the long-term status of
the Jews. The Trustees' declaration
of February allowed or services "in
Memorial Church," but Jewish repre
sentatives have repeatedly refused
to worship in "a Christian building."
"Additional conversations on facil
ities for non-Christian groups will
have to be held," Dean Smith said
yesterday.
The denominational ministers sev
eral weeks ago decided they would not
take advantage of the privilege to
worship on campus unless provision
were made "to allow non-Christian
groups to worship on campus in good
conscience." Since Jewish services are
being allowed in the interim period, a
minister representative explained last
night, the Christian groups will begin
services.
Ministers Could Discontinue
If, however, the final plans do not
include Jewish worship outside of
Memorial Church, the ministers will
discontinue worship on campus.
The Trustee declaration of Febru
ary ended a religious policy dating
back to the founding of the Univer
sity which prohibited the holding of
sectarian worship services on cam
pus. The policy was based on a pro
vision of the Founding Grant which
declared "the University must forever
be maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis."
Dr. Napier is coming to Stanford
next fall to take charge of Stanford's
religious programs and activities cur
rently administered by the chaplain.
The chaplain will be away next year
on sabbatical.

Napier.
Yesterday's statement explained "no
comprehensive scheduling of denomi
national services is possible until Dr.
Napier comes. In the meantime, how
ever, any denominational groups
wanting to hold worship services
(with or without the participation of

clergy) may make arrangements with
Chaplain Robert Minto to use Memo
rial Church." In addition interim ar
rangements for Jewish groups to use
the Women's Clubhouse have been
made.
"Everyone in the community must
understand," the statement contin
ued, "any arrangements made this
spring are not precedents applicable
to the religious program for next year
which will be worked out with Dr.
Napier's participation."
Effective Right Away
The new policy will go into effect
"right away," Chaplain Minto told
The Daily last night. The chaplain and
the denominational ministers are hav
ing their regular weekly meeting to
day and "will try to work out some
thing at the meeting," the chaplain
said.
Impetus for changing the policy

came from a group of Jewish students
who have been holding daily services
in the basement of the Women's Club
house for some weeks. On April 19.
they approached associate dean of stu
dents Joel Smith and appraised him
of their activities.
He asked if they could worship ei
ther off-campus or in one of the
rooms of Memorial Church. They re
plied negatively to both, explaining
1) they were performing the tradi
tional Jewish afternoon service as
"part of our daily existence and not
something we should have to go off
campus to do"; and 2) Memorial
Church was objectionable because of
its Christian symbolism. "Some mem
bers of the group feel it distasteful to
worship in a Christian building," a
member of the group explained.
"Further, it seemed another example
of a community trying to impose its
will on Jewish people. There is a his
tory of attempts at such coercion."
Official Authorization
Official authorization for the stu
dents to make arrangements to use
the clubhouse was given through
Dean Smith on April 22. The students
procoded to make the proper arrange
ments and now hold kadish services
daily at 5:30 in the basement of the
Clubhouse.
Left undecided by yesterday's policy
change was the long-term status of
the Jews. The Trustees' declaration
of February allowed or services "in
Memorial Church," but Jewish repre
sentatives have repeatedly refused
to worship in "a Christian building."
"Additional conversations on facil
ities for non-Christian groups will
have to be held," Dean Smith said
yesterday.
The denominational ministers sev
eral weeks ago decided they would not
take advantage of the privilege to
worship on campus unless provision
were made "to allow non-Christian
groups to worship on campus in good
conscience." Since Jewish services are
being allowed in the interim period, a
minister representative explained last
night, the Christian groups will begin
services.
Ministers Could Discontinue
If, however, the final plans do not
include Jewish worship outside of
Memorial Church, the ministers will
discontinue worship on campus.
The Trustee declaration of Febru
ary ended a religious policy dating
back to the founding of the Univer
sity which prohibited the holding of
sectarian worship services on cam
pus. The policy was based on a pro
vision of the Founding Grant which
declared "the University must forever
be maintained upon a strictly non
