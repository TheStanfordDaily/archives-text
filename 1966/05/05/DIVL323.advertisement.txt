Sebastodes, or Rock fish, is one of many colorful species of the ocean deeps where
our underwater TV cameras and lights probe the night-black water at 600 feet.
These cameras are not for study of marine life, however. They're down (here to
help technicians aboard our anchored oil-drilling ships guide complicated, remote
controlled drilling equipment. TV receivers on deck enable engineers to observe
these drilling operations at depths hazardous for human divers to penetrate.
600 feet 100 fathoms. It's almost twice as deep as any ocean oil drilling ever
attempted, until some very special techniques developed by Standard Oil scientists
and engineers made it possible.
Our continuing search for new sources of oil takes us to mountains, deserts, .itid
ever and ever deeper waters. For we must be certain that adequate supplies of oil
are on hand to serve the Free World's growing energy needs, now and in the future HSB
