LETTER POLICY
The Daily is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
They must be typewritten on
65-space lines and double spaced.
Letters should not exceed 300
words in length. Shorter letters
have a better chance of being
printed.
As a general rule, unsigned
letters will not be printed, but
names will be withheld under
certain circumstances upon re
quest.
The Daily reserves the right
to edit all letters for grammar
and spelling, and also to fit
available space.
