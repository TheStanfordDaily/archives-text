All Stanford men who have tickets
of admission for the Selective Service
Test May 14 and May 21 are urged
to pick up their cspecific room assign
ments at the Counceling and Testing
Center, Second Floor, Encina Hall
West.
"Because of the large number of
men and many testing rooms in
volved, we would like to avoid the
confusion and chaos that will ensue
if thousands of students all descend
on the two reporting stations at 8:30
a.m. May 14 and May 21," said Dr.
John D. Black, director of the Coun
seling and Testing Center.
"By being pre-assigned to specific
rooms, students can go directly to
their assigned rooms for fingerprint
ing and the testing can begin prompt
ly," Black said.
Students should bring their tickets
of admission with them to the Coun
seling Center when seeking room as
signments; no assignments ran be
made without it.

On the morning of tho test, stu
dents should bring their tickets of ad
mission, test center address cards, and
their room assignment cards to the
testing room. They must also bring
an official document showing their
Selective Service number and the
exact designation, number, and ad

diction over them
