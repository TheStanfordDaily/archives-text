# Experts View Student Power
## 
### 
In an article in a national
education magazine, two Stan
ford experts in higher educa
tion, Joseph Katz and Nevitt
Sanford, contend that students
have become a "fourth estate
which is taking its place beside
the traditional estates of fac
ulty, administration, and trus
tees."
Members of the Institute for
the Study of Human problems,
Katz and Sanford describe the
student position in the fourth
estate as "irreversible." But the
exact boundaries of the new
power situation are yet to be
determined. This depends on the
students own press for power,

their activists' support among
students-at-large, and counter
vailing forces within each col
lege and university, they stated.
Students Conscious Of Power
"Students have become con
scious of their own power," they
comment. "They know that re
forms are possible and feel that
the colleges have been letting
them down. Above all, tehy have
experienced success in making
their presence felt and in ex
tracting concessions."
