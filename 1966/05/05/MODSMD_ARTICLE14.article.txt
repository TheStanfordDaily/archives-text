# Senior Officers Announce Plan
## 
### 
Tryouts for next year's Senior
Class government will be held
next week, president- arid vice
president-elect Jim Binns and
Nancy Coffey announced today.
Posts available include that of
business manager, chairmen of
the Heritage Fund drive, and po
sitions on the class executive
committee.
The program planned for next
year will center around an ac
tive social program, both within
the class and with faculty and
alumni. The Happy Hours, Mo
vie Nights, Shiffazz's, and Think
and Drink's will all be contin
ued, with some "creative inno
vations made possible by the
new liquor policy.''
The class will plan and direct
the Senior Ball and graduation
activities.
Reform of Colloquia
In addition to these traditional
programs, the officers plan to
sponsor forums on graduate
schools and careers and to pub
lish a Senior Handbook guide to
grad schools, fellowships and
grants, military and volunteer
service programs, and job op
portunities.
Another class goal is a reform
of Senior Colloquia, with an end
to improving the courses and
putting them on a voluntary
basis. A Senior Advisor program
will provide freshmen with in
formal academic advice.
The officers emphasize the
fact that this list represents
only a base from which to move.
People of All Interests
Binns stressed the need for
people of all interests on the
executive committee: "To carry
out our program, we need capa
ble people in virtually all inter
est areas: publicity, art work,
journalism, spirit, organization,
academic reform—you name it.
The work of the ex-comm is go
ing to be satisfying and fun.
and I hope every interested
junior will consider devoting
some of his time next year to
the class."
Applications and sign • up
sheets for interviews can be
