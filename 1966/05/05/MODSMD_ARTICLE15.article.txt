# Late Singer-Writer Depresses, Dazzles

### BRUCE REITZ 
Richard Farina. Been Down
So Long 1 It Iv<H»ks Like Up to
Me. Random House: 1966, 324
pp., $5.95.
Richard Farina's first novel
is claimed to "come on like the
Hallelujah Chorus done by 200
kazoo players with perfect
pitch." There is a lot of truth
in this statement, but 200 kazoo
players, no matter what their
pitch, can be a bit tedious, even
downright jarring to some ears.
Fighting Disease
Been Down So Long follows
the adventures of Gnossos Pap
padopoulis, who, much in the
tradition of Saul Bellow's Hen
derson, is earnestly seeking the
real in a world of veneer. With
his slightly shrunk, fading Boy
Scout shirt, sandles, and pare
goric filled rucksack, he is look
ing for "exemption, fto] walk
among the diseased with Im
munity, a little knowledge-in
the-abstract, a vision every sev
enth day or so."
The diseased, as Gnossos sees
them, are the conventional and
restrictive, the False, and the po-

tentially evil. In order to es
cape, he travels, and his wan
derings lead him to Alaska, the
gambling halls of Las Vegas,
the hills of Cuba, and finally
the "microcosm" of Mentor
University.
The book gives us the first
person flow of consciousness im
pressions of Gnossos in his
quest. Each page's new experi
ence is completely unpredicta
ble, a dizzying onrush of hilari
ous, absurd, frightening, sensu
ous, and stimulating images.
The table of contents has chap
ter headings such as "Jimmy
Brown the Newsboy?" "Two
Curious Strangers," "The Bull
whip," "The Artificial Eye," "A
Most Peculiar Proposition,"
"L'Hopital's Rule and the homi
cidal return of Watson-May,"
"Apotheosis in the Rucksack."
Each of these chapters describes
an experience, or probably more

exactly, a "happening." Some
times disjointed but always un
conventional, these episodes and
the characters involved are ex
tremely entertaining.
Wild Dinner
An example of one of Gnos
sos' hilarious experiences is a
rush dinner at a Mentor Uni
versity Fraternity (they're serv
ing steak and Gnossos is hun
gry). Fitzgore, Gnossos' buddy
who belongs to the house, has
agreed to let him come if he
will "play the game". Then,
"He downed the food on his
plate, refilled it, ate again, re
filled and ate. Long silences,
clattering dish noises. Always
eat well. Nutrients squirming
in the marrow of Anglo-Saxon
food stuffs. I'm in a room filled
with robots. Be careful.
"He reached into his pocket
and took out the second lamp
dried cigarette, lighting it be
fore Fitzgore could take notice,
burning half away with a single
inspirational puff, holding the
smoke down, adding little sips
of sharply sucked at air. Ex
hale. Beautiful, no smoke. An
other puff, almost gone, weeeee.
Fitzgore sniffing.
" 'What's that you're smok
ing, Paps?'
"No time to talk, saturate
lungs. All that spongy fiber
swilling Listen to your nerves
hum. Yes.
"Oh yes. 'Wooooooo'
"Fitzgore jumping up, 'Okay,
Paps, let's go, that's enough—.'
" 'Shazam!' He was up on the
table, making a noise like a
thunderclap, then with a bound
into the middle of the dining
room.' "
Sad Conclusion
Gnossos and his friends are
aware of the benefits of pot,
paregoric, heroin, and alcohol.
Their very far out language will
definitely prove jarring to some.
Sadly, Gnossos never finds the
Immunity he was seeking; in
the end he is drafted.
Richard Farina has been a
folk-rock singer as well as au
thor; married to Mimi Baez,
they have recently released an
interesting album, Reflections in
a Crystal Wind (Vanguard Rec
ords). With great regret one
notes Mr. Farina's death in a
motorcycle accident on Sunday
May 1, in the Carmel Highlands.
This is an especially untimely
death, following, by only three
days, the publication of this
promising first novel.

pitch, can be a bit tedious, even
downright jarring to some ears.
Fighting Disease
Been Down So Long follows
the adventures of Gnossos Pap
padopoulis, who, much in the
tradition of Saul Bellow's Hen
derson, is earnestly seeking the
real in a world of veneer. With
his slightly shrunk, fading Boy
Scout shirt, sandles, and pare
goric filled rucksack, he is look
ing for "exemption, fto] walk
among the diseased with Im
munity, a little knowledge-in
the-abstract, a vision every sev
enth day or so."
The diseased, as Gnossos sees
them, are the conventional and
restrictive, the False, and the po-

tentially evil. In order to es
cape, he travels, and his wan
derings lead him to Alaska, the
gambling halls of Las Vegas,
the hills of Cuba, and finally
the "microcosm" of Mentor
University.
The book gives us the first
person flow of consciousness im
pressions of Gnossos in his
quest. Each page's new experi
ence is completely unpredicta
ble, a dizzying onrush of hilari
ous, absurd, frightening, sensu
ous, and stimulating images.
The table of contents has chap
ter headings such as "Jimmy
Brown the Newsboy?" "Two
Curious Strangers," "The Bull
whip," "The Artificial Eye," "A
Most Peculiar Proposition,"
"L'Hopital's Rule and the homi
cidal return of Watson-May,"
"Apotheosis in the Rucksack."
Each of these chapters describes
an experience, or probably more

exactly, a "happening." Some
times disjointed but always un
conventional, these episodes and
the characters involved are ex
tremely entertaining.
Wild Dinner
An example of one of Gnos
sos' hilarious experiences is a
rush dinner at a Mentor Uni
versity Fraternity (they're serv
ing steak and Gnossos is hun
gry). Fitzgore, Gnossos' buddy
who belongs to the house, has
agreed to let him come if he
will "play the game". Then,
"He downed the food on his
plate, refilled it, ate again, re
filled and ate. Long silences,
clattering dish noises. Always
eat well. Nutrients squirming
in the marrow of Anglo-Saxon
food stuffs. I'm in a room filled
with robots. Be careful.
"He reached into his pocket
and took out the second lamp
dried cigarette, lighting it be
fore Fitzgore could take notice,
burning half away with a single
inspirational puff, holding the
smoke down, adding little sips
of sharply sucked at air. Ex
hale. Beautiful, no smoke. An
other puff, almost gone, weeeee.
Fitzgore sniffing.
" 'What's that you're smok
ing, Paps?'
"No time to talk, saturate
lungs. All that spongy fiber
swilling Listen to your nerves
hum. Yes.
"Oh yes. 'Wooooooo'
"Fitzgore jumping up, 'Okay,
Paps, let's go, that's enough—.'
" 'Shazam!' He was up on the
table, making a noise like a
thunderclap, then with a bound
into the middle of the dining
room.' "
Sad Conclusion
Gnossos and his friends are
aware of the benefits of pot,
paregoric, heroin, and alcohol.
Their very far out language will
definitely prove jarring to some.
Sadly, Gnossos never finds the
Immunity he was seeking; in
the end he is drafted.
Richard Farina has been a
folk-rock singer as well as au
thor; married to Mimi Baez,
they have recently released an
interesting album, Reflections in
a Crystal Wind (Vanguard Rec
ords). With great regret one
notes Mr. Farina's death in a
motorcycle accident on Sunday
May 1, in the Carmel Highlands.
This is an especially untimely
death, following, by only three
days, the publication of this
promising first novel.

among the diseased with Im
munity, a little knowledge-in
the-abstract, a vision every sev
enth day or so."
The diseased, as Gnossos sees
them, are the conventional and
restrictive, the False, and the po-

tentially evil. In order to es
cape, he travels, and his wan
derings lead him to Alaska, the
gambling halls of Las Vegas,
the hills of Cuba, and finally
the "microcosm" of Mentor
University.
The book gives us the first
person flow of consciousness im
pressions of Gnossos in his
quest. Each page's new experi
ence is completely unpredicta
ble, a dizzying onrush of hilari
ous, absurd, frightening, sensu
ous, and stimulating images.
The table of contents has chap
ter headings such as "Jimmy
Brown the Newsboy?" "Two
Curious Strangers," "The Bull
whip," "The Artificial Eye," "A
Most Peculiar Proposition,"
"L'Hopital's Rule and the homi
cidal return of Watson-May,"
"Apotheosis in the Rucksack."
Each of these chapters describes
an experience, or probably more

exactly, a "happening." Some
times disjointed but always un
conventional, these episodes and
the characters involved are ex
tremely entertaining.
Wild Dinner
An example of one of Gnos
sos' hilarious experiences is a
rush dinner at a Mentor Uni
versity Fraternity (they're serv
ing steak and Gnossos is hun
gry). Fitzgore, Gnossos' buddy
who belongs to the house, has
agreed to let him come if he
will "play the game". Then,
"He downed the food on his
plate, refilled it, ate again, re
filled and ate. Long silences,
clattering dish noises. Always
eat well. Nutrients squirming
in the marrow of Anglo-Saxon
food stuffs. I'm in a room filled
with robots. Be careful.
"He reached into his pocket
and took out the second lamp
dried cigarette, lighting it be
fore Fitzgore could take notice,
burning half away with a single
inspirational puff, holding the
smoke down, adding little sips
of sharply sucked at air. Ex
hale. Beautiful, no smoke. An
other puff, almost gone, weeeee.
Fitzgore sniffing.
" 'What's that you're smok
ing, Paps?'
"No time to talk, saturate
lungs. All that spongy fiber
swilling Listen to your nerves
hum. Yes.
"Oh yes. 'Wooooooo'
"Fitzgore jumping up, 'Okay,
Paps, let's go, that's enough—.'
" 'Shazam!' He was up on the
table, making a noise like a
thunderclap, then with a bound
into the middle of the dining
room.' "
Sad Conclusion
Gnossos and his friends are
aware of the benefits of pot,
paregoric, heroin, and alcohol.
Their very far out language will
definitely prove jarring to some.
Sadly, Gnossos never finds the
Immunity he was seeking; in
the end he is drafted.
Richard Farina has been a
folk-rock singer as well as au
thor; married to Mimi Baez,
they have recently released an
interesting album, Reflections in
a Crystal Wind (Vanguard Rec
ords). With great regret one
notes Mr. Farina's death in a
motorcycle accident on Sunday
May 1, in the Carmel Highlands.
This is an especially untimely
death, following, by only three
days, the publication of this
promising first novel.
