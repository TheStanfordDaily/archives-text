As U. S. policy in the Far East
receives closer public scrutiny,
we are beginning to wake up to
our lack of knowledge about
that part of the world. That this
ignorance has plagued the for
eign policy of other nations is
demonstrated in Robert North's
new study.
This detailed but well-paced
account traces Russian involve
ment in China and the history of
the ambiguous, often contradic
tory directives to Soviet and
Comintern agents, directives
which prove that officials, too,
have misunderstood the situa
tion in the Far East.
North views the Chinese Com
munist Party as a creature of
the Communist Party of the So
viet Union: it was conceived as
a tool of the Soviet world revo
lution.
Bolshevist Techniques
The book's story is that of the
metamorphosis of the CCP from
a dependent offshoot of the
CPSU to an independent power,

with an ideology and power base
peculiar to its individual, Chi
nese position. This resulted not
from the reappearance of Con
fucian philosophy in Chinese
clothes, but from the adaptation
of Bolshevist revolutionary tech
niques to a Chinese situation.
The correct adoption proce
dure was not immediately per
ceived by Soviet agents, who
bound by doctrine, could not be
flexible enough to take advan
tage of or even understand the
chaotic situation in China. (So
that we will not be too hasty in
condemning Russia, however, it
must be noted that Chiang Kai
shek and the Kuomintang were
also too bent on personal power
to react to the necessities of the
situation.)
Insistent Independence
Russian policies for the CCP
ranged from the mass insurrec
tions of the Li Li-san period to
the United Fronts, but none
were succcssful in gaining
power for the party. It was not
until Mao asserted his leader
ship, declaring independence
from Soviet directives, that the
CCP came into its own, taking
over the government, not just as

a member of a coalition, but as
the sole ruling party.
Mao's rise to power is retold
against a background of the
conflict between the doctrines of
revolution from above and from
below. North introduces this mo
tif by describing the positions
of Lenin and H. M. Roy, an In
dian revolutionary, at the Sec
ond Congress of the Communist
International.
Dichotomy Motif
North weaves the dichotomy
between the two approaches
through hit; book as an ever
present and increasingly obvi
ous irritant in Sino-Soviet rela
tions. A central cause of
friction was the Soviet tendency
to disregard the CCP's wishes to
govern as an independent entity
and its consequent overt support
of the KMT.
North's book, although it does
not deal with post-1948 Sino-
Soviet relations in great detail,
is a fascinating account of So
viet attempts to run the Chinese
revolution, and, being a history
of theories as well as events, it
provides an excellent base for
interpretations of the present
Sino-Soviet rift.

As U. S. policy in the Far East
receives closer public scrutiny,
we are beginning to wake up to
our lack of knowledge about
that part of the world. That this
ignorance has plagued the for
eign policy of other nations is
demonstrated in Robert North's
new study.
This detailed but well-paced
account traces Russian involve
ment in China and the history of
the ambiguous, often contradic
tory directives to Soviet and
Comintern agents, directives
which prove that officials, too,
have misunderstood the situa
tion in the Far East.
North views the Chinese Com
munist Party as a creature of
the Communist Party of the So
viet Union: it was conceived as
a tool of the Soviet world revo
lution.
Bolshevist Techniques
The book's story is that of the
metamorphosis of the CCP from
a dependent offshoot of the
CPSU to an independent power,

with an ideology and power base
peculiar to its individual, Chi
nese position. This resulted not
from the reappearance of Con
fucian philosophy in Chinese
clothes, but from the adaptation
of Bolshevist revolutionary tech
niques to a Chinese situation.
The correct adoption proce
dure was not immediately per
ceived by Soviet agents, who
bound by doctrine, could not be
flexible enough to take advan
tage of or even understand the
chaotic situation in China. (So
that we will not be too hasty in
condemning Russia, however, it
must be noted that Chiang Kai
shek and the Kuomintang were
also too bent on personal power
to react to the necessities of the
situation.)
Insistent Independence
Russian policies for the CCP
ranged from the mass insurrec
tions of the Li Li-san period to
the United Fronts, but none
were succcssful in gaining
power for the party. It was not
until Mao asserted his leader
ship, declaring independence
from Soviet directives, that the
CCP came into its own, taking
over the government, not just as

a member of a coalition, but as
the sole ruling party.
Mao's rise to power is retold
against a background of the
conflict between the doctrines of
revolution from above and from
below. North introduces this mo
tif by describing the positions
of Lenin and H. M. Roy, an In
dian revolutionary, at the Sec
ond Congress of the Communist
International.
Dichotomy Motif
North weaves the dichotomy
between the two approaches
through hit; book as an ever
present and increasingly obvi
ous irritant in Sino-Soviet rela
tions. A central cause of
friction was the Soviet tendency
to disregard the CCP's wishes to
govern as an independent entity
and its consequent overt support
of the KMT.
North's book, although it does
not deal with post-1948 Sino-
Soviet relations in great detail,
is a fascinating account of So
viet attempts to run the Chinese
revolution, and, being a history
of theories as well as events, it
provides an excellent base for
interpretations of the present
Sino-Soviet rift.
