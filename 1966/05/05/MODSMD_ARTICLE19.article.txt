# Novel Exposes Hell In Shopping Center

By ROBERT lIASS
Thomas Bontly. The Competitor
Seribner's: 157 pp.,
This extraordinary first novel
by a Stanford graduate student
and creative writing fellow is
about the harrowing and unre
deemed vulgarity and despera
tion of American life.
Mr. Bontly's subject is a day
in the life of Martie Hansen, a
thirty four year old shoe sales
man who works for The Friend
ly Shoe Corporation in a quick
buck, hard-sell, Midwestern su
burban outlet.
The day on which the action
is set the Saturday in Septem
ber just before the schools open
is, like Thanksgiving, one of
those rituals which define a na
tional life.
On this day, in a novel sev
erely realistic, Mr. Bontly deliv
ers up to his reader a vision of
hell: Coke ads, shrewd shoppers,
shrewder salesmen, the sweet
sickening smell of Woolworth
lunch counters, piped-in love
and played-out nerves, money
tension, sex tension, and the ten
sion that comes from trying to
be human in the midst of it.
Mr. Bontly has got down in
lean graceful prose the terror
behind the fatigue and he knows
how corrosive it can be to any
of us: those dutiful customers,
sad hearts in the supermarket.
Treadmill Vision
Not the least of the reasons
why you should buy and read
this book is that it tells us what
production for profit is like out
there in the world and what it
does to men.
Martie Hansen, exhausted by
9 a.m., a fallen man. expelled

from the Eden of the cigarette
ads, had the vision once of great
wheels turning, money coming
in, new shiny leather shoes go
ing out, everyone happy, and
America growing strong but it
was replaced gradually by the
more common one—outside of
business schools —of the tread
mill.
The novel describes Martie's
day on the treadmill and the

ways in which a decent man, try
ing to cope, betrays himself.
Martie is being used by his
boss, a sort of cross between
Dale Carnegie and Knute
Iloekne; he is distrusted by the
company because as a young
man he was unknowingly in
volved in a dishonest deal (i.e.,
cheating the company); his
sales position is being threat
ened by another salesman whom
Martie dislikes because he is
relaxed, Mexican, and jazzing
the blonde at the cash register;
in the middle of these tensions
and tiie central tension of selling
shoes in hot weather on the big
gest day of the year, his mind
drifts backward to the promise
of adolescence and to the logical
series of steps which drew him
into the trap.
In the final hour of his day,
he completes his dehumaniza
tion by violating his last scru
pie and sells badly fitted shoes
to a child whose feet could be
misshapened by them.
Finely Written
Mr. Bontly handles these ma
terials quietly and intelligently.
The first sixty pages of the
novel which describe mainly the
feel and frenetic temj>o of the
store are especially well-done.
The prose is careful, but it has
none of the intrusive manner
isms which damage books like
Updike's Itabbit ltun, or Kcsey's
One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest.
His eye is on his subject and
he refuses to relieve the reader
with tasteful prettiness or
Rabelesian posturing.
The novel has its faults.
Conversations are introduced
to generalise the meaning of
Marty's situation and they are
not necessary. Some of the sec
ondary characters fail to come
alive.
And there is one rich-girls
have-whiter-breasts flashback in
the Fitzgerald tradition (I wish
people would stop writing that
way; it is the literary equivalent
of the girls in Martie's cigarette
ads), but none of these things
do any serious damage to the
force and authority of Mr. Bont
ly's novel.
He is working the old vein of
Dreiser and Lewis, telling, with
honesty and compassion, the un
pleasant truth about the way we
live, making, in an unpromising
world, his art out of the unful
filled promises of people.
This is, for anyone who cares
about social intelligence in
American fiction, a very hopeful
performance.

sickening smell of Woolworth
lunch counters, piped-in love
and played-out nerves, money
tension, sex tension, and the ten
sion that comes from trying to
be human in the midst of it.
Mr. Bontly has got down in
lean graceful prose the terror
behind the fatigue and he knows
how corrosive it can be to any
of us: those dutiful customers,
sad hearts in the supermarket.
Treadmill Vision
Not the least of the reasons
why you should buy and read
this book is that it tells us what
production for profit is like out
there in the world and what it
does to men.
Martie Hansen, exhausted by
9 a.m., a fallen man. expelled

from the Eden of the cigarette
ads, had the vision once of great
wheels turning, money coming
in, new shiny leather shoes go
ing out, everyone happy, and
America growing strong but it
was replaced gradually by the
more common one—outside of
business schools —of the tread
mill.
The novel describes Martie's
day on the treadmill and the

ways in which a decent man, try
ing to cope, betrays himself.
Martie is being used by his
boss, a sort of cross between
Dale Carnegie and Knute
Iloekne; he is distrusted by the
company because as a young
man he was unknowingly in
volved in a dishonest deal (i.e.,
cheating the company); his
sales position is being threat
ened by another salesman whom
Martie dislikes because he is
relaxed, Mexican, and jazzing
the blonde at the cash register;
in the middle of these tensions
and tiie central tension of selling
shoes in hot weather on the big
gest day of the year, his mind
drifts backward to the promise
of adolescence and to the logical
series of steps which drew him
into the trap.
In the final hour of his day,
he completes his dehumaniza
tion by violating his last scru
pie and sells badly fitted shoes
to a child whose feet could be
misshapened by them.
Finely Written
Mr. Bontly handles these ma
terials quietly and intelligently.
The first sixty pages of the
novel which describe mainly the
feel and frenetic temj>o of the
store are especially well-done.
The prose is careful, but it has
none of the intrusive manner
isms which damage books like
Updike's Itabbit ltun, or Kcsey's
One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest.
His eye is on his subject and
he refuses to relieve the reader
with tasteful prettiness or
Rabelesian posturing.
The novel has its faults.
Conversations are introduced
to generalise the meaning of
Marty's situation and they are
not necessary. Some of the sec
ondary characters fail to come
alive.
And there is one rich-girls
have-whiter-breasts flashback in
the Fitzgerald tradition (I wish
people would stop writing that
way; it is the literary equivalent
of the girls in Martie's cigarette
ads), but none of these things
do any serious damage to the
force and authority of Mr. Bont
ly's novel.
He is working the old vein of
Dreiser and Lewis, telling, with
honesty and compassion, the un
pleasant truth about the way we
live, making, in an unpromising
world, his art out of the unful
filled promises of people.
This is, for anyone who cares
about social intelligence in
American fiction, a very hopeful
performance.

By ROBERT lIASS
Thomas Bontly. The Competitor
Seribner's: 157 pp.,
This extraordinary first novel
by a Stanford graduate student
and creative writing fellow is
about the harrowing and unre
deemed vulgarity and despera
tion of American life.
Mr. Bontly's subject is a day
in the life of Martie Hansen, a
thirty four year old shoe sales
man who works for The Friend
ly Shoe Corporation in a quick
buck, hard-sell, Midwestern su
burban outlet.
The day on which the action
is set the Saturday in Septem

is, like Thanksgiving, one of
those rituals which define a na
tional life.

more common one—outside of
business schools —of the tread
mill.
The novel describes Martie's
day on the treadmill and the

ways in which a decent man, try
ing to cope, betrays himself.
Martie is being used by his
boss, a sort of cross between
Dale Carnegie and Knute
Iloekne; he is distrusted by the
company because as a young
man he was unknowingly in
volved in a dishonest deal (i.e.,
cheating the company); his
sales position is being threat
ened by another salesman whom
Martie dislikes because he is
relaxed, Mexican, and jazzing
the blonde at the cash register;
in the middle of these tensions
and tiie central tension of selling
shoes in hot weather on the big
gest day of the year, his mind
drifts backward to the promise
of adolescence and to the logical
series of steps which drew him
into the trap.
In the final hour of his day,
he completes his dehumaniza
tion by violating his last scru
pie and sells badly fitted shoes
to a child whose feet could be
misshapened by them.
Finely Written
Mr. Bontly handles these ma
terials quietly and intelligently.
The first sixty pages of the
novel which describe mainly the
feel and frenetic temj>o of the
store are especially well-done.
The prose is careful, but it has
none of the intrusive manner
isms which damage books like
Updike's Itabbit ltun, or Kcsey's
One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest.
His eye is on his subject and
he refuses to relieve the reader
with tasteful prettiness or
Rabelesian posturing.
The novel has its faults.
Conversations are introduced
to generalise the meaning of
Marty's situation and they are
not necessary. Some of the sec
ondary characters fail to come
alive.
And there is one rich-girls
have-whiter-breasts flashback in
the Fitzgerald tradition (I wish
people would stop writing that
way; it is the literary equivalent
of the girls in Martie's cigarette
ads), but none of these things
do any serious damage to the
force and authority of Mr. Bont
ly's novel.
He is working the old vein of
Dreiser and Lewis, telling, with
honesty and compassion, the un
pleasant truth about the way we
live, making, in an unpromising
world, his art out of the unful
filled promises of people.
This is, for anyone who cares
about social intelligence in
American fiction, a very hopeful
performance.
