# Heffner States Policy On CIA Contracts
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following is the
text of a statement released to The
Daily yesterday by Hubert Heffner,
Associate Provost for Research. He
first answers some questions involv
ing researfh contracts at Stanford, in
cluding those sponsored by the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency, and then
gives his persorud views on the sub
ject.)
At the time of the May 2 demon
stration in front of my office I agreed
to make known through the medium
of The Daily certain factual informa
tion regarding Stanford's involve
ment in classified research and Stan
ford's policy and practices of accept
ing CIA-sponsored research or, in
fact, any research involving security
classification.
I welcome this opportunity, for I
believe these issues should be a matter
of public knowledge and public dis
cussion.
I would be less than honest, how
ever, if I did not say at the outset
that I consider the establishment and
modification of these policies the
prerogative of the faculty and officers
of the University and not the stu
dents.
Several specific questions have been
asked of me, both orally and in writ
ing. The following represent the an
swers to those questions:
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy in re
gard to future .acceptance of CIA
contracts?
A. Stanford will accept research
programs sponsored by the CIA if:
• They meet academic criteria ap
plied to all research proposals, that
is, the research carried out contrib
utes to the functions of the Univer
sity.
• The fact that the program is
sponsored by the CIA is made known
to the University prior to its initia
tion, and
• The program involves no activity
outside the United States. Stanford
will not knowingly allow any of its
programs to be used as a cover by
the CIA or any other organization for
clandestine operations.
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy on
freedom of publication?
A. In 1964, the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (COUP) adopted the
following statement:
It is the policy of Stanford Uni
versity to guarantee to its faculty
their historic freedom of scholarly

publication. To this end, the Uni
versity does not normally accept
agreements for research support
which contain provisions restrict
ing 1 the scholar's right to dissemi
nate the results of Ills research in
the manner, place, and time of his
choosing.
An exception to this policy shall
be where the research to be con
ducted involves the possible genera
tion of classified material and
where the purpose of publication
review Is solely to determine wheth
er the research results must be
given security classification under
existing ageney regulations.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has Stanford ever refused a
government contract?
A. Yes. A recent case occurred for
exactly this freedom of publication
policy. We refused to accept a con
tract from the Agency for Interna
tional Development when we learned
at the last minute that they demanded
the right to review and refuse per
mission to publish on grounds which
were vaguely defined. There were
other objectionable features of the
contract, but the final basis on which
no agreement could be reached was
the issue of freedom of publication.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does the SLAC contract have
special provisions for security checks
of personnel, loyalty investigations, or
possible suppression by the govern
ment of results of research?
A. No. Professor Panofsky and oth
er members of the University worked
hard and successfully to eliminate
any restrictive provisions from that
contract.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has the University ever refused,
or does it have any policy to refuse
contracts which require research
which is morally repugnant?
A. Morally repugnant to whom?
The "morality" of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsibility
of the man himself.
A rather effective check is provided
by the assessment of his professional
peers within and outside of his own
university.
Ultimately, however, we should and
do rely on the conscience of the in
dividual to determine how he will
employ his scholarly talents.
There are means within the Univer
sity whereby advice can be sought re
garding the propriety of research and
at least one where it is required by
federal regulation. I refer to a Uni
versity committee whose approval is
required before medical experimenta

tion on human subjects is under
taken.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does my office solicit or en
courage research contracts ("secret"
or open) from business or the federal
government?
A. If I understand tho tenor of this
question, the answer is—no
Every research project is initiated
by an individual faculty member who
wants to do a particular piece of re
search.
He writes a proposal to a federal
agency or to a foundation, or in highly
exceptional circumstances, to a busi
ness organization outlining what he
wants to do and how much it will
cost.
This proposal is reviewed by the
Department Head, School Dean, and
Provost's office on academic bases and
by the Controller's office for a budget
check and compatibility with federal
regulations.
Only after these favorable reviews,

is it forwarded by the University for
outside consideration.
My office, in addition to the propo
sal review responsibility which I men
tioned, will also give advice to faculty
members wishing research support
and when possible assist them in ob
taining it.
★ * ★
Q. How many classified contracts
does Stanford have?
A. Stanford has 13 such contracts
under the direction of eight different
faculty or research staff members.
Eleven of these contracts are in
the Stanford Electronics Laboratories,
one in Geophysics, and one (an Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
contract) is in the Hoover Institution.
The total dollar amount of these con
tracts is $3,383,500.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the majority of research on the eleven
engineering contracts is actually of an
unclassified nature and is indeed pub
lished.

Thus, this dollar amount is a mis
leading indicator of the amount of
research which is actually classified.
★ ★ ★
Q. How many students liave re
ceived degrees as a result of thesis
research which was classified?
A. Since 1948 (as far back as Uni
versity records go on this subject),
there have been thirty nidividuals who
have submitted classified theses.
Of these, five have been for Mas
ter's degrees, one for a Doctor of Edu
cation degree, ten have been for En
gineer's degrees, and the remainder
for Ph.D.'s.
Of th total, twenty-three have been
in Engineering, three in Education,
two in Physical Sciences, and one
each in Business and International
Relations. Fourteen of the thirty
theses are no longer classified.
★ ★ ★
I have also been asked to state my
own personal views on the propriety
of classified research in a university
and on whether a university should
accept research sponsored by the CIA.
Let me take these two issues up in
order, speaking first to the question
of classified research.
I feel strongly that a university
should impose as few rules and pro
cedures as possible on its faculty (and
students, too).
To this end, the individual faculty
member should make the decision
as to what research he wishes to pur
sue.
On the other hand, the University
is, or should be, a community of schol
ars and the historic guarantee of free
dom of publication should not be
lightly abrogated.
What then are the factors which
would convince a professor voluntar
ily to restrict his freedom to publish
the results of his research?
I believe there is one, and it is this.
When all the flag-waving is over,
when all the drum-beating of chauvin
ism has died down, many feel an hon
orable duty to strengthen the defense
of our country.
I myself do not wish to undertake
classified research in time of peace
or in time of an undeclared war in
which we are currently involved. Yet,
I would never attempt to impose my
desires and predictions on my col
leagues.
Special ized Research
There is another feature of classi
fied research which is perhaps not
widely recognized and thus deserves
emphasis. It is that within this cate
gory lie some of the most intellect

ually challenging problems of our
time.
Consider the engineering problem
of devising an effective missile de
fense of the United States.
Consider the economics of assessing
the Chinese capability of supporting
a nuclear weapons program.
Consider the sociological and politi
cal problems of setting a disarma
ment oplicy which will be both accept
able and meaningful.
Work in each of these areas will,
if not classified itself, at least involve
access to classified material if it is
to be at all valuable. Thus, the con
tract which supports this work must
be classified.
I*ropriety
Now let me turn to the question
of the propriety in accepting research
sponsored by the CIA. Again, I em
phasize, I am giving my personal
view as I was asked to do.
I believe that Stanford's policy as
outlined above insures that the nature
of the research is appropriate to a
university. Thus, the problem, to my
mind, is less a moral one than it is
a tactical one.
Do we want to be associated even
indirectly with an agency which has
as a part of its activities espionage
and subversion of foreign govern
ments? You will recognize that it
was exactly on this point of institu
tional embarrassment that MIT re
portedly decided to terminate its CIA
contract.
I must report honestly that my own
inclination would be to follow suit,
but I would remark that this is in
a sense the coward's way out, for if
the research topic is a bona fide one,
should we not defend our right to
pursue it no matter how unsavoury
the reputation of the sponsor?
I believe a better solution would be
to have these topics of research sup
ported through other government
agencies at the urging of the CIA
rather than by the CIA itself.
These are conclusions, however, on
which reasonable men can disagree.
That being the case, I would fall back
on the principle of leaving the decis
ion of the acceptability of CIA re
search support up to the individual
faculty member involved.
Ready To Meet
I stand ready to meet with any
group of the University community
further to elucidate Stanford's poli
cies and practices regarding research.
This is a subject which, if recent
student publications serve as a guide,
generates opinions based more on
misinformation than on facts.

gives his persorud views on the sub
ject.)
At the time of the May 2 demon
stration in front of my office I agreed
to make known through the medium
of The Daily certain factual informa
tion regarding Stanford's involve
ment in classified research and Stan
ford's policy and practices of accept
ing CIA-sponsored research or, in
fact, any research involving security
classification.
I welcome this opportunity, for I
believe these issues should be a matter
of public knowledge and public dis
cussion.
I would be less than honest, how
ever, if I did not say at the outset
that I consider the establishment and
modification of these policies the
prerogative of the faculty and officers
of the University and not the stu
dents.
Several specific questions have been
asked of me, both orally and in writ
ing. The following represent the an
swers to those questions:
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy in re
gard to future .acceptance of CIA
contracts?
A. Stanford will accept research
programs sponsored by the CIA if:
• They meet academic criteria ap
plied to all research proposals, that
is, the research carried out contrib
utes to the functions of the Univer
sity.
• The fact that the program is
sponsored by the CIA is made known
to the University prior to its initia
tion, and
• The program involves no activity
outside the United States. Stanford
will not knowingly allow any of its
programs to be used as a cover by
the CIA or any other organization for
clandestine operations.
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy on
freedom of publication?
A. In 1964, the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (COUP) adopted the
following statement:
It is the policy of Stanford Uni
versity to guarantee to its faculty
their historic freedom of scholarly

publication. To this end, the Uni
versity does not normally accept
agreements for research support
which contain provisions restrict
ing 1 the scholar's right to dissemi
nate the results of Ills research in
the manner, place, and time of his
choosing.
An exception to this policy shall
be where the research to be con
ducted involves the possible genera
tion of classified material and
where the purpose of publication
review Is solely to determine wheth
er the research results must be
given security classification under
existing ageney regulations.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has Stanford ever refused a
government contract?
A. Yes. A recent case occurred for
exactly this freedom of publication
policy. We refused to accept a con
tract from the Agency for Interna
tional Development when we learned
at the last minute that they demanded
the right to review and refuse per
mission to publish on grounds which
were vaguely defined. There were
other objectionable features of the
contract, but the final basis on which
no agreement could be reached was
the issue of freedom of publication.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does the SLAC contract have
special provisions for security checks
of personnel, loyalty investigations, or
possible suppression by the govern
ment of results of research?
A. No. Professor Panofsky and oth
er members of the University worked
hard and successfully to eliminate
any restrictive provisions from that
contract.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has the University ever refused,
or does it have any policy to refuse
contracts which require research
which is morally repugnant?
A. Morally repugnant to whom?
The "morality" of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsibility
of the man himself.
A rather effective check is provided
by the assessment of his professional
peers within and outside of his own
university.
Ultimately, however, we should and
do rely on the conscience of the in
dividual to determine how he will
employ his scholarly talents.
There are means within the Univer
sity whereby advice can be sought re
garding the propriety of research and
at least one where it is required by
federal regulation. I refer to a Uni
versity committee whose approval is
required before medical experimenta

tion on human subjects is under
taken.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does my office solicit or en
courage research contracts ("secret"
or open) from business or the federal
government?
A. If I understand tho tenor of this
question, the answer is—no
Every research project is initiated
by an individual faculty member who
wants to do a particular piece of re
search.
He writes a proposal to a federal
agency or to a foundation, or in highly
exceptional circumstances, to a busi
ness organization outlining what he
wants to do and how much it will
cost.
This proposal is reviewed by the
Department Head, School Dean, and
Provost's office on academic bases and
by the Controller's office for a budget
check and compatibility with federal
regulations.
Only after these favorable reviews,

is it forwarded by the University for
outside consideration.
My office, in addition to the propo
sal review responsibility which I men
tioned, will also give advice to faculty
members wishing research support
and when possible assist them in ob
taining it.
★ * ★
Q. How many classified contracts
does Stanford have?
A. Stanford has 13 such contracts
under the direction of eight different
faculty or research staff members.
Eleven of these contracts are in
the Stanford Electronics Laboratories,
one in Geophysics, and one (an Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
contract) is in the Hoover Institution.
The total dollar amount of these con
tracts is $3,383,500.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the majority of research on the eleven
engineering contracts is actually of an
unclassified nature and is indeed pub
lished.

Thus, this dollar amount is a mis
leading indicator of the amount of
research which is actually classified.
★ ★ ★
Q. How many students liave re
ceived degrees as a result of thesis
research which was classified?
A. Since 1948 (as far back as Uni
versity records go on this subject),
there have been thirty nidividuals who
have submitted classified theses.
Of these, five have been for Mas
ter's degrees, one for a Doctor of Edu
cation degree, ten have been for En
gineer's degrees, and the remainder
for Ph.D.'s.
Of th total, twenty-three have been
in Engineering, three in Education,
two in Physical Sciences, and one
each in Business and International
Relations. Fourteen of the thirty
theses are no longer classified.
★ ★ ★
I have also been asked to state my
own personal views on the propriety
of classified research in a university
and on whether a university should
accept research sponsored by the CIA.
Let me take these two issues up in
order, speaking first to the question
of classified research.
I feel strongly that a university
should impose as few rules and pro
cedures as possible on its faculty (and
students, too).
To this end, the individual faculty
member should make the decision
as to what research he wishes to pur
sue.
On the other hand, the University
is, or should be, a community of schol
ars and the historic guarantee of free
dom of publication should not be
lightly abrogated.
What then are the factors which
would convince a professor voluntar
ily to restrict his freedom to publish
the results of his research?
I believe there is one, and it is this.
When all the flag-waving is over,
when all the drum-beating of chauvin
ism has died down, many feel an hon
orable duty to strengthen the defense
of our country.
I myself do not wish to undertake
classified research in time of peace
or in time of an undeclared war in
which we are currently involved. Yet,
I would never attempt to impose my
desires and predictions on my col
leagues.
Special ized Research
There is another feature of classi
fied research which is perhaps not
widely recognized and thus deserves
emphasis. It is that within this cate
gory lie some of the most intellect

ually challenging problems of our
time.
Consider the engineering problem
of devising an effective missile de
fense of the United States.
Consider the economics of assessing
the Chinese capability of supporting
a nuclear weapons program.
Consider the sociological and politi
cal problems of setting a disarma
ment oplicy which will be both accept
able and meaningful.
Work in each of these areas will,
if not classified itself, at least involve
access to classified material if it is
to be at all valuable. Thus, the con
tract which supports this work must
be classified.
I*ropriety
Now let me turn to the question
of the propriety in accepting research
sponsored by the CIA. Again, I em
phasize, I am giving my personal
view as I was asked to do.
I believe that Stanford's policy as
outlined above insures that the nature
of the research is appropriate to a
university. Thus, the problem, to my
mind, is less a moral one than it is
a tactical one.
Do we want to be associated even
indirectly with an agency which has
as a part of its activities espionage
and subversion of foreign govern
ments? You will recognize that it
was exactly on this point of institu
tional embarrassment that MIT re
portedly decided to terminate its CIA
contract.
I must report honestly that my own
inclination would be to follow suit,
but I would remark that this is in
a sense the coward's way out, for if
the research topic is a bona fide one,
should we not defend our right to
pursue it no matter how unsavoury
the reputation of the sponsor?
I believe a better solution would be
to have these topics of research sup
ported through other government
agencies at the urging of the CIA
rather than by the CIA itself.
These are conclusions, however, on
which reasonable men can disagree.
That being the case, I would fall back
on the principle of leaving the decis
ion of the acceptability of CIA re
search support up to the individual
faculty member involved.
Ready To Meet
I stand ready to meet with any
group of the University community
further to elucidate Stanford's poli
cies and practices regarding research.
This is a subject which, if recent
student publications serve as a guide,
generates opinions based more on
misinformation than on facts.

ford's policy and practices of accept
ing CIA-sponsored research or, in
fact, any research involving security
classification.
I welcome this opportunity, for I
believe these issues should be a matter
of public knowledge and public dis
cussion.
I would be less than honest, how
ever, if I did not say at the outset
that I consider the establishment and
modification of these policies the
prerogative of the faculty and officers
of the University and not the stu
dents.
Several specific questions have been
asked of me, both orally and in writ
ing. The following represent the an
swers to those questions:
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy in re
gard to future .acceptance of CIA
contracts?
A. Stanford will accept research
programs sponsored by the CIA if:
• They meet academic criteria ap
plied to all research proposals, that
is, the research carried out contrib
utes to the functions of the Univer
sity.
• The fact that the program is
sponsored by the CIA is made known
to the University prior to its initia
tion, and
• The program involves no activity
outside the United States. Stanford
will not knowingly allow any of its
programs to be used as a cover by
the CIA or any other organization for
clandestine operations.
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy on
freedom of publication?
A. In 1964, the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (COUP) adopted the
following statement:
It is the policy of Stanford Uni
versity to guarantee to its faculty
their historic freedom of scholarly

publication. To this end, the Uni
versity does not normally accept
agreements for research support
which contain provisions restrict
ing 1 the scholar's right to dissemi
nate the results of Ills research in
the manner, place, and time of his
choosing.
An exception to this policy shall
be where the research to be con
ducted involves the possible genera
tion of classified material and
where the purpose of publication
review Is solely to determine wheth
er the research results must be
given security classification under
existing ageney regulations.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has Stanford ever refused a
government contract?
A. Yes. A recent case occurred for
exactly this freedom of publication
policy. We refused to accept a con
tract from the Agency for Interna
tional Development when we learned
at the last minute that they demanded
the right to review and refuse per
mission to publish on grounds which
were vaguely defined. There were
other objectionable features of the
contract, but the final basis on which
no agreement could be reached was
the issue of freedom of publication.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does the SLAC contract have
special provisions for security checks
of personnel, loyalty investigations, or
possible suppression by the govern
ment of results of research?
A. No. Professor Panofsky and oth
er members of the University worked
hard and successfully to eliminate
any restrictive provisions from that
contract.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has the University ever refused,
or does it have any policy to refuse
contracts which require research
which is morally repugnant?
A. Morally repugnant to whom?
The "morality" of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsibility
of the man himself.
A rather effective check is provided
by the assessment of his professional
peers within and outside of his own
university.
Ultimately, however, we should and
do rely on the conscience of the in
dividual to determine how he will
employ his scholarly talents.
There are means within the Univer
sity whereby advice can be sought re
garding the propriety of research and
at least one where it is required by
federal regulation. I refer to a Uni
versity committee whose approval is
required before medical experimenta

tion on human subjects is under
taken.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does my office solicit or en
courage research contracts ("secret"
or open) from business or the federal
government?
A. If I understand tho tenor of this
question, the answer is—no
Every research project is initiated
by an individual faculty member who
wants to do a particular piece of re
search.
He writes a proposal to a federal
agency or to a foundation, or in highly
exceptional circumstances, to a busi
ness organization outlining what he
wants to do and how much it will
cost.
This proposal is reviewed by the
Department Head, School Dean, and
Provost's office on academic bases and
by the Controller's office for a budget
check and compatibility with federal
regulations.
Only after these favorable reviews,

is it forwarded by the University for
outside consideration.
My office, in addition to the propo
sal review responsibility which I men
tioned, will also give advice to faculty
members wishing research support
and when possible assist them in ob
taining it.
★ * ★
Q. How many classified contracts
does Stanford have?
A. Stanford has 13 such contracts
under the direction of eight different
faculty or research staff members.
Eleven of these contracts are in
the Stanford Electronics Laboratories,
one in Geophysics, and one (an Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
contract) is in the Hoover Institution.
The total dollar amount of these con
tracts is $3,383,500.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the majority of research on the eleven
engineering contracts is actually of an
unclassified nature and is indeed pub
lished.

Thus, this dollar amount is a mis
leading indicator of the amount of
research which is actually classified.
★ ★ ★
Q. How many students liave re
ceived degrees as a result of thesis
research which was classified?
A. Since 1948 (as far back as Uni
versity records go on this subject),
there have been thirty nidividuals who
have submitted classified theses.
Of these, five have been for Mas
ter's degrees, one for a Doctor of Edu
cation degree, ten have been for En
gineer's degrees, and the remainder
for Ph.D.'s.
Of th total, twenty-three have been
in Engineering, three in Education,
two in Physical Sciences, and one
each in Business and International
Relations. Fourteen of the thirty
theses are no longer classified.
★ ★ ★
I have also been asked to state my
own personal views on the propriety
of classified research in a university
and on whether a university should
accept research sponsored by the CIA.
Let me take these two issues up in
order, speaking first to the question
of classified research.
I feel strongly that a university
should impose as few rules and pro
cedures as possible on its faculty (and
students, too).
To this end, the individual faculty
member should make the decision
as to what research he wishes to pur
sue.
On the other hand, the University
is, or should be, a community of schol
ars and the historic guarantee of free
dom of publication should not be
lightly abrogated.
What then are the factors which
would convince a professor voluntar
ily to restrict his freedom to publish
the results of his research?
I believe there is one, and it is this.
When all the flag-waving is over,
when all the drum-beating of chauvin
ism has died down, many feel an hon
orable duty to strengthen the defense
of our country.
I myself do not wish to undertake
classified research in time of peace
or in time of an undeclared war in
which we are currently involved. Yet,
I would never attempt to impose my
desires and predictions on my col
leagues.
Special ized Research
There is another feature of classi
fied research which is perhaps not
widely recognized and thus deserves
emphasis. It is that within this cate
gory lie some of the most intellect

ually challenging problems of our
time.
Consider the engineering problem
of devising an effective missile de
fense of the United States.
Consider the economics of assessing
the Chinese capability of supporting
a nuclear weapons program.
Consider the sociological and politi
cal problems of setting a disarma
ment oplicy which will be both accept
able and meaningful.
Work in each of these areas will,
if not classified itself, at least involve
access to classified material if it is
to be at all valuable. Thus, the con
tract which supports this work must
be classified.
I*ropriety
Now let me turn to the question
of the propriety in accepting research
sponsored by the CIA. Again, I em
phasize, I am giving my personal
view as I was asked to do.
I believe that Stanford's policy as
outlined above insures that the nature
of the research is appropriate to a
university. Thus, the problem, to my
mind, is less a moral one than it is
a tactical one.
Do we want to be associated even
indirectly with an agency which has
as a part of its activities espionage
and subversion of foreign govern
ments? You will recognize that it
was exactly on this point of institu
tional embarrassment that MIT re
portedly decided to terminate its CIA
contract.
I must report honestly that my own
inclination would be to follow suit,
but I would remark that this is in
a sense the coward's way out, for if
the research topic is a bona fide one,
should we not defend our right to
pursue it no matter how unsavoury
the reputation of the sponsor?
I believe a better solution would be
to have these topics of research sup
ported through other government
agencies at the urging of the CIA
rather than by the CIA itself.
These are conclusions, however, on
which reasonable men can disagree.
That being the case, I would fall back
on the principle of leaving the decis
ion of the acceptability of CIA re
search support up to the individual
faculty member involved.
Ready To Meet
I stand ready to meet with any
group of the University community
further to elucidate Stanford's poli
cies and practices regarding research.
This is a subject which, if recent
student publications serve as a guide,
generates opinions based more on
misinformation than on facts.

ever, if I did not say at the outset
that I consider the establishment and
modification of these policies the
prerogative of the faculty and officers
of the University and not the stu
dents.
Several specific questions have been
asked of me, both orally and in writ
ing. The following represent the an
swers to those questions:
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy in re
gard to future .acceptance of CIA
contracts?
A. Stanford will accept research
programs sponsored by the CIA if:
• They meet academic criteria ap
plied to all research proposals, that
is, the research carried out contrib
utes to the functions of the Univer
sity.
• The fact that the program is
sponsored by the CIA is made known
to the University prior to its initia
tion, and
• The program involves no activity
outside the United States. Stanford
will not knowingly allow any of its
programs to be used as a cover by
the CIA or any other organization for
clandestine operations.
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy on
freedom of publication?
A. In 1964, the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (COUP) adopted the
following statement:
It is the policy of Stanford Uni
versity to guarantee to its faculty
their historic freedom of scholarly

publication. To this end, the Uni
versity does not normally accept
agreements for research support
which contain provisions restrict
ing 1 the scholar's right to dissemi
nate the results of Ills research in
the manner, place, and time of his
choosing.
An exception to this policy shall
be where the research to be con
ducted involves the possible genera
tion of classified material and
where the purpose of publication
review Is solely to determine wheth
er the research results must be
given security classification under
existing ageney regulations.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has Stanford ever refused a
government contract?
A. Yes. A recent case occurred for
exactly this freedom of publication
policy. We refused to accept a con
tract from the Agency for Interna
tional Development when we learned
at the last minute that they demanded
the right to review and refuse per
mission to publish on grounds which
were vaguely defined. There were
other objectionable features of the
contract, but the final basis on which
no agreement could be reached was
the issue of freedom of publication.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does the SLAC contract have
special provisions for security checks
of personnel, loyalty investigations, or
possible suppression by the govern
ment of results of research?
A. No. Professor Panofsky and oth
er members of the University worked
hard and successfully to eliminate
any restrictive provisions from that
contract.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has the University ever refused,
or does it have any policy to refuse
contracts which require research
which is morally repugnant?
A. Morally repugnant to whom?
The "morality" of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsibility
of the man himself.
A rather effective check is provided
by the assessment of his professional
peers within and outside of his own
university.
Ultimately, however, we should and
do rely on the conscience of the in
dividual to determine how he will
employ his scholarly talents.
There are means within the Univer
sity whereby advice can be sought re
garding the propriety of research and
at least one where it is required by
federal regulation. I refer to a Uni
versity committee whose approval is
required before medical experimenta

tion on human subjects is under
taken.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does my office solicit or en
courage research contracts ("secret"
or open) from business or the federal
government?
A. If I understand tho tenor of this
question, the answer is—no
Every research project is initiated
by an individual faculty member who
wants to do a particular piece of re
search.
He writes a proposal to a federal
agency or to a foundation, or in highly
exceptional circumstances, to a busi
ness organization outlining what he
wants to do and how much it will
cost.
This proposal is reviewed by the
Department Head, School Dean, and
Provost's office on academic bases and
by the Controller's office for a budget
check and compatibility with federal
regulations.
Only after these favorable reviews,

is it forwarded by the University for
outside consideration.
My office, in addition to the propo
sal review responsibility which I men
tioned, will also give advice to faculty
members wishing research support
and when possible assist them in ob
taining it.
★ * ★
Q. How many classified contracts
does Stanford have?
A. Stanford has 13 such contracts
under the direction of eight different
faculty or research staff members.
Eleven of these contracts are in
the Stanford Electronics Laboratories,
one in Geophysics, and one (an Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
contract) is in the Hoover Institution.
The total dollar amount of these con
tracts is $3,383,500.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the majority of research on the eleven
engineering contracts is actually of an
unclassified nature and is indeed pub
lished.

Thus, this dollar amount is a mis
leading indicator of the amount of
research which is actually classified.
★ ★ ★
Q. How many students liave re
ceived degrees as a result of thesis
research which was classified?
A. Since 1948 (as far back as Uni
versity records go on this subject),
there have been thirty nidividuals who
have submitted classified theses.
Of these, five have been for Mas
ter's degrees, one for a Doctor of Edu
cation degree, ten have been for En
gineer's degrees, and the remainder
for Ph.D.'s.
Of th total, twenty-three have been
in Engineering, three in Education,
two in Physical Sciences, and one
each in Business and International
Relations. Fourteen of the thirty
theses are no longer classified.
★ ★ ★
I have also been asked to state my
own personal views on the propriety
of classified research in a university
and on whether a university should
accept research sponsored by the CIA.
Let me take these two issues up in
order, speaking first to the question
of classified research.
I feel strongly that a university
should impose as few rules and pro
cedures as possible on its faculty (and
students, too).
To this end, the individual faculty
member should make the decision
as to what research he wishes to pur
sue.
On the other hand, the University
is, or should be, a community of schol
ars and the historic guarantee of free
dom of publication should not be
lightly abrogated.
What then are the factors which
would convince a professor voluntar
ily to restrict his freedom to publish
the results of his research?
I believe there is one, and it is this.
When all the flag-waving is over,
when all the drum-beating of chauvin
ism has died down, many feel an hon
orable duty to strengthen the defense
of our country.
I myself do not wish to undertake
classified research in time of peace
or in time of an undeclared war in
which we are currently involved. Yet,
I would never attempt to impose my
desires and predictions on my col
leagues.
Special ized Research
There is another feature of classi
fied research which is perhaps not
widely recognized and thus deserves
emphasis. It is that within this cate
gory lie some of the most intellect

ually challenging problems of our
time.
Consider the engineering problem
of devising an effective missile de
fense of the United States.
Consider the economics of assessing
the Chinese capability of supporting
a nuclear weapons program.
Consider the sociological and politi
cal problems of setting a disarma
ment oplicy which will be both accept
able and meaningful.
Work in each of these areas will,
if not classified itself, at least involve
access to classified material if it is
to be at all valuable. Thus, the con
tract which supports this work must
be classified.
I*ropriety
Now let me turn to the question
of the propriety in accepting research
sponsored by the CIA. Again, I em
phasize, I am giving my personal
view as I was asked to do.
I believe that Stanford's policy as
outlined above insures that the nature
of the research is appropriate to a
university. Thus, the problem, to my
mind, is less a moral one than it is
a tactical one.
Do we want to be associated even
indirectly with an agency which has
as a part of its activities espionage
and subversion of foreign govern
ments? You will recognize that it
was exactly on this point of institu
tional embarrassment that MIT re
portedly decided to terminate its CIA
contract.
I must report honestly that my own
inclination would be to follow suit,
but I would remark that this is in
a sense the coward's way out, for if
the research topic is a bona fide one,
should we not defend our right to
pursue it no matter how unsavoury
the reputation of the sponsor?
I believe a better solution would be
to have these topics of research sup
ported through other government
agencies at the urging of the CIA
rather than by the CIA itself.
These are conclusions, however, on
which reasonable men can disagree.
That being the case, I would fall back
on the principle of leaving the decis
ion of the acceptability of CIA re
search support up to the individual
faculty member involved.
Ready To Meet
I stand ready to meet with any
group of the University community
further to elucidate Stanford's poli
cies and practices regarding research.
This is a subject which, if recent
student publications serve as a guide,
generates opinions based more on
misinformation than on facts.

swers to those questions:
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy in re
gard to future .acceptance of CIA
contracts?
A. Stanford will accept research
programs sponsored by the CIA if:
• They meet academic criteria ap
plied to all research proposals, that
is, the research carried out contrib
utes to the functions of the Univer
sity.
• The fact that the program is
sponsored by the CIA is made known
to the University prior to its initia
tion, and
• The program involves no activity
outside the United States. Stanford
will not knowingly allow any of its
programs to be used as a cover by
the CIA or any other organization for
clandestine operations.
★ ★ ★
Q. What is Stanford's policy on
freedom of publication?
A. In 1964, the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (COUP) adopted the
following statement:
It is the policy of Stanford Uni
versity to guarantee to its faculty
their historic freedom of scholarly

publication. To this end, the Uni
versity does not normally accept
agreements for research support
which contain provisions restrict
ing 1 the scholar's right to dissemi
nate the results of Ills research in
the manner, place, and time of his
choosing.
An exception to this policy shall
be where the research to be con
ducted involves the possible genera
tion of classified material and
where the purpose of publication
review Is solely to determine wheth
er the research results must be
given security classification under
existing ageney regulations.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has Stanford ever refused a
government contract?
A. Yes. A recent case occurred for
exactly this freedom of publication
policy. We refused to accept a con
tract from the Agency for Interna
tional Development when we learned
at the last minute that they demanded
the right to review and refuse per
mission to publish on grounds which
were vaguely defined. There were
other objectionable features of the
contract, but the final basis on which
no agreement could be reached was
the issue of freedom of publication.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does the SLAC contract have
special provisions for security checks
of personnel, loyalty investigations, or
possible suppression by the govern
ment of results of research?
A. No. Professor Panofsky and oth
er members of the University worked
hard and successfully to eliminate
any restrictive provisions from that
contract.
★ ★ ★
Q. Has the University ever refused,
or does it have any policy to refuse
contracts which require research
which is morally repugnant?
A. Morally repugnant to whom?
The "morality" of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsibility
of the man himself.
A rather effective check is provided
by the assessment of his professional
peers within and outside of his own
university.
Ultimately, however, we should and
do rely on the conscience of the in
dividual to determine how he will
employ his scholarly talents.
There are means within the Univer
sity whereby advice can be sought re
garding the propriety of research and
at least one where it is required by
federal regulation. I refer to a Uni
versity committee whose approval is
required before medical experimenta

tion on human subjects is under
taken.
★ ★ ★
Q. Does my office solicit or en
courage research contracts ("secret"
or open) from business or the federal
government?
A. If I understand tho tenor of this
question, the answer is—no
Every research project is initiated
by an individual faculty member who
wants to do a particular piece of re
search.
He writes a proposal to a federal
agency or to a foundation, or in highly
exceptional circumstances, to a busi
ness organization outlining what he
wants to do and how much it will
cost.
This proposal is reviewed by the
Department Head, School Dean, and
Provost's office on academic bases and
by the Controller's office for a budget
check and compatibility with federal
regulations.
Only after these favorable reviews,

is it forwarded by the University for
outside consideration.
My office, in addition to the propo
sal review responsibility which I men
tioned, will also give advice to faculty
members wishing research support
and when possible assist them in ob
taining it.
★ * ★
Q. How many classified contracts
does Stanford have?
A. Stanford has 13 such contracts
under the direction of eight different
faculty or research staff members.
Eleven of these contracts are in
the Stanford Electronics Laboratories,
one in Geophysics, and one (an Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
contract) is in the Hoover Institution.
The total dollar amount of these con
tracts is $3,383,500.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the majority of research on the eleven
engineering contracts is actually of an
unclassified nature and is indeed pub
lished.

Thus, this dollar amount is a mis
leading indicator of the amount of
research which is actually classified.
★ ★ ★
Q. How many students liave re
ceived degrees as a result of thesis
research which was classified?
A. Since 1948 (as far back as Uni
versity records go on this subject),
there have been thirty nidividuals who
have submitted classified theses.
Of these, five have been for Mas
ter's degrees, one for a Doctor of Edu
cation degree, ten have been for En
gineer's degrees, and the remainder
for Ph.D.'s.
Of th total, twenty-three have been
in Engineering, three in Education,
two in Physical Sciences, and one
each in Business and International
Relations. Fourteen of the thirty
theses are no longer classified.
★ ★ ★
I have also been asked to state my
own personal views on the propriety
of classified research in a university
and on whether a university should
accept research sponsored by the CIA.
Let me take these two issues up in
order, speaking first to the question
of classified research.
I feel strongly that a university
should impose as few rules and pro
cedures as possible on its faculty (and
students, too).
To this end, the individual faculty
member should make the decision
as to what research he wishes to pur
sue.
On the other hand, the University
is, or should be, a community of schol
ars and the historic guarantee of free
dom of publication should not be
lightly abrogated.
What then are the factors which
would convince a professor voluntar
ily to restrict his freedom to publish
the results of his research?
I believe there is one, and it is this.
When all the flag-waving is over,
when all the drum-beating of chauvin
ism has died down, many feel an hon
orable duty to strengthen the defense
of our country.
I myself do not wish to undertake
classified research in time of peace
or in time of an undeclared war in
which we are currently involved. Yet,
I would never attempt to impose my
desires and predictions on my col
leagues.
Special ized Research
There is another feature of classi
fied research which is perhaps not
widely recognized and thus deserves
emphasis. It is that within this cate
gory lie some of the most intellect

ually challenging problems of our
time.
Consider the engineering problem
of devising an effective missile de
fense of the United States.
Consider the economics of assessing
the Chinese capability of supporting
a nuclear weapons program.
Consider the sociological and politi
cal problems of setting a disarma
ment oplicy which will be both accept
able and meaningful.
Work in each of these areas will,
if not classified itself, at least involve
access to classified material if it is
to be at all valuable. Thus, the con
tract which supports this work must
be classified.
I*ropriety
Now let me turn to the question
of the propriety in accepting research
sponsored by the CIA. Again, I em
phasize, I am giving my personal
view as I was asked to do.
I believe that Stanford's policy as
outlined above insures that the nature
of the research is appropriate to a
university. Thus, the problem, to my
mind, is less a moral one than it is
a tactical one.
Do we want to be associated even
indirectly with an agency which has
as a part of its activities espionage
and subversion of foreign govern
ments? You will recognize that it
was exactly on this point of institu
tional embarrassment that MIT re
portedly decided to terminate its CIA
contract.
I must report honestly that my own
inclination would be to follow suit,
but I would remark that this is in
a sense the coward's way out, for if
the research topic is a bona fide one,
should we not defend our right to
pursue it no matter how unsavoury
the reputation of the sponsor?
I believe a better solution would be
to have these topics of research sup
ported through other government
agencies at the urging of the CIA
rather than by the CIA itself.
These are conclusions, however, on
which reasonable men can disagree.
That being the case, I would fall back
on the principle of leaving the decis
ion of the acceptability of CIA re
search support up to the individual
faculty member involved.
Ready To Meet
I stand ready to meet with any
group of the University community
further to elucidate Stanford's poli
cies and practices regarding research.
This is a subject which, if recent
student publications serve as a guide,
generates opinions based more on
misinformation than on facts.

(Editor's note: Following is the
text of a statement released to The
Daily yesterday by Hubert Heffner,
Associate Provost for Research. He
first answers some questions involv
ing researfh contracts at Stanford, in
cluding those sponsored by the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency, and then
gives his persorud views on the sub
ject.)
At the time of the May 2 demon
stration in front of my office I agreed
to make known through the medium
of The Daily certain factual informa
tion regarding Stanford's involve
ment in classified research and Stan
ford's policy and practices of accept
ing CIA-sponsored research or, in
fact, any research involving security
classification.
I welcome this opportunity, for I
believe these issues should be a matter
of public knowledge and public dis
cussion.
I would be less than honest, how
ever, if I did not say at the outset
that I consider the establishment and
modification of these policies the
prerogative of the faculty and officers
of the University and not the stu
dents.
