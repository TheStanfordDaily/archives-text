# Peace Corps To Face Radicals
## 
### 
The role of the Peace Corps
as an agent for social change
will be the subject of a panel
discussion tonight at 8:15 in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder Un
ion.
An occasion for the confronta
tion between the Peace Corps
and student "radicals" will be
provided when the Stanford
Peace Corps Committee will
be present: David Harris, ASSU
President-elect and avowed
"radical"; Paul Slausen, former
Peace Corps country representa
tive in Pakistan; Frank Maho
ny, former AID official in So
malia; Dennis Sweeney, Stan
ford senior and former worker
for the Student Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee (SNCC)
in Mississippi; Keith Lowe,
member of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam
(SCVP); and Dennis Ekberg,
former Peace Corps Volunteer
in Ethiopia.
One of the professed goals of

the Peace Corps is to effect fun
damental social and economic
change in the emerging nations
of the world. The means involve
an absolute rejection not only of
violence, but also of any kind of
political activity on the part of
the Volunteer.
Attacks From Activists
Many attacks have come from
student activists on American
college campuses, who feel that
the Peace Corps will never bring
about basic social change with
out involving itself in and en
couraging political movements
in developing countries.
Another and more recent of
the Peace Corps' interests has
grown out of a recognition of

the significance of the "Student
Movement" in this country. It
has been encouraging student
activists and radicals to join,
feeling that such concerned peo
ple have great potential as Vol
unteers.
However, according to one
Peace Corps spokesman, "The
activist must come aboard on
Peace Corps terms"â€”he must
put his philosophy of achieving
social change by means of po
litical activism and (if appropri
ate) civil disobedience in cold
storage for two years. With such
a pre-condition, can the student
activist be a Peace Corps Volun
teer without "selling himself
out"?
