The Collegiate Press Service
St. John's University has been
placed on the censure list of the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors, but the Middle
States Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools has con
tinued the school's accreditation
"for the time being."
The decision of the Middle
States Association not to revoke
the accreditation of St. John's
carried with it a warning by the
association's commission on
higher education that the uni
versity had made "grievous er
rors" and that it would "not
hesitate to revoke the accredita
tion" at a future date.
The Middle States Association
report did not directly mention
the dismissal of the 31 profes
sors nor the strike against the
school by the New York local of
the American Federation of
Teachers. The strike was
prompted by the dismissals; the
strikers claim that 21 of the
teachers were fired because they
had tried to gain a greater voice
in university decision making.
