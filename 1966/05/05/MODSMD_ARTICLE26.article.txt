# Intramurals Near Climax
## Leading Leaper 
### ERIC FISHER 
Living groups throughout the
campus have sent forth their
would be jocks, hoping to gain
fame and glory in intramural
competition. Joe Higgins, direc
tor of intramurals, is working
hard to keep up with the action
in softball, volleyball, tennis,
water polo, horseshoes, swim
ming, and track.
In fact, track finals are this
afternoon at Angell Field with
the field events starting at 3:30
and the running events at 4:00.
Entries will be taken in the mile
run, the 880 and the 880 yard
relay prior to running of those
events. Entrants in the other
events were selected Tuesday in
the prelims. See "Murals" on
this page.
The volleyball and softball
league competitions are drawing
to a close, with the final single
elimination tournaments sched
uled to begin Monday of next
week. Volleyball games will be

contested at 4:00, and the soft
ball gets under way at 6:30.
Thirty teams comprise the
volleyball tourney, and the "in
group" for softball number
twenty-four. They are too num
erous to mention here, so check
the IM office.
The horseshoes championship
will be decided soon, as Theta
Xi waits to play the winner of
the Neutrinos-Chi Psi II match.
In table tennis it looks like
Larkin will repeat as University
champs. They have swept
through the double-elimination
tournament without a loss and
are to face either I-Club or Cro
Mem to make it official. Larkin
has beaten each once.
Swimmers are urged to get in
shape for the swimming tourna
ment which the IM office has in
store for them May 10 and May
12. Until then the Encina pools
will be used for the concluding
games in water polo competi
tion.

The finals of the single-elim
ination tennis tournament are
scheduled this week in both the
"A" and "B" categories. In the
"A" division the Neutrinos, grad
students in physics, defeated
Lassen Tuesday for the right to
meet I-Club, winners of the up
per bracket. The "B" finals pair
Larkin II against Chi Psi 11.
CVI Point System
Seventy points will be award
ed to the University champions
in volleyball and Softball with
forty points going to the run
ners-up. League winners in an
"A" league receive 30 points,
while second, third and fourth
teams earn 20, 10, and five re
spectively. "B" squads are
allotted approximately half as
many points for comparable
finishes. Water polo champs are
awarded 25 points, league win
ners 15.
Tournament winners in ten
nis, horseshoes, and table ten
nis get 25 points for their ef
forts. Runners-up receive 16,
while semifinal losers earn 12.
Points are also awarded for
each win prior to elimination,
but a team which forfeits a
game or round of competition
by not appearing loses all points
earned to that point in that
sport.
Points for individual events
in track and swimming are
awarded on a 7-5-4-3-2-1 basis,
and relays are scored on a 14-10
8-6-4-2 scale. The winning team
is given 25 points.


Stanford sophomore Craig
Vanghan shows the form wliich
makes him the AAWU's leading
long jumper. Craig's best leap
of 24' 514" makes him a favorite
to win in Saturday's Big Meet
with Cal. Teanunate Bud Walsh,
who has jumped 24'4", ranks
second in the conference.
