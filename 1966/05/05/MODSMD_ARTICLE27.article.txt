# Cricket Club Dumps Golden Gate Eleven
## 
### 
An easy victory over an out
manned Golden Gate Cricket
Club added the fourth match to
Stanford's season long winning
skein at Golden Gate park on
Sunday.
Golden Gate finished its in

ning at bat with a moderate 200
runs and it took only two of
Stanford's ten batsmen to sur
pass that and win the game.
"That's how we'd like to win
all our matches," said Stanford
stalwart Mike O'Meara. "We
think we've got a pretty strong
side, one of the strongest in the
West."
Stanford's Club played with
most of its regulars this week.
Last week, with only two regu
lars, it took the eleven until the
last over to win.
Although their season lasts
through October, the longest of
any Stanford sport, (he eleven
is off to a great start in the
hopes of retaining the Inter
collegiate Championship Cup for
the third year in a row.
While the regular team was
gliding by Golden Gate, the
newly organized second eleven
played a practice match against
Marin County Cricket Club
which the latter won by 64 runs.
Stanford's Club plays every
Sunday at noon. All home
matches are on the intramural
field. This Sunday the Club will
host Cal Davis.
