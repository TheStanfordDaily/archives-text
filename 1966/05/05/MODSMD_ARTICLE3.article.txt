## Provoked By Middle Class 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
"The artist alone is capable of giv
ing meaning" to today's literature,
according to novelist Saul Bellow,
speaking here last night to a capacity
crowd in Dinkelspiel.
He went on to explain that today's
typical hero, weakened by emotion
and desires, is no match for surround
ing circumstances. Bellow appeared
as a guest of the Creative Writing
Center, established 20 years ago.
"Today it is not difficult to hold
radical views; the literary radicals
have it made," he said. Bellow critic
ized "contrived radicalism" however,
saying that originality is inherently
radical. "Tho substance of the revolu
tionary tradition is gone—only the
forms remain."
This need for reform affects not
only the content of a novel of poem
but also the lives of the artists,
according to Bellow.
Hemingway 'White Savage'
Citing the case of Hemingway, "a
white version of Rousseau's noble
savage," the novelist and his char
acters were virtually closed to poli
tics. "He dealt with love, death, and
war, but not the causes of war. The
American tourist who got there first,
ahead of the crowd, Hemingway had
a Populist devotion to the plain
spoken American man."
But as Hemingway himself became
more of a celebrity, the simple man
was transformed into a tragic doll.
In this case it is difficult to determine
whether his art or his existence was
more significant.
Bellow criticized this tendency for
modern writers to be drawn into
public life and their consequent role
playing duties. Modern writers may

profess a distaste for social institu
tions as did Joyce and Eliot, yet they
may be members of the Jet Set, he
said.
"They want the benefits of the
artistic and heroic life, but none of

the pains, the values of austerity with
those of luxury. They may get $50,000
a year and hate the Establishment;
they want to live dangerously and at
the same time securely."
Bellow said that the artist has
always fulfilled a social role but the
concept of this role has now changed.
Walt Whitman felt a "duty to per
fect new high forms. He became a
'high priest' and illustrated in his own
being the aims of art."

Today's artists are drawn into
more of an entertainment role. "Hu
man beings arc demanding artists
to tell them how to be." This insuing
popular demand "consumes" art. The
middle class demands "guidance" and
in doing so, provokes the artist to
showmanship and exhibitionistic tend
encies, he said.

This need for reform affects not
only the content of a novel of poem
but also the lives of the artists,
according to Bellow.
Hemingway 'White Savage'
Citing the case of Hemingway, "a
white version of Rousseau's noble
savage," the novelist and his char
acters were virtually closed to poli
tics. "He dealt with love, death, and
war, but not the causes of war. The
American tourist who got there first,
ahead of the crowd, Hemingway had
a Populist devotion to the plain
spoken American man."
But as Hemingway himself became
more of a celebrity, the simple man
was transformed into a tragic doll.
In this case it is difficult to determine
whether his art or his existence was
more significant.
Bellow criticized this tendency for
modern writers to be drawn into
public life and their consequent role
playing duties. Modern writers may

profess a distaste for social institu
tions as did Joyce and Eliot, yet they
may be members of the Jet Set, he
said.
"They want the benefits of the
artistic and heroic life, but none of

the pains, the values of austerity with
those of luxury. They may get $50,000
a year and hate the Establishment;
they want to live dangerously and at
the same time securely."
Bellow said that the artist has
always fulfilled a social role but the
concept of this role has now changed.
Walt Whitman felt a "duty to per
fect new high forms. He became a
'high priest' and illustrated in his own
being the aims of art."

Today's artists are drawn into
more of an entertainment role. "Hu
man beings arc demanding artists
to tell them how to be." This insuing
popular demand "consumes" art. The
middle class demands "guidance" and
in doing so, provokes the artist to
showmanship and exhibitionistic tend
encies, he said.

"The artist alone is capable of giv
ing meaning" to today's literature,
according to novelist Saul Bellow,
speaking here last night to a capacity
crowd in Dinkelspiel.
He went on to explain that today's
typical hero, weakened by emotion
and desires, is no match for surround
ing circumstances. Bellow appeared
as a guest of the Creative Writing
Center, established 20 years ago.
"Today it is not difficult to hold
radical views; the literary radicals
have it made," he said. Bellow critic
ized "contrived radicalism" however,
saying that originality is inherently
radical. "Tho substance of the revolu
tionary tradition is gone—only the
forms remain."
This need for reform affects not
only the content of a novel of poem

according to Bellow.
