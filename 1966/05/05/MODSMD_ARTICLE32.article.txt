# Politics And The ROTC
## 
### 
The nature of the Military Science Depart
ment's participation in the recent campus blood
drive does not speak well of the Department's
place in an academic community. For when
classrooms and grades are used in a manner that
more resembles indoctrination than education,
one of the fundamental responsibilities accom
panying academic freedom—the teacher's duty
to present all sides of a question and then to
allow his students to draw their own conclus
ions—has been transgressed.
The blood drive in question was organized
in mid-April by the Walter Company of the
Association of the United States Army, an extra
curricular organization for students in the ROTC
program. The purpose of the drive, in the words
of student Robert Clark, who organized the
effort, was "both physical and political." The
physical side of it was to fill a need for certain
blood derivatives—and as for the political facet,
Clark said it was the hope of Walter Company
"that the blood drive's demonstration of solidar
ity will shorten the war by bolstering the morale
of the anti-communist forces and by persuading
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong that the
U.S. will not tire of the war cither on the battle
field or on the home front." Thus, regardless of
whether blood drives are good or bad, regard
less of whether the War in Vietnam is good or
bad, Walter Company's project was, in part,
political.
Which, in itself, was not wrong.

But when an officer of the U. S. Army stepped
into his classroom to sign up ROTC students to
give blood, and individually asked those who did
not volunteer when diey would like to donate,
then, we feel, the classroom was used inapprop
riately.
More damning, perhaps, is the fact that the
grades of ROTC students were affected by their
participation in an activity that was, as we said
before, partly of a political nature. If a student
had not given because he did not want to con
tribute to the U.S. effort in Vietnam, he would
not have received the five "leadership merits"
given to those who did—and although it would
have amounted to only a small part of his grade,
if he had been a borderline case, his academic
standing would have been affected. There are,
we think, legitimate extracurricular activities
which might be used to grade leadership. But
giving blood to further one side of a political
controversy such as the one the war has pro
duced is not one of them.
It is sad, we think, that a display of support
for the American commitment in Vietnam was,
in reality, a display of the ROTC s commitment
to authoritarianism and to brainwashing in an
effort to create active support for the war where
it did not exist. Sadder is the fact that the teacher
involved saw nothing wrong with it. And sad
dest of all is the fact that it happened in a com
munity where an individual's academic standing
traditionally is not affected by his political
ideals.
