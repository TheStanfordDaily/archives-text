# Gruber Speaks
## The 						Report From The Front 
### Steve Gruber 
I received a postcard the oth
er day from the "Orange Coun
ty Stanford Students For Chris
topher."
"Looks like a group of Stan
ford students supporting Chris
topher for Governor," I mut
tered to myself as I was about
to tear it up.
Then I saw it.
The first two paragraphs read,
"Who are the members of this
esoteric group?
"They are students who are
annoyed by the image of irra
tional, irresponsible conserva
tism that is increasingly associ
ated with Orange County."
Was it a practical joke?
Obviously not. The rest of the
postcard was sane.
Postcard
The reason I got the postcard
is that until last October I was
a "Stanford student from
Orange County."
And I have a few tales to
tell.
". . . the image of irrational,
irresponsible conservatism that
is increasingly associated with
Orange County." It's not only

an image, it's the truth. Orange
County is rotten.
I never really believed this un
til the summer of 1964, when I
started working for the Harbor
Democratic Club in Newport
Beach. My job was to canvass
the precincts for new Demo
cratic registrations.
Everyday I met new and in
teresting people.
Who sometimes threatened to
kill me.
Take, for example, the Min
uteman we found in one pre
cinct. Both he and his rifle were
real, not an "image."
Or how about the little old
lady who told me that "All ni
gras mate like cattle." An
image?
If these were the only two
nuts that I met in four months
of campaigning, I wouldn't have
worried. But we met at least
one in every precinct and there
were 104 precincts.
Revilo Oliver
I remember the night that
approximately 200 Democrats
formed a picket line in front of
a school at which Revilo Oliver

was speaking to a John Birch
Society meeting. Revilo Oliver,
as you may remember, is a Pro
fessor of Classics at the Univer
sity of Illinois. He became well
known after President Ken
nedy's death when he wrote that
Kennedy had been killed by
Communist agents because he
had strayed from the party line.
While we were picketing I no
ticed a certain amount of ani
mosity between the Birehers and
the Democrats.
"Where are your party cards,
you dirty commies," screamed
one middle-aged woman. No, she
wasn't wearing tennis shoes.
Police Arrive
Then the police came. They
took motion pictures of the en
tire picket line "in the event
that there is any disturbance."
We were to discover, after the
election, that 25 per cent of this
particular police force were
members of the John Birch So
ciety.
Is Knott's Berry Farm an
image? Located in the northern
end of Orange County, this
unique institution specializes in
friend chicken, ghost towns, and

. . . racist literature.
That's right. The next time
you're at Knott's, drop into their
lending library and browse
through a few racist tracts. And
if you tire of that, there's al
ways American Opinion, the
monthly voice of the John Birch
Society.
Then there's Disneyland, whose
proprietor, Walt Disney, is an
avid supporter of Ronald Rea
gan.
Don't forget the distinct Ne
gro ghetto in Santa Ana and the
Mexican ghetto in Fullerton.
Rationality Exists
Yes, there are rational people
in Orange County. Someday we
may hear from them. Demo
cratic registration is slowly
climbing. The University of Cali
fornia at Irvine, the county's
first major university, was fin
ished last September. There is
even an occasional rational Re
publican.
But Orange County will not
be helped by a group called the
"Orange County Stanford Stu
ents for Christopher," located
450 miles away trying to pro
mote a new "image."
