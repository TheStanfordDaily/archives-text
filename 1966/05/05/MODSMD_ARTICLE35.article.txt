# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Personal Choice And The Pill 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We think that a number of
important and far-reaching is
sues are raised by the Stanford
Sexual Rights Forum campaign
for the prescription of contra
ceptives by the Health Service
to all Stanford students who de
sire them, given that there are
no medical counter-indications.
We urge that these issues be
dealt with seriously and in good
faith by all members of the
campus community who are con
cerned.
The first issue raised is
whether students shall be able
to participate meaningfully in
the making of policy decisions
which importantly affect their
lives while they are at the uni
versity.
The SSRF has apparently used
all means at its disposal to
create a dialogue and achieve a
democratic solution to this con
troversy. It has talked, it has
written letters, and it has dem
onstrated the existence of a stu
dent consensus.
It has been met with a flat
"no" from the administration,
which apparently intends to
close the issue.
We think the SSRF deserves
more. We urge that there be a
public hearing on this question,
which is open to all members of
the Stanford community.
We suggest that facts and
opinions be heard from all inter
ested parties, including stu
dents, faculty, medical services,
campus mental health profes
sionals, administrators, and cam
pus religious leaders.
The second issue raised by this
controversy is just exactly what
the actual practice of the Health
Service has been. We have been
members of the Stanford com
munity for a good many years.
We are aware that folklore has
it that the Health Service has
been prescribing contraceptives
to unmarried students for some
years, at its own discretion.
We should like to know wheth
er or not this is so. It is difficult
either to maintain or to revise
policy when the real nature of
either policy or practice is not
known to those who are most
affected by it. "Don't ask me my
policy, just ask for what you
want," is hardly a satisfactory
reply to the modern student.
The third issue raised by the

SSRF campaign is a civil liber
ties question.
The contention is that sexual
freedom is no different from any
other kind of freedom; that in
the same way as freedom of
speech entails, among other
things, the unlimited right to
publish and acquire printed ma
terial (excepting that which in
volves libel, slander, conspiracy,
etc.), sexual freedom entails,
among other things, the right
to acquire contraceptives, sub
ject only to medical and eco
nomic limitations.
To say that providing contra
ceptives to the unwed consti
tutes an endorsement of pre
marital sexual intercourse
makes no more sense than to say
that because the Tresidder Me
morial Union store carries the
Peking Review it thereby sub
scribes to the views presented
by that publication.
To endorse the opportunity
for a personal choice is not nec
essarily to endorse any of the
alternatives which may be
chosen.
To put the problem in a medi
cal context, to treat a patient
who smokes a lot with an hypo
thetical preventative for lung
cancer would not be to endorse
his smoking habit (presumably
the physician would recommend
the contrary).
The final issue involved here,
that of the validity of tradition
al sexual mores, is actually in
cidental in the sense that the
issues already mentioned could
in theory be resolved without
reaching it.
In practice, it would seem
fairly obvious that the anxiety
attaching to sexual matters in
our society makes sexual free
dom somewhat more proble
matical than other liberties. We
can only urge that all due recog
nition and respect be given the
anxieties involved.
Dr. Osborne has suggested
that there may be an important
difference in generational pers
pective here. We tend to agree.
One is not likely to find SSRF
irresponsible or trivial if one is
young enough to remember how
it felt the first time one under
took to obtain a contraceptive
device for one's own use.
By the same token, the young
er generation might pause to
consider the nature of the pro
found sentiments which they
have challenged.
Removal of the fear of preg
nancy places the whole question
of premarital sex in other
frames of reference, perhaps
where it more rightly belongs.
We agree with those who stress
that sexual expressions are just
one vital element in the complex
fabric of intimacy and of psy
chologically meaningful human
relationships.
This consideration, however,
should never be used as a justi
fication for ignoring or dismiss
ing sincere requests for sexual
information, contraceptives, or
"choices," but rather should be
used to emphasize the impor
tance of giving counsel and
helping to instill a sense of hu
man responsibility along with
the affirmation of personal
choice.

• Black And White
Editor, The Daily:
Oh, some now Dr. Black!
While I couldn't agree with you
more that contraceptives aren't
the central question now facing
us (The Daily, May 2), a "letter
to the parents" is not the way
to put the issue in the proper
perspective.
In the first place, on the prac
tical level, your 1 to 500 ratio
would suggest that only 3.5 un
dergraduate women find it ad
visable to use the pill to avoid

pregnancy. I would suggest that
if you divided your ratio by 20
you would still end up with a
conservative guess as to those
that do take it, and probably
many more should when one
considers the "long term de
structive results" of unwed preg
nancy. And to suggest absten
tion is as ridiculous as suggest
ing abstention.
On the theoretical level the
question does definitely have
relevancy to a much larger con
cern. It is not the place of the
University either to condone or
encourage any moral or ethical
code. The University should not
set up more restrictive or more
permissive rules than the "out
side world." As in the case of
liquor and religion, where Stan
ford has now begun to recog
nize the same rights for stu
dents as state law and the Con
stitution give human beings in
our "free society", the Health
Service should respond to the
demands and requests of its pa
tients as any other clinic would.
The issue is black and white—
let's recognize that it is only one
small symptom of the paternal
ism here—change it—place the
responsibility on the individual
where it belongs—and move on
to the massive job of radical
educational reform ahead of us.

• Sexual Rights Guys
Editor, The Daily:
What these "minority" sexual
rights guys need is to visit a
Head Shrinker.
I've heard people say they'd
not send any daughters to any
institution of "learning" where
so few make so many demands
of the female of the species.
Once, we oldsters respected
our females and protected them.
We did not use or abuse the
privilege of their loving associa
tion.
And we did not go about with
our lower lip in a pout, because
we could not get an aphrodisiac
to propel us into the realms of
the ridiculous.
What these guys need is a
vasectomy and stop this poison
ing our female population with
pills.

• Missing The Mark
Editor, The Daily:
A basic criticism of Mr.
Cohn's article in The Daily April
28 is that it does not accomplish
its stated objective, "to forward
a few notes on what might be
wrong with academic life at
Stanford." He tells us that the
real reason for the present stu
dent-faculty alienation lies with
a "basic imbalance and senti
mentality in the prevailing edu
cational tone at Stanford."
As a counterexample, he offers
French higher education, a very
interesting choice. I do not
claim to be an expert on the
subject, but I have just returned
from a six month stay in France
where I had the opportunity to
observe this system "in action,"
so to speak.
I certainly do not disagree
with Mr. Cohn's statement that
there is "a certain lagging pro
vinciality and exclusiveness in
French higher education." Voila,
Tours!
However, his implication (cor
rect) that the curriculum and,
in fact, general attitude in
French universities is conserva
tive, traditional, and relatively
inflexible illustrates the basic
paradox in his statements; while
praising this example of strong
conservative bias in education,
he condemns Stanford education
for "a basic imbalance," which,
we can only assume, means an
inclination toward the liberal,
modern, and flexible.
I submit that this is, at best,
a vigorous rationalization.
From these premises, Mr.
Cohn arrives at the wonderfully
ludicrous conclusion that "there
are evolving rewards of zestful
appreciation if the 'latest thing'
is read under the table, so to
speak." How any serious educa
tor could write this is beyond
me.
I'm willing to ignore the state
ment, "This helps to explain why
France continues to produce far
beyond its share of original art
ists and thinkers in all do
mains." Suffice it to say that it
might prove to be difficult to
substantiate.
My second major objection to
Mr. Cohn's remarks was his
rather circumstantial dismissal
of an overseas campus program
as "dessert," a hindrance to his
"delicate but all-important bal
ance."
Perhaps my intellect has been
"dulled by a 'progressive and
permissive modishness,' but I
consider the six months I spent
in Tours by far the most signifi
cant of my education to date.
It would be interesting to hear
a more specific criticism of
Stanford's overseas program
from Mr. Cohn.
Finally, after avoiding all men
tion of any "sentimentality" in
the Stanford system, Mr. Cohn
offers us this:
In sum, the only way to mit

igate the alienation of the
"new generation," . . . is by
challenging them to become
the (special) kind of men we
arts or are t»upi>osad to be, or
once were. (All qualifications
courtesy Mr. Cohn)
This looks suspiciously like
the awful sentimentality we
were cautioned to avoid. I think
Mr. Cohn could benefit from
drawing a little further into sab
batical retreat and re-examining
a few of his statements.

• The Time Has Come
Editor, The Daily:
"An idea is not invalid because
powerful people oppose it. . . .
Let us decide whether an idea
is ritfht and then decide the best
way to realize it."
"These are not common times.
We cannot go on with common
business. Therefore, we refuse
to continue in the daily affairs
of the university, our society.
How can one continue?"
Is the latter not frequently the
means by which those who es
pouse the former ultimately
seek to oppose the "powerful
people" and thus realize the
ideas they have judged to be
"right"? The call of revolution
is heard ad nauseam, from pro
fessors to friendly Black Mus
lim newsboys. The university
student thoroughly recognizes
his duties regarding the imple
mentation of social change, his
right to oppose the status quo.
The disturbing fallacy lies nei
ther in the right nor the duty,
but in the generalization that the
sanction of expression presup
poses the sanction of reason.
When members of a student
body assume the enlightened at
titude that their own maturity is
best capable of guiding their
education, why do they violate
the logic of this same maturity
by accepting irrational, imma
ture demands merely because
they are demands which exercise
the sanction of independence?
If the active minority must
initiate action in the "commun
ity of scholars," why not an ac
tive minority of students willing
to stand for reason, respect, and
true maturity? If the student
body is willing to follow anyone
engaged in an exercise which
seems proper to the academic
community, why not follow
those who at least are worthy
of the respect of the society up
on which the student plans to
build his life?
Perhaps the Notre Dame grad
uate in political science was cor
rect when he reasoned: "The an
swer must be that many stu
dents do not suffer the ill effects
of the intellectual atmosphere
merely because they have . . .
as little to do with it as they
can."
