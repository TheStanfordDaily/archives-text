# 'Grading For Blood' LASSU Topic
## 
### CHRIS HARTE News Editor 
LASSU will consider a resolution
tonight recommending to the Execu
tive Committee of the Academic Coun
cil "that academic credit be removed
from ROTC courses and that ROTC
be recognized as any other outside
activity."
Mike Collins, ASSU Vice-president
elect, is sponsoring the bill primarily
because an Army major used his
ROTC classroom to solicit blood in
last month's Association of the US
Army blood drive, and also offered
to add the equivalent of slightly over

one point to the quarter's grade of
any student who did give.
The drive, according to spokesman
Robert Clark, was "both physical and
political."
These charges against ROTC came
from several freshman cadets who
thought that methods used in the
classroom were "high-handed and co
ercive."
ROTC commanding officers, in an
interview with The Daily, admitted
that a student's grade might be raised
if he gave blood, but denied that this
was wrong.
Major William Hammil, the officer
who used grade incentive in his fresh

man Military Science classes, said that
points were added to the leadership
grade of those who donated blood.
"But," he said, "we give points for
any type of activity which shows
leadership."
The leadership grades counts a quar
ter of the entire ROTC grade.
One freshman, commenting on the
fact that giving blood counted for
the leadership grade, said that he
thought giving under the circum
stances showed an ability "not to
lead, but rather to be led."
In class the week before the blood
drive Hammill passed out folders for
students to sign up for a time to do

nate blood, according to the cadets
and individually asked several boys
who failed to sign up voluntarily
when they would like to give.
The cadet who first reported the
grade incentive to The Daily com
mented that at this point "it was no
longer a donationâ€”the students need
ed to have a reason not to give."
Faculty Consideration
Kenneth J. Arrow, Professor of
Economics and Statistics and secre
tary of the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council, said the com
mittee "certainly would consider any
resolution from LASSU and make a
recommendation on it to the full Aca
demic Council, which decides on these
issues."
Arrow added his hope that "if there
are factual examples of grade incen
tive being used, we would appreciate
documentation."
Collins, who was a ROTC cadet
himself for two years, said "It has
always been a definite question in
many people's minds what place
ROTC had in the university. I per
sonally think that academic credit for
a course in oral hygiene would be
much valuable."
The Legislature will meet tonight at
7:30 in room 370. It will consider reso
lutions on open house hours, contra
ceptive policy and classified contracts.
