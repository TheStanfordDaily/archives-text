# SOCIAL REGS COMMITTEE
## End Of Tradition Near? 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
The Social Regulations Committee
may be on its way out.
Confusion concerning the selection
procedure for next year's Social Reg
ulations Committee has caused the
cancellation of try-outs for member
ship. Ellen Otto, chairman of the pres
ent committee, said that this issue has
re-emphasized a problem which the
group has been faced with all year—
the lack of a clear statement of its
purpose and responsibilities.
Barbara Miller, committee member,
added, "We have found it impossible
to explain our function to applicants.
The complexities arise from the con
flicting relationship of the committee
to LASSU and to the presidential Stu
dent Affairs and Services Committee."
For this reason, Mrs. Otto an
nounced that the try-outs for the

1966-G7 Social Regulations Committee
have been cancelled and that efforts
would bo made to restructure the or
ganization this spring.
"The position of the old AWS So
cial Regulations Committee no longer
exists or is the most desirable. A re
evaluation of women's regulations
should be placed in the context of the
other social policies, open house and
liquor, and should be handled by one
committee," stated Mrs. Otto.
ASSU Will Consider
The present Social Regulations
Committee, after discussions with
both LASSU, members of the admin
istration, and women students, de
vised a proposal for an ASSU com
mission to handle all social regula
tions. The body would be composed of
equal numbers of boys and girls. This
recommendation was sent to the
LASSU Student Affairs Committee

for consideration on Tuesday of this
week.
The LASSU committee considered
this proposal at a meeting yesterday.
However, it decided to submit a plan
which completely abolishes a Social
Regulation Committee and assigns all
its duties to the ASSU Social Secre
tary and standing committees of the
Legislature. This by-law change will
be introduced at the meeting tonight.
Dan Smith, chairman of the Student
Affairs Committee was not available
for a statement on the bill.
She continued, "A conflict in func
tion has existed between these two
committees." To rectify this conflict
and other problems, the Social Regu
lations Committee in the past two
weeks, has met with Dan Smith as
well as with Dean Joel Smith, Assist
ant Dean of Students, and Professor
Alfred Grommon, chairman of the
Student Affairs and Services Commit
tee.
Concern Of Women
In a meeting last week with the
entire Social Regulations Committee,
Dan Smith presented the Legisla
ture's views on the problem. He said
that LASSU gladly received and con
sidered the recommendations of the
Social Regulations Committee. How
ever, he stated that the ultimate au
thority for the student policy rested
with the representative body.
Mrs. Otto added that the fact that
LASSU bills concerning Social Regu
lations are not sent to her committee

purpose and responsibilities.
Barbara Miller, committee member,
added, "We have found it impossible
to explain our function to applicants.
The complexities arise from the con
flicting relationship of the committee
to LASSU and to the presidential Stu
dent Affairs and Services Committee."
For this reason, Mrs. Otto an
nounced that the try-outs for the

1966-G7 Social Regulations Committee
have been cancelled and that efforts
would bo made to restructure the or
ganization this spring.
"The position of the old AWS So
cial Regulations Committee no longer
exists or is the most desirable. A re
evaluation of women's regulations
should be placed in the context of the
other social policies, open house and
liquor, and should be handled by one
committee," stated Mrs. Otto.
ASSU Will Consider
The present Social Regulations
Committee, after discussions with
both LASSU, members of the admin
istration, and women students, de
vised a proposal for an ASSU com
mission to handle all social regula
tions. The body would be composed of
equal numbers of boys and girls. This
recommendation was sent to the
LASSU Student Affairs Committee

for consideration on Tuesday of this
week.
The LASSU committee considered
this proposal at a meeting yesterday.
However, it decided to submit a plan
which completely abolishes a Social
Regulation Committee and assigns all
its duties to the ASSU Social Secre
tary and standing committees of the
Legislature. This by-law change will
be introduced at the meeting tonight.
Dan Smith, chairman of the Student
Affairs Committee was not available
for a statement on the bill.
She continued, "A conflict in func
tion has existed between these two
committees." To rectify this conflict
and other problems, the Social Regu
lations Committee in the past two
weeks, has met with Dan Smith as
well as with Dean Joel Smith, Assist
ant Dean of Students, and Professor
Alfred Grommon, chairman of the
Student Affairs and Services Commit
tee.
Concern Of Women
In a meeting last week with the
entire Social Regulations Committee,
Dan Smith presented the Legisla
ture's views on the problem. He said
that LASSU gladly received and con
sidered the recommendations of the
Social Regulations Committee. How
ever, he stated that the ultimate au
thority for the student policy rested
with the representative body.
Mrs. Otto added that the fact that
LASSU bills concerning Social Regu
lations are not sent to her committee

The Social Regulations Committee
may be on its way out.
Confusion concerning the selection
procedure for next year's Social Reg
ulations Committee has caused the
cancellation of try-outs for member
ship. Ellen Otto, chairman of the pres
ent committee, said that this issue has
re-emphasized a problem which the
group has been faced with all year—
the lack of a clear statement of its
purpose and responsibilities.
