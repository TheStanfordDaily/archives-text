# God: The Being At The Center?
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
Replacing the conception of God as
a being "standing against his crea
tion," Bishop John A. Robinson in his
concluding West lecture yesterday
posited a projection of God "whereby
he is represented as the center, radi
ating out â€”as the 'within of things',
rather than as a Being external to
them."
Speaking in Dinkelspiel on the
theme "An Exercise in Re-centering,"
the bishop began by detailing two
tracks in contemporary theology: the
evolutionary theories of Teilhard de
Chardin and "a type of Christian
positivism."
"De Chardin sees the whole cosmos
as in the grip of a great expansive
force rolling all things on towards
some cosmic appointment with God,"
he quoted Leslie Paul as stating. The
other view is a doctrine of seculariza
tion, "that men are in charge and
rolling away from God. In this doc
trine man looks to his own resources
and not God's."
Although the two groups each start

from a different point, "one from the
inside out and the other from the out
side in," their points of convergence
are "more significant and seem to con
stitute the base from which a con
temporary exploration into God could
proceed."
First is the agreement that "a dual
istic model of the universe is out.
Whether looked at from the outside or
the inside, reality for us is all of one
piece. There is no supernatural reali
ty, high and lofty above us. There is
only that reality which concerns us
directly and concretely."
"The corollary of this is not the
abolition of the transcendent in pure
naturalism: it is an application of the
transcendent as given in, with and un
der the immanent. 'The beyond' is to
be found always and only 'in the
midst', as a function and dimension
of it."
Third, "the other side of this coin
is a strong insistence that we can say
nothing of God apart from relation
ships. We cannot speak of God in
himself, but only in terms of the ways

in which we actually encounter other
ness."
In place of the traditional label of
'theism', Bishop Robinson suggested
the term 'panentheism': "the belief
that the Being of God includes and
penetrates the whole universe, so that
every part of its exists in him, but (as
against Pantheism) that his Being is
more than, and is not exhausted by
the universe. It is the view that God
is in everything and everything is in
God."
Pantheism tends towards "an aes
thetic, impassive, impersonalistic view
of life in which the individual loses
his significance. Its advantage is that
it visualizes God as the inner truth,
the depth and center of all being. And
this surely is a more promising pro
jection than seeing God and the world
as separate existences.
"Theism rejected the depersonaliza
tion of God in deism but retained its
projection. Can we reject the deper
sonalization of God in pantheism but
retain its projection?" he asked.
Such an attempt, he said, "must be
made. It would mean going through
the traditional Christian doctrines and
seeing how they come out in the new
projection."
For the doctrine of creation, he sug
gested, the new projection would in
sist on replacing the image of the
"artificer God." Western tool-making
man has "allowed himself to become
fixated by this mechanistic imagery;
