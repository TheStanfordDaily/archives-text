# History Department Requirements Change
## 
### JANE ARIES 
Requirements for the undergrad
uate history major have been sub
stantially restructured, Department
Chairman David M. Potter announced
yesterday. All present sophomores
electing a history major will follow
the new program.
Beginning with the Class of '68,
majors will take ten units of inde
pendent reading in comparative his
tory culminating in a four-hour com
prehensive examination. The basic
seminar will be given during the
junior year, area requirements will
be made more stringent, and the
minor requirement will be abolished.
The changes come as a result of
recommendations of a student-fac
ulty committee established by ASSU
President Sandy MacKenzie and or
ganized by Vice President Clark
Brown, The committee members were
Professors Otis Pease, Gordon Craig,
and Philip Dawson; Fred Johnson,
sophomore philosophy major; John

Cavenaugh and Julie Skirsky, senior
history majors; and Jim Bartholo
mew, graduate student in history.
Six-Quarter Registration
Specifically, history majors must be
registered in the Department for six
quarters and must complete eight
other courses numbered 20 or above
besides the two of comparative his
tory, with at least two in each of the
following fields: Western Europe
since 1700 and the United States;
Africa, Asia, Midle East, Latin Am
erica, Russia and East Europe; and
the period before 1700.
The Honors progam will remain
the same.
According to Potter, the independ
ent reading in comparative history
is "one of the most distinct steps,
one of the most imaginative changes
the Department has made in a num
ber of years. It could be very fruit
ful."
Students will focus on a theme
which lends itself to a historical corn

parison, such as revolution or colon
ialism, and take a comprehensive
exam based on their reading. Thus,
the possibility of too general an exam
will be avoided. Hopefully, this kind
of comparison will encourage an
alysis and interpretation.
'Think Ln Different Categories'
Pease predicted, It will get students
to think in different categories, to
give a different arrangement to facts
learned in their courses."
The reading will be conducted with
out classes and thus will lead to inde
pendent work by the students. As
Dawson said, "Everyone takes the
same exam, so there will be a feeling
of common experience. Students hope
fully will discuss the reading with
each other either informally or in
structured groups."
The other major change is that
the basic seminar will be taken the
junior year. This seminar, which deals
with methods of research and the
philosophy of history is now given

to seniors who, Dawson commented,
can make no use of it.
Civ Teacher's Seminar
The seminar, which is presently
taught by the senior members of the
Department, will be taught by ni
structors in Western Civilization,
especially chosen for their ability in
this type of teaching. Senior mem
bers of the faculty will be freed for
other areas of undergraduate teach
ing, such as expanded colloquia. Ac
cording to Dawson, the enthusiasm
and genuine interest of Civ. instruc
tors for this type of instruction prob
ably surpasses the average amount
of enthusiasm of senior members.
Pease emphasized that if any time
is freed, senior faculty members will
devote it to undergraduates. Thus,
this change will not mean a loss of
contact between senior faculty and
undergraduates.
The change on the History major
was described by Pease as the result
of two converging forces. Last Fall

Sandy MacKenzie conceived of the
idea of a student-faculty liaison com
mittee which could take advantage
of the opportunity for students to
work with faculty at the department
level. MacKenzie consulted with Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Robert
Sears who suggested that the History
Department might be responsive to
MacKenzies' overtures. The students
on the Committee felt that making
the history program more rigorous
would discourage people who did not
have a sincere interest in history.
At the same time the History De
partment was looking critically at the
undergraduate requirements. Enroll
ment was rising with extreme rapid
ity, and the 800 majors make History
Stanford's largest department. There
seemed to be what Pease called "chaos
around the edges." The department
had outstanding students and faculty,
but its program was not well enough
structured.
The Student-Faculty Committee

met seven times fall quarter and pro
duced a series of proposals which it
presented to the History Department
in January. At the meetings there
was no feeling of student-faculty ten
sion. The Department then discussed
and modified the Committee's pro
posals.
Both students and faculty on the
Committee seemed satisfied with the
changes. The Committee had recom
mended general comprehensive ex
ams but felt that the faculty proposal
of comparative historical reading was
even more creative. Fred Johnson ex
pressed doubt only about Civ. nistruc
tors' teaching the basic seminar.
Given the fact that the faculty cannot
be expanded, however, he was satis
fied with the present solution.
The reading and examination in
comparative history is unique in the
United States and, as Potter com
mented, may become one of the most
distinctive history programs in Am
erican higher education.
