# 'Billy Liar' vs 'Kwaidan' In Arts
## 
### MEL KNOX 
The double-bill at the Paris
last week well illustrated the
differences between classical
and decadent art.
"Kwaidan," a Japanese film,
reputed to be the most expen
sive movie ever made there,
and "Billy Liar," an English
movie featuring Tom Courtenay
and Julie Christie, contain vir
tues of opposite orders.
In "Billy Liar," the ultimate
value of the movie derives from
the insight into Billy Fisher's
character, while the enjoyment
of "Kwaidan" comes out of its
eeriness and the beauty of vis
ual effects.
And these differences are, of
course, the difference between
classical and decadent art.
Classical art is good because the
parts are subordinated to the
whole, while in decadent art the
reverse is true, the parts carry
more weight than the whole.
Popular during the 1890's, deca
dent art has been making a big
comeback lately.
Those Unwitting Hipsters
The hippy generation, wheth
er it realizes it or not, has re
turned to Oscar Wilde's world,
with its emphasis on decadence,
drugs, and the "grooving" con
cept.
"Billy Liar" is clearly exem
plary of classical art, if I may
apply the word "art" to it. Billy
Fisher, the protagonist, has
trouble coping with the every
day world and compensates
through fantasy.
When the opportunity comes
for Billy to escape his unhappy
world, he escapes the train he
has just boarded by ostensibly
looking for some milk (get it,
gang?).
As the train pulls out the
station, without him on it, Billy
throws the milk containers on
the tracks. Running after the
train is in vain, so he starts
walking, and, imagining himself
to be leading a corps of elite
soldiers, he returns to his make
believe world.

"Billy Liar" is a comedy, a
fact thus far hidden from the
reader, and, as in all good classi
cal art-type comedies, the com
edy serves to point up Billy's
weaknesses.
Whenever he is thwarted, em
barrassed, or otherwise dis
turbed, he imagines himself tri
umphing over those who have
hurt him, by, for example, turn
ing a machine gun on them.
Courtenay and Christie
Aren't Bad
The acting of Tom Courtenay
is really outstanding, and Julie
Christie isn't bad herself. Billy's
financees are good portraits of
dumb broads.
The movie is fairly good. The
juxtaposition of reality and
imagination is carried off well,
though the cutting back and
forth between scenes is often
times too fast for the tempo of
the movie.

"Kwaidan" can be looked at
from two views. One can con
sider it as three eerie ghosts
stories or one can "trip out" on
the exotic color effects. Since
the first effect could have been
easily obtained without the sec
ond, I consider the movie to be
(un)intentionally (?) decadent
art.
None of the three ghost
stories have any apparent rela
tion to each other, a confusing
situation for anyone viewing
the movie without advance
preparation.
Black Hairs in Tea Cup
The first, "Black Hair," is an
ironic tale about a samurai who
returns to his first wife. The
third "In the Cup of Tea," a bit
of comic relief, a guard swal
lows a soul.
The middle story, "Hoichi, the
Earless," moves slowly at times,
but it is undoubtedly the -best

of the three stories. A blind aco
lyte who likes to sing of an an
cient sea battle that took place
near his temple is brought be
fore the ghosts of the Heike
clan who lost that battle.
Eventually, to protect him
from the ghosts, his body is
painted with script, save for his
ears, which are not covered,
and when the ghost of the sam
urai comes to take him away,
the only visible part of his body
is his ears, which are dutifully
removed.
A Visual Psychedelic
The visual effects, the colored
diffusion filters, the painted
skies, the weird battle effects,
are remarkable. Insofar as the
use of color and color effects
is concerned, "Kawidan" is rem
iniscent of "Juliet of the Spir
its." One might justly term it a
psychedelic movie.

cept.
"Billy Liar" is clearly exem
plary of classical art, if I may
apply the word "art" to it. Billy
Fisher, the protagonist, has
trouble coping with the every
day world and compensates
through fantasy.
When the opportunity comes
for Billy to escape his unhappy
world, he escapes the train he
has just boarded by ostensibly
looking for some milk (get it,
gang?).
As the train pulls out the
station, without him on it, Billy
throws the milk containers on
the tracks. Running after the
train is in vain, so he starts
walking, and, imagining himself
to be leading a corps of elite
soldiers, he returns to his make
believe world.

"Billy Liar" is a comedy, a
fact thus far hidden from the
reader, and, as in all good classi
cal art-type comedies, the com
edy serves to point up Billy's
weaknesses.
Whenever he is thwarted, em
barrassed, or otherwise dis
turbed, he imagines himself tri
umphing over those who have
hurt him, by, for example, turn
ing a machine gun on them.
Courtenay and Christie
Aren't Bad
The acting of Tom Courtenay
is really outstanding, and Julie
Christie isn't bad herself. Billy's
financees are good portraits of
dumb broads.
The movie is fairly good. The
juxtaposition of reality and
imagination is carried off well,
though the cutting back and
forth between scenes is often
times too fast for the tempo of
the movie.

"Kwaidan" can be looked at
from two views. One can con
sider it as three eerie ghosts
stories or one can "trip out" on
the exotic color effects. Since
the first effect could have been
easily obtained without the sec
ond, I consider the movie to be
(un)intentionally (?) decadent
art.
None of the three ghost
stories have any apparent rela
tion to each other, a confusing
situation for anyone viewing
the movie without advance
preparation.
Black Hairs in Tea Cup
The first, "Black Hair," is an
ironic tale about a samurai who
returns to his first wife. The
third "In the Cup of Tea," a bit
of comic relief, a guard swal
lows a soul.
The middle story, "Hoichi, the
Earless," moves slowly at times,
but it is undoubtedly the -best

of the three stories. A blind aco
lyte who likes to sing of an an
cient sea battle that took place
near his temple is brought be
fore the ghosts of the Heike
clan who lost that battle.
Eventually, to protect him
from the ghosts, his body is
painted with script, save for his
ears, which are not covered,
and when the ghost of the sam
urai comes to take him away,
the only visible part of his body
is his ears, which are dutifully
removed.
A Visual Psychedelic
The visual effects, the colored
diffusion filters, the painted
skies, the weird battle effects,
are remarkable. Insofar as the
use of color and color effects
is concerned, "Kawidan" is rem
iniscent of "Juliet of the Spir
its." One might justly term it a
psychedelic movie.
The double-bill at the Paris
last week well illustrated the
differences between classical
and decadent art.
"Kwaidan," a Japanese film,
reputed to be the most expen
sive movie ever made there,
and "Billy Liar," an English
movie featuring Tom Courtenay
and Julie Christie, contain vir
tues of opposite orders.
In "Billy Liar," the ultimate
value of the movie derives from
the insight into Billy Fisher's
character, while the enjoyment
of "Kwaidan" comes out of its
eeriness and the beauty of vis
ual effects.
And these differences are, of
course, the difference between
classical and decadent art.
Classical art is good because the
parts are subordinated to the
whole, while in decadent art the
reverse is true, the parts carry
more weight than the whole.
Popular during the 1890's, deca
dent art has been making a big
comeback lately.

Aren't Bad
The acting of Tom Courtenay
is really outstanding, and Julie
Christie isn't bad herself. Billy's
financees are good portraits of
dumb broads.
The movie is fairly good. The
juxtaposition of reality and
imagination is carried off well,
though the cutting back and
forth between scenes is often
times too fast for the tempo of
the movie.

"Kwaidan" can be looked at
from two views. One can con
sider it as three eerie ghosts
stories or one can "trip out" on
the exotic color effects. Since
the first effect could have been
easily obtained without the sec
ond, I consider the movie to be
(un)intentionally (?) decadent
art.
None of the three ghost
stories have any apparent rela
tion to each other, a confusing
situation for anyone viewing
the movie without advance
preparation.
Black Hairs in Tea Cup
The first, "Black Hair," is an
ironic tale about a samurai who
returns to his first wife. The
third "In the Cup of Tea," a bit
of comic relief, a guard swal
lows a soul.
The middle story, "Hoichi, the
Earless," moves slowly at times,
but it is undoubtedly the -best

of the three stories. A blind aco
lyte who likes to sing of an an
cient sea battle that took place
near his temple is brought be
fore the ghosts of the Heike
clan who lost that battle.
Eventually, to protect him
from the ghosts, his body is
painted with script, save for his
ears, which are not covered,
and when the ghost of the sam
urai comes to take him away,
the only visible part of his body
is his ears, which are dutifully
removed.
A Visual Psychedelic
The visual effects, the colored
diffusion filters, the painted
skies, the weird battle effects,
are remarkable. Insofar as the
use of color and color effects
is concerned, "Kawidan" is rem
iniscent of "Juliet of the Spir
its." One might justly term it a
psychedelic movie.
