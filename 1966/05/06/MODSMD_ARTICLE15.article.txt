# 'Darling' Swings To Tune Of Julie The Mundivagant
## 
### DWIGHT JOHNSON 
"Darling" is the first major
film directed by John Schles
singer. Its major strength and
weaknesses are those typical of
many first films. At the same
time it one of the few unique
films to be released in 1965.
Unfortunately, that which
makes a film unique also makes
it impossible to criticize ac
curatelyâ€”it has no precedent.
Moreover, when the film is also
good, analysis is somewhat un
fair. Therefore, rather than run
the risk of distorting the read
er's impressions of a unique
and excellent film, I will confine
my comments to what is not
unique in "Darling". This will
limit the discussion to the
faults of the film, but don't be
misled, the film is as good as
any produced last year.
Major works by serious as
pirants in many fields have
similarities which make them
identifiable as first works. Fre
quently noticeable is an at
tempt by the author to put into
his product everything he can
think of on the subject, espe
cially if those things which
show his skill to the best advan
tage. Often, other aspects of the
piece are sacrificed in making
it a showpiece. This was the
case with "Darling."
The story of a girl, motivated
by absurd frustration through
a particularly meaningless seg
ment of an absurd world, is
necessarily a comment on and
characterization of her world as
well. If it had stopped at that
it would have been perfect. But,
Schlessinger, hopefully through
exuberance, went much farther
and it didn't always work.
Compromises Development
For example, in a scene where
Diana (Julie Christie) is intro
duced to high society and ap
parantly greatly changed by it,
the important development to
the film is what happens to her
character. But, in this confron
tation, Schlessinger uses the op
portunity to zero in on the sick
ness of the environment in a
melange of tricks picked up
from Fellini and Lester. He
flashes close ups of society ma

trons making typical, assinine
comments that we have all
heard. He then concentrates his
attack on some homosexual
goons making boring remarks
about cute little colored boys.
Worst of all is Schlessinger's
treatment of a speech by a
faggotty M.P. It is a typical
speech with a "Mondo Pazzo"
cut away to a fat old matron
in a gambling casino playing
chemin defer and feeding her
face on some line in the M.P.'s
speech about Britons always
aiding the starving peoples of
the world. I don't mind saying
it is all well done, but it is peri
pheral to Darling (the girl). It
shows us nothing about the so
ciety we didn't know, and makes
no comment on Diana. It only
obscures her for a moment.
The same comments go for
the art show interlude, and the
old joke on the escalator in the
tube. Parts of her visit to her
sister are a wasted opportunity
too. It is never out of taste, but
it is just unnecessary and dis
tracting from some superbly
acted characterization.
Transitions 'Too Good'
The other weakness of the
film is similar. Schlessinger is
a master of fluid and meaning
ful transition. I have never seen
shot-to-shot or scene-to-scene
flow smoother or stronger.
Most of the time it ranks
Schlessinger with Antonioni and
Truffaut. But, sometimes it is
overbearing, tricky, and dis
tracting. In a sense it is just
too good.
As a first major direction,
"Darling" ranks with "Hard
Days Night" and "Jules and
Jim" in its freshness of style,
strength of presentation and
sensitivity of good acting. If
"Darling doesn't compare in
overall quality with the other
two, I think its due to lack of
experience, pressure from a lot
of talent and occasionally over
powering good sense.
It may be more than coinci
dence that by the end of this
year, Julie Christie's three star
ring roles in movies will have
been directed by Schlessinger,
Truffaut, and Lester.
