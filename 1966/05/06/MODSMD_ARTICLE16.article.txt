# LONDON TO PARIS
## 'Magnificent Men' In Trouble 
### KIRK HANEN 
Sitting attentively through
two hours and 33 minutes of
"Those Magnificent Men In
Their Flying Machines" is
almost as difficult as saying the
title (even without the appended
sub-title: "Or How I Flew From
London to Paris in 25 Hours
And 11 Minutes.")
Though superior in all ways
to its recent counterpart, "The
Great Race," and vastly more
credible, "Those Magnificent
Men," has a difficult time over
coming several mediocre acting
jobs and a labored script.
While Terry-Thomas is steal
ing the show with his accustom
ed English dry wit—and he's
worth the price of admission
by himself—the other principals

offer only the mildest objec
tions.
Sarah Miles is as much at
home in the part of a socially
registered newspaper publish
er's daughter as Julie Andrews
would be in the title role of
"Darling." She can't seem to
shake her milkmaid charm.
'Unconvincing'
James Fox and Stuart Whit
man are unconvincing as early
day flyboys risking their necks
and machines for a 10,000 pound
first prize in the London-Paris
race. Fox as the Coldstream
Guard officer and Whitman as
the Arizona barnstormer do
have their moments in this
cliche-ridden marathon —espec-
ially in their competition for the
publisher-sponsor's daughter —
but are usually bogged down by
every banal turn of plot and
prop.
Like most spectaculars,
"Those Magnificent Men" sports
an all-star international cast.
Gert Frobe, as the caustic col
onel from the Fatherland; Jean-
Pierre Cassel, as the lecherous
Frenchman who can't turn down
a romp in the hay at the ex
pense of the race; and Alberto
Sordi, as a mama-dominated
Italian nobleman" are all dressed
for their parts—with no place to

go. Red Skelton is absolutely
superfluous where he could
have been superb.
•Don't Miss'
As the two-and-one-half-hour
spectacle wings out over the
technicolor-c aptu r e d White
Cliffs of Dover, across the En
glish Channel to Calais, and on
across Normandy, director Ken
Annakin keeps piling on the
slapstick 'til the movie's internal
structure collapses under its
own weight. The fact that three
of these 1910 vintage daredevils
finally do make it to Paris seems
anti-climatic.
When you go to see this one
— and you really shouldn't miss
this tribute to the men who
gave aviation its start—find a
good, soft seat. After its over,
you'll feel like you've been along
for the rida
