## Unique Press Conference Starts ACTive Ball Rolling 
### WENDY WEINER 
William Ball, director of the
American Conservatory Theater
(ACT), offered a glimpse of this
summer's excitement at a press
conference Tuesday night.
Ball gesticulated wildly while
he delivered monologues on his
company's first West Coast
visit, ACT's repertory, and his
role as a director.
ACT will be performing at the
Stanford Summer Festival of
the Arts, presenting dramas
representative of "Twentieth
Century Innovations." The com
pany will perform a basic reper
tory of five plays, Pirandello's
"Six Characters in Search of an
Author," Shaw's "Misalliance,"
Thomas' "Charley's Aunt," Chek
hovs "Uncle Vanya," and Ed
ward Albee's "Tiny Alice."
In addition, Ball announced
that he will add four late per
formances of the British satir
ical review, "Beyond the
Fringe." These after-shows will
be "an interesting experiment to
try here," commented Stephen
Baffrey, producing manager of
the Summer Festival.
Experimentation is a key to
William Ball's approach to his
company. "I ask that the actors
give themselves an openness to
the exposure to anything that
may come along. Through di
recting I am trying to bring a
group of people down the road
of mine or anyone else's creat
ive idea," he said. "But actors
are not always open to the new
idea. There's a safeness in non
extension."
Learns More From Other Works
Ball strives to get as close as
he can to the playwrites world.
"I often learn more from the
playwrite's other works than
from the play under direction."
Ball emphasized that acting
is a continuous learning process.
" 'We do not know. Anything,' "
he said, quoting his favorite
line from "Tiny Alice." In the
theatre, "there are no opinions
based on knowledge. We have
only emotion and experience."
In comparison to the critic,
who purports to deal with
knowledge, "the actor is com
pletely compulsive. I wish there
could be a day when critics
would declare their ideas about

acting and beauty on stage and
actors could give them reviews."
Baffrey, excited by this idea,
challenged Ball to just that. At
the critics' symposium, an eval
uation program to be held late
in the Summer Festival season,
the critics will be reviewed by
Ball and the ACT company.
California Very Generous
Ball is anxious to bring the
ACT company to the West
Coast. "California audiences are
very generous. It's because of
all the space out here," he con
jectured. "New York theatre
audiences aren't used to room,
so they aren't open to what they
are experiencing."
If ACT reflects the personal
ity of its director, the repertory
company's three weeks at the
Stanford Summer Festival of
the Arts should be quite exhil
erating."
