# Whitaker: We Must Recover 'Awareness Of Common Good'
## 
### 
"In an age when the fashion
able philosophy is thoroughly
egocentric, we need to recover
an awareness of the common
good as the goal which each in
dividual must choose as his
own," according to Graduate
Dean Virgil Whitaker.
"The outrageous appearance
and the filth of youths in revolt
are too often an outward sym
bol" declaring their abandon
ment of human obligations, he
contends.
His remarks were prepared
for the dedication of the new
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies in Rome, Italy, last
week. The Center is adminis
tered by Stanford for a consort
ium of 17 institutions.
"Parents among us simply
assume their children should
and will be more knowledge

able, healthier, happier, and—
above all—richer. Children seem
often to accept as their heritage
a right to look down on their
parents as old fogies.
No Danger
"We are in no danger of los
ing the desire to be healthier,
happier and richer. But we are
in danger of forgetting the
classical teaching that if we are
to be happier, we must be wiser,
as distinguished from more
knowledgeable, and above all
better."
A Shakespearean scholar
trained in the classics, Dean
Whitaker suggests that modern
man has overcome his geo
graphic provincialism only to
fall victim to temporal near
sightedness.
"As we have extended the
present, we have lost the past,"

he comments.
"Those of us who deal with
modern students are constantly
appalled by their indifference
to the lessons of even recent
history and their belief that
conditions to which they have
taken a passing dislike can and
must be changed overnight.
Indifference
"This attitude reflects the in
difference of too many of their
teachers to the evolutionary
nature of human institutions, to
the witness of history, and
especially to the danger of ran
dom tinkering with old insti
tutions that are fairly useful.
"Extended knowledge of the
present is only extended dark
ness if we cannot see by the
light of the past."
Where Shakespeare often
viewed contemporary problems
through the eyes of the great
Roman writers, Dean Whitaker
noted, Americans would rarely
consider Vietnam as basically
similar to the dilemma of Mar
cus Aurelius in deciding whether
to hold Dacia or retreat to the
Danube.
Skepticism
Turning to the present, he
adds: "We live in an age that
is profoundly skeptical of hu
man ideals that do not square
with present realities, in which
the superstition of the intellect
ual is his preoccupation with
statistical norms.
"While I do not ohject to find
ing out what people do norm
ally, that knowledge seems to
me of real value only as it shows
us the magnitude of our prob
lem in getting them to do what
they ought to do. The goals
must be set by human intelli
gence and human vision cooper
ating. Our danger is that we
may become cynical of the vis
ion."
