# ROTC Change Recommended By Legislature
## 
### 
The Legislature last night request
ed the Executive Committee of the
Academic Council to consider "wheth
er R.O.T.C. should become an extra
curricular activity without grades
and academic credit."
The resolution passed 28 to 23 at
11:15 after a long and heated debate.
It. states that the academic stand
ards of R.O.T.C. courses are "ques
tionable" and asks whether the
"blatant abuse of the teacher-student
relationship as evidenced by attempt
ed intimidation of Army R.O.T.C.
should be tolerated within the aca
demic framework."
The charge of "attempted intimida
tion" refers to the alleged actions of
Major William Hammil, a Stanford
instructor of military science, to
force ROTC students to donate in a
campus blood drive this quarter.
It was this incident that provided
the impetus for the Legislature's
move last night.
'Reprehensible'
The consensus of the Legislature
was that Major Hammil's conduct
was "reprehensible." The debate,
however, revolved around the ques
tion of abolishing ROTC's academic
accreditation.
Graduate Representative John
Shippee argued that the Hammil in
cident reflected a "fundamental and
basic inconsistency of ROTC in the
academic community."
Opponents of the resolution assert
ed that it was unjustified to censure
the entire ROTC department for an
"inadvertant and unfortunate incir
dent."
"You should single out your critic
ism to the one individual involved,"
one representative said.
The Legislature may reconsider the
resolution next week, as a motion to
that effect was made at the close of
the meeting last night.
Women Off Campus
In another resolution the Legisla
ture requested the Committee of
Fifteen to consider the matter of off
campus residence for undergraduate
women.
It recommends that students—in
cluding unmarried, undergraduate
women—not be compelled to live on
campus or buy their board at an on
campus residence.
In other action the Legislature:
—appropriated $100 to the Mexican-
American Project for this summer.
—accepted nominations for Carl
Schmidt as Legislature speaker and
for Tom Forstenzer as liaison officer.
—passed a resolution to consider a
controversial bill about open house
hours next week.
