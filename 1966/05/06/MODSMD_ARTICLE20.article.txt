Stanford lax m en may be
swinging crutches at Cal's Bears
this Saturday instead of sticks,
if things continue as they have
been this past week.
After having tied the Bears
3-3 after two overtime periods
three weeks ago, on the Berke
ley postage stamp, the Indians
will host the Blue and Gold on
their own full-sized field to de
termine the winner of the Aber
crombie and Fitch broken stick
trophy. If this game should end
in a tie after the official two
overtime periods, a sudden
death overtime will ensue.
On the hobbled list for the In
dians are attackmen Clay Prim
rose and Tony King and mid
fielder Tom Hecht. Primrose,
who leads the Indians in both
goals and assists caught a
stick in his knee Monday, but

began running again on Wednes
day and hopefully will be ready
Saturday.
Crease attackman Tony King
suffered a slight recurrance of
a back injury, but if past refcord
is any indication should be
ready Saturday.
Hecht, one-third of the second
inidfield, which includes Dirk
>peas and Sill Sanders is hob
bled by a thigh injury and is the
most doubtful for Saturday's
ontest.
But this week also marks the
eturn of Captain Bob Murphy
o full health at midfield, which
lodes well for the Tribe. Mur
ohy has clearly had his best
week of the season and has re
gained most of his old form after
a painful muscle injury in his
leg.
Goalie Mel Ellis is also in
peak form, shoring up the tough
Stanford defense.
