## 
### 
The frosh tennis team, overshadowed this spring by the track
and baseball teams, completed an undefeated season yesterday
with a convincing 9-0 sweep over Robert Louis Stevenson School.
The victory left the freshmen with a 9-0 record in inter-school
competition. Among their victims were Cal, Foothill, and tough
City College of San Francisco, winners of the Northern California
Intercollegiates in the frosh and junior college division.

Chuck Alloo, nation a 11 y
ranked in both singles and dou
bles, led off yesterday with an
easy 6-1, 6-1 victory against Bill
Atkins in the first singles
match. Dale Wong and Brad
Cornell followed with straight
set victories in the second and
third slots. Rich Young, Jim
Shoch, and Bill Closs completed
the singles sweep.
Alloo and Wong then teamed
for a 6-3, 8-6 win at first dou
bles against Atkins and Ron
Marston. Cornell and Young
paired for a close 8-6, 8-6 deci
sion, and Shoch and Closs
closed out the match with a 6-4,
6-2 triumph.
The frosh narrowly defeated
Foothill Tuesday in their
closest match this year. Alloo
struggled through thirty-seven
games to beat Dale MacGowan
at first singles. Dale Wong beat
Geoff Kerber, but Brad Cornell
dropped a three-setter to Dick
Svedman.
Foothill's Barry Rapozo de
feated Rich Young, 6-2, 7-5 to
even the match at 2-2. Jim
Shoch outclassed Rob Herdman,
though, and Glen Garrison, de
spite a second set letdown, beat
Paul Bates to give the frosh a
4-2 lead.
MacGowan and Kerber
smashed Alloo and Wong in the
doubles, and after Svedman and
Rapozo had edged Cornell and
Young, the match was again
tied. Jim Shoch and Bill Closs
preserved the team's unbeaten
record with a hard earned 4-6,
6-4, 9-7 win at third doubles.
