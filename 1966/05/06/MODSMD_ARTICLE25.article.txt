# Stanford Nine Battles Cal In Weekend Series
## 
### 
Stanford's recently hard hit
ting baseball team plays its last
two games ever in the CIBA
this weekend when they face
Cal in a home and home series.
The Indians engage the Bears
at Sunken Diamond Friday
afternoon at 3:00. Saturday, the
two teams move to the Berkeley
campus for a noon game.
The reason these are the last
ever CIBA contests for Tribe
is that the always powerful Cali
fornia Baseball Association after
40 years of operation will be dis
membered. Stanford, Cal, UC
LA, and USC next season will
form into a league which par
allels the AAWU football league.
One of the reasons is that now
an all-sports trophy can be
awarded.
This weekend could easily
turn into a pitcher's battle even
though Stanford hitters clouted
the ball mercilessly last week
end when they beat UCSB, 6-3
and UCLA 18 0 and 7-0.
John Mason, who threw a
shutout last trip out, will be on
the mound Friday, and Terry

Docken, who also threw a shut
out last trip, will pitch Satur
day.
Cal has two fireballing jun
iors who handle their mound
chores like they know how to
do it. Andy Messersmith, an all
league pick last year, and Bill
Frost are the duo. Frost has
been striking out people at an
even faster rate than Messer
smith who along with Mason
is the hardest thrower in the
league.
