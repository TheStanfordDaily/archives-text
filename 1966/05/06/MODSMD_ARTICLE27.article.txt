# Crew's Varsity Manned For Tough Bruin Team
## 
### 
This weekend, the Stanford
crew travels to Los Angeles to
meet UCLA and USC in the an
nual Harbach Cup. This cup is
given annually to the winner of
the regatta by Edwin Harbach,
a L.A. financier. UCLA has won
the cup three straight years.
The Bruins are undefeated so
far this season. They have beat
en Cal by one length and USC
by 2% lengths. Stanford has
beaten the Trojans by three.
Stanford also claims three
straight victories over Santa
Clara, Oregon State, and Long
Beach State. Last week, the In
dians lost to the Washington
varsity. This Huskie crew is vir
tually the same one that fin
ished third in the IRA last June.

However, this week's Stan
ford varsity crew will not be
the same one that competed
against Washington and should
be considerably faster. They
will be performing together for
the first time this season, but it
is an experienced team. Six men
are rowing who were in the IRA
last year.
Stanford will be rowing their
first varsity this weekend pre
paring for the big race against
Cal next Sunday. The Indians
will row five races against the
Bears beginning at 8:45 in the
Redwood City Harbor. There
will be three varsity races and
two frosh races between the two
rivals.
