# CAL TRACK CLASH
## Tribe Slight Favorites 
### BOB EGELKO 
Payton Jordan's Card track
men will play a nervous favor
ite's role at Berkeley tomorrow
as they try for a fifth straight
dual meet win over the Cal
Bears. The varsity meet will
begin at 1:00.
Stanford and California will
meet twice this year, the sec
ond scheduled here May 27; and
although the Cards will be fa
vored to extend their 36-32 mar
gin in the 71st renewal of the
traditional series, Jordan has
been talking "tossup" all week
long.
He may hove some justifica
tion. The Bears, despite several
losses in the 100-point class,
could well win a majority of
first places tomorrow; and
Stanford will have to call on its
depth and field event superiori
ty to come out on top.
Bear Hurdlers Tough
Cal is strongest in the middle
distances, hurdles, and relays.
Stanford's Bud Wash, who has
been working out this week
after missing the Washington
meet due to illness, faces two
good hurdlers in Lou Kirtman
(14.2) in the 120 highs and Pad
dy McCrary, the AAWTJ's best

Stanford's undefeated frosh
track team will begin field
competition at 11:30 tomorrow
against Cal. Frosh running
events will be interspersed
with the varsity events start
ing at 1:15.

(51.3) in the intermediates.
Bears Devone Smith (1:50.7)
and Mike Shafer should breeze
in the 880, as Jordan plans to
save Dave Deubner for the cru
cial distance duels with Cal's
Bob Price.
Price, who finished second to
Deubner in last year's two-mile,
has come in a long way since
then. His mile time of 4:06.2 is
comparable to Deubner's, and
he has been consistently under
nine minutes in the longer race.
Sprinter Forest Beaty is an
other man in Cal's upset hopes.
Beaty will try to duplicate his
1965 quarter mile victory and
come right back in the 220, and
a double victory could go a long
way toward erasing Stanford's
ten-to-fifteen-point "on paper"
margin.
With help from teammate
Larry Hengl, who has actually
beaten him the last two weeks,
Beaty will try to shut out Stan
ford sophomore Jim Ward in

the quarter, and then seek to
upset Larry Questad in the 220.
Questad is a slim choice in
the 100 over Cal'e Bob Brink
worth and Steve Adams; the
Bears' best sprinter, Gary Ma
han (9.5), is injured and will
miss the meet.
Going for 34
Cal's mile relay team has won
33 straight races and is a good
bet to make it 34, as a clocking
of 3:10 would appear to put it
out of Stanford's class. The 440
relay is something else; the
Bears posted a debatable but of
ficial 39.9 against San Jose, but
may need to run even faster
should the Cards overcome
their handoff woes.
It is in the field events,

though, that Cal can be had,
and Stanford must score heavily
here to overcome the hosts'
track edge.
Injuries have cut into an al
ready thin Cal field crew to the
extent that the Cards could win
every event. Craig Vaughn a*nd
Bud Waltsh in the long jump,
Bob Stoecker in the discus. Jim
Eshclman and Chuck Smith in
the vault, and George Porter in
the javelin look the safest bets.
Cal depth in the triple jump,
with five men over 43 feet, may
be too much for Stanford's Art
Miller (46-1); but the Bears' top
jumper, Jim Kennedy (46-94),
could fall short of his best form
due to an injury, giving Miller
a shot at an important win.

may need to run even faster
should the Cards overcome
their handoff woes.
It is in the field events,

though, that Cal can be had,
and Stanford must score heavily
here to overcome the hosts'
track edge.
Injuries have cut into an al
ready thin Cal field crew to the
extent that the Cards could win
every event. Craig Vaughn a*nd
Bud Waltsh in the long jump,
Bob Stoecker in the discus. Jim
Eshclman and Chuck Smith in
the vault, and George Porter in
the javelin look the safest bets.
Cal depth in the triple jump,
with five men over 43 feet, may
be too much for Stanford's Art
Miller (46-1); but the Bears' top
jumper, Jim Kennedy (46-94),
could fall short of his best form
due to an injury, giving Miller
a shot at an important win.
Payton Jordan's Card track
men will play a nervous favor
ite's role at Berkeley tomorrow
as they try for a fifth straight
dual meet win over the Cal
Bears. The varsity meet will
begin at 1:00.
Stanford and California will
meet twice this year, the sec
ond scheduled here May 27; and
although the Cards will be fa
vored to extend their 36-32 mar
gin in the 71st renewal of the
traditional series, Jordan has
been talking "tossup" all week
long.
He may hove some justifica
tion. The Bears, despite several
losses in the 100-point class,
could well win a majority of
first places tomorrow; and
Stanford will have to call on its
depth and field event superiori
ty to come out on top.
Bear Hurdlers Tough
Cal is strongest in the middle
distances, hurdles, and relays.
Stanford's Bud Wash, who has
been working out this week
after missing the Washington
meet due to illness, faces two
good hurdlers in Lou Kirtman
(14.2) in the 120 highs and Pad
dy McCrary, the AAWTJ's best

Stanford's undefeated frosh
track team will begin field
competition at 11:30 tomorrow
against Cal. Frosh running
events will be interspersed
with the varsity events start
ing at 1:15.

(51.3) in the intermediates.
Bears Devone Smith (1:50.7)
and Mike Shafer should breeze
in the 880, as Jordan plans to
save Dave Deubner for the cru
cial distance duels with Cal's
Bob Price.
Price, who finished second to
Deubner in last year's two-mile,
has come in a long way since
then. His mile time of 4:06.2 is
comparable to Deubner's, and
he has been consistently under
nine minutes in the longer race.
Sprinter Forest Beaty is an
other man in Cal's upset hopes.
Beaty will try to duplicate his
1965 quarter mile victory and
come right back in the 220, and
a double victory could go a long
way toward erasing Stanford's
ten-to-fifteen-point "on paper"
margin.
With help from teammate
Larry Hengl, who has actually
beaten him the last two weeks,
Beaty will try to shut out Stan
ford sophomore Jim Ward in

the quarter, and then seek to
upset Larry Questad in the 220.
Questad is a slim choice in
the 100 over Cal'e Bob Brink
worth and Steve Adams; the
Bears' best sprinter, Gary Ma
han (9.5), is injured and will
miss the meet.
Going for 34
Cal's mile relay team has won
33 straight races and is a good
bet to make it 34, as a clocking
of 3:10 would appear to put it
out of Stanford's class. The 440
relay is something else; the
Bears posted a debatable but of
ficial 39.9 against San Jose, but
may need to run even faster
should the Cards overcome
their handoff woes.
