# Whims Of Freedom Blow
## 
### 
We are increasingly lead to believe that the
vote of the Board of Trustess in February to
allow freedom of worship on the Stanford cam
pus was in reality only an attempt to placate
a University community committed to the ecu
menical belief that individuals of all faiths
ought to have the right to worship on campus.
The sham, however, is proving unsuccessful.
A case in point is yesterday's "clarification"
by the administration of a two-day-old an
nouncement that campus sectarian worship
services could begin now, rather than next fall
as previously announced. By ruling that Rabbi
Charles Familant cannot lead Jewish services
in the Woman's Clubhouse, the administration
has affirmed its adherence to the letter of the
Trustee's declaration —that "arrangements be
made for the various denominations to hold
worship services on a regular schedule in Me
morial Church" (emphasis ours) —and has ig
nored the spirit in which we had assumed that
the policy change had been made.
Previous to the Board's vote, Familant had
informed President Sterling that Jane Stan
ford's memorial to her husband was, because
of its Christian symbolism, an unacceptable
setting for Jewish worship. As a consequence,
for the past eleven weeks the administration
has been seeking for the Jews an "accommoda
tion"—a term, incidentally, which smacks of
the worst of religious paternalism—by which
they would be allowed to worship in accept
able surroundings. The administration's best
offer to date would allow the Jews to worship
in the Choir Room in the basement of Memo
rial Church—an offer comparable to suggest
ing that the History Department hold its class
es in the TMU Bowling Alley. In the mean
while, the ministers of the other campus reli
gious groups have admirably supported Rabbi
Familant by declaring that they will not begin

campus services until the Jews be allowed to
do the same in acceptable surroundings.
Thus, the present impasse. The administra
tion insists that the Trustees' new law be car
ried out to the letter; Familant and the other
ministers are asking that the theoretical spirit
of it be observed.
Not that this has been the only sign of the
administration's unwillingness to face the free
dom-of-worship issue head-on.
After shelving Chaplain Robert Minto dur
ing spring vacation and announcing the ap
pointment of B. Davie Napier of Yale to the
new post of Dean of the Chapel, the adminis
tration said implementation of the new policy
would have to wait until Napier arrived on
campus this summer. This unnecessary delay
surprised even Dr. Napier, who has told The
Daily that he sees no reason why the new pol
icy should not have been put into effect short
ly after its approval. Finally on Tuesday of
this week, acting under the threat of publicity
resulting from public disclosure of the unrea
sonable procrastination, the administration an
nounced "interim" sectarian worship pending
Dr. Napier's arrival. And then, yesterday, came
the "clarification."
All of which leads us to question whether
the Board's vote in February was intended
only to "accommodate" Stanford's new breed of
ecumenical activists, and whether the Board
had any real intention at all of granting true
freedom of worship to the campus.
If the Trustees had no such intention, then
President Sterling should go back to the Board
and request that the "Memorial Church" re
striction on campus worship be removed. If
they did, the administration should stop seek
ing "accommodations", withdraw from the pic
ture, and allow worship by all groups to pro
ceed unhampered.

morial Church" (emphasis ours) —and has ig
nored the spirit in which we had assumed that
the policy change had been made.
Previous to the Board's vote, Familant had
informed President Sterling that Jane Stan
ford's memorial to her husband was, because
of its Christian symbolism, an unacceptable
setting for Jewish worship. As a consequence,
for the past eleven weeks the administration
has been seeking for the Jews an "accommoda
tion"—a term, incidentally, which smacks of
the worst of religious paternalism—by which
they would be allowed to worship in accept
able surroundings. The administration's best
offer to date would allow the Jews to worship
in the Choir Room in the basement of Memo
rial Church—an offer comparable to suggest
ing that the History Department hold its class
es in the TMU Bowling Alley. In the mean
while, the ministers of the other campus reli
gious groups have admirably supported Rabbi
Familant by declaring that they will not begin

campus services until the Jews be allowed to
do the same in acceptable surroundings.
Thus, the present impasse. The administra
tion insists that the Trustees' new law be car
ried out to the letter; Familant and the other
ministers are asking that the theoretical spirit
of it be observed.
Not that this has been the only sign of the
administration's unwillingness to face the free
dom-of-worship issue head-on.
After shelving Chaplain Robert Minto dur
ing spring vacation and announcing the ap
pointment of B. Davie Napier of Yale to the
new post of Dean of the Chapel, the adminis
tration said implementation of the new policy
would have to wait until Napier arrived on
campus this summer. This unnecessary delay
surprised even Dr. Napier, who has told The
Daily that he sees no reason why the new pol
icy should not have been put into effect short
ly after its approval. Finally on Tuesday of
this week, acting under the threat of publicity
resulting from public disclosure of the unrea
sonable procrastination, the administration an
nounced "interim" sectarian worship pending
Dr. Napier's arrival. And then, yesterday, came
the "clarification."
All of which leads us to question whether
the Board's vote in February was intended
only to "accommodate" Stanford's new breed of
ecumenical activists, and whether the Board
had any real intention at all of granting true
freedom of worship to the campus.
If the Trustees had no such intention, then
President Sterling should go back to the Board
and request that the "Memorial Church" re
striction on campus worship be removed. If
they did, the administration should stop seek
ing "accommodations", withdraw from the pic
ture, and allow worship by all groups to pro
ceed unhampered.
We are increasingly lead to believe that the
vote of the Board of Trustess in February to
allow freedom of worship on the Stanford cam
pus was in reality only an attempt to placate
a University community committed to the ecu
menical belief that individuals of all faiths
ought to have the right to worship on campus.
The sham, however, is proving unsuccessful.
A case in point is yesterday's "clarification"
by the administration of a two-day-old an
nouncement that campus sectarian worship
services could begin now, rather than next fall
as previously announced. By ruling that Rabbi
Charles Familant cannot lead Jewish services
in the Woman's Clubhouse, the administration
has affirmed its adherence to the letter of the
Trustee's declaration —that "arrangements be
made for the various denominations to hold
worship services on a regular schedule in Me
morial Church" (emphasis ours) —and has ig
nored the spirit in which we had assumed that
the policy change had been made.
