# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Research Is Above Politics 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The spirit of M'Carthyism is
still among us. Not only in the
vestigial but unfortun
ately in the group of student
and faculty critics who oppose
the University's association with
the CIA. Perhaps they too are
guilty of condemnation by as
sociation.
The morality of a research
donor, including its cloak and
dagger activities, is not really
the University's concern at the
level of research project evalu
ation. Indeed, the criteria have
wisely been maintained aloof
from politics, and placed solely
on the basis of (1) whether ap
propriate for scientific inquiry,
and (2) whether consistant with
academic freedom and auton
omy.
Thank goodness those tal
ented enough to contribute to
man's store of knowledge do not
always ponder the myriad pos
sible uses to which it may be
put, screening and censoring
each of their investigations
which might contribute to "im
moral" purposes.
I thing the ultimate responsi
blity for morality in the use of
our technology rests not upon
those researchers, without whose
efforts the Twentieth Century
would be just as the First, but
upon those profound thinkers
who (should) cast the ballot.

• Academic Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I would certainly agree that
there are questions of policy and
principle involved in the current
controversy concerning the CIA
(horrors) and other classified
contracts. Most important
among these is the lip service
granted academic freedom by
many students and faculty mem
bers.
For the sake of argument I
would think it reasonable to as
sume, that aside from the usual
economic pressures and blandish
ments, no one is forced to work
on these projects. Indeed many
of thorn are actively solicited by
the professors involved.
As the concept of academic
freedom is normally viewed by
the AAUP it means the freedom
to pursue a line of research or
teaching (possibly in unpopular
subjects or with unpopular con

elusions) free of harassment
from the university administra
tion, students' irate parents, gov
ernment dictation, and/or other
faculty members. Within this
context the researcher (who let
us hope is not disinterested) is
in no way obligated to communi
cate his findings until he is sat
isfied with them.
Given the above one cannot
imagine a person or a group of
people seriously devoted to the
iedals of academic freedom de
manding to know the nature of
the research being undertaken
by a faculty member. It appears
to me that Monday's demonstra
tion was a reprehensible intrus
ion upon the foundation of aca
demic freedom.
Based upon the previous edi
torial positions taken in The
Daily on the subjects of aca
demic freedom and administra
tion control of the professional
activities of the faculty, one
would expect questioning of the
desirability of having either the
administration or a faculty com
mittee prejudge the research
being undertaken or proposed
by {acuity members.
The only restriction on classi
fied research which I consider
valid is that neither university
credit nor degrees should be
awarded for work which is not
available to the entire academic
community.

• 'The Message''
Editor, The Daily:
For those who didn't "get the
message," allow me to para
phrase the reasoning of Tues
day's CIA editorial:
• Although the only activity
being done for the CIA is re
search which is "indistinguish
able" from present studies in
the field of electrical engineer
ing, we don't know the uses the
CIA may make of the study,
therefore such study is not con
ducive to open inquiry and this
violates the principles of aca
demic freedom.
• The CIA is really a bad
thing and we are condoning its
activities and its existence by
doing this research for them.
• Even the Executive Com
mittee doesn't know about the
classified research contract,
therefore the decision-making
process is "inadequate."
There, now, isn't that better?

• O. s & C. s Quandary
Editor, The Dally:
Was it the "Universality of
History" or the "History of Uni
versality" (The Daily, May 3)?
Two horsemen of the Apoca
lypse (the other two were fond
of smorgasboards; they boasted
of no ethical passions), Harald
Ohlendorf and David Cornberg,
rode rough shod over our nicely
ordered smorgasbord tables. Had
it not been for the trees they
would have seen the forest.
Though Dostoevsky attributes
moments of revelation to his
Idiot during periods of epileptic
encounter, we cannot assume
that his findings are correct. Un
les modern medicine contradicts
me, our idiots have fabricated
not only the revelations but also
the epilepsy. Something is "void
at the center."
After consulting Confucius,
Buddha, Jesus Christ and the
Church of the Latter Day Saints,
not to mention Boethius, St.
Augustine, Voltaire and Groucho
Marx, I must confess ignorance
in respect to O.'s and C.'s quan
dary.
Even mice know how to push
the lever once they have run the
maze. (Hilgard—someplace or
other.)
In order not to give myself
over entirely to my august
sources, I would like to state an
idea all my own.
I am convinced without a
shadow of a doubt that, with my
very excellent processes of di
gestion (and my acquaintances
will vouch for the quality of my
digestion), I am able to do jus
tice to any smorgasbord.
But if, however, I have occa
sion for nausea and my stomach
rejects my bodily nourishment,
well, then you can see the uni
versality of it all!
O.'s and C.'s self-criticisms are
merited.

• No One Thinks Here
Editor, The Daily:
I found "Universality and His
tory" (Th«» Daily, May 3) an ex
tremely provocative, and some
how very satisfying article, sat
isfying especially in its remarks
on general education and on the
conflict between the Baconian
and the Platonic approach to the
question of university.
Stanford, unfortunately, has
chosen the Baconian approach.

Students are not encouraged to
think at Stanford. They are en
couraged to accumulate units as
effeciently as possible, develop
a little social suave, and choose
a lucrative profession in which
they can become successful after
graduation.
No one thinks at Stanford—
publicly, anyway. It is neither
required nor really encouraged
and so becomes somewhat super
fluous. Stanford is interested
only in providing students with
a patented, uniform, Good
Housekeeping Approved educa
tion so that they can become Up
standing Citizens and Commun
ity Pillars.
One wonders whether this uni
versity is not, after all, defeating
its purpose, if, perhaps, a little
training in deep thinking might
not, after all, produce more con
cerned, competent citizens, citi
zens more involved in and com
mitted to involvement in im
portant community, national,
and international issues?
In regard to the value of the
general studies program, I
would like to say that, as far as
I can see, it has little real value
beyond introducing the student
to the bare fact that there are
areas of academic concern be
yond his major.
The Stanford general studies
program makes little effort to
relate academic fields, to demon
strate the basic unity and inter
relatednes of human knowl
edge, an awareness of which is
essential before an individual
can develop any coherent Wel
tanschauung- (world-view), or
formulate any personally sat
isfying sense of values.
Stanford's failure, and the fail
ure of its general studies pro
gram, to provide students with a
sense, at least, of the universal
ity of knowledge cannot help
but produce valueless, dissatis
fied individuals.
Stanford — are you going to
produce successful businessmen
or educated, thoughtful men and
women?
