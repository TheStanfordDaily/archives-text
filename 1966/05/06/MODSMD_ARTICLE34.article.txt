## Cal Phones 'Dial-a-Liberal' And Harris Answers Call 
### Robert Stone 
Rumor has it that students
at the University of California
at Berkeley are disgruntled with
their role in educational decision
making.
In any event last week saw
Slate, a political group that
always runs a slate of candi
dates, and the GCC attempt to
ratify a new ASUC constitution
which would have allowed the
students at Berkeley a greater
say in the decision-making of
the school.
The ratification referendum
was a drawing card for the
largest vote in the history of
the ASUC, and the proposed con
stitution was not ratified by a
substantial margin.
Peculiar Situation
The defeat of the proposed
constitution leaves the students
at UC in a peculiar situation;
they want more voice in the
decisions relevant to student
government and education, but
are unable, because of adminis
trational intrepidness, to do any
thing more than protest the sit
uation. (Practice makes per
fect.)
A situation similar to the one
,at Berkeley ocurred here at
Stanford last week. Stanford
students, however, being infin
itely more intelligent than their

Cal counterparts, saw a quick
and simple solution. They elect
ed Dave Harris ASSU President.
There is a beauty in the Stan
ford solution to the problem
which should not be overlooked.
Not only does it provide a front
man to do the student's protest
ing for them, but if for some
reason the Administration at
the Farm should be slow to re
act to the pressure for change,
the students have a ready-made
scapegoat.
Brilliant Strategy
Harris is already on record
as saying that he will resign if,
for any reason, he is unable to
carry out his campaign prom
ises. This statement was a mas
terful stroke of strategy on Har
ris' part. If for any reason he
should resign the unifying ef
fect that his action will have on
student dissatisfaction will be
tremendous.
The regular ASUC election is
coming up at Berkeley; new stu
dent body officers are to be
elected for the coming year. The
answer to this new (sic) diffi
culty at UC is a simple one to
find. The student body must
elect a president who is sworn,
upon pain of resignation, to pro
test for the student's rights.
Liberal In The House?
UC, with a registration in ex
cess of 26,000, must have at
least one "flaming liberal" who
is dedicated to his ideals, and
is not just protesting in an at
tempt to pollute the atmosphere.
There must be one person who
is willing to act in behalf of the
combined consciences of his fel
low students.
There is only one obstacle in
the path of this solution—Slate.
Slate is a political organization
dedicated to the proposition that
it is always right in the area of
student politics. What is even
more disturbing is the fast that
the students at UC seem to be
lieve that Slate is infallible.
Every Slate proposition since
1957 has eventually been accept
ed by the student body.
Slate To Withdraw
Slate is upset, however, by its
defeat in last week's refer
endum. Its members have vowed
to withdraw from all campus
politics for the remainder of this
academic year. Immediate re
action to such a withdrawal by
the uninitiated usually takes
the form of a question: "What
do they expect to acomplish that
way?"
Slate expects to accomplish a
great deal. Not only is it with
drawing from campus politics,
but it is also campaigning activ
ely against the upcoming ASUC
election. The true significance
of this action cannot be under
stood without, knowing that
Slate holds all but eight seats in
the UC Senate.
Illegitimacy is the watchword
of the current Slate campaign.
By withdrawing from all cam
pus politics it hopes to sound
that activity's death knell.
It must appear to all that
Slate is not using its head—
only its mouth. Many of its
gripes are legitimate and even
the administration has admitted
that there is a need for change.
The solution is obvious, even
for Cal students.
Harris Available
Dave Harris, if he honors his
campaign pledge to resign, will
only be in office here at Stan
ford for two weeks. After that
he will find himself frustrated
in his hopes of making Stanford
an educational institution. He
would surely like to try his
hand at turning UC into such
an institution. Why not give him
the chance?
In the meanwhile Stanford
students must begin to realize
that they no longer have to look
to the north for guidelines in
liberalism. Apathy is dead on
the Farm. (Would you believe
dying?)
We have shown the way out
of what is becoming a very tick
lish situation on many college
campuses. By the numbers now,
let's pat ourselves on the back.

the path of this solution—Slate.
Slate is a political organization
dedicated to the proposition that
it is always right in the area of
student politics. What is even
more disturbing is the fast that
the students at UC seem to be
lieve that Slate is infallible.
Every Slate proposition since
1957 has eventually been accept
ed by the student body.
Slate To Withdraw
Slate is upset, however, by its
defeat in last week's refer
endum. Its members have vowed
to withdraw from all campus
politics for the remainder of this
academic year. Immediate re
action to such a withdrawal by
the uninitiated usually takes
the form of a question: "What
do they expect to acomplish that
way?"
Slate expects to accomplish a
great deal. Not only is it with
drawing from campus politics,
but it is also campaigning activ
ely against the upcoming ASUC
election. The true significance
of this action cannot be under
stood without, knowing that
Slate holds all but eight seats in
the UC Senate.
Illegitimacy is the watchword
of the current Slate campaign.
By withdrawing from all cam
pus politics it hopes to sound
that activity's death knell.
It must appear to all that
Slate is not using its head—
only its mouth. Many of its
gripes are legitimate and even
the administration has admitted
that there is a need for change.
The solution is obvious, even
for Cal students.
Harris Available
Dave Harris, if he honors his
campaign pledge to resign, will
only be in office here at Stan
ford for two weeks. After that
he will find himself frustrated
in his hopes of making Stanford
an educational institution. He
would surely like to try his
hand at turning UC into such
an institution. Why not give him
the chance?
In the meanwhile Stanford
students must begin to realize
that they no longer have to look
to the north for guidelines in
liberalism. Apathy is dead on
the Farm. (Would you believe
dying?)
We have shown the way out
of what is becoming a very tick
lish situation on many college
campuses. By the numbers now,
let's pat ourselves on the back.
Rumor has it that students
at the University of California
at Berkeley are disgruntled with
their role in educational decision
making.
In any event last week saw
Slate, a political group that
always runs a slate of candi
dates, and the GCC attempt to
ratify a new ASUC constitution
which would have allowed the
students at Berkeley a greater
say in the decision-making of
the school.
The ratification referendum
was a drawing card for the
largest vote in the history of
the ASUC, and the proposed con
stitution was not ratified by a
substantial margin.
Peculiar Situation
The defeat of the proposed
constitution leaves the students
at UC in a peculiar situation;
they want more voice in the
decisions relevant to student
government and education, but
are unable, because of adminis
trational intrepidness, to do any
thing more than protest the sit
uation. (Practice makes per
fect.)
A situation similar to the one
,at Berkeley ocurred here at
Stanford last week. Stanford
students, however, being infin
itely more intelligent than their

Cal counterparts, saw a quick
and simple solution. They elect
ed Dave Harris ASSU President.
There is a beauty in the Stan
ford solution to the problem
which should not be overlooked.
Not only does it provide a front
man to do the student's protest
ing for them, but if for some
reason the Administration at
the Farm should be slow to re
act to the pressure for change,
the students have a ready-made
scapegoat.
Brilliant Strategy
Harris is already on record
as saying that he will resign if,
for any reason, he is unable to
carry out his campaign prom
ises. This statement was a mas
terful stroke of strategy on Har
ris' part. If for any reason he
should resign the unifying ef
fect that his action will have on
student dissatisfaction will be
tremendous.
The regular ASUC election is
coming up at Berkeley; new stu
dent body officers are to be
elected for the coming year. The
answer to this new (sic) diffi
culty at UC is a simple one to
find. The student body must
elect a president who is sworn,
upon pain of resignation, to pro
test for the student's rights.
Liberal In The House?
UC, with a registration in ex
cess of 26,000, must have at
least one "flaming liberal" who
is dedicated to his ideals, and
is not just protesting in an at
tempt to pollute the atmosphere.
There must be one person who
is willing to act in behalf of the
combined consciences of his fel
low students.

Peculiar Situation
The defeat of the proposed
constitution leaves the students
at UC in a peculiar situation;
they want more voice in the
decisions relevant to student
government and education, but
are unable, because of adminis
trational intrepidness, to do any
thing more than protest the sit
uation. (Practice makes per
fect.)
A situation similar to the one
,at Berkeley ocurred here at
Stanford last week. Stanford
students, however, being infin
itely more intelligent than their

Cal counterparts, saw a quick
and simple solution. They elect
ed Dave Harris ASSU President.
There is a beauty in the Stan
ford solution to the problem
which should not be overlooked.
Not only does it provide a front
man to do the student's protest
ing for them, but if for some
reason the Administration at
the Farm should be slow to re
act to the pressure for change,
the students have a ready-made
scapegoat.
Brilliant Strategy
Harris is already on record
as saying that he will resign if,
for any reason, he is unable to
carry out his campaign prom
ises. This statement was a mas
terful stroke of strategy on Har
ris' part. If for any reason he
should resign the unifying ef
fect that his action will have on
student dissatisfaction will be
tremendous.
The regular ASUC election is
coming up at Berkeley; new stu
dent body officers are to be
elected for the coming year. The
answer to this new (sic) diffi
culty at UC is a simple one to
find. The student body must
elect a president who is sworn,
upon pain of resignation, to pro
test for the student's rights.
Liberal In The House?
UC, with a registration in ex
cess of 26,000, must have at
least one "flaming liberal" who
is dedicated to his ideals, and
is not just protesting in an at
tempt to pollute the atmosphere.
There must be one person who
is willing to act in behalf of the
combined consciences of his fel
low students.
There is only one obstacle in
the path of this solution—Slate.
Slate is a political organization
dedicated to the proposition that
it is always right in the area of
student politics. What is even
more disturbing is the fast that
the students at UC seem to be
lieve that Slate is infallible.
Every Slate proposition since
1957 has eventually been accept
ed by the student body.
Slate To Withdraw
Slate is upset, however, by its
defeat in last week's refer
endum. Its members have vowed
to withdraw from all campus
politics for the remainder of this
academic year. Immediate re
action to such a withdrawal by
the uninitiated usually takes
the form of a question: "What
do they expect to acomplish that
way?"
Slate expects to accomplish a
great deal. Not only is it with
drawing from campus politics,
but it is also campaigning activ
ely against the upcoming ASUC
election. The true significance
of this action cannot be under
stood without, knowing that
Slate holds all but eight seats in
the UC Senate.
Illegitimacy is the watchword
of the current Slate campaign.
By withdrawing from all cam
pus politics it hopes to sound
that activity's death knell.
It must appear to all that
Slate is not using its head—
only its mouth. Many of its
gripes are legitimate and even
the administration has admitted
that there is a need for change.
The solution is obvious, even
for Cal students.
Harris Available
Dave Harris, if he honors his
campaign pledge to resign, will
only be in office here at Stan
ford for two weeks. After that
he will find himself frustrated
in his hopes of making Stanford
an educational institution. He
would surely like to try his
hand at turning UC into such
an institution. Why not give him
the chance?
In the meanwhile Stanford
students must begin to realize
that they no longer have to look
to the north for guidelines in
liberalism. Apathy is dead on
the Farm. (Would you believe
dying?)
We have shown the way out
of what is becoming a very tick
lish situation on many college
campuses. By the numbers now,
let's pat ourselves on the back.
Rumor has it that students
at the University of California
at Berkeley are disgruntled with
their role in educational decision
making.
In any event last week saw
Slate, a political group that
always runs a slate of candi
dates, and the GCC attempt to
ratify a new ASUC constitution
which would have allowed the
students at Berkeley a greater
say in the decision-making of
the school.
The ratification referendum
was a drawing card for the
largest vote in the history of
the ASUC, and the proposed con
stitution was not ratified by a
substantial margin.
