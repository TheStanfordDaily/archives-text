# ROTC Withdraws Blood-Drive Points
## 
### 
Whether or not Stanford ROTC
cadets participated i"n the recent
campus blood drive will have "ab
solutely no effect" on their academic
grades, Col. David Y. Nanney said
yesterday.
Executive head of the Department
of Military Science, Col. Nanney
gave his views in a letter to President
Wallace Sterling.

One ROTC class instructor previ
ously had indicated that leadership
credits might be given cadets for do
nation to the blood drive, which was
conducted last month.
Col. Nanney said, "It is unfortunate
that a member of his department dis
cussed giving leadership merit points
to those who participated in this
drive, but perhaps may be under

standable in view of his recent as
signment to Vietnam."
Nanney's statements yesterday con
trasted with remarks he made last
month in an interview with The
Daily.
"It's okay with me," he said in ref
erence to the incident. "We have aca
demic freedom here, and I don't care
what the instructor wants to do."
