# SCPV Starts Redwood City Vigil To Protest Undemocratic Action
## 
### 
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam began a protest vigil at
the Redwood City napalm plant at 8
o'clock this morning.
"The democratic process is being
thwarted in Redwood City," said
SCPV chairman Cyril Sia yesterday,
"and the vigil will be a protest as
much against the breakdown of
democracy as agaist the production
of napalm by United Technology
Center."
The petition asking for a referen
dum on the napalm issue was sub
mitted with 3,700 signatures on April

20 to Redwood City Clerk Helen
Moore. She has not yet acknowledged
receipt of these names, although the
city charter requires her to verify
whether the signatures are adequate
and authentic within ten days. Ten
percent of the voters of Redwood
City (2400) must sign a petition to
initiate a referendum.
Issue's Validity Questioned
City Attorney Gardella has said
that the city charter will not allow
the matter to be put to a public vote.
However, Dennis Woodman, attorney
for the Redwood City Committee

Against Napalm, insists that the ap
proval of the lease of port land to
United Technology Center by the
Board of Port Commissioners is a
valid referendum issue.
The SCPV vigil will continue until
May 28, when Bay Area peace groups
will stage a massive demonstration
in Redwood City, unless the courts
first issue an injunction restraining
UTC napalm production until after
the referendum.
The SCPV urges all its members to
join the vigil in four-hour shifts
around the clock. Students may meet
at 2 p.m. today at the SCPV desk in
the ASSU office for rides to Redwood
City.
Brooklyn Fights Napalm
As a result of SCPV's attempts to
make the napalm protest nationwide,
a group called Citizens' Committee
Against Napalm was recently or
ganized in Brooklyn. It picketed the
annual meeting of Witco Chemical
Corporation April 17.
SCPV hopes to coordinate peace
groups in the Los Angeles area to
take action soon against Dow Chemi
cal Corporation, makers of Napalm-B
in Torrance, California.
