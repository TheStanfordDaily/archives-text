# Rabbi Barred From Services
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
Rabbi Charles Familant has been
denied permission to conduct sabbath
services on campus.
The University, in announcing its
action yesterday, re-affirmed its pol
icy of allowing denominational wor
ship services only in Memorial
Church. The rabbi, Stanford Hillel di
rector, has refused to use the build
ing ever since the new religious pol
icy allowing sectarian worship was
declared by the Trustees in February.
The rabbi made his request in re
sponse to an announcement made two
days ago allowing interim implemen
tation of sectarian worship and mak
ing public a two-week old agreement
authorizing Jewish students to con
duct daily kaddish services in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
A University spokesman yesterday
declined to comment on whether the
kaddish services, which have been
held in the Clubhouse since April 18,
constitute denominational worship on
campus.
Trustees Limit Worship
The statement released by the Uni
versity yesterday stated that "Rabbi
Familant cannot participate in wor

ship services in any other worship
facility but Memorial Church because
of the explicit limitation in the Feb
ruary Trustees resolution which spec
ifies denominational worship at Stan
ford may be conducted only within
the Church."
"While the University was prepared
to authorize informal assembly of
Jewish students for the purpose of
private prayer," the statement con
tinued, "we simply cannot authorize
Rabbi Familant to conduct sabbath
services outside Memorial Church.
Such a service would obviously vio
late the intention of the Trustee reso
lution."
The criterion on which the prayer
services are designated as informal is
that no ordained clergyman is pres
ent.
"The distinction between informal
and formal prayer is unknown within
the framework of Jewish theology,"
Rabbi Familant told The Daily yes
terday."And to describe the daily
Jewish service as private is a false
description because no one who wish
es to participate is refused.
Non-Jewish Participation
Several non-Jewish students have
taken part in the services, which are

announced in The Daily's Once
Around the Quad section.
Responding to yesterday's develop
ments, Prof. Lewis Spitz, acting
chairman of the Presidential Commit
tee on Religious Activities, called a
meeting of the Committee for next
Wednesday to discuss the matter of
Jewish worship.
Professor of Religion Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, a Committee member,
plans to submit a resolution to the
committee urging that arrangements
be made for Jewish services outside
Memorial Church.
"We must see that provisions are
made for worship outside Memorial
Church for those groups to whom the
building poses theological or liturgi
cal problems," Brown said yesterday.
Rabbi Familant's stand has the sup
port of the other campus denomina
tional ministers. "There is a clear
consensus," Rev. James Carson, lead
er of the ministers' group, told The
Daily yesterday. "No one will take
advantage of the opportunity to hold
services on campus until adequate
provision is made for the Jewish
members of the community.
"I could not exercise in good con
science any freedom extended by the

Trustees," he continued, "as long as
arrangements are not made for Rabbi
Familant and the Jewish students to
have equal freedom."
The issue of worship for the Jews
derives from the declaration of the
Board of Trustees last February that
"arrangements be made for the vari
ous denominations to hold worship
services on a regular schedule in Me
morial Church."
Rabbi Familant and the Jewish stu
dents have since then maintained that
it is "impossible to worship within
the sanctuary because the Christian
symbols there help create an atmos
phere incompatible with the spirit
which ought to be generated in a Jew
ish worship service."
It has been suggested that the Jews
use the Memorial Church choir room.
"To strengthen this proposal," the
rabbi said yesterday, "some have
drawn a parallel between the present
situation and that of Jewish service
men worshiping in chapels on mili
tary bases. The situation is not paral
lel because the present choice is be
tween worshiping in Memorial
Church or off campus, whereas in
the army it is between the chapel and
some other location on the base."
No Wedding Analogy
The rabbi also discounted the argu
ment that because Jewish weddings
have been held in the Church, regular
worship services should be held there
too. "There is an important distinc
tion to be made," he said. "In the case
of wedding ceremonies, the students
have voluntarily agreed to use the
Church. But in the case of holding
general Jewish worship services, it
would not be a voluntary act for all."
"They have not been asked if they
want to use the Church as were the
participants in the wedding cere
mony. In fact, many have stated ex
plicity that they would not worship
in the Church.
"Therefore, any agreement on my
part to accept the sanctuary or choir
room as a place for services would
not entail an agreement from the
Jewish students who are vitally con
cerned."
"I am both happy and sad by the
state of affairs that has developed
this week," he said.
•Sympathetic' Administration
"I am happy because the decision
to allow [daily kaddish] services to oc
cur on campus indicates the adminis
tration is sympathetic to the religious
needs of Jewish students."
"I am sad because I am unable to
find any justifiable criterion — not
even one—for making a distinction
between the daily services and sab
bath services. I want to make it clear
that an ordained rabbi need not be
present at a sabbath service."
"There is no qualitative difference
in the eyes of Judaism between the
two types of service. We don't have
such things as prayer meetings. The
liturgies recited at both services are
essentially the same.

"To strengthen this proposal," the
rabbi said yesterday, "some have
drawn a parallel between the present
situation and that of Jewish service
men worshiping in chapels on mili
tary bases. The situation is not paral
lel because the present choice is be
tween worshiping in Memorial
Church or off campus, whereas in
the army it is between the chapel and
some other location on the base."
No Wedding Analogy
The rabbi also discounted the argu
ment that because Jewish weddings
have been held in the Church, regular
worship services should be held there
too. "There is an important distinc
tion to be made," he said. "In the case
of wedding ceremonies, the students
have voluntarily agreed to use the
Church. But in the case of holding
general Jewish worship services, it
would not be a voluntary act for all."
"They have not been asked if they
want to use the Church as were the
participants in the wedding cere
mony. In fact, many have stated ex
plicity that they would not worship
in the Church.
"Therefore, any agreement on my
part to accept the sanctuary or choir
room as a place for services would
not entail an agreement from the
Jewish students who are vitally con
cerned."
"I am both happy and sad by the
state of affairs that has developed
this week," he said.
•Sympathetic' Administration
"I am happy because the decision
to allow [daily kaddish] services to oc
cur on campus indicates the adminis
tration is sympathetic to the religious
needs of Jewish students."
"I am sad because I am unable to
find any justifiable criterion — not
even one—for making a distinction
between the daily services and sab
bath services. I want to make it clear
that an ordained rabbi need not be
present at a sabbath service."
"There is no qualitative difference
in the eyes of Judaism between the
two types of service. We don't have
such things as prayer meetings. The
liturgies recited at both services are
essentially the same.
Rabbi Charles Familant has been
denied permission to conduct sabbath
services on campus.
The University, in announcing its
action yesterday, re-affirmed its pol
icy of allowing denominational wor
ship services only in Memorial
Church. The rabbi, Stanford Hillel di
rector, has refused to use the build
ing ever since the new religious pol
icy allowing sectarian worship was
declared by the Trustees in February.
The rabbi made his request in re
sponse to an announcement made two
days ago allowing interim implemen
tation of sectarian worship and mak
ing public a two-week old agreement
authorizing Jewish students to con
duct daily kaddish services in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
A University spokesman yesterday
declined to comment on whether the
kaddish services, which have been
held in the Clubhouse since April 18,
constitute denominational worship on
campus.
Trustees Limit Worship
The statement released by the Uni
versity yesterday stated that "Rabbi
Familant cannot participate in wor

ship services in any other worship
facility but Memorial Church because
of the explicit limitation in the Feb
ruary Trustees resolution which spec
ifies denominational worship at Stan
ford may be conducted only within
the Church."
"While the University was prepared
to authorize informal assembly of
Jewish students for the purpose of
private prayer," the statement con
tinued, "we simply cannot authorize
Rabbi Familant to conduct sabbath
services outside Memorial Church.
Such a service would obviously vio
late the intention of the Trustee reso
lution."
The criterion on which the prayer
services are designated as informal is
that no ordained clergyman is pres
ent.
"The distinction between informal
and formal prayer is unknown within
the framework of Jewish theology,"
Rabbi Familant told The Daily yes
terday."And to describe the daily
Jewish service as private is a false
description because no one who wish
es to participate is refused.
Non-Jewish Participation
Several non-Jewish students have
taken part in the services, which are

announced in The Daily's Once
Around the Quad section.
Responding to yesterday's develop
ments, Prof. Lewis Spitz, acting
chairman of the Presidential Commit
tee on Religious Activities, called a
meeting of the Committee for next
Wednesday to discuss the matter of
Jewish worship.
Professor of Religion Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, a Committee member,
plans to submit a resolution to the
committee urging that arrangements
be made for Jewish services outside
Memorial Church.
"We must see that provisions are
made for worship outside Memorial
Church for those groups to whom the
building poses theological or liturgi
cal problems," Brown said yesterday.
Rabbi Familant's stand has the sup
port of the other campus denomina
tional ministers. "There is a clear
consensus," Rev. James Carson, lead
er of the ministers' group, told The
Daily yesterday. "No one will take
advantage of the opportunity to hold
services on campus until adequate
provision is made for the Jewish
members of the community.
"I could not exercise in good con
science any freedom extended by the

Trustees," he continued, "as long as
arrangements are not made for Rabbi
Familant and the Jewish students to
have equal freedom."
The issue of worship for the Jews
derives from the declaration of the
Board of Trustees last February that
"arrangements be made for the vari
ous denominations to hold worship
services on a regular schedule in Me
morial Church."
Rabbi Familant and the Jewish stu
dents have since then maintained that
it is "impossible to worship within
the sanctuary because the Christian
symbols there help create an atmos
phere incompatible with the spirit
which ought to be generated in a Jew
ish worship service."
It has been suggested that the Jews

Rabbi Familant told The Daily yes
terday."And to describe the daily
Jewish service as private is a false
description because no one who wish
es to participate is refused.
Non-Jewish Participation
Several non-Jewish students have
taken part in the services, which are

announced in The Daily's Once
Around the Quad section.
Responding to yesterday's develop
ments, Prof. Lewis Spitz, acting
chairman of the Presidential Commit
tee on Religious Activities, called a
meeting of the Committee for next
Wednesday to discuss the matter of
Jewish worship.
Professor of Religion Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, a Committee member,
plans to submit a resolution to the
committee urging that arrangements
be made for Jewish services outside
Memorial Church.
"We must see that provisions are
made for worship outside Memorial
Church for those groups to whom the
building poses theological or liturgi
cal problems," Brown said yesterday.
Rabbi Familant's stand has the sup
port of the other campus denomina
tional ministers. "There is a clear
consensus," Rev. James Carson, lead
er of the ministers' group, told The
Daily yesterday. "No one will take
advantage of the opportunity to hold
services on campus until adequate
provision is made for the Jewish
members of the community.
"I could not exercise in good con
science any freedom extended by the

Trustees," he continued, "as long as
arrangements are not made for Rabbi
Familant and the Jewish students to
have equal freedom."
The issue of worship for the Jews
derives from the declaration of the
Board of Trustees last February that
"arrangements be made for the vari
ous denominations to hold worship
services on a regular schedule in Me
morial Church."
Rabbi Familant and the Jewish stu
dents have since then maintained that
it is "impossible to worship within
the sanctuary because the Christian
symbols there help create an atmos
phere incompatible with the spirit
which ought to be generated in a Jew
ish worship service."
It has been suggested that the Jews
use the Memorial Church choir room.
"To strengthen this proposal," the
rabbi said yesterday, "some have
drawn a parallel between the present
situation and that of Jewish service
men worshiping in chapels on mili
tary bases. The situation is not paral
lel because the present choice is be
tween worshiping in Memorial
Church or off campus, whereas in
the army it is between the chapel and
some other location on the base."
No Wedding Analogy
The rabbi also discounted the argu
ment that because Jewish weddings
have been held in the Church, regular
worship services should be held there
too. "There is an important distinc
tion to be made," he said. "In the case
of wedding ceremonies, the students
have voluntarily agreed to use the
Church. But in the case of holding
general Jewish worship services, it
would not be a voluntary act for all."
"They have not been asked if they
want to use the Church as were the
participants in the wedding cere
mony. In fact, many have stated ex
plicity that they would not worship
in the Church.
"Therefore, any agreement on my
part to accept the sanctuary or choir
room as a place for services would
not entail an agreement from the
Jewish students who are vitally con
cerned."
"I am both happy and sad by the
state of affairs that has developed
this week," he said.
•Sympathetic' Administration
"I am happy because the decision
to allow [daily kaddish] services to oc
cur on campus indicates the adminis
tration is sympathetic to the religious
needs of Jewish students."
"I am sad because I am unable to
find any justifiable criterion — not
even one—for making a distinction
between the daily services and sab
bath services. I want to make it clear
that an ordained rabbi need not be
present at a sabbath service."
"There is no qualitative difference
in the eyes of Judaism between the
two types of service. We don't have
such things as prayer meetings. The
liturgies recited at both services are
essentially the same.
Rabbi Charles Familant has been
denied permission to conduct sabbath
services on campus.
The University, in announcing its
action yesterday, re-affirmed its pol
icy of allowing denominational wor
ship services only in Memorial
Church. The rabbi, Stanford Hillel di
rector, has refused to use the build
ing ever since the new religious pol
icy allowing sectarian worship was
declared by the Trustees in February.
The rabbi made his request in re
sponse to an announcement made two
days ago allowing interim implemen
tation of sectarian worship and mak
ing public a two-week old agreement
authorizing Jewish students to con
duct daily kaddish services in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
A University spokesman yesterday
declined to comment on whether the
kaddish services, which have been
held in the Clubhouse since April 18,
constitute denominational worship on
campus.
Trustees Limit Worship
The statement released by the Uni
versity yesterday stated that "Rabbi
Familant cannot participate in wor

ship services in any other worship
facility but Memorial Church because
of the explicit limitation in the Feb
ruary Trustees resolution which spec
ifies denominational worship at Stan
ford may be conducted only within
the Church."
"While the University was prepared
to authorize informal assembly of
Jewish students for the purpose of
private prayer," the statement con
tinued, "we simply cannot authorize
Rabbi Familant to conduct sabbath
services outside Memorial Church.
Such a service would obviously vio
late the intention of the Trustee reso
lution."
The criterion on which the prayer
services are designated as informal is
that no ordained clergyman is pres
ent.
"The distinction between informal
and formal prayer is unknown within
the framework of Jewish theology,"
Rabbi Familant told The Daily yes
terday."And to describe the daily
Jewish service as private is a false
