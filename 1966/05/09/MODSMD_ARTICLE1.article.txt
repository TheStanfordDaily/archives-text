# Linear Accelerator Nears Completion Date
## 
### PAT McMAHON (First in a series 
Nestled among the Stanford foot
hills, south of the Sand Hill Road,
lies the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center which, upon completion, will
be the largest and most powerful
electron linear accelerator ever built.
Nearly all of the construction is
now complete; most of the buildings
are already occupied and fully land
scaped. The basic architectural pat
tern is reminiscent of the Quad. Par
ticularly outstanding are the colo
naded arches and the red tile roofs.
The accelerator and the equipment
necessary to operate are in two paral
lel housings, the tunnel containing
the accelerator proper buried twenty
five feet below the ground level. The
associated equipment, for the proper
operation of the accelerator to main
tain the exacting standards required
are housed in a gallery at ground
level, where the controls can be easily
regulated.
purposes
In performing physics research, it
is desirable to work with high energy
particles. The accelerators act as the
means to raise the particles to the
higher energy level.
They serve two purposes. First,
they act as giant microscopes, in that
they enable scientists to study parti
cles which are a billion times smaller

than he can examine with an optical
microscope. Accelerators can also
create new particles. Since energy
and mass are different forms of the
same thing, accelerators can create
any of the particles now known
There are generally two types of
accelerators, those which accelerate
electrons and those which accelerate
heavier particles such as protons and
ilpha particles. Falling under the
category of "atom-smashers," there
are many kinds of accelerators in
cluding cyclotrons, betatrons, syn
chrotrons, and linear accelerators.
With the exception of the linear ac
celerator, the others generally ac
celerate heavier particles and are
round machines.
Stanford Pioneers
Stanford was a pioneer in work with
the linear accelerator. When work
with atom-smashers began, the ac
celerators were of the round type. It
was discovered then that electrons
could not be raised in energy to a
very high level with the round ma
chine, so electron acceleration was
ignored until Stanford physicists be
gan research on the problem.
In the accelerator the electrons
travel through a copper pipe by rid
ing on the crests of a powerful radio
wave. This principle was developed
here by the late Professor W. W. Han
sen. The energy of the electron is

taken from the radio waves which
are constantly reinforced from suc
cessive klystron tubes. Klystrons are
essentially tubes which amplify the
high power radio waves.
The new two mile facility will have
240 klystrons, each delivering pulses

of up to 24. million watts of micro
wave power to the accelerator pipe.
Driven forward by the waves, the
electrons will reach almost the speed
of light within a few feet. Thereafter,
the power input of the remaining
klystrons can do little to increase

their speed but it increases their
energy. At twenty billion volts, the
level at which SLAC will operate ini
tially the mass of an electron is 40,000
times greater than at the start of the
acceleration.
The accelerated electrons will then

strike a target and observations and
analyses are made of the resulting
creation of new particles. The knowl
edge gained from this process will
then lead to a better understanding
of the mysteries of the sub-nuclear
universe.
Atomic Energy Commission
SLAC was designed and is being
constructed by Stanford and will be
operated by the University. However,
the entire cost of the machine is be
ing footed by the Atomic Energy
Commission. The contract provides
that SLAC is "national facility" and
that the use of the machine will be
open to physicists from other coun
tries under special arrangement.
The contract further provides that
Stanford has the responsibility to pro
gram the research use of the national
facility. Stanford has also contributed
the 480 acres on which SLAC is built.
The land is leased to the government
for one dollar per year, for a period
of 150 years.
SLAC Director Professor W.K.H.
Panofsky, has summed up the need
for this accelerator when he said,
"When spending money on fundamen
tal research that may change our
whole way of looking at nature, the
question of need is premature. We
cannot afford to be ignorant of the
most fundamental type of structure
on which everything else depends."
