Stanford History Department
Chairman Otis Pease informed
the Daily yesterday that the
Basic Seminar Program (Daily,
May 6) will not be taught ex
clusively by history instructors.
The Department anticipates
that in a normal year, between
one-fourth and one-third of the
seminats will be taught by De
partment members above the
rank of instructor, with the ra
tion increasing to one-half in
the next two years.
