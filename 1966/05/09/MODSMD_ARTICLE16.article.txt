# Swingin' Easy
## Music Sets Relaxed Mood 
### AARON ROSS 
C o 01, relaxed, easygoing,
that's the mood set by Vince
Guaraldi at the Sunday concert
for the Convalescent Home.
Vince first gained recognition in
1960 with his album "Black Or
pheus", taking the sound track
from that movie and setting it
to jazz.
I'm sorry to say, Vince's music
hasn't changed much from those
days; he still uses many of the
same compositional formulas to
day. His solos are sometimes in
teresting, but on the whole are
filled with standard cliches.
I don't mean to say that he's
a prostitute, just that he's safe.
He sticks to the security blanket
that brought him fame and for
tune. This is sad because he's
a very talented and capable
musician. Someday, I hope he
shows it.
Vince, for the past few years
has featured a guitarist. The
first was 8010 Sete, who was
such a success, he took off on
his own. More recently, he's
been featuring George Morel, a
semi-classical guitarist from

Buenos Aires, Argentina, a very
fine tenician who has brought
a refreshing change of pace.
"You've heard my voice and
you know my name." These are
the beginning lyrics of Glenn
Yarborough's first song. A man
with a good voice and a great
deal of feeling. Yarborough is
not the "standard type folk
singer," but he carries many of
the same messages popular to
day through necessity.
It was interesting that some
of the introduction lines
to his songs were melody ilnes
from the freedom movement.
Along with being a good singer,
he is also an excellent enter
tainer. He told jokes, sang the
Coca-Cola song that he did on
a commercial, and used the aud

ience as a chorus for a couple
of numbers.
Featured among Guaraldi's
selections were "Samba Orph
eus;" and a new composition,
"Rain, Rain, Go Away." Morel
did his own arrangement of clas
sical and popular Spanish songs
entitled Fantasia Espanol.
Yarborough appeared with a
combo made up of a piano, bass,
drums, and guitar.
The crowd seemed to enjoy
themselves and it appeared to
be a profitable day for Con
Home.
The best way to sum it up is
with these lyrics," . . . Some
times, when the world's gone
wrong and when you feel like
going away, listen to the cry of
a baby. One more round, man
kind, will you take it like a baby
does?"


1500 jazz enthusiasts packed Frost Amphitheater
yesterday afternoon to hear Vince Guaraldi and
Glenn Yarbroiitfh perform for the benefit of the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
