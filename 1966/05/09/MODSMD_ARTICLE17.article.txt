# Contemporary Drama Featured In One-Acts
## 
### ANNE BROPHY 
Ram's Head Spring One Acts
is presenting a trio of contem
porary plays providing a unique
blend of contemporary play
wrights, Tennessee Williams
"Ten Blocks on the Camino
Real" and two students' plays
will be staged.
Tickets are available at Tre
sidder Box Office for all four
performances of the plays open
ing on Wednesday at the Nitery.
The Nitery offers an extra di
mension to the contemporary
theater experience by the dra
matic proximity of the audience
to the actors. Intimare staging,
featured in performances of
"Lysistrata" and "Twelfth
Night" last quarter, highlight
the excitement of the drama.
Staging the One-Acts in The
Nitery was a show in itself. Ori
ginally a classroom, now used
during the day as a studio for
video-taping, The Nitery is
transformed for its "after five"
role; the walls are draped in
black, a light box is positioned,
the platform stage assembled
and risers installed. Tiers of
seats surround three sides of
the stage. Entrances and exits
conform to circular staging
techniques and contribute to au
dience involvement.

The trio of plays offer a di
versity of settings to stretch the
ingenuity of Technical Director
Jerry Smith and Lighting De
signer Bill Williams.
"Valparaiso" set in the bed
room of a man contemplating
suicide uses flashbacks to relate
the tensions and conflicts which
ultimately culminate in self-de
struction.
A granite fountain offers a
focal point in the staging of
"The Miracle Wolf of Gubbio,"
set in the midst of an Italian
University in 1300. The drama
delves into student discontent
on the eve of the Renaissance.
