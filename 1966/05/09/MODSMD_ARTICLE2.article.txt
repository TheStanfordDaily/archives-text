# Track Star's Future Hangs With Barber
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Stanford's frosh track team was
upset Saturday by the University of
California, ending their hopes for an
undefeated season.
The entire track team including the
varsity even though they won their
meet, however, was upset because of
a conflict that occurred earlier that
day. This conflict has been brewing
since the beginning of the year.
Freshman Pat Morrison, who was
scheduled to compete in five events

Saturday, was not allowed to make
the trip to Cal.
"Just A Trivial Thing"
Varsity track coach Payton Jordan,
who may not have formulated the fi
nal action but through which he ex
pressed his sentiments, was responsi
ble for not allowing Morrison to per
form. Morrison, who was extremely
disappointed because he was unable
to complete, commented that this
action resulted from "refusing to do
just a trivial thing as cutting my
hair."
Refusing to heed the request upon
boarding the team bus headed for Cal,
Morrison was told by Jordan that he
would not be allowed to represent
Stanford in the meet against the Cal
frosh.
Not only is the entire track team
disturbed by this "trival thing" but
so are Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Ath
letic Director, and numerous Stanford
alumni. The Bureau of Athletic Con
trol (BAC) feels that Morrison went
too far in his refusal to "trim his
hair."
Fight To Save Hair
The fight to save Morrison's hair
began first in a joking, carefree man
ner when Pat, who originates from
England, first arrived at Stanford.
The feeling was that Morrison would
outgrow the whole thing and come
to the decision himself to get his
hair cut.
But it wasn't settled that easily.
Coach Jordan finally took it upon
himself to request Morrison to trim
his hair. Morrison refused. The con
flict ensued. Outside pressures from
Chuck Taylor who was receiving
complaints from influential and, need
less to say, rich alumni made Jor
dan's task increasingly necessary.
These outside pressures only caused
the English import to take a firmer
stand concerning his personal
rights.
Discussed Problem
Morrison discussed the matter per
sonally with Chuck Taylor and nu
merous times with Jordan, but still
no change was made.
Then came the final action by Jor
dan on Saturday.
Morrison sympathizes with Jor
dan's position. "Payton has tried to
defend me up to now. But I still
don't feel that any coach or athletic
bureau should be omnipotent. A coach
has not right to impose an image on
an athlete that he is reluctant to ac
cept, especially if this image is en
tirely irrelevant to his performance.
This child-soldier image with its regi
mentation and quasi-indoctrination is
defunct and totally alien to me."
Morrison currently holds the frosh
record in the 100 and 220 with times
of 9.6 and 21.0. Originally, he applied
to Stanford for academic reasons. His
athletic abilities were discovered later
which resulted in his receiving an ath
letic scholarship.
Jordan Very Concerned
Coach Jordan also expressed con
cern regarding this unfortunate situa
tion but remained firm in his stand.
Jordan commented, "We haven't
asked him to cut all his hair off. All
I ask him is that he trim his side
burns and cut the hair on the bark
of his neck so that it isn't hanging
over the back of his clothes.
"He made the decision himself to
join the track team. No one made him
join. Therefore, he has to comply
with the rules of his membership."
Personally. Jordan enjoys coaching
Morrison. Morrison is a likeable fel
low and coachable. "But," as Coach
Jordan so adequately phrased it, "it's
a decision he must make for himself.
He is proud and willing to wear the
Stanford uniform, go on trips, and
accept the free meals.
"Therefore, he must realize that he
