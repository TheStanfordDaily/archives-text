# Ad Hoc Committee Replies To Heffner, Criticizes Statement As Contradictory
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
is the text of a reply by the Ad
Hoc Committee on Stanford and
National Security to Ass<xiate
Provost Hubert Heffner's state
ment on University research
policy which appeared in The
Daily May 5.)
We would like to organize
our response about 5 major
points: 1) student responsibility
for University decision-making,
2) the CIA contract itself, 3)
classified research in general,
4) the University and its rela
tions to government, and 5)
what ought to be done.
Mr. Heffner began his state
ment by suggesting that re
search policy is the prerogative
of the faculty and administra
tion and not of the students.
Community Of Scholars
In contrast, it is our view that
the University is a community
of scholars; each member of
the community is equally re
sponsible for and affected by
the sins and accomplishments of
the University.
We as students pay for, are
limited by, are influenced by,
and are morally implicated in all
classified research. We are af
fected and we are responsible,
and we therefore have the right
to an equal voice.
Our education does not occur
in the vaccuum of departments
or courses: we are educated in
the University community, a
community of scholars search
ing together after knowledge
and truth. We are not consum
ers in a supermarket but partici
pants in an educative process:
as participants we ask for our
share of decision-making pawer.
Within The Country?
The particular contract which
Mr. Heffner defends is a CIA
contract for the Electrical En
gineering department. Mr. Hef
ner does not object to CIA con
tracts so long as they "contrib
ute to the function of the Uni
versity" and involve "no activity
outside of the United States."
We ask these question:
• Since the CIA cannot leg
ally operate within the US, how
can any CIA contract not in
volve overseas activities? In
particular, since the Electrical
Engineering department cannot
be doing analysis of, say, Chi
nese policy, how can this re
search be viewed as national and
beneficent? Does it not neces
sarily invilve the weapons of
espionage, perhaps illegal es
pionage, within the US?
• How can any classified, mil
itary contract "contribute to the
functions of the University"? Is
not the University an education
institution? What is the rela
tion between education and sec
recy Between free inquiry and
secrecy?
Mr. Heffner's position on

classified contracts is that he
does not see how he can in good
conscience impose his views on
any member of the faculty: The
morality of a scholar's research
is the primary responsibility of
the scholar himself."
We have two replies.
First, Mr. Heffner's argument
seems to us a recourse to form
which hides the facts of the
freedoms involved. That is, Mr.
Heffner is advocating not aca
demic freedom but academic
anarchy.
It is of course true that mur
derers are ultimately respons
ible to themselves, but we never
theless prevent murderers from
committing crimes, if we can.
We put stop signs on street
corners to prevent accidents;
this may limit the freedom of
the individual to drive as he
sees fit, but it in fact ensures
the freedom of movement of the
community.
In the same way, restriction
on secrecy limits the individual
from doing as he pleases, but
it insures the freedom of in
quiry in the community as a
whole. We do not live isolated
lives, and freedom is not there
fore equal to anarchy.
Second, Mr. Heffner himself
has stated that the University,
that is to say Mr. Heffner, has
jstopped contracts when they
limited freedom of publication."
If he is willing to stop con
tracts for this reason, why is
he not willing to stop contracts
if they involve murder, or if
they limit freedom of inquiry?
Further, is it not true that all
classified contracts limit free
dom of inquiry, a freedom
larger than freedom of publica
tion, and should the University
not defend the right to freedom
of inquiry categorically and in
all cases?
War Involvement
Mr. Heffner has stated that
the University has 13 classified
contracts, eleven in electrical en
gineering. He says further that
since 1948, when the University
began taking classified con
tracts, the University has initi
ated 30 classified dissertation
theses.
These facts seem to us to
demonstrate clearly that the
University is involved in the war
policies of our government, that
it has subordinated the freedom
of inquiry within the University
to financial gain from question
able if not dirty contractors.
Mr. Heffner argues that some
classified research is very in
teresting. But this is no reason
why it should be kept from the
University and from the coun
try and that we should not tol
erate let alone cooperate with
such endeavors in a democratic
society.
Mr. Heffner seems willing to

abdicate the University's re
sponsibility to the society to
disseminate knowledge and to
act as guardian of civilized val
ues.
Secrecy, espionage, war, are
neither civilized nor morally de
fensible: there is no good reason
whatever that an educational
institution should cooperate
with men involved in such activ
ities.
We believe the University
ought to protest secrecy and
espionage whenever it can, not
cooperate or aid in the effort.
Contradictory
We find Mr. Heffner's state
emnt contradictory and basic
ally indefensible.
We are appalled at the lack
of response to classified re
search on the part of the fac
ulty, a lack of response which
seems to us a distressing in
stance of moral coarseness, and
to call on the Academic Council
to make their position clear im
mediately.
We further ask the Adminis
tration to:
• Permit no further classified
theses.
• Cancel forthwith all classi
fied contracts.
• Permit no further CIA con
tracts.
• Disclose the relations be
tween the trustees, particularly

those in the electronics indlstry,
and classified electronics re
search on this campus or at
SRI.
• Establish a committee of
faculty, students and an admin
istrator to supervise and hold

final decision-making power in
the future on all outside con
tracts. Such a structural charge
seems to us esential as a recog
nition that the entire scholarly
community participants in Uni
versity research.

Contradictory
We find Mr. Heffner's state
emnt contradictory and basic
ally indefensible.
We are appalled at the lack
of response to classified re
search on the part of the fac
ulty, a lack of response which
seems to us a distressing in
stance of moral coarseness, and
to call on the Academic Council
to make their position clear im
mediately.
We further ask the Adminis
tration to:
• Permit no further classified
theses.
• Cancel forthwith all classi
fied contracts.
• Permit no further CIA con
tracts.
• Disclose the relations be
tween the trustees, particularly

those in the electronics indlstry,
and classified electronics re
search on this campus or at
SRI.
• Establish a committee of
faculty, students and an admin

final decision-making power in
the future on all outside con

(Editor's note: The following
is the text of a reply by the Ad
Hoc Committee on Stanford and
National Security to Ass<xiate
Provost Hubert Heffner's state
ment on University research
policy which appeared in The
Daily May 5.)
We would like to organize
our response about 5 major
points: 1) student responsibility
for University decision-making,
2) the CIA contract itself, 3)
classified research in general,
4) the University and its rela
tions to government, and 5)
what ought to be done.
Mr. Heffner began his state
ment by suggesting that re
search policy is the prerogative
of the faculty and administra
tion and not of the students.
Community Of Scholars
In contrast, it is our view that
the University is a community
of scholars; each member of
the community is equally re
sponsible for and affected by
the sins and accomplishments of
the University.
We as students pay for, are
limited by, are influenced by,
and are morally implicated in all
classified research. We are af
fected and we are responsible,
and we therefore have the right
to an equal voice.
Our education does not occur
in the vaccuum of departments
or courses: we are educated in
the University community, a
community of scholars search
ing together after knowledge
and truth. We are not consum
ers in a supermarket but partici
pants in an educative process:
as participants we ask for our
share of decision-making pawer.
Within The Country?
The particular contract which
Mr. Heffner defends is a CIA
contract for the Electrical En
gineering department. Mr. Hef
ner does not object to CIA con
tracts so long as they "contrib
ute to the function of the Uni
versity" and involve "no activity
outside of the United States."
We ask these question:
• Since the CIA cannot leg
ally operate within the US, how
can any CIA contract not in
volve overseas activities? In
particular, since the Electrical
Engineering department cannot
be doing analysis of, say, Chi
nese policy, how can this re
search be viewed as national and
beneficent? Does it not neces
sarily invilve the weapons of
espionage, perhaps illegal es
pionage, within the US?
• How can any classified, mil
itary contract "contribute to the
functions of the University"? Is
not the University an education
institution? What is the rela
tion between education and sec
recy Between free inquiry and
secrecy?
Mr. Heffner's position on

classified contracts is that he
does not see how he can in good
conscience impose his views on
any member of the faculty: The
morality of a scholar's research
is the primary responsibility of
the scholar himself."
We have two replies.
First, Mr. Heffner's argument
seems to us a recourse to form
which hides the facts of the
freedoms involved. That is, Mr.
Heffner is advocating not aca
demic freedom but academic
anarchy.
It is of course true that mur
derers are ultimately respons
ible to themselves, but we never
theless prevent murderers from
committing crimes, if we can.
We put stop signs on street
corners to prevent accidents;
this may limit the freedom of
the individual to drive as he
sees fit, but it in fact ensures
the freedom of movement of the
community.
In the same way, restriction
on secrecy limits the individual
from doing as he pleases, but
it insures the freedom of in
quiry in the community as a
whole. We do not live isolated
lives, and freedom is not there
fore equal to anarchy.
Second, Mr. Heffner himself
has stated that the University,
that is to say Mr. Heffner, has
jstopped contracts when they
limited freedom of publication."
If he is willing to stop con
tracts for this reason, why is
he not willing to stop contracts
if they involve murder, or if
they limit freedom of inquiry?
Further, is it not true that all
classified contracts limit free
dom of inquiry, a freedom
larger than freedom of publica
tion, and should the University
not defend the right to freedom
of inquiry categorically and in
all cases?
War Involvement
Mr. Heffner has stated that
the University has 13 classified
contracts, eleven in electrical en
gineering. He says further that
since 1948, when the University
began taking classified con
tracts, the University has initi
ated 30 classified dissertation
theses.
These facts seem to us to
demonstrate clearly that the
University is involved in the war
policies of our government, that
it has subordinated the freedom
of inquiry within the University
to financial gain from question
able if not dirty contractors.
Mr. Heffner argues that some
classified research is very in
teresting. But this is no reason
why it should be kept from the
University and from the coun
try and that we should not tol
erate let alone cooperate with
such endeavors in a democratic
society.
Mr. Heffner seems willing to

abdicate the University's re
sponsibility to the society to
disseminate knowledge and to
act as guardian of civilized val
ues.
Secrecy, espionage, war, are
neither civilized nor morally de
fensible: there is no good reason
whatever that an educational
institution should cooperate
with men involved in such activ
ities.
We believe the University
ought to protest secrecy and
espionage whenever it can, not
cooperate or aid in the effort.

We find Mr. Heffner's state
emnt contradictory and basic

ated 30 classified dissertation
theses.
These facts seem to us to
demonstrate clearly that the
University is involved in the war
policies of our government, that
it has subordinated the freedom
of inquiry within the University
to financial gain from question
able if not dirty contractors.
Mr. Heffner argues that some
classified research is very in
teresting. But this is no reason
why it should be kept from the
University and from the coun
try and that we should not tol
erate let alone cooperate with
such endeavors in a democratic
society.
Mr. Heffner seems willing to

abdicate the University's re
sponsibility to the society to
disseminate knowledge and to
act as guardian of civilized val
ues.
Secrecy, espionage, war, are
neither civilized nor morally de
fensible: there is no good reason
whatever that an educational
institution should cooperate
with men involved in such activ
ities.
We believe the University
ought to protest secrecy and
espionage whenever it can, not
cooperate or aid in the effort.
Contradictory
We find Mr. Heffner's state
emnt contradictory and basic
ally indefensible.
We are appalled at the lack
of response to classified re
search on the part of the fac
ulty, a lack of response which
seems to us a distressing in
stance of moral coarseness, and
to call on the Academic Council
to make their position clear im
mediately.
We further ask the Adminis
tration to:
• Permit no further classified
theses.
• Cancel forthwith all classi
fied contracts.
• Permit no further CIA con
tracts.
• Disclose the relations be
tween the trustees, particularly

those in the electronics indlstry,
and classified electronics re
search on this campus or at
SRI.
• Establish a committee of
faculty, students and an admin
istrator to supervise and hold

final decision-making power in
the future on all outside con
tracts. Such a structural charge
seems to us esential as a recog
nition that the entire scholarly
community participants in Uni
versity research.
(Editor's note: The following
is the text of a reply by the Ad
Hoc Committee on Stanford and
National Security to Ass<xiate
Provost Hubert Heffner's state
ment on University research
policy which appeared in The
Daily May 5.)
We would like to organize
our response about 5 major
points: 1) student responsibility
for University decision-making,
2) the CIA contract itself, 3)
classified research in general,
4) the University and its rela
tions to government, and 5)
what ought to be done.
Mr. Heffner began his state
ment by suggesting that re
search policy is the prerogative
of the faculty and administra
tion and not of the students.
Community Of Scholars
In contrast, it is our view that
the University is a community
of scholars; each member of
the community is equally re
sponsible for and affected by
the sins and accomplishments of
the University.
We as students pay for, are
limited by, are influenced by,
and are morally implicated in all
classified research. We are af
fected and we are responsible,
and we therefore have the right
to an equal voice.
Our education does not occur
in the vaccuum of departments
or courses: we are educated in
the University community, a
community of scholars search
ing together after knowledge
and truth. We are not consum
ers in a supermarket but partici
pants in an educative process:
as participants we ask for our
share of decision-making pawer.
Within The Country?
The particular contract which
Mr. Heffner defends is a CIA
contract for the Electrical En
gineering department. Mr. Hef
ner does not object to CIA con
tracts so long as they "contrib
ute to the function of the Uni
versity" and involve "no activity
outside of the United States."
We ask these question:
• Since the CIA cannot leg
ally operate within the US, how
can any CIA contract not in
volve overseas activities? In
particular, since the Electrical
Engineering department cannot
be doing analysis of, say, Chi
nese policy, how can this re
search be viewed as national and
beneficent? Does it not neces
sarily invilve the weapons of
espionage, perhaps illegal es
pionage, within the US?
• How can any classified, mil
itary contract "contribute to the
functions of the University"? Is
not the University an education
institution? What is the rela
tion between education and sec
recy Between free inquiry and
secrecy?
Mr. Heffner's position on

classified contracts is that he
does not see how he can in good
conscience impose his views on
any member of the faculty: The
morality of a scholar's research
is the primary responsibility of
the scholar himself."
We have two replies.
First, Mr. Heffner's argument
seems to us a recourse to form
which hides the facts of the
freedoms involved. That is, Mr.
Heffner is advocating not aca
demic freedom but academic
anarchy.
It is of course true that mur
derers are ultimately respons
ible to themselves, but we never
theless prevent murderers from
committing crimes, if we can.
We put stop signs on street
corners to prevent accidents;
this may limit the freedom of
the individual to drive as he
sees fit, but it in fact ensures
the freedom of movement of the
community.
In the same way, restriction
on secrecy limits the individual
from doing as he pleases, but
it insures the freedom of in
quiry in the community as a
whole. We do not live isolated
lives, and freedom is not there
fore equal to anarchy.
Second, Mr. Heffner himself
has stated that the University,
that is to say Mr. Heffner, has
jstopped contracts when they
limited freedom of publication."
If he is willing to stop con
tracts for this reason, why is
he not willing to stop contracts
if they involve murder, or if
they limit freedom of inquiry?
Further, is it not true that all
classified contracts limit free
dom of inquiry, a freedom
larger than freedom of publica
tion, and should the University
not defend the right to freedom
of inquiry categorically and in
all cases?
War Involvement
Mr. Heffner has stated that
the University has 13 classified
contracts, eleven in electrical en
gineering. He says further that
since 1948, when the University
began taking classified con
tracts, the University has initi
ated 30 classified dissertation
theses.
These facts seem to us to
demonstrate clearly that the
University is involved in the war
policies of our government, that
it has subordinated the freedom
of inquiry within the University
to financial gain from question
able if not dirty contractors.
Mr. Heffner argues that some

from doing as he pleases, but
it insures the freedom of in
quiry in the community as a
whole. We do not live isolated
lives, and freedom is not there
fore equal to anarchy.
Second, Mr. Heffner himself
has stated that the University,
that is to say Mr. Heffner, has
jstopped contracts when they
limited freedom of publication."
If he is willing to stop con
tracts for this reason, why is
he not willing to stop contracts
if they involve murder, or if
they limit freedom of inquiry?
Further, is it not true that all
classified contracts limit free
dom of inquiry, a freedom
larger than freedom of publica
tion, and should the University
not defend the right to freedom
of inquiry categorically and in
all cases?
War Involvement
Mr. Heffner has stated that
the University has 13 classified
contracts, eleven in electrical en
gineering. He says further that
since 1948, when the University
began taking classified con
tracts, the University has initi
ated 30 classified dissertation
theses.
These facts seem to us to
demonstrate clearly that the
University is involved in the war
policies of our government, that
it has subordinated the freedom
of inquiry within the University
to financial gain from question
able if not dirty contractors.
Mr. Heffner argues that some
classified research is very in
teresting. But this is no reason
why it should be kept from the
University and from the coun
try and that we should not tol
erate let alone cooperate with
such endeavors in a democratic
society.
Mr. Heffner seems willing to

abdicate the University's re
sponsibility to the society to
disseminate knowledge and to
act as guardian of civilized val
ues.
Secrecy, espionage, war, are
neither civilized nor morally de
fensible: there is no good reason
whatever that an educational
institution should cooperate
with men involved in such activ
ities.
We believe the University
ought to protest secrecy and
espionage whenever it can, not
cooperate or aid in the effort.
Contradictory
We find Mr. Heffner's state
emnt contradictory and basic
ally indefensible.
We are appalled at the lack
of response to classified re
search on the part of the fac
ulty, a lack of response which
seems to us a distressing in
stance of moral coarseness, and
to call on the Academic Council
to make their position clear im
mediately.
We further ask the Adminis
tration to:
• Permit no further classified
theses.
• Cancel forthwith all classi
fied contracts.
• Permit no further CIA con
tracts.
• Disclose the relations be
tween the trustees, particularly

those in the electronics indlstry,
and classified electronics re
search on this campus or at
SRI.
• Establish a committee of
faculty, students and an admin
istrator to supervise and hold

final decision-making power in
the future on all outside con
tracts. Such a structural charge
seems to us esential as a recog
nition that the entire scholarly
community participants in Uni
versity research.
