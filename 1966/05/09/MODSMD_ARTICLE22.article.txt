Ted Parks of Cal fouled out
down the rightfield lino advanc
ing the runner at second to
third. Roger Stevens then hit a

to dive on to prevent more than

hold at second because of Hov
ley's effort.
The next hitter flied out to
deep center putting runners on
first and third. Mason struck out
the next batter, Rich Nye, to end

in the game.
The long bomb propelled In
dian baseballers to two weekend
wins as Dick Swan, Jim Hibbs,
and Steve Hovley each hit home
runs to make Stanford's last
two games in the CIBA sweet
ones.
The Tribe beat Cal, 3-1, Fri
day, and beat them 6-5 Satur
day.
John Mason and Cal's Bill
Frost were locked up in a pitch
er's duel Friday in Sunken Dia
mond for six innings. The only
run was a third inning homer
by second baseman Swan. The
blast carried over the left field
fence.
Hibbs Belts Homer
Frost the leading strike out
artist in the nation seemed to
be sailing along quite well after
Swan's homer until the seventh.
Centerfielder Steve Hovley lead
off the inning with a single
through the hole between sec
ond and first. Then Hibbs, who
had 10 RBIs last weekend
stepped up and hit the first
pitch high and deep over the
right centerfield fence. The ball
travelled approximately 400
feet.
Mason who was tough all the

way with 8 strike outs looked
like a cinch winner until a ninth
inning rally by Cal. Two errors
put men on first and second
with no outs.
Ted Parks of Cal fouled out
down the rightfield lino advanc
ing the runner at second to
third. Roger Stevens then hit a
sharp single to center which
Hovley went quickly to his right
to dive on to prevent more than
one run scoring. Also the man
who had been on first had to
hold at second because of Hov
ley's effort.
The next hitter flied out to
deep center putting runners on
first and third. Mason struck out
the next batter, Rich Nye, to end
the game, however.
Saturday Win, 6-5
Steve Hovley's three run
homer in the ninth at Cal Satur
day and a strong throw from
Mike Schomaker in left to cut
down a Cal runner at third in
the bottom of the ninth pushed
Stanford to a 6-5 win.
Jim Hibbs also had an extra
base hit for the Tribe. He hit
a double. Shortstop Frank Duf
fy, Schomaker, and third base
man Hi Lewis each had two hits
in the game.
