# Washington, Brought on Star In Football Victory
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Gene Washington in his debut as a varsity football player lived
up to his preseason build up by neatly passing his way to stardom
in the annual Red vs. White spring football frolic, Saturday, on the
Stanford Stadium turf.
Although, both teams played irratic football which is to be ex
pected in spring ball, several familiar faces performed commanding
roles. Other personnel who found themselves in new roles per
formed adequately at their new positions.

Although the outcome of the
contest has no meaning the Red
team won 14-6.
Wasliington Looks Great
There was little to get excited
about besides the arm of Wash
ington and his frequent skirts
around end.
On several occasions he avert
ed sure disaster by either out
running the opposition or flip
ping a pass off at the last mo
ment.
Dave Lewis, who quarter
backed the losing white team,
had his share of bad breaks but
still did not reveal any of the
All-American potential we keep
hearing about him. He attempt
ed several passes to flanker
Bob Blunt that were usually off
their mark. Blunt also had hits
difficulties in finding the handle
on some of Lewis' better passes.
Broughton Looks Good
Tim Abena, Jon Huss, Mark
Marquess, and Greg Broughton
ran well on occasions with
Broughton showing the most
consistency plunging through
the middle of the defensive line.
With around 200 high school
coaches watching the contest
after having attended Stanford's
coaching clinic, Gene Washing
ton broke up what till then had
been a punting contest with a
second quarter 30-yard touch
down pass to Larry Stein.
Marquess, who switched off

with Washington, at quarter
back throughout the game, set
up the initial score on a 15-yard
wobbly pass and a pitch-out to
Huss for 20 yards. Marquess
scored the two-point conver
sion.
Lewis Scores On Pass
Lewis' five-yard pass to Bruce
Cass and an unsuccessful at
tempt at a two-point conversion
brought the score to 8-6 before
the end of the third quarter.
A series of line smashes by
Broughton and a Washington to
Broughton scoring pass ended
the scoring.
An electrifying punt return
for 60 yards by Frank Arm
strong was the only remaining
highlight of the preparatory
contest for next Saturday's
Alumni-Varsity contest.
