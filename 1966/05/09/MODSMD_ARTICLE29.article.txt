# Laxmen Pelter Cal Goal In Shutout Win
## 
### 
In a display of near-perfect
lacrosse, Stanford's Indians
trampled Cal's Bears Saturday,
11-0, to capture the Aberchrom
bie and Fitch "Broken Stick"
trophy.
The Tribe got on the score
board with only two minutes
gone when Dirk Speas side
armed a humming shot past Cal
goalie Andy Israel. In a display
of incredible balance, Doug Ram
sey, Tom Hecht, Tony King,
and Clay Primrose followed
suit to give the Indians a phen
omenal five goals by the end of
the period.
After that there was little
doubt the Indians were going
to route the already ragged
Bears. So the crowd created a
new tension — whether Indian
goalie Mel Ellis would get a
shutout. Which he did, his first
in two years.
Easiest Shutout
It had to be the easiest shut
out in Ellis' career—he had to
make four whole saves, while
Israel at the other end of the
field was being shot at thirty
times. The Bears only got one
face-off. They were beat consist
ently to ground balls by the well
conditioned Tribe, while the
Stanfordites were flipping the
ball to each other, talking to
each other, and backing each
other up in excellent fashion.
Stanford did not score in the
second period and in the first
three minutes of the third, when

thev exploded again for five
goals in the third period in the
space of five minutes. Bob Mur
phy, and George Peters got in
to the scoring column and
Speas, King, and Primrose got
their second goals.
Five Wins
The final tally came in the
final period when Peters took
a feed from Primrose and quick -
sticked one into the goal.
Stanford now stands at 5-1-1
for the season and will meet
league-leading Palo Alto, who
rides on a thirteen-game win
streak in two weeks and could
easily knock off the powerful
Palo Altans.
This weekend the California
North-South All-Star game will
be played at the Golden Gate
Park Polo Field. Stanford has
five men on the North team:
the first midfield of Bob Mur
phy, George Peters, and Wick
Rowland, attackman Clay Prim
rose, and defenseman Chip
Greening. Mel Ellis is alternate
goalie.
