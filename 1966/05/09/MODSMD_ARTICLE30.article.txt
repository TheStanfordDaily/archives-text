# Walsh, Ward Top Solid Track Win
## 
### BOB EGELKO 
A last-lap mile victory by
Dave Deubner and a last-second
440 win by Jim Ward, along
with 13 points by Bud Walsh,
carried Stanford tracksters to
their fifth straight conquest of
California, 83-62, in the 71st Big
Meet Scfturday.
A light Edwards Field crowd
watched the visiting Cards wrap
it up early to move their con
ference record to 3-2.
In the mile, a "must" on the
Cal charts, Deubner turned in
his most impressive race of the
season, and possibly his best
competitive mile ever, to edge
Bob Price of the Bears in 4:03.6.
Strategic Duel
Strategy called for Deubner,
the better finisher of the two,
to stay close to Price's pace for
three laps, and the slender sen
ior from North Eugene, Ore. did
just that, as the bespcctaled Cal
runner vainly tried to shake him
in a burning 2:01.5 in the 880.
Not to be shaken, Deubner
finally went by in the back
stretch of the final lap and did
not appear to be straining as he
won by four yards. All four of
the runners, including Stan
ford's Randy Hyvonen (4:14.9),
improved on their best 1966
times.
Ward's 440 win was a dra
matic reversal of pre-race pre
dictions, which favored Bears
Larry Hengl and Forrest Beatty;
and mid-way through the race,
the only competition appeared
to be between three Cal men,
with Hengl emerging in front
at the start of the turn. Ward
was running virtually last.
Fast Finish
But, as he did against USC,
the Stanford sophomore came
on with a closing rush that
made the only question one of
how far away the tape was.
This time it was far enough, as
Ward overtook Beaty coming
off the turn and then caught
Hengl with about ten yards to
go to win in 47.3.
It was another big meet for
Walsh, the Cards' leading point
collector. Bud sailed up 6-2 and
out 23-9% to win the high and
long jumps, but was most im

pressive in an event he did not
win, the 120 high hurdles.
With a quick start and flaw
less-looking technique, Walsh
ran the fastest flight of highs
in his life, finishing in 14.3. Cal's
Lou Kirtman, one of the AA
WU's best, had to equal his own
school record of 14.2 to beat him
by a few feet.
Relay Miscue
The Bears upset chances dim
med considerably in the opening
440 relay when a dropped baton
eliminated their quartet on the
first handoff; Stanford, mean
while, generally won where it
was supposed to win and used
some good backup performances
to take the meet out of the "toss
up" category.
Larry Questad turned in a
strong sprint double in 9.7 and
21.4, and the Cards picked up
some points when Donn Forbes
ran his fastest 100 this year to
place second, also in 9.7.
Bob Stoecker outclassed the
field to win the discuss at 180-
IV2, and Chuck Schombra, with
his lifetime best of 162-ivi, and
Tyler Wilkins completed the
Stanford sweep.
Eshelman Over 16
Jim Eshelman set the Cards'
only meet record of the day to
lead a 1-2 finish in the pole
vault. Eshelman, who did not
appear to be in his best form,
nevertheless cleared 16-1 Va to
surpass his 15-7 of last year and
also break the stadium record.
He narrowly missed his third
try at 16-6V2, hitting the bar
coining down.
With Walsh held out of the
440 hurdles, Grady Means and
John Williamson each ran life
time bests to finish 2-3 behind
Cal's Paddy McCrary (52.7) and
actually put Stanford over the
top. Means was clokced at 55.1,
Williamson 55.2.
George Porter's 226-4 in the
javelin, one of his best throws
ever, figured in the Card's 6-1
domination of the field events.
The Bears settled for a double
by McCrary (47-7 V2 in the triple
jump), Devone Smith's 1:50.2
880, Price's 8:58.5 two-mile, and
their 34th straight mile relay
win in a meet record 3.09.8.


Bob Stoecker, Stanford track co-captain, displays the form which
won the NCAA discus last year and the Biff Meet last Saturday at
Berkeley.
