## 'To Hell With Mom' 
### Art Bucbwald 
As soon as President Johnson
announced that May 8 would he
Mother's Day, the "Coordi
nating Committee of the Non-
Violent Students Against Moth
ers" opened up headquarters in
Washington.
The chairman of the commit
tee, Charley La Barbe, held a
press conference and protest
meeting, to which I was invited.
The headquarters was filled
with people making signs and
bannersâ€”"Get Out of Mother's
Day," "T a k e Mothers to the
UN," "Why Be a Mother When
You Can Take a Pill?"
La Barbe said that his com
mittee had caught on like wild
fire, particularly amongst stu
dents who hated their mothers.
Burn-In
I saw a large crowd on the
steps and I asked La Barbe
what one of the students was
doing.
' He's burning his birth certifi
cate."
"That takes a lot of guts," I
said.
"We're going to have the big
gest demonstration this country

has ever seen," he said. "Do you
know what we're doing Sun
day?"
"I'd hate to guess."
"We're hanging Whistler's
Mother in effigy."
"Who are those women over
there?"
"That's our Mother's Commit
tee Against Mothers. They'll be
protesting with their children on
May 8."
"Your movement seems to be
snowballing," I said.
"There are a lot of people in
this country who are to be
heard from,"he said. "Every
one is afraid to speak out
against motherhood because it's
unpatriotic, but we're not afraid
to demonstrate."
"This is a personal question,
but why are you against your
mother?"
'I Was Tricked'
"Because I was tricked. I
served in World War II and we
were told that one of the things
we were fighting for was Ma's
apple pie. Well, I came home
after the war and asked my
mother to make me an apple
pie. Do you know something?

It wasn't worth fighting for."
"Was it the crust or the ap
ples?" I asked him.
"Both. She finally went out
and bought a frozen pie. Four
years I fought and all I got out
of it was a frozen apple pie."
"So that's when you got your
idea to abolish Mother's Day."
"That isn't the onlj thing.
She wouldn't let me watch tele
vision while I was going to col
lege.
"But I'm not putting this on
a personal level.
Demons t ration
"Johnson isn't telling us the
whole truth about Mother's
Day. He expects us to go along
with him on May 8, but he re
fuses to say how far he's going
to get involved and how many
mothers he's going to commit."
"Do you plan to hold a peace
ful demonstration?"
"We do unless the cops give
us trouble. The fuzz are all
mother-lovers, you know."
"What happens if you get ar
rested?"
"Our mothers have all prom
ised to bail us out."
