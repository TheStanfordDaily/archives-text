By FHIIJP H. RHINELANDER
The long discussion of my
views which Messrs. Ohlendorf
and Cornberg have put forward
calls for a few comments in the
interests of accuracy.
The principal views which
they attribute to me—and which
they strongly criticize — are
almost the exact opposite of
those which I actually hold.
I have frequqently and con
sistently asserted that the frag
mentation or atomization of
knowledge is the primary prob
lem of education today, and that
the principal aim of curricula
reform should be to overcome
the difficulty. I also believe, and
arid have stated publicly, that
the loss of a stable hierarchy of
values is one of the main roots
of current unrest, not only
among students but in society
at large. I have argued as force
fully as I can that student com
plaints and suggestions should
always be listened to.
Same Points
Now Messrs. Ohlendorf and
Cornberg seem to assert exactly
the same points. There is, there
fore, no important disagreement
on these fundamental matters.
What, then, is the shooting
about?
It is not about the final con
clusions — which are in fact
agreed — but wholly about the
theoretical grounds on which
they are supported.
Messrs. Ohlendorf and Corn
berg mistakenly asume that
their own premises are the only
ones on which such conclusions
could be properly arrived at.
Hence, they infer that anyone
who fails to accept or adopt
their reasonings must necessar
ily reject their conclusions.
niimpty-Diunpty Logic
Thus they argue quite explic
itly that since I avoid putting
my reliance on the slippery no
tion of "universality", which
they prize, therefore I necessar
ily reject the primacy of theo
retical knowledge, necessarily
accept the dangerous fragmen
tation of the curriculum, am
necessarily indifferent to the
loss of stable values, and neces
sarily brush off student com
plaints!
Such logic—if one can call it
that — is like the logic of
Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Car
roll. You take some fine-sound
ing word, like "universality",
disregard its ambiguities, wave
it around like a flag, give it
whatever meanings you want,
and condemn anyone who would
rather rest his conclusions on
a more rational basis.

This point is not merely theo
retical but practical. If you
really want to get something
done about the fragmentation of
the curriculum, for example,
the more different grounds you
can find for doing so, the better.
If you tie your concrete ob
jective to one particular philoso
phical positon, to the exclusion
of all others, you weaken the
objective.
Whitehead, for example, is a
very persuasive authority here,
especially in his attack on "in
ert ideas." Yet Messrs. Ohlen
dorf and Cornberg would appar
ently have to dismiss Whitehead
as a "Baconian" since he does
not employ their particular
methods and arguments.
Other Grounds
It is very important, I think,
to make clear that the validity
of the ultimate objectives which
Messrs. Ohlendorf and Corn
berg are urging should not be
judged by the sort of arguments
which they use to support them;
there are other grounds, and
very good grounds, for accept
ing these conclusions.
One does not have to talk
about "universality" or choose
Plato over Bacon in order to
believe that the current frag
mentation of knowledge is very
dangerous, that stable values
are highly important, and that
student complaints when sin
cerely made (and not just for
show) should always be listened
to.
In short, the fact that very
bad arguments can be advanced
in favor of a particular position
is no ground for dismissing the
position itself.
Three Senses
The trouble with the no
tion of "universality" is illu
strated by the fact that Messrs.
Ohlendorf and Cornberg use it
in at least three different senses,
which they do not distinguish.
The fact is, however, that each
sense involves a different set of
concrete problems for educa
tion.
They use the notion of
"universality" in one sense as
implying an ideal of theoretical
knowledge, as opposed to tech
nological knowledge designed
for the control of nature. Here
their distinction between the
"Platonic" view and the "Bacon
ian" view is most clearly appli
able.
Now the modern university
imparts both theoretical and
technical knowledge. Unless
Messrs. Ohlendorf and Cornberg
mean to imply that all technical
subjects, such as engineering,
should be dropped as being
"Baconian" rather than "Platon
ic" in intention, it is difficult
to see how this aspect of "uni
versality" is relevant to the
questions in issue.
Fixed Values
They use the notion of
"universality" in a second sense

as implying belief in fixed and
objective values. This raises a
different set of problems, in
cluding many important and
difficult ones.
It is sufficient, I think, for
present purposes to point out
that one does not have to be a
Platonist (in any significant
sense) to believe that the lack
of some stable hierarchy of
generally accepted values poses
serious problems in the modern
world.
I believe that many whom
Messrs. Ohlendorf and Corn
berg would label as "Baconians"
would fully agree.
In a third sense they use
the notion of "universality" as
implying the possibility of uni
fying knowledge as opposed to
its fragmentation.
Now the problem of finding
ways to achieve a possible inte
gration of knowledge within the
curriculum is posed today
chiefly by the sheer volume of
knowledge available. Messrs.
Ohlendorf and Cornberg note
this fact. But again, one need
not be a Plantonist to be con
cerned with this problem; a
Baconian might be equally con
cerned.
One thing is clear; talking
about "universality" may be
one way of describing the prob
lem, but it does not seem to
advance us toward finding a vi
able solution.
Further Senses
I should add that if we are

to talk of the "universality" of
knowledge, we should also con
sider further senses of the word
which Messrs. Ohlendorf and
Cornberg do not mention.
One is "universality" as mean
ing openness to the whole spec
trum of knowledge and all
points of view, as contrasted
with exclusive commitment to
one philosophical position. Ad
herence to Plato and the rejec
tion of the "Baconian" view of
knowledge, as recommended,
would seem to involve a rejec
tion of "universality" in this
sense.
There is also the sense of
"universality" in which it is
taken to imply education for all
as distinguished from education
for an elite group of those spe
cially qualified. Plato's own se
lective theory of education
would hardly reflect "universali
ty" in this sense.
Ambiguous
In short, "universality" is not
only ambiguous but double
edged. It can cut both ways. It
seems to me that nothing but
confusion results if you try to
base serious conclusions about
education on so shifting a foun
dation.
The article of Messrs. Ohlen
dorf and Cornberg is an excel
lent illustration. As stated at
the outset, I agree with their
concerns and their ultimate con
clusions. But the case can, and
should, be made on better
grounds.
