# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Waiting For God To Go Away 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We should not have a prob
lem about where to hold sec
tarian services on the campus
today.
For fifteen years or more Rev.
Minto has advocated the erec
tion of a building in conjunction
with Memorial Church, contain
ing a large hall, sufficient office
space for the various denomina
tional ministers, the Chaplain
and his staff, and perhaps even
the Department of Religious
Studies.
But somehow any religious
building, however needed, has
too low a priority to receive se
rious consideration.
Indeed, the powers that be
seem to feel that the best way
to deal with the situation in any
religion controversy is to ignore
it in the hope that it will go
away.
Their attitude is not a new
one. Memorial Church is an In
complete building. The original
central tower, although in ques
tionable taste, had the estheti
cally desirable effect of vertical
ly dominating the vast horizon
tal sweep of Quad, and thereby
focusing and unifying the plan.
When the church was rebuilt
after the Earthquake, a fight
developed over whether to re
build the tower as it had been
or to put up an outer dome. So
the crossing was covered with a
temporary roof until the mat
ter was decided. The money was
spent on some worthy project,
and that temporary roof is still
there today.
The acoustics in the church
are ridiculous. You cannot be
understood unless you are will
ing to sing whatever you are
trying to say.
Experts on accoustics have
made studies of the problem,
and they say nothing can be ac
complished until the accoustical
deadening material installed in
1916 is removed from the ceil
ing to reveal the bare wood be
hind, a very expensive proce
dure indeed. The privilege of
understanding the word of God
is apparently not worth it to the
Trustees.
The Trustees seem deter

mined to do nothing more than
is absolutely necessary to put
up a show for the potential do
nating public that God is not
dead at Stanford, as if con
vinced that he really were.
The rationale of all their ac
tions in the question of reli
gious services and/or Memorial
Church seems to be that if you
can only ignore God long
enough He will go away and not
bother you any more so you can
spend His money somewhere
else.

• Not At SLAC
Editor, The Daily:
It seems clear from Keith
Lowe's letter (The Daily, May
4) that he does not understand
the nature and purpose of SLAC.
He indicates that he considers
SLAC a part of what he calls
the "military - industrial - multi
versity complex".
SLAC's objectives are basic
research in high-energy physics
and the full and unrestricted dis
semination of its research find
ings. SLAC has no industrial ob
jectives, no classified security,
and no military implications.
SLAC is open both for visits
and scientific participation to
people from all over the world.
I very much regret Mr.
Lowe's apparent misconception
of our program and purpose. I
hope he and others who may be
interested in SLAC will pay us
a visit; they will be very wel
come here. Arrangements for a
tour can be made by calling Mrs.
Kittle at 854-3300, Extension 205.

• House Of Intellect
Editor, The Daily:
I thought Mr. Lowe's hyper
bolic metaphor of the virgin In
ner City (The Daily, May 4)-
turned whore of Babylon was
prophetic exaggeration. The
May 5 Daily contained a series
of detailed descriptions of the
tricks she turns.
She gives academic credit for
"m i 1 i t a r y science" courses
taught by the fatuous majors or
colonels who are "not even aware
that there is something wrong
with coercing students to give
blood pledges of support to a
criminal war that can get sup
port in no other way.
She maintains armed guards
and fences around buildings
used for secret projects of the
CIA (I can be shot for walking
through part of the campus.)
She has approved thirty class
ified Ph.D. theses in direct vio
lation of the principle of aca
demic freedom.
She has accepted three and a
half million dollars worth of
secret contracts carried out with
university facilities.
She services the Republic by
making every teacher a tentacle
of the Selective Service Systm
by forcing him to take at least
partial responsibility for decid
ing which of his students will
be shipped to Vietnam to kill or
be killed.
She administers a test to se
lect cannon fodder on the basis
of lack of facility in manipulat
ing numbers or arbitrarily cho
sen verbal patterns.
These are the words of a
spokesman for the house of in
tellect — or has it been trans
formed into another kind of
house:
Within this category of clas
sified research lie some of the
most intellectually challeng
ing problems of our time: . . .
the engineering problems of
devising an effective missile
defense of the U. S. . . . the
economics of assessing the
Chinese capability of support
ting a nuclear weapons pro
gram.
This is his conception of what
is cowardly and what is coura
geous:
[MlT's termination of CIA in
volvement] is the coward's

way out, for if the research
topic is a bona fide one,
should we not defend our right
to pursue if no matter unsav
ory the reputation of the
sponsor?
And here is Mr. Heffner's sug
gestion of how to sever the lia
son:
I believe a better solution
would be to have these topics
of research supported through
other government agencies at
the urging of the CIA rather
than by the CIA Itself.
Perhaps use another depart
ment of the University as a
cover.
Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape. But there are a few ob
scene and perverse outrages we
still have power to resist. Let
us with Olaf at least repeat,
"There is some s. I will not eat."
STEVEN MARX
• Studies Defended
Editor, The Daily:
It is truly unfortunate that
Mr. Lowe (The Daily, May 4),
in his valiant attempt to find
new campus "witches", grasps
at straws and accuses four very
dissimilar campus institutions
of being at the service of cold
war "demonologists".
It seems that Mr. Lowe is
engaging in the same despicable
practices as the so-called "cold
war demonologists."
In this case it seems that one
qualifies as a "university
whore" if he is engaged in any
kind of study involving commu
nism. I refer more particularly
to his rather poor choice of vic
tim in condemning the Stan
ford Studies of the Communist
System.
If Mr. Lowe had taken the
time to familiarize himself with
the scope and purpose of this
organization he would have dis
covered that one of the main
purposes of the Ford Founda
tion grant that founded it was
to encourage the training of ob
jective young scholars who are
interested in the communist sys
tem.
I can assure Mr. Lowe that
the Stanford Studies of the
Communist System is engaged
in doing just that. If my assur
ances are not enough Mr. Lowe
can always take the time to
browse through some of the re
search papers produced by the
group to see if they smack of
anti-communist demonology.
Finally, Mr. Lowe might do
well to reflect for a moment on
the meaning of the term "dem
onologist" as not all demonolo
gists are engaged in anti-com
munist activities.
In fact, it is possible that
some demonologists spend their
time making unsubstantiated,
nihilistic attacks on defenseless
institutions and thus find them
selves "whores" in the house of
nihilism.

• Playing The Game
Editor, The Daily:
The Call Is Out, and all peo
ple who believe in honor, chival
ry, and patriotism must answer.
The good major from ROTC
has named the capitalist game
to be played; and, therefore, I
answer his challenge by offer
ing $5 and free homework for
any ROTC student refusing to
give blood, and, furthermore,
$25 and a promised "A" grade
in his toughest subject to any
student who will drop out of
the ROTC program.
This game is good because it
gets right to the heart of ROTC
personnel. This is the type of
moral, soul-searching problems
they have been trained to deal
with.

• The Universal Donor
Editor, The Dally:
"You'll bolster your grade
By giving your blood,"
Said Chief of Brigade
Colonel Victus N. Mudd.
"The blue book is passe,"
Said Mudd with his hypo,
"I'm giving an A
To all men with Type O."
"And don't take your grievance
To ASSU.
Ideological deviance
Could kill your three-point-two."
Then leadership points
Were given the bled
And others quick followed
Where the leaders were led.
A law student who was
About to flunk Torts,
Rolled up his sleeve
And gave by the quart.
And soon all the flunkees
Were fain to catch up;
One student was nabbed
Donating ketchup.
Yet our Generals were sharp
To take pointers from Vampire,
And thus saved the day
For American Empire.

• Rebels In Madrid
Editor, The Daily:
I am somewhat amazed and
even shocked at some state
ments made by Mr. Bob Menifee
in his review of the film To Die
In Madrid (The Daily, April 29).
It is possible that I do not un
derstand what he means, but
then, I can only base myself on
his prose.
At one point, he says: "Fran
co is victorious, but the narra
tors try to elicit pity for the
rebels." This implies that the
"rebels" are those that were
defeated, i.e. the Loyalists or Re
publicans, for does anyone ever
try to elicit pity for victors?
Now this is a shocking distortion
of history, simply because the
Spanish Republic had been,
since 1931, the legitimate gov
ernment of Spain. If anyone was
a "rebel", it was Franco, who
came out of Africa to overthrow
by violence a government demo
cratically elected. The film very
clearly refers to partisans of
Franco as rebels, but Mr. Meni
fee seems to have completely
missed this point. To him, the
other side becomes the "rebels."
He also finds it reprehensible
that Irene Worth should be
"oversympathetic and moan for
the Republic." Pray tell, what is
wrong with moaning for the Re
public? What is wrong with any
kind of emotion in such a tragic
context anyway? The reviewer
apparently considers it unde
sirable. He would, I suppose,
have preferred a cool, detached,
matter-of-fact narration at all
times, in accordance with Anglo-
Saxon tradition which frowns on
the expression of emotion, no
matter what is being discussed.
It is the same kind of attitude
which allows people to discuss
genocide, for instance, with
something approaching equa
nimity. This attitude also paves
the way for complete moral
overtones, e.g. when people state
that they are much more horri
fied by the fact that Eichmann
was kidnapped to be brought to
trial than they are by what he
did. Such attitudes, quite preva
lent in the U.S.A., are incom
prehensible to many continental
Europeans.
If I have misunderstood Mr.
Manifee, I shall be happy to be
corrected. But if I have indeed
misunderstood him, it is due to
the way he has expressed him
self.
