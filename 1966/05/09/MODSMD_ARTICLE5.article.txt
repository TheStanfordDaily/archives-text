# Solon's Report Calls Berkeley A 'Fairy-Land'
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The state
Senate Committee on Un-American
Activities Friday pictured the Uni
versity of California's Berkeley Cam
pus as seething with communist and
homosexual activity, and blamed UC
President Clark Kerr.
Kerr promptly denied the charges.
Under Kerr, charged the Commit
tee, communist-oriented students and
nonstudents have made the Berkeley
campus the nationwide center for the
anti-Vietnam war movement. Homo
sexuality and sexual promiscuity, the
Senators suggested, are rampant.
Kerr called the Committee's report
"inaccurate" and "distorted" and re
peated his challenge that the senators
produce the names of communists at
the University.
Kerr said he has been asking the
committee for four years to provide
the names of communists connected
with the University.
"No reply has ever been received,"
he said "I repeat my request."
Kerr said the University "by its na
ture is dedicated to freedom in a free
society. It can become, consequently,
an arena for dissent." He said he sup
ports dissent as necessary for prog
ress, and "we also support the prin
ciple of fair play."
Campaign Issue
Ronald Reagan, the actor who is
seeking the Republican nomination

for governor, demanded that the man
he hopes to unseat—Democratic Gov.
Edmund G. Brown—take immediate
action "to restore the University to
its once high standing."
A Reagan aide, who declined identi
fication, said Reagan "definitely will
make the UC mess a campaign issue."
Brown and George Christopher,
former San Francisco Mayor and Rea
gan's chief rival for the GOP nomina
tion, both said they would have to
read the report thoroughly before
commenting on it.
Los Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty,
campaigning against Brown for the
Democratic nomination, was in Bos
ton and could not be reached for com
ment.
'Hostile Attitude'
The five-member committee accused
Kerr of a "hostile attitude" toward
its work, and said he not only didn't
help in seeking out communist, activi
ties on campus "but actually took
steps that tended to prevent its being
given."
The senators also charged Kerr with
being instrumental in re-hiring a
teacher fired, the Committee said, be
cause he lied about his past when he
took the state's anti-communist loyal
ty oath. It named the teacher as Eli
Katz.
Katz, a professor of German, taught
at Berkeley in 1963 but his con
tract was not renewed for 1964.
After faculty protests, however,
Katz was offered his job back
and is scheduled to return to
Berkeley this fall.
Katz, 37, now teaching at
Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, called the section of
the report concerning him "a
misstatement of all the facts
referred to."
2,700 Homosexuals
To back up its charge that
homosexuality is rampant at
Berkeley, the Committee cited a
story in the Daily Califomian,
the student newspaper, which
reported that 2,700 of the

school's 27,000 students were
homosexual.
Jim Branson, Editor of the
campus newspaper, said the sta
tistic was provided by Harold
Call, president of the Mat
tachine Society of San Francis
co, a group devoted to protect
ing the rights of homosexuals.
The Committee charged that
under Kerr, "the campus sank
to a new low," and reported
campus dances with lewd
themes and blatant promiscuity
and the presentation of "dis
gusting, debased spectacles."
At one dance, the senators
said, the smell of marijuana
"pervaded the area," intoxica
tion was widespread and "sex
ual misconduct was blatant."
Kerr Responsible
Kerr's failure to uphold a for
mer rule forbidding use of the
campus for off-campus political
causes allowed "a left-wing dom
ination of the campus scene,"
said the Committee.
This in turn led to Berkeley's
becoming "the focal point" of
the Vietnam Day Committee,
which the Committee said used
the campus to organize anti-
Vietnam protest marches, sit-ins
and abortive attempts to block
troop trains.

2,700 Homosexuals
To back up its charge that
homosexuality is rampant at
Berkeley, the Committee cited a
story in the Daily Califomian,
the student newspaper, which
reported that 2,700 of the

school's 27,000 students were
homosexual.
Jim Branson, Editor of the
campus newspaper, said the sta
tistic was provided by Harold
Call, president of the Mat
tachine Society of San Francis
co, a group devoted to protect
ing the rights of homosexuals.
The Committee charged that
under Kerr, "the campus sank
to a new low," and reported
campus dances with lewd
themes and blatant promiscuity
and the presentation of "dis
gusting, debased spectacles."
At one dance, the senators
said, the smell of marijuana
"pervaded the area," intoxica
tion was widespread and "sex
ual misconduct was blatant."
Kerr Responsible
Kerr's failure to uphold a for
mer rule forbidding use of the
campus for off-campus political
causes allowed "a left-wing dom
ination of the campus scene,"
said the Committee.
This in turn led to Berkeley's
becoming "the focal point" of
the Vietnam Day Committee,
which the Committee said used
the campus to organize anti-
Vietnam protest marches, sit-ins
and abortive attempts to block
troop trains.
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The state
Senate Committee on Un-American
Activities Friday pictured the Uni
versity of California's Berkeley Cam
pus as seething with communist and
homosexual activity, and blamed UC
President Clark Kerr.
Kerr promptly denied the charges.
Under Kerr, charged the Commit
tee, communist-oriented students and
nonstudents have made the Berkeley
campus the nationwide center for the
anti-Vietnam war movement. Homo
sexuality and sexual promiscuity, the
Senators suggested, are rampant.
Kerr called the Committee's report
"inaccurate" and "distorted" and re
peated his challenge that the senators
produce the names of communists at
the University.
Kerr said he has been asking the
committee for four years to provide
the names of communists connected
with the University.
"No reply has ever been received,"
he said "I repeat my request."
Kerr said the University "by its na
ture is dedicated to freedom in a free
society. It can become, consequently,
an arena for dissent." He said he sup
ports dissent as necessary for prog
ress, and "we also support the prin
ciple of fair play."
Campaign Issue
Ronald Reagan, the actor who is
seeking the Republican nomination

for governor, demanded that the man
he hopes to unseat—Democratic Gov.
Edmund G. Brown—take immediate
action "to restore the University to
its once high standing."
A Reagan aide, who declined identi
fication, said Reagan "definitely will
make the UC mess a campaign issue."
Brown and George Christopher,
former San Francisco Mayor and Rea
gan's chief rival for the GOP nomina

read the report thoroughly before
commenting on it.
Los Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty,
campaigning against Brown for the
Democratic nomination, was in Bos

'Hostile Attitude'
The five-member committee accused
Kerr of a "hostile attitude" toward
its work, and said he not only didn't
help in seeking out communist, activi
ties on campus "but actually took
steps that tended to prevent its being
given."
