# Solon's Report Calls Berkeley A 'Fairy-Land'

SACRAMENTO (AP) — The state
Senate Committee on Un-American
Activities Friday pictured the Uni
versity of California's Berkeley Cam
pus as seething with communist and
homosexual activity, and blamed UC
President Clark Kerr.
Kerr promptly denied the charges.
Under Kerr, charged the Commit
tee, communist-oriented students and
nonstudents have made the Berkeley
campus the nationwide center for the
anti-Vietnam war movement. Homo
sexuality and sexual promiscuity, the
Senators suggested, are rampant.
Kerr called the Committee's report
"inaccurate" and "distorted" and re
peated his challenge that the senators
produce the names of communists at
the University.
Kerr said he has been asking the
committee for four years to provide
the names of communists connected
with the University.
"No reply has ever been received,"
he said "I repeat my request."
Kerr said the University "by its na
ture is dedicated to freedom in a free
society. It can become, consequently,
an arena for dissent." He said he sup
ports dissent as necessary for prog

Campaign Issue
Ronald Reagan, the actor who is
seeking the Republican nomination

for governor, demanded that the man
he hopes to unseat—Democratic Gov.
Edmund G. Brown—take immediate
action "to restore the University to
its once high standing."
A Reagan aide, who declined identi
fication, said Reagan "definitely will
make the UC mess a campaign issue."
Brown and George Christopher,
former San Francisco Mayor and Rea
gan's chief rival for the GOP nomina
tion, both said they would have to
read the report thoroughly before
commenting on it.
Los Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty,
campaigning against Brown for the
Democratic nomination, was in Bos
ton and could not be reached for com
ment.
'Hostile Attitude'
The five-member committee accused
Kerr of a "hostile attitude" toward
its work, and said he not only didn't
help in seeking out communist, activi
ties on campus "but actually took
steps that tended to prevent its being
given."
The senators also charged Kerr with
being instrumental in re-hiring a
teacher fired, the Committee said, be
cause he lied about his past when he
took the state's anti-communist loyal
ty oath. It named the teacher as Eli
Katz.
Katz, a professor of German, taught
