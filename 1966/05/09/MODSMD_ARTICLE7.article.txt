# Flexibility Urged In Worship Sites

"There is no doubt that Stanford
has to permit Jewish worship led by
Rabbi Familant in some place other
than Memorial Church," B. Davie Na
pier told The Daily in a telephone con
versation from Yale Saturday.
Napier, who is coming to Stanford
July 1 as Dean of the Chapel, was
reacting to the University's announce
ment Friday that the rabbi had been
denied permission to conduct sabbath
service in the Women's Clubhouse.
The University had earlier autho
rized Jewish students to conduct kad
dish services daily in the clubhouse.
The explanation given for denying
the rabbi's request was that the
Board of Trustee's February declara
tion allowing sectarian worship on
campus "explicitly" limits" denomina
tional worship services to Memorial
Church.
Control
Napier suggested that the term
"Memorial Church" could be inter
preted to mean "under the control of
the person responsible for the Church.
The only important principle here,
and in all departments of the Uni
versity," he said, "is that the Univer
sity insists on maintaining control.
Beyond that, there should be no con
cern."
"It is hard for me to see the differ
ence between the services now going
on and those which would be lead by
the rabbi. In fact, it would be better
if the rabbi were the responsible per
son," Napier stated.
"It seems to me that, from any

body's point of view the issue is a
relatively trivial matter. Private and
public Jewish services in non-Chris
tian buildings are being conducted on
campuses all across the country."
New Program
Napier has announced that he
would feel in no way constricted in
setting up his program next year if
services were allowed to begin this
spring. "There is no reason why ser
vices in the Clubhouse conducted by
Rabbi Familant should not be permit
ted," he said.
As for next year, "given their un
derstandable antipathy to conducting
services in a building dedicated to
Christian worship, the Jews are now
in effect barred from the campus.
This poses a handicap to me in the
creation of a united ministry on the
campus," Napier said.
Napier praised the stand of the
Christian denominational ministers in
refusing to worship on campus until
provisions are made for rabbi-led Jew
ish services outside the Church. "This
is a fine example of the degree of
unity and cooperation already
achieved at Stanford," he said.
Christian Ministers
In explaining the ministers' stand
to his parishioners yesterday, Father
John Duryea said: "We (the Chris
tian ministers) have made our joint
policy known to the Administration
in the hope that it may help the
Trustees to see the incredibly un
realistic nature of their present posi
tion."

provisions are made for rabbi-led Jew
ish services outside the Church. "This
is a fine example of the degree of
unity and cooperation already
achieved at Stanford," he said.
Christian Ministers
In explaining the ministers' stand
to his parishioners yesterday, Father
John Duryea said: "We (the Chris
tian ministers) have made our joint
policy known to the Administration
in the hope that it may help the
Trustees to see the incredibly un
realistic nature of their present posi
tion."
"There is no doubt that Stanford
has to permit Jewish worship led by
Rabbi Familant in some place other
than Memorial Church," B. Davie Na
pier told The Daily in a telephone con
versation from Yale Saturday.
Napier, who is coming to Stanford
July 1 as Dean of the Chapel, was
reacting to the University's announce
ment Friday that the rabbi had been
denied permission to conduct sabbath
service in the Women's Clubhouse.
The University had earlier autho
rized Jewish students to conduct kad
dish services daily in the clubhouse.
The explanation given for denying
the rabbi's request was that the
Board of Trustee's February declara
tion allowing sectarian worship on
campus "explicitly" limits" denomina
tional worship services to Memorial
Church.
Control
Napier suggested that the term
"Memorial Church" could be inter
preted to mean "under the control of
the person responsible for the Church.
The only important principle here,
and in all departments of the Uni
versity," he said, "is that the Univer
sity insists on maintaining control.
Beyond that, there should be no con
cern."
"It is hard for me to see the differ
ence between the services now going
on and those which would be lead by
the rabbi. In fact, it would be better
if the rabbi were the responsible per
son," Napier stated.
"It seems to me that, from any

body's point of view the issue is a
relatively trivial matter. Private and
public Jewish services in non-Chris
tian buildings are being conducted on
campuses all across the country."
New Program
Napier has announced that he
would feel in no way constricted in
setting up his program next year if
services were allowed to begin this
spring. "There is no reason why ser
vices in the Clubhouse conducted by
Rabbi Familant should not be permit
ted," he said.
As for next year, "given their un
derstandable antipathy to conducting
services in a building dedicated to
Christian worship, the Jews are now
in effect barred from the campus.
This poses a handicap to me in the
creation of a united ministry on the
campus," Napier said.
Napier praised the stand of the
Christian denominational ministers in
refusing to worship on campus until
provisions are made for rabbi-led Jew
ish services outside the Church. "This
is a fine example of the degree of
unity and cooperation already
achieved at Stanford," he said.
