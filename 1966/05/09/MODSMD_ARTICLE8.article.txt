# CCLA Organizes Efforts To Effect Legal Abortion
## 
### 
Stanford's chapter of the California
Committee to Legalize Abortion will
begin public activity with a table in
front of Tresidder Memorial Union
today.
The CCLA's expressed aim is the
repeal of California's anti-abortion
laws (specifically, Sections 274, 275
and 276 of the California Penal Code).
The CCLA "believes that it is the
woman—not the state—who should
determine the outcome of her preg
nancy. We feel the state has no right
to force a woman to give birth to an
unwanted child," according to its
statement of principle.
It continues, "because the Legis
lature has not acted on this problem,
we are going directly to the people
via an initiative. To do this we need
enough volunteers (approximately
10,000 ) to collect the more than 500,-
000 signatures necessary to place the
initiative on the November, 1968 gen
eral election ballot."
The number of signatures of regis
tered voters needed is equal to eight
percent of those voting in the prev
ious greneral election.
The filing date for the proposal
has been set as December 20, 1966.
Between now and December 20th,
CLA's efforts will be concentrated on
(1) organizing groups throughout
California, (2) recruiting volunteers
to circulate petitions and (3) raising

funds, according io Coordinator
James Sayre.
CCLA has active chapters in Berke
ley and in Los Angeles. Over fifty
students here at Stanford have indi
dated their interest in helping to cir
culate petitions.
Chairman of the Stanford Chapter
is Dave Mustart, a graduate student
in Geology. The Treasurer is Cidy
Sandfort, a freshman. Members of
the steering committee include Leslie
Gaillard, Gerry York, Gerry Davis,
Hubbard Kirkpatrick and Laurie
Wise.
