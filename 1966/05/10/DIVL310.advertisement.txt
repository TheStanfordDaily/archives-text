my tender,

If you've never used an electric shaver before, the Norelco 'Flip-
Top' Speedshaver® is a great way to find out the easier side of x
shaving. Its rotary blades stroke whiskers off. Never cut or nick.
They won't hurt you. Neither will the price, which is about the
same as a year's supply of razor blades and shave cream. Jill
P.S. If you want to spend a littlemore, get the Norelco Speedshaver Mr
30 (at right). 35% closer shaves. 'Floating heads,' too. And a
pop-up trimmer for sideburns. All the trimmings. From shave to t lu r
price, it's clear about any Norelco—you can't get stung! "
