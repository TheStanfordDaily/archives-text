# 'New Left' Under Pressure: Drachkovitch
## 
### 
Rapidly building pressures soon will force
the nebulous and largely nonideological "Now
Left" of youthful American radicals into
"much more defined political contours," ac
cording to a Stanford University political sci
entist.
Writing in the inaugural issue of Western
Politica —an independent scholarly journal
founded by several Stanford students — Dr.
Milorad M. Drachkovitch concentrates his
"critical appraisal" on the official documents
of key organizations in the New Left and on
the pronouncements of their leaders. He finds
no consensus in the motives and diverse views
held by the movement's "rank-and-file."
Drachkovitch, senior staff member at the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and
Peace, credits organizations and individuals
in the New Left with "a high degree of ideal
ism and a strong motivation."
United Communist. Front
Drachkovitch argues however, that "anti-
Vietnam militancy," in particular, has made
many leaders and members of New Left
groups "politically and psychologically vul

nerable to the idea of a united front with the
Communists."
This has happened, says the Stanford schol
ar, despite the fact that the New Left "still
rejects a stern, systematic and dogmaic ideol
ogy and also rejects the organizational frame
work and discipline that are the very trade
marks of Communism."
At last year's outbreak of nationwide pro
tests against the Vietnam war, writes Drach
kovitch, leaders in the Students for a Demo
cratic Society fSDS) — among other groups—
became "willing and eager to establish a com
mon front with the radically leftist groups of
avowed or barely hidden Communist orienta
tion—the 'Maoist' Progressive Labor Move
ment, the May 2nd Movement, the W.E.B.
Dußois Clubs—and to compete with them in
denunciation of American foreign policy."
Anti-Communist Charter
Accompanying this new direction toward
joint action with the hard left, says the au
thor, was a significant theoretical demarche.
He notes that the 1962 charter of the SDS,
the so-called Port Huron Statement, had de

dared "as democrats, we are in basic oppo
sition to the Communist system."
From the 1965 convention of the SDS at
Kewadin, Mich., however, emerged a kind of
"a-Communism neither pro nor anti" recent
ly formulated in a joint statement by SDS

In addition to Drachkovitch, Professor Wil
liam C. Bark and students James Koltx- and
Robert Naylor have contributed articles on
Arnold Toynbee, Vietnam's economy, and lib
eral intellectuals.

founder Thomas Hayden and Yale University
Prof. Staughton Lynd.
Drachkovitch observes that Hayden and
Lynd began with the declaration that "we re
fuse to be anti Communist" and closed their
statement with the "confidence that move
ments can be built which are too strong to be
used" by the Communists or any other out
side influences.

The author believes this confidence was
compromised, though, by the trip to Hanoi
and other Communist capitals early this year
of Hayden, Lynd and Herbert Aptheker, chief
theoretician of the U. S. Communist Party.
Lynd's Hanoi statement denouncing the
United States' "barbarous aggression in Viet
nam," Drachkovitch writes, "is symbolic of
how easy it is to slip from a-Communism to
pro-Communism."
Still "anti-ideological and quasi-anarchic,"
according to Drachkovitch, the New Left
probably could never be drawn to this coun
try's Communist-serving movements if left
to its own devices. But, warns the author, the
U. S. Communist Party—for one—does not
intend to leave the young radicals alone.
According to Drachkovitch, the Party's new
draft program, published in February this
year, "expresses in cautious but unmistakable
terms the highest hopes of the Party with re
gard to the dismemberment and assimilation
of the New Left, "a movement it describes as
"the most significant political phenomenon in
the recent American past."

The strategy outlined in the draft program,
continues the Stanford scholar, is not to in
vite the New Left and other potential allies
into the Communist Party now hut to "join in
a new version of he American Popular Front
—a new people's party."
One among many recent tactical signals,
notes Drachkovitch, appeared in an article in
the December J965 issue of Political Affairs,
theoretical journal for the U. S. Communist
Party. The article said in part:
"In order to be able to criticize the New
Left effectively, and to teach it what we
know, we must be accepted and admired by
it.
"This can only happen when Communists
are known to be on the picket lines and in the
jails . . Now is the time to win for our
class this courageous and militant section of
youth."
This passage hintß, says Drachkovitch, at
the kind of pressure that will "force the rank
and-file—if not the leaders—of the new move
ments to make a choice between commitment
to totalitarianism or to democracy."

founder Thomas Hayden and Yale University
Prof. Staughton Lynd.
Drachkovitch observes that Hayden and
Lynd began with the declaration that "we re
fuse to be anti Communist" and closed their
statement with the "confidence that move
ments can be built which are too strong to be
used" by the Communists or any other out
side influences.

The author believes this confidence was
compromised, though, by the trip to Hanoi
and other Communist capitals early this year
of Hayden, Lynd and Herbert Aptheker, chief
theoretician of the U. S. Communist Party.
Lynd's Hanoi statement denouncing the
United States' "barbarous aggression in Viet
nam," Drachkovitch writes, "is symbolic of
how easy it is to slip from a-Communism to
pro-Communism."
Still "anti-ideological and quasi-anarchic,"
according to Drachkovitch, the New Left
probably could never be drawn to this coun
try's Communist-serving movements if left
to its own devices. But, warns the author, the
U. S. Communist Party—for one—does not
intend to leave the young radicals alone.
According to Drachkovitch, the Party's new
draft program, published in February this
year, "expresses in cautious but unmistakable
terms the highest hopes of the Party with re
gard to the dismemberment and assimilation
of the New Left, "a movement it describes as
"the most significant political phenomenon in
the recent American past."

The strategy outlined in the draft program,
continues the Stanford scholar, is not to in
vite the New Left and other potential allies
into the Communist Party now hut to "join in
a new version of he American Popular Front
—a new people's party."
One among many recent tactical signals,
notes Drachkovitch, appeared in an article in
the December J965 issue of Political Affairs,
theoretical journal for the U. S. Communist
Party. The article said in part:
"In order to be able to criticize the New
Left effectively, and to teach it what we
know, we must be accepted and admired by
it.
"This can only happen when Communists
are known to be on the picket lines and in the
jails . . Now is the time to win for our
class this courageous and militant section of
youth."
This passage hintß, says Drachkovitch, at
the kind of pressure that will "force the rank
and-file—if not the leaders—of the new move
ments to make a choice between commitment
to totalitarianism or to democracy."
Rapidly building pressures soon will force
the nebulous and largely nonideological "Now
Left" of youthful American radicals into
"much more defined political contours," ac
cording to a Stanford University political sci
entist.
Writing in the inaugural issue of Western
Politica —an independent scholarly journal
founded by several Stanford students — Dr.
Milorad M. Drachkovitch concentrates his
"critical appraisal" on the official documents
of key organizations in the New Left and on
the pronouncements of their leaders. He finds
no consensus in the motives and diverse views
held by the movement's "rank-and-file."
Drachkovitch, senior staff member at the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and
Peace, credits organizations and individuals
in the New Left with "a high degree of ideal
ism and a strong motivation."
United Communist. Front
Drachkovitch argues however, that "anti-
Vietnam militancy," in particular, has made
many leaders and members of New Left
groups "politically and psychologically vul

nerable to the idea of a united front with the
Communists."
This has happened, says the Stanford schol
ar, despite the fact that the New Left "still
rejects a stern, systematic and dogmaic ideol
ogy and also rejects the organizational frame
work and discipline that are the very trade
marks of Communism."

tests against the Vietnam war, writes Drach

used" by the Communists or any other out
side influences.

The author believes this confidence was
compromised, though, by the trip to Hanoi
and other Communist capitals early this year
of Hayden, Lynd and Herbert Aptheker, chief
theoretician of the U. S. Communist Party.
Lynd's Hanoi statement denouncing the
United States' "barbarous aggression in Viet
nam," Drachkovitch writes, "is symbolic of
how easy it is to slip from a-Communism to
pro-Communism."
Still "anti-ideological and quasi-anarchic,"
according to Drachkovitch, the New Left
probably could never be drawn to this coun
try's Communist-serving movements if left
to its own devices. But, warns the author, the
U. S. Communist Party—for one—does not
intend to leave the young radicals alone.
According to Drachkovitch, the Party's new
draft program, published in February this
year, "expresses in cautious but unmistakable
terms the highest hopes of the Party with re
gard to the dismemberment and assimilation
of the New Left, "a movement it describes as
"the most significant political phenomenon in
the recent American past."

The strategy outlined in the draft program,
continues the Stanford scholar, is not to in
vite the New Left and other potential allies
into the Communist Party now hut to "join in
a new version of he American Popular Front
—a new people's party."
One among many recent tactical signals,
notes Drachkovitch, appeared in an article in
the December J965 issue of Political Affairs,
theoretical journal for the U. S. Communist
Party. The article said in part:
"In order to be able to criticize the New
Left effectively, and to teach it what we
know, we must be accepted and admired by
it.
"This can only happen when Communists
are known to be on the picket lines and in the
jails . . Now is the time to win for our
class this courageous and militant section of
youth."
This passage hintß, says Drachkovitch, at
the kind of pressure that will "force the rank
and-file—if not the leaders—of the new move
ments to make a choice between commitment
to totalitarianism or to democracy."
Rapidly building pressures soon will force
the nebulous and largely nonideological "Now
Left" of youthful American radicals into
"much more defined political contours," ac
cording to a Stanford University political sci
entist.
Writing in the inaugural issue of Western
Politica —an independent scholarly journal
founded by several Stanford students — Dr.
Milorad M. Drachkovitch concentrates his
"critical appraisal" on the official documents
of key organizations in the New Left and on
the pronouncements of their leaders. He finds
no consensus in the motives and diverse views
held by the movement's "rank-and-file."
Drachkovitch, senior staff member at the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and
Peace, credits organizations and individuals
in the New Left with "a high degree of ideal
ism and a strong motivation."
United Communist. Front
Drachkovitch argues however, that "anti-
Vietnam militancy," in particular, has made
many leaders and members of New Left
groups "politically and psychologically vul

nerable to the idea of a united front with the
Communists."
This has happened, says the Stanford schol
ar, despite the fact that the New Left "still
rejects a stern, systematic and dogmaic ideol
ogy and also rejects the organizational frame
work and discipline that are the very trade
marks of Communism."
At last year's outbreak of nationwide pro
tests against the Vietnam war, writes Drach
kovitch, leaders in the Students for a Demo
cratic Society fSDS) — among other groups—
became "willing and eager to establish a com
mon front with the radically leftist groups of
avowed or barely hidden Communist orienta
tion—the 'Maoist' Progressive Labor Move
ment, the May 2nd Movement, the W.E.B.
Dußois Clubs—and to compete with them in
denunciation of American foreign policy."
Anti-Communist Charter
Accompanying this new direction toward
joint action with the hard left, says the au
thor, was a significant theoretical demarche.
He notes that the 1962 charter of the SDS,
the so-called Port Huron Statement, had de

dared "as democrats, we are in basic oppo
sition to the Communist system."
From the 1965 convention of the SDS at
Kewadin, Mich., however, emerged a kind of
