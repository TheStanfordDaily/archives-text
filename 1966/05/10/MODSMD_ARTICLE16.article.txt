(Editor's note: The following
is the text of a statement by
President Wallace Sterling on
the new campus liquor regula
tions effective today.)
The following statement has
been issued by President J. E.
Wallace Sterling to clarify the
new liquor laws effective today:
The University believes that
the development of self-disci
pline, individual responsibility

and respect for law will be en
hanced by entrusting to the stu
dents a greater responsibility
for compliance with State law
and by the removal of complete
prohibitions which are not en
forceable in practice.
Therefore, the University
draws to the attention of all its
members that it is unlawful for
any person to sell, furnish, give
or cause to be sold, furnished or
given away any alcoholic bev
erages to any person under the
age of 21 years. The University
expects each individual student
and each student living group
to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this pro
vision of the California Alcohol

ic Beverage Control Act on the
Stanford campus.
The University has particular
concern for the assumptions of
this responsibility by students
who are not yet 21 years of age
and are therefore more exposed
to violations of the law; this
concern applies especially to
freshmen students, nof merely
because they are exposed to vio
lation of the law but also and
importantly because they are
are new to University life with
its attendant problems of ad
justment and achievement.
These regulations rest on the
assumption that Stanford stu
dents, relying on the Fundamen
tal Standard, residence regula
tions, and their own judicial

procedures, are capable of in
dividual and group self-disci
pline. This assumption has been
unanimously supported by the
Committee of Fifteen (March
10, 1966); it cannot be taken
lightly.
• Each Stanford student is
individually and personally re
sponsible for compliance with
the applicable provisions of the
law of the State of California.
• In order to provide maximum
opportunity for effective self
regulation which will protect
the interests of all members of
the Stanford community, each
residence shall adopt and main
tain regulations pertaining to
the use of alcoholic beverages
The University has particular

concern for the assumption of
within the residence and shall
be responsible for compliance
with them.
In doing so, each residence
shall seriously take into account
the age distribution of its mem
bers so that the legal status of
those students who are not yet
21 years of age shall be accord
ed recognition and appropriate
protection.
• Alcoholic beverages may not
be used by students on the cam
pus except within the interior of
campus residences and eating
clubs.
• Alcoholic beverages may
not be served at social func
tions held in residences occupied
predominantly by freshfmen.
• Alcoholic beverages may be
served at social functions in
residences other than those oc
cupied predominantly by fresh
men only if nonolcoholic bev
erages are also served at such
functions.
• Alcoholic beverages shall
not be sold on the Stanford
campus.
• Violations of these alcoholic
beverage regulations, as of oth
er University regulations, shall
be subject to discipline through
regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when
alcoholic beverages are used at
all, they should be used in mod
eration and that the conduct of
students on the Stanford cam
pus shall at no time be disorder
ly or otherwise offensive due to
immoderate use of alcohol or
for any other reason.
The University does not con
done violation of the State law
concerning the use of alcoholic
beverages; nor does it condone
the use of alcoholic beverages
under any circumstances when
such use impairs personal
health, academic achievement,
or the best interests of the Stan
ford community.

The following statement has
been issued by President J. E.
Wallace Sterling to clarify the
new liquor laws effective today:
The University believes that
the development of self-disci
pline, individual responsibility

and respect for law will be en
hanced by entrusting to the stu
dents a greater responsibility
for compliance with State law
and by the removal of complete
prohibitions which are not en
forceable in practice.
Therefore, the University
draws to the attention of all its
members that it is unlawful for
any person to sell, furnish, give
or cause to be sold, furnished or
given away any alcoholic bev
erages to any person under the
age of 21 years. The University
expects each individual student
and each student living group
to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this pro
vision of the California Alcohol

ic Beverage Control Act on the
Stanford campus.
The University has particular
concern for the assumptions of
this responsibility by students
who are not yet 21 years of age
and are therefore more exposed
to violations of the law; this
concern applies especially to
freshmen students, nof merely
because they are exposed to vio
lation of the law but also and
importantly because they are
are new to University life with
its attendant problems of ad
justment and achievement.
These regulations rest on the
assumption that Stanford stu
dents, relying on the Fundamen
tal Standard, residence regula
tions, and their own judicial

procedures, are capable of in
dividual and group self-disci
pline. This assumption has been
unanimously supported by the
Committee of Fifteen (March
10, 1966); it cannot be taken
lightly.
• Each Stanford student is
individually and personally re
sponsible for compliance with
the applicable provisions of the
law of the State of California.
