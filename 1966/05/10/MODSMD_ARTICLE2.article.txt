"Maintaining little balkanized sec
tions of fifty states is impossible to
day," asserted Oregon Senator Mau
rine Neuberger yesterday in answer
to a question concerning "too big"
government.
Senator Neuberger discussed a va
riety of issues, ranging from ciga
rette legislation to foreign affairs, in
an informal talk in Dinkelspiel and a
press conference yesterday afternoon.
Strong Federal Government
The Senator cited health, food and
drugs, and education as areas in

all well tonight if all I had to reply
on was the Oregon National Guard,"
she continued.
Senator Neuberger emphasized two
of her prime interestsâ€”cigarette and
consumer legislation. "New connec
tions between smoking and disease
have been discovered and will be re
leased soon," she announced. "This
should cause another couple million
people to quit smoking."
Clear, honest food packaging, Sen
ator Neuberger claimed, is especially
important in that "packages are the
salesmen of today." Her second con
sumer bill, she continued, centers
around "truth in lending," designed
to inform customers of the total price
they will pay on installment pur
chases.

Commenting on the Vietnam war,
Senator Neuberger admitted that "We
(the Senators) are groping in the
dark." "It is impossible," she claimed,
"to use Amercan terminology and se
mantics to discuss, for example, free
elections in Vietnam."
Senator Neuberger indicated that

she favored Senator William Ful
bright's stand on the war.
Two issues which Senator Neu
berger feels "have become respectable
only in the past six years" are birth
control and Red China. President Ken
nedy, she felt, opened the door for
population control talks because, as
a Catholic, "he could dare to do it."
