# Pat Morrison Case 'Unfortunate'
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
It's truly unfortunate that
the so-called Morrison "haircut
controversy" has occurred. Per
haps, though, it was inevitable
at this time with the personali
ties involved.
However, some clear thinking
has to be done by both sides:

the Morrison faction and the
representatives of Stanford's
Bureau of Athletic Control.
One realizes, of course, that
there is more at stake in this
conflict than a haircut. And it's
more than just a personality
conflict between the varsity
track coach Payton Jordan and
frosh sprinter Pat Morrison.
Clash of Principles
The clash is grappling with
the right of an individual to
question the athletic adminis
tration and its decision to not
allow an athlete to compete be
cause of his personal appear
ance.
Stanford's Athletic Director,
Chuck Taylor, whose shoulders
are carrying most of the burden
of criticism is definitely con
cerned about the ramifications
of this incident. He is concerned
not only in regards to Stan
ford's present athletic program
but more seriously about its af
fect on the future of recruiting
of athletes.
Morrison has now established
himself as a martyr and will
remain firm in his protest
against the image that he is "re
luctant to accept and is entirely
irrelevant to his performance."
There is no question that Mor
rison will refuse to comply in
any way to the BAC's wishes to
change his "individualistic
stand."
A Rational Approach Needed
Now that some of the initial
excitement has worn off this
incident everyone personally
concerned seems to be taking
a more rational approach to the
problem. They all, however,
seem to justify their approach
as being the only reasonable
and acceptable solution.
What alternatives or compro
mises develop must arise be
tween Morrison and Taylor.
Granted, Morrison and Taylor
represent more than an athlete
and an administrator, but what
exactly are the issues at stake
and what demands have been
made on Morrison?
"Accepted In England"
Morrison has been asked only
to trim his hair and, as Coach
Jordan phrased it, "not get a
Yul Brynner or a butch. Just so
he looks neat." This decision
stems, ultimately, from Stan
ford's athletic policy.
Morrison retorted that long
hair is a mark of distinction in
England. "The most important
men you see have long hair,"
he added. To cut his hair would
be to lose his individuality.
But no one is trying to de
stroy "The Pat Morrison." He
has been asked numerous times
and under the most natural con
ditions that all he has to do is
look "neat and trim."
He can keep his "long hair"
and Beatle cut. Jordan merely
wishes his track teams to com
ply with what the athletic de
partment feels is "common de
cency."

No one asked him to slip into
an athletic mold and conform to
Jordan's dictates in all aspects
of his life. Jordan's request i6
not a demand for him to look
like "an uniform plucked chick
en."
I feel for both sides of the
conflict.
I respect Morrison for his
character in standing up for
what he believes. No one crit
icizes him for doing this and its
his right, but I also have em
pathy for Chuck Taylor.
Taylor holds a responsible posi
tion and when he receives undue
criticism from personal friends
he is confronted with a peculiar
situation. Naturally, he must
uphold the respect of his friends
and alumni not only for Stan
ford's athletic but also for him
self.
Blatant Criticism
One blatant example of criti
cism is the column by Stanford
alumni John Hall in the Los An
geles Times.
After condemning Morrison's
appearance as being shocking

and doubly distressing he writes
about Stanford, "It's probably
too much to believe—but this is
the same school that once gave
the world the Vow boys and
three straight Rose Bowl repre
sentatives in football. . . .
"The Indian track team
hasn't beaten USC since 1933,
the football squad hasn't wor
ried about a date in Pasadena
since New Year's eve of 1951,
and in the last 12 years . . . the
basketball club hasn't won a
single game over UCLA in Los
Angeles."
Uncalled For Criticism
Criticism of this sort is aimed
directly at Stanford's athletic
program and is definitely un
called for. It is too bad that
Stanford's sports has to suffer
from this type of basically irra
tional attack.
It is also unforunate that
Stanford' 6 athletic system is
going to have to suffer more
and possibly harsher criticism
to enable a college freshman to
make an individualistic stand
against a so-called "omnipotent
and beaucratic institution."

partment feels is "common de
cency."

No one asked him to slip into
an athletic mold and conform to
Jordan's dictates in all aspects
of his life. Jordan's request i6
not a demand for him to look
like "an uniform plucked chick
en."
I feel for both sides of the
conflict.
I respect Morrison for his
character in standing up for
what he believes. No one crit
icizes him for doing this and its
his right, but I also have em
pathy for Chuck Taylor.
Taylor holds a responsible posi
tion and when he receives undue
criticism from personal friends
he is confronted with a peculiar
situation. Naturally, he must
uphold the respect of his friends
and alumni not only for Stan
ford's athletic but also for him
self.
Blatant Criticism
One blatant example of criti
cism is the column by Stanford
alumni John Hall in the Los An
geles Times.
After condemning Morrison's
appearance as being shocking

and doubly distressing he writes
about Stanford, "It's probably
too much to believe—but this is
the same school that once gave
the world the Vow boys and
three straight Rose Bowl repre
sentatives in football. . . .
"The Indian track team
hasn't beaten USC since 1933,
the football squad hasn't wor
ried about a date in Pasadena
since New Year's eve of 1951,
and in the last 12 years . . . the
basketball club hasn't won a
single game over UCLA in Los
Angeles."
Uncalled For Criticism
Criticism of this sort is aimed
directly at Stanford's athletic
program and is definitely un
called for. It is too bad that
Stanford's sports has to suffer
from this type of basically irra
tional attack.
It is also unforunate that
Stanford' 6 athletic system is
going to have to suffer more
and possibly harsher criticism
to enable a college freshman to
make an individualistic stand
against a so-called "omnipotent
and beaucratic institution."
It's truly unfortunate that
the so-called Morrison "haircut
controversy" has occurred. Per
haps, though, it was inevitable
at this time with the personali
ties involved.
However, some clear thinking
has to be done by both sides:

the Morrison faction and the
representatives of Stanford's
Bureau of Athletic Control.
One realizes, of course, that
there is more at stake in this
conflict than a haircut. And it's
more than just a personality
conflict between the varsity
track coach Payton Jordan and
frosh sprinter Pat Morrison.
Clash of Principles
The clash is grappling with
the right of an individual to
question the athletic adminis
tration and its decision to not
allow an athlete to compete be
cause of his personal appear
ance.
Stanford's Athletic Director,
Chuck Taylor, whose shoulders
are carrying most of the burden
of criticism is definitely con
cerned about the ramifications
of this incident. He is concerned
not only in regards to Stan
ford's present athletic program
but more seriously about its af
fect on the future of recruiting
of athletes.
Morrison has now established
himself as a martyr and will
remain firm in his protest
against the image that he is "re
luctant to accept and is entirely
irrelevant to his performance."
There is no question that Mor
rison will refuse to comply in
any way to the BAC's wishes to
change his "individualistic
stand."
A Rational Approach Needed
Now that some of the initial
excitement has worn off this
incident everyone personally
concerned seems to be taking
a more rational approach to the
problem. They all, however,
seem to justify their approach
as being the only reasonable
and acceptable solution.
What alternatives or compro
mises develop must arise be
tween Morrison and Taylor.
Granted, Morrison and Taylor
represent more than an athlete
and an administrator, but what
exactly are the issues at stake
and what demands have been
made on Morrison?
"Accepted In England"
Morrison has been asked only
to trim his hair and, as Coach
Jordan phrased it, "not get a
Yul Brynner or a butch. Just so
he looks neat." This decision
stems, ultimately, from Stan
ford's athletic policy.
Morrison retorted that long
hair is a mark of distinction in
England. "The most important
men you see have long hair,"
he added. To cut his hair would
be to lose his individuality.
But no one is trying to de
stroy "The Pat Morrison." He
has been asked numerous times
and under the most natural con
ditions that all he has to do is
look "neat and trim."
He can keep his "long hair"
and Beatle cut. Jordan merely
wishes his track teams to com
ply with what the athletic de
partment feels is "common de
cency."

No one asked him to slip into
an athletic mold and conform to
Jordan's dictates in all aspects

cause of his personal appear
ance.
Stanford's Athletic Director,
Chuck Taylor, whose shoulders
are carrying most of the burden
of criticism is definitely con
cerned about the ramifications
of this incident. He is concerned
not only in regards to Stan
ford's present athletic program
but more seriously about its af
fect on the future of recruiting
of athletes.
Morrison has now established
himself as a martyr and will
remain firm in his protest
against the image that he is "re
luctant to accept and is entirely
irrelevant to his performance."
There is no question that Mor
rison will refuse to comply in
any way to the BAC's wishes to
change his "individualistic
stand."
A Rational Approach Needed
Now that some of the initial
excitement has worn off this
incident everyone personally
concerned seems to be taking
a more rational approach to the
problem. They all, however,
seem to justify their approach
as being the only reasonable
and acceptable solution.
What alternatives or compro
mises develop must arise be
tween Morrison and Taylor.
Granted, Morrison and Taylor
represent more than an athlete
and an administrator, but what
exactly are the issues at stake
and what demands have been
made on Morrison?
"Accepted In England"
Morrison has been asked only
to trim his hair and, as Coach
Jordan phrased it, "not get a
Yul Brynner or a butch. Just so
he looks neat." This decision
stems, ultimately, from Stan
ford's athletic policy.
Morrison retorted that long
hair is a mark of distinction in
England. "The most important
men you see have long hair,"
he added. To cut his hair would
be to lose his individuality.
But no one is trying to de
stroy "The Pat Morrison." He
has been asked numerous times
and under the most natural con
ditions that all he has to do is
look "neat and trim."
He can keep his "long hair"
and Beatle cut. Jordan merely
wishes his track teams to com
ply with what the athletic de
partment feels is "common de
cency."

No one asked him to slip into
an athletic mold and conform to
Jordan's dictates in all aspects
of his life. Jordan's request i6
not a demand for him to look
like "an uniform plucked chick
en."
I feel for both sides of the
conflict.
I respect Morrison for his
character in standing up for
what he believes. No one crit
icizes him for doing this and its
his right, but I also have em
pathy for Chuck Taylor.
Taylor holds a responsible posi
tion and when he receives undue
criticism from personal friends
he is confronted with a peculiar
situation. Naturally, he must
uphold the respect of his friends
and alumni not only for Stan
ford's athletic but also for him
self.
Blatant Criticism
One blatant example of criti
cism is the column by Stanford
alumni John Hall in the Los An
geles Times.
After condemning Morrison's
appearance as being shocking

and doubly distressing he writes
about Stanford, "It's probably
too much to believe—but this is
the same school that once gave
the world the Vow boys and
three straight Rose Bowl repre
sentatives in football. . . .
"The Indian track team
hasn't beaten USC since 1933,
the football squad hasn't wor
ried about a date in Pasadena
since New Year's eve of 1951,
and in the last 12 years . . . the
basketball club hasn't won a
single game over UCLA in Los
Angeles."
Uncalled For Criticism
Criticism of this sort is aimed
directly at Stanford's athletic
program and is definitely un
called for. It is too bad that
Stanford's sports has to suffer
from this type of basically irra
tional attack.
It is also unforunate that
Stanford' 6 athletic system is
going to have to suffer more
and possibly harsher criticism
to enable a college freshman to
make an individualistic stand
against a so-called "omnipotent
and beaucratic institution."
It's truly unfortunate that
the so-called Morrison "haircut
controversy" has occurred. Per
haps, though, it was inevitable
at this time with the personali
ties involved.
However, some clear thinking
has to be done by both sides:

the Morrison faction and the
representatives of Stanford's
Bureau of Athletic Control.
One realizes, of course, that
there is more at stake in this
conflict than a haircut. And it's
more than just a personality
conflict between the varsity
track coach Payton Jordan and
frosh sprinter Pat Morrison.
Clash of Principles
The clash is grappling with
the right of an individual to
question the athletic adminis
tration and its decision to not
allow an athlete to compete be
cause of his personal appear
ance.
