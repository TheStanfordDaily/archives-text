# Crew Wins Regatta Gains Harbach Cup
## 
### DAN CABRERA 
Fighting wind, wakes, and
barges, the Stanford crew swept
through the Harbach Cup re
gatta Saturday over both UCLA
and USC, held in Southern Cali
fornia's San Pedro Harbor.
In the Frosh race, all three
boats were even through the
first 500 meters, when UCLA's
shell suddenly dropped back be
cause of the broken seat in the
third position. Stanford then
pulled away to win by a com
fortable IY2 boat lead.
Neck and neck through 1300
meters of the 2000 meter course,
the JV shell finished a full
length ahead of the field, step
ping up their stroke to a back
breaking 38 counts a minute in
their final surge.
Showing a power that will be
needed against Cal next week
end, the Varsity manhandled
both UCLA and USC to recap
ture the Harbach Cup which
UCLA has held for the past
three years.
Near the end of the race, with
Stanford two lengths in the
lead, a large barge charged onto
the course, and things almost
came to a halt. With admirable
self-control, Stanford varsity
coxswain Charles Blitzer steered
his shell safely behind the mov
ing barge, while the UCLA boat,
already two lengths behind,
simply stopped dead, giving
trailing SC a chance to catch
up. UCLA never even finished
the race, which Stanford won

by a good four lengths over SC.
Including Saturday, the In
dian shellmen have reaped 207
of their opponents jerseys as a
result of their victories, losing
only 18 during the season, all
last week when the Frosh and
Varsity lost at Corvallis.
The team this year is an all
returning squad, experienced on
the water, and used to rowing
together. The line-up in the Var
sity shell runs as follows:
stroke: Bill Stump, Jr.
7 Larry Hough, Captain
6 Carry Mc√üride, Jr.
5 Lee Disston, Sr.
4 Dave Robbins, Sr.
3 Tim Cowles, Jr.
2 Rick Dawkins, Soph.
Bow John Stitt, Jr.
Cal Next
Next Sunday morning Stan
ford will tackle Cal on the home
course in Redwood City Harbor.
Although Cal lost to UCLA, con
siderable shifting in their posi
tions has resulted in a much
stronger boat than they had in
that first race of the season.
Stanford has not won a Var
sity crew meet from Cal since
1957, but our veteran-stocked
team's hopes are high for vic
tory on Sunday.
The frosh race will begin at
8:30 a.m. and the last race, the
Varsity, will start at 10:00 a.m.
at Redwood City Harbor, ten
minutes north of Stanford.
