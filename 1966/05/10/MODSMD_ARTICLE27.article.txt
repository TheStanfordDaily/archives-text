# The 						Morrison Case

Do not do unto others as you would that
they should do unto you. Their tastes may not
ha the same.
George Bernard Shaw
The Athletic Department's interference with
the length of freshman sprinter Pat Morrison's
hair is at best a ridiculous mistake and at worst
a reprehensible violation of individual freedom.
Track Coach Payton Jordan, Athletic Direc
tor Chuck Taylor, and the Buck Club — an
alumni organization named for its financial con
tribution to Stanford sports —should all be re
minded that because a student is a member
of a team or organization is no excuse for tak
ing away rights—including the right of choice
in personal appearance — that are otherwise
his.
Moreover, since they seem to be worried
about The 1 "arm's "image," they might be re
minded that Stanford is changing —and that a
sign of "the edge of greatness" creeping into
the athletic program ought to be regarded as
beneficial rather than detrimental. Better yet,
they might forget this whole superficial fetish
over Stanford's "image" and begin looking into
the real problems of quality in the University.
If the handling of the Morrison case was
based on an official policy, then, we believe,
that policy should be changed immediately. If
it was only personal initiative that motivated
Jordan, Taylor, and the Buck Club, then a pub
lic apology is owed to the young sprinter from
England.

In any case, it is unfortunate that the game
of intimidating male students with long hair has
seeped from the unthinking little-old-lady and
small-town-high-school-principal sets into the
world of academe. The situation is disgusting
and calls for immediate action.
