# A 						Student Burden
## 
### 
The new liquor regulations go into effect to
day, but the burden of hypocrisy has not disap
peared. It has only been transferred from the
administration to the student body.
For although the new regulations, which
stress sudent enforcement, are a tremendous
improvement over the old, they still leave a
formidable gap between policy and practice. In
the first place, the revised policy does not con
form wholly to State law. Students, even at the
age of 42, still cannot drink on the banks of
Lake Lagunita, up in the hills, or in back of
fraternity houses. Moreover, the State law
which the new policy approximates is unreal
istic. It presupposes a distinction between stu
dents over and under 21 which simply does not
exist at Stanford, at least as far as drinking is
concerned.
In order for the burden of hypocrisy to be
lifted completely, it will be necessary for the
University to bring its policy into conformity
with the law, and for the law to be updated
to reflect reality.
The University would do well to take the
first step.
