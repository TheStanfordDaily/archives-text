# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Value Of Athletics Questioned 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The pathetic confrontation
between Patrick Morrison and
the Athletic Department chal
lenges the place of that depart
ment within the University. Al
though having considerably
.greater alumni and financial
backing, this department should
not enjoy any greater autonomy
from the University than, say,
the English Department.
The Athletic Department's de
sire to project a particular im
age is antithetical to the Uni
versity's role of encouraging in
dividual choice and development.
Beyond suggesting certain
training procedures, the Ath
letic Department should not ex
ercise control over students in
terested in athletics, even those
on scholarships granted under
its auspices. It certainly should
not be allowed to interfere with
students' lives.
In view of the Morrison inci
dent, the Athletic Department's
policies and its relationship to
the University should be eval
uated.

Editor, The Daily:
The night of May 4 many
Stanford people were forced to
the wayside by someone's fond
and wayward thoughts about
the function of a university lec
ture.
Of course we can hardly
blame the citizens of Palo Alto
for crowding the students out
of Dinkelspiel in order to hear
a man so widely known as Mr.
Bellow, especially since someone
was so generous as to place an
advertisement in the Palo Alto
Times soliciting their attend
ance at this free event.
It is ridiculous that we
should court the citizens of Palo
Alto to displace the university
community at a lecture paid for
by Stanford, when Stanford
residents are barred from Foot
hill Park and must pay exhorbi
tant fees to use the facilities of
their libraries and community
center.
Perhaps in the future a lec
ture with such drawing-power

should be scheduled for Memo
rial Auditorium; or, if that hall
is not available (as was the case
last night), the affair should be
restricted to members of the
Stanford community or handled
on a reserve-seat basis. Tickets
could still be free to anyone but
dispensed only on campus.
I hope it is understood that
these remarks in no way bear
upon the marketing policies of
such institutions as the Stan
ford Repertory Theater, which
legitimately direct themselves
to an audience drawn from the
whole Bay Area.
But I hope someone also un
derstands how disheartening it
is to beg and exhort one's stu
dents to overcome their evening
inertia only to see them turned
away at the doors.

• The Pill And The CIA
Editor, The Daily:
In May s's Daily Mike Col
lin's (ASSU Vi c e-President
elect) argues in a letter on con
traceptives that "It us not the
place of the University either to
condone or encourage any moral
or ethical code." He wants to
"place the responsibility on the
individual where it belongs."
Yet in the anti-CIA crusade
being mounted by Collins and
others the University is being
indicted for (among other
things) not adopting a moral
code—one which would exclude
contracts with the CIA. Hubert
Heffner was asked:
"Has the University ever re
fused, or does it have any pol
icy to refuse, contracts which
require research which is moral
ly repugnant?"
Heffner flung the radicals'
principles back in their faces:

"Morally repugnant to whom?
The 'morality' of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsi
bility of the man himself. . . .
"Every research project is
initiated by an individual facul
ty member who wants to do a
particular piece of research."
Do the radicals want to im
prison the University and its
faculty in a strait jacket of
their own (probably relativistic
anyway) moral codes, in con
tradiction to their professed
stance on "pills"? What hap
pens to "individual moral re
sponsibility"?
Is this not the opposite of the
academic freedom and "free in
quiry" they supposedly ehnm
pion?

• Beauty Contest
Editor, The Daily:
Graduate Dean Virgil VVhit
aker is reported in The Daily,
May 6, to have said that "the
outrageous appearance and the
filth of youths in revolt are too
often an outward symbol" de
claring their abandonment of
human obligations.
As interesting, indeed as Ren
aissance, as this sense of the
relation of the outer and the
inner man may be, we are not
wholly convinced that physical
comeliness is an accurate meas
ure of sanctifying grace, politi
cal correctness, or moral habi
tude.
However, as an act of good
faith and as an indication of our
concern for the common good,
we challenge Professor YVhit
aker to a Beauty Contest to take
place at noon in White Plaza.
To insure objectivity, we pro
pose that the contest be judged
by Elizabeth Arden, David Har
ris, and Baldesar Castiglione.

If Professor Whitaker is right,
their decision may solve the
generational conflict once and
for all, and the community will
be able to turn its attention
to the more important fact that
the administration has allowed
the University to become an
agent of Cold War politics and
an instrument of the armaments
industry.
We can even, through human
intelligence and human vision,
begin to determine whether the
drifting of the university has
contributed to the common
good.

The night of May 4 many
Stanford people were forced to
the wayside by someone's fond
and wayward thoughts about
the function of a university lec
ture.
Of course we can hardly
blame the citizens of Palo Alto
for crowding the students out
of Dinkelspiel in order to hear
a man so widely known as Mr.
Bellow, especially since someone
was so generous as to place an
advertisement in the Palo Alto
Times soliciting their attend
ance at this free event.
It is ridiculous that we
should court the citizens of Palo
Alto to displace the university
community at a lecture paid for
by Stanford, when Stanford
residents are barred from Foot
hill Park and must pay exhorbi
tant fees to use the facilities of
their libraries and community
center.
Perhaps in the future a lec
ture with such drawing-power

should be scheduled for Memo
rial Auditorium; or, if that hall
is not available (as was the case
last night), the affair should be
restricted to members of the
Stanford community or handled
on a reserve-seat basis. Tickets
could still be free to anyone but
dispensed only on campus.
I hope it is understood that
these remarks in no way bear
upon the marketing policies of
such institutions as the Stan
ford Repertory Theater, which
legitimately direct themselves
to an audience drawn from the
whole Bay Area.
But I hope someone also un
derstands how disheartening it
is to beg and exhort one's stu
dents to overcome their evening
inertia only to see them turned
away at the doors.

• The Pill And The CIA
Editor, The Daily:
In May s's Daily Mike Col
lin's (ASSU Vi c e-President
elect) argues in a letter on con
traceptives that "It us not the
place of the University either to
condone or encourage any moral
or ethical code." He wants to
"place the responsibility on the
individual where it belongs."
Yet in the anti-CIA crusade
being mounted by Collins and
others the University is being
indicted for (among other
things) not adopting a moral
code—one which would exclude
contracts with the CIA. Hubert
Heffner was asked:
"Has the University ever re
fused, or does it have any pol
icy to refuse, contracts which
require research which is moral
ly repugnant?"
Heffner flung the radicals'
principles back in their faces:

"Morally repugnant to whom?
The 'morality' of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsi
bility of the man himself. . . .
"Every research project is
initiated by an individual facul
ty member who wants to do a
particular piece of research."
Do the radicals want to im
prison the University and its
faculty in a strait jacket of
their own (probably relativistic
anyway) moral codes, in con
tradiction to their professed
stance on "pills"? What hap
pens to "individual moral re
sponsibility"?
Is this not the opposite of the

claring their abandonment of

As interesting, indeed as Ren

If Professor Whitaker is right,

The night of May 4 many
Stanford people were forced to
the wayside by someone's fond
and wayward thoughts about
the function of a university lec
ture.
Of course we can hardly
blame the citizens of Palo Alto
for crowding the students out
of Dinkelspiel in order to hear
a man so widely known as Mr.
Bellow, especially since someone
was so generous as to place an
advertisement in the Palo Alto
Times soliciting their attend
ance at this free event.
It is ridiculous that we
should court the citizens of Palo
Alto to displace the university
community at a lecture paid for
by Stanford, when Stanford
residents are barred from Foot
hill Park and must pay exhorbi
tant fees to use the facilities of
their libraries and community
center.
Perhaps in the future a lec
ture with such drawing-power

should be scheduled for Memo
rial Auditorium; or, if that hall
is not available (as was the case
last night), the affair should be
restricted to members of the
Stanford community or handled
on a reserve-seat basis. Tickets
could still be free to anyone but
dispensed only on campus.
I hope it is understood that
these remarks in no way bear
upon the marketing policies of
such institutions as the Stan
ford Repertory Theater, which
legitimately direct themselves
to an audience drawn from the
whole Bay Area.
But I hope someone also un
derstands how disheartening it
is to beg and exhort one's stu
dents to overcome their evening
inertia only to see them turned
away at the doors.

• The Pill And The CIA
Editor, The Daily:
In May s's Daily Mike Col
lin's (ASSU Vi c e-President
elect) argues in a letter on con
traceptives that "It us not the
place of the University either to
condone or encourage any moral
or ethical code." He wants to
"place the responsibility on the
individual where it belongs."
Yet in the anti-CIA crusade
being mounted by Collins and
others the University is being
indicted for (among other
things) not adopting a moral
code—one which would exclude
contracts with the CIA. Hubert
Heffner was asked:
"Has the University ever re
fused, or does it have any pol
icy to refuse, contracts which
require research which is moral
ly repugnant?"
Heffner flung the radicals'
principles back in their faces:

"Morally repugnant to whom?
The 'morality' of a scholar's re
search is the primary responsi
bility of the man himself. . . .
"Every research project is
initiated by an individual facul
ty member who wants to do a
particular piece of research."
Do the radicals want to im
prison the University and its
faculty in a strait jacket of
their own (probably relativistic
anyway) moral codes, in con
tradiction to their professed
stance on "pills"? What hap
pens to "individual moral re
sponsibility"?
Is this not the opposite of the

Graduate Dean Virgil VVhit

claring their abandonment of

As interesting, indeed as Ren

However, as an act of good

To insure objectivity, we pro

If Professor Whitaker is right,
their decision may solve the
