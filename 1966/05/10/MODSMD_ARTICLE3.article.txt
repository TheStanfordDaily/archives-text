# Ramparts Editor Steinbaum Challenges U.S. Involvement

### 
Charging that the United States is
responding militarily to a non-mili
tary question in Southeast Asia be
cause it feels war with China is in
evitable, Stanley K. Steinbaum, con
sulting editor of Ramparts magazine,
addressed about 80 people at Tresid
der last night on "Current American
Purpose in Southeast Asia."
The editor and co-author of the
article which revealed CIA involve
ment in Michigan State University,
returned two months ago from a tour
of Cambodia, Thailand and South
Vietnam. He met with the Cambodian
cabinet, which reaffirmed its desire to
remain neutral in Southeast Asia. But
Cambodia doesn't like the U.S. idea
of neutrality, which is 'Let us protect
you from the enemy,' " he stated.
Thailand, too, is a carbon copy of
South Vietnam, according to Shein
baum. We have 16,000 troops there
now, and projections show that these
will be tripled within a year.
The problem in Saigon, as Shein
baum sees it, is that the U.S. military
situation is not improving, since "they
seem to escalate every time we do."
He pointed out that one of the major
problems is that in the city, water,
electricity and sanitation are being
neglected.

Sheinbaum believes that the United
States is taking this military stand
because it feels that war with China
is inevitable, and the administration
is preparing the Southeast Asia penin
sula as a military base for U.S. secur
ity.
Sheinbaum denied that there were
bases and a supply line for the Viet
Cong in Cambodia. "Cambodia sympa
thizes with the Viet Cong and sends
rice and medical supplies," he ad
mitted. "And of course the Viet Cong
flee to adjacent Cambodia; they don't
recognize international borders when
they are running."
However Steinbaum continued, he
traveled by jeep, foot and air along
the Cambodia-South Vietnam border
and saw no supply roads.
The member of the Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions in
Santa Barbara and Democratic can
didate for the California Congress
noted that the American public is
being presented a false picture of the
situation in Vietnam. "Administra
tion reports are a deliberate attempt
to deceive, and not a matter of mis
understanding," he emphasized.
