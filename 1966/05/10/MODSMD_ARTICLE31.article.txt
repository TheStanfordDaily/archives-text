# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## Training And Indoctrination 
### JOE PENNOCK 
(Editor's note: This is the sixth in a
leisurely series of articles on education at
Stanford.)

In the American university, and at Stan
ford in particular, the distinction between
education and training is viewed as the
distinction between general study and spe
cialization, and the question of education
and indoctrination is not discussed.
I hope to show that education can be
best understood in terms of education it
self, training, and indoctrination, and that
the distinction between education and
training cannot be made in the contem
porary fashion.
The view of education which members
of the acadcmic community entertain is
the problem to which we address our
selves. But one can hardly view the prob
lem from the point of view of the problem
itself.
As a starting orientation, therefore, for
encountering this unfamiliar view of edu
cation we turn attention to three personal
ity types to be found in the culture and
society.
Education and Personality
The first type of person holds opinions
on a number of issues and cannot criticize
his opinions. He possesses, furthermore, no
occupational skills. Included in this type
may be the surfer, the beatnik, or the
housewife.
A second type is proficient in various
skills and also voices opinions about cur
rent issues. His abilities may be developed
in academic or vocational skills, opening
to him occupations in engineering, medi
cine, business, law, or historical research.
But because of his "general education,"
he can set fortli views of current problems,
regardless of the area of his disciplining,
and yet he is unable to criticize his views.
A third type is capable of gaining in
sights which, regardless of his special
skills. £o beyond the realm of cultural
prejudice which grounds the opinions of
the first two. He may find difficulty with
the fact that many aspects of culture fun
damental to the lives of his contemporaries
are foreign to him.
He is unable, however, to articulate his
insight in an academic discipline and to
criticize his present difficulty and the basis
for his insight.
These personalities exemplify a problem
in contemporary education.
If that problem is to be regarded in
terms of education, training, and indoctri
nation, which of these processes do the
types exemplify? Furthfermore, we ask,
what are the processes themselves?
Instruction and Acculturation
Indoctrination is the process of leading
the individual into the acceptance of a
teaching without providing him a means of
criticizing what is taught for its truth or
validity.
The process takes two recognizable
forms: acculturation and instruction.
Acculturation brings the child to accept
the viewpoints of his culture. Instruction
is a similar process when the subject mat
ter of a discipline is given and received
uncritically.
Indoctrination as acculturation is pre
dominant in the development of the first
personality.

Setting forth opinions grounded in no
disciplined study, without any criticism, he
is the mere product of acculturation. He is
a dogmatist who maintains one point of
view and either denies the validity of all
others, or understands them only in terms
of his own.
Dogmatism and Alienation
Training is the process of learning sub
ject matter which does not in itself con
stitute a discipline, but serves as the struc
tural, operational, or communicative basis
of a discipline. Practically, training is the
acquisition of skills which are means to
ends but which are not ends in themselves.
The second person, then, is well trained,
in either academic or vocational skills. He
is also indoctrinated, first in the form of
acculturation, and secondly, if he has been
to the university, in the form of instruc
tion.
But while he may possess general or
special knowledge as well as skills, he still
harbors the same cultural prejudices as
everyone else. He is unable to criticize his
opinions, the goals of his training, and the
part training has played in his personal
development.
Lacking such critical thought, he also
holds a position of dogmatism.
The third personality differs from the
others in that, while he may be similarly
indoctrinated and trained, he is capable of
insight beyond the status quo of cultural
prejudice. His orientation toward life in
society, however, is not one of self-affirm
ing dogmatism, but what is traditionally
described as alienation.
This person is equally unable, however,
to criticize the foundations of his insight
and his alienation.
The Structure of Education
If these three personalities, the indoc
trinated, the trained, and the insightful,
are typical in our society and culture, we
want to understand whether or not any of
them are also educated.
We want to ask, in terms of the proc
esses themselves, is education merely a
name for a combination of training and in
doctrination, or for the goal of these proc
esses, or is it perhaps the process and goal
which transcends both the processes of
training and indoctrination and their
goals?
Education is a process of coming to criti
cize and understand oneself and one's cul
ture. It is dependent upon indoctrination
and training, but, as a process itself, it
goes beyond them.
Education is dependent upon indoctrina
tion in the forms of both acculturation and
instruction.
Acculturation provides the cultural sub
stance of personality which serves as sub
ject matter for the start of self-criticism
towards education itself
Instruction in knowledge made available
In the disciplines provides the basis for
criticism which pertains to the personality
but which transcends it to include criticism
of the culture as a whole.
Criticism And Prejudice
Such criticism and understanding of self
and culture is both well structured, well
grounded, and communicable.
But if education is truly to involve critic
ism and understanding and not mere preju
dice, then it must avoid indoctrination as
an end result.

Education is thus dependent upon train
ing, training in critical thought. Such critic
ism has two characteristics.
One is the recognition of one's indoctrin
ation, manifest in both forms. The other
is an act of non-attachment which allows
the individual to objectify dogma and in
doctrination.
Non-attachment is not to be understood
as a matter of removing oneself from con
cern for an issue or from involvement in
social circumstance.
Rather it is an act of non-attachment
which allows the individual to look directly
to the issue at hand, without confusing it
with his or others' personalities, enabling
him to see into the nature of the issue itself
and to see furthermore just what relation
it does have to his own life and personality.
It is as if I enable myself to watch a
play into which I project myself as a real
participant.
This act of spectating while participating
allows me to identify with the other actors
but to see at the same time just what my
relation to the other actors is, what may be
the nature of the issues under considera
tion, and what relevance they have to the
actors, this spectator included, and to the
play as a whole.
Nonattachm«>nt And Typicality
The critical person, engaging in this pro
cess, will objectify everything which he
considers "his own," every opinion, idea,
and conviction which he has received
through acculturation, whether they per
tain to his personality, his culture, or his
special discipline. He will likewise objectify
the dogma which he has received through
instruction in educational institutions.
The critical personality always asks him
self, "What it is?" He recognizes that the
natural response to that question is a dog
matic response which must in turn be
objectified in an act of nonattachment and
investigated for its truth.
His reflections upon the history and pres
ent activity of his own personality will ulti
mately coincide with his reflections upon
his culture as ho grasps personality and
culture as necessarily given together.
Engaging in this process of education,
the individual will begin to see into his
own typicality and atypicality as a member
of his culture and come to understand him
self and his culture as a whole.
Towards Self-Knowledge
The process of education then is not, as
is assumed in American universities and
today at Stanford, merely a process of
training or indoctrination as they have been
regarded.
It includes them and is dependent upon
them, but it transcends them.
Education is not a process which, from
the point of view of culture and society,
servos merely to perpetuate their status
quos, but one that allows the individual
to approach a fundamental understanding
of culture and enact real criticism of him
self and of his society.
From the point of view of the individual
personality, education is not a process
which allows for the growth of dogmatism
blinding to the intellect or alienation de
structive to personal stability, but a process
of striving toward true self-knowledge,
which develops personal depth and in
tegrity.

cern for an issue or from involvement in
social circumstance.
Rather it is an act of non-attachment
which allows the individual to look directly
to the issue at hand, without confusing it
with his or others' personalities, enabling
him to see into the nature of the issue itself
and to see furthermore just what relation
it does have to his own life and personality.
It is as if I enable myself to watch a
play into which I project myself as a real
participant.
This act of spectating while participating
allows me to identify with the other actors
but to see at the same time just what my
relation to the other actors is, what may be
the nature of the issues under considera
tion, and what relevance they have to the
actors, this spectator included, and to the
play as a whole.
Nonattachm«>nt And Typicality
The critical person, engaging in this pro
cess, will objectify everything which he
considers "his own," every opinion, idea,
and conviction which he has received
through acculturation, whether they per
tain to his personality, his culture, or his
special discipline. He will likewise objectify
the dogma which he has received through
instruction in educational institutions.
The critical personality always asks him
self, "What it is?" He recognizes that the
natural response to that question is a dog
matic response which must in turn be
objectified in an act of nonattachment and
investigated for its truth.
His reflections upon the history and pres
ent activity of his own personality will ulti
mately coincide with his reflections upon
his culture as ho grasps personality and
culture as necessarily given together.
Engaging in this process of education,
the individual will begin to see into his
own typicality and atypicality as a member
of his culture and come to understand him
self and his culture as a whole.
Towards Self-Knowledge
The process of education then is not, as
is assumed in American universities and
today at Stanford, merely a process of
training or indoctrination as they have been
regarded.
It includes them and is dependent upon
them, but it transcends them.
Education is not a process which, from
the point of view of culture and society,
servos merely to perpetuate their status
quos, but one that allows the individual
to approach a fundamental understanding
of culture and enact real criticism of him
self and of his society.
From the point of view of the individual
personality, education is not a process
which allows for the growth of dogmatism
blinding to the intellect or alienation de
structive to personal stability, but a process
of striving toward true self-knowledge,
which develops personal depth and in
tegrity.
(Editor's note: This is the sixth in a
leisurely series of articles on education at
Stanford.)

In the American university, and at Stan
ford in particular, the distinction between
education and training is viewed as the
distinction between general study and spe
cialization, and the question of education
and indoctrination is not discussed.
I hope to show that education can be
best understood in terms of education it
self, training, and indoctrination, and that
the distinction between education and
training cannot be made in the contem
porary fashion.
The view of education which members
of the acadcmic community entertain is
the problem to which we address our
selves. But one can hardly view the prob
lem from the point of view of the problem
itself.
As a starting orientation, therefore, for
encountering this unfamiliar view of edu
cation we turn attention to three personal
ity types to be found in the culture and
society.
Education and Personality
The first type of person holds opinions
on a number of issues and cannot criticize
his opinions. He possesses, furthermore, no
occupational skills. Included in this type
may be the surfer, the beatnik, or the
housewife.
A second type is proficient in various
skills and also voices opinions about cur
rent issues. His abilities may be developed
in academic or vocational skills, opening
to him occupations in engineering, medi
cine, business, law, or historical research.
But because of his "general education,"
he can set fortli views of current problems,
regardless of the area of his disciplining,
and yet he is unable to criticize his views.
A third type is capable of gaining in
sights which, regardless of his special
skills. £o beyond the realm of cultural
prejudice which grounds the opinions of
the first two. He may find difficulty with
the fact that many aspects of culture fun
damental to the lives of his contemporaries
are foreign to him.
He is unable, however, to articulate his
insight in an academic discipline and to
criticize his present difficulty and the basis
for his insight.
These personalities exemplify a problem
in contemporary education.
If that problem is to be regarded in
terms of education, training, and indoctri
nation, which of these processes do the
types exemplify? Furthfermore, we ask,
what are the processes themselves?
Instruction and Acculturation
Indoctrination is the process of leading
the individual into the acceptance of a
teaching without providing him a means of
criticizing what is taught for its truth or
validity.
The process takes two recognizable
forms: acculturation and instruction.
Acculturation brings the child to accept
the viewpoints of his culture. Instruction
is a similar process when the subject mat
ter of a discipline is given and received
uncritically.
Indoctrination as acculturation is pre
dominant in the development of the first
personality.

Setting forth opinions grounded in no
disciplined study, without any criticism, he
is the mere product of acculturation. He is
a dogmatist who maintains one point of
view and either denies the validity of all
others, or understands them only in terms
of his own.
Dogmatism and Alienation
Training is the process of learning sub
ject matter which does not in itself con
stitute a discipline, but serves as the struc
tural, operational, or communicative basis
of a discipline. Practically, training is the
acquisition of skills which are means to
ends but which are not ends in themselves.
The second person, then, is well trained,
in either academic or vocational skills. He
is also indoctrinated, first in the form of
acculturation, and secondly, if he has been
to the university, in the form of instruc
tion.
But while he may possess general or
special knowledge as well as skills, he still
harbors the same cultural prejudices as
everyone else. He is unable to criticize his
opinions, the goals of his training, and the
part training has played in his personal
development.
Lacking such critical thought, he also
holds a position of dogmatism.
The third personality differs from the
others in that, while he may be similarly
indoctrinated and trained, he is capable of
insight beyond the status quo of cultural
prejudice. His orientation toward life in
society, however, is not one of self-affirm
ing dogmatism, but what is traditionally
described as alienation.
This person is equally unable, however,
to criticize the foundations of his insight
and his alienation.
The Structure of Education
If these three personalities, the indoc
trinated, the trained, and the insightful,
are typical in our society and culture, we
want to understand whether or not any of
them are also educated.
We want to ask, in terms of the proc
esses themselves, is education merely a
name for a combination of training and in
doctrination, or for the goal of these proc
esses, or is it perhaps the process and goal
which transcends both the processes of
training and indoctrination and their
goals?
Education is a process of coming to criti
cize and understand oneself and one's cul
ture. It is dependent upon indoctrination
and training, but, as a process itself, it
goes beyond them.
Education is dependent upon indoctrina
tion in the forms of both acculturation and
instruction.
Acculturation provides the cultural sub
stance of personality which serves as sub
ject matter for the start of self-criticism
towards education itself
Instruction in knowledge made available
In the disciplines provides the basis for
criticism which pertains to the personality
but which transcends it to include criticism
of the culture as a whole.
Criticism And Prejudice
Such criticism and understanding of self
and culture is both well structured, well
grounded, and communicable.
But if education is truly to involve critic
ism and understanding and not mere preju
dice, then it must avoid indoctrination as
an end result.

Education is thus dependent upon train
ing, training in critical thought. Such critic
ism has two characteristics.
One is the recognition of one's indoctrin
ation, manifest in both forms. The other
is an act of non-attachment which allows
the individual to objectify dogma and in
doctrination.
Non-attachment is not to be understood
as a matter of removing oneself from con
cern for an issue or from involvement in
social circumstance.
Rather it is an act of non-attachment
which allows the individual to look directly
to the issue at hand, without confusing it
with his or others' personalities, enabling
him to see into the nature of the issue itself
and to see furthermore just what relation
it does have to his own life and personality.
It is as if I enable myself to watch a
play into which I project myself as a real
participant.
This act of spectating while participating
allows me to identify with the other actors
but to see at the same time just what my
relation to the other actors is, what may be
the nature of the issues under considera
tion, and what relevance they have to the
actors, this spectator included, and to the
play as a whole.

to the university, in the form of instruc
tion.
But while he may possess general or
special knowledge as well as skills, he still
harbors the same cultural prejudices as
everyone else. He is unable to criticize his
opinions, the goals of his training, and the
part training has played in his personal
development.
Lacking such critical thought, he also
holds a position of dogmatism.
The third personality differs from the
others in that, while he may be similarly
indoctrinated and trained, he is capable of
insight beyond the status quo of cultural
prejudice. His orientation toward life in
society, however, is not one of self-affirm
ing dogmatism, but what is traditionally
described as alienation.
This person is equally unable, however,
to criticize the foundations of his insight
and his alienation.
The Structure of Education
If these three personalities, the indoc
trinated, the trained, and the insightful,
are typical in our society and culture, we
want to understand whether or not any of
them are also educated.
We want to ask, in terms of the proc
esses themselves, is education merely a
name for a combination of training and in
doctrination, or for the goal of these proc
esses, or is it perhaps the process and goal
which transcends both the processes of
training and indoctrination and their
goals?
Education is a process of coming to criti
cize and understand oneself and one's cul
ture. It is dependent upon indoctrination
and training, but, as a process itself, it
goes beyond them.
Education is dependent upon indoctrina
tion in the forms of both acculturation and
instruction.
Acculturation provides the cultural sub
stance of personality which serves as sub
ject matter for the start of self-criticism
towards education itself
Instruction in knowledge made available
In the disciplines provides the basis for
criticism which pertains to the personality
but which transcends it to include criticism
of the culture as a whole.
Criticism And Prejudice
Such criticism and understanding of self
and culture is both well structured, well
grounded, and communicable.
But if education is truly to involve critic
ism and understanding and not mere preju
dice, then it must avoid indoctrination as
an end result.

Education is thus dependent upon train
ing, training in critical thought. Such critic
ism has two characteristics.
One is the recognition of one's indoctrin
ation, manifest in both forms. The other
is an act of non-attachment which allows
the individual to objectify dogma and in
doctrination.
Non-attachment is not to be understood
as a matter of removing oneself from con
cern for an issue or from involvement in
social circumstance.
Rather it is an act of non-attachment
which allows the individual to look directly
to the issue at hand, without confusing it
with his or others' personalities, enabling
him to see into the nature of the issue itself
and to see furthermore just what relation
it does have to his own life and personality.
It is as if I enable myself to watch a
play into which I project myself as a real
participant.
This act of spectating while participating
allows me to identify with the other actors
but to see at the same time just what my
relation to the other actors is, what may be
the nature of the issues under considera
tion, and what relevance they have to the
actors, this spectator included, and to the
play as a whole.
Nonattachm«>nt And Typicality
The critical person, engaging in this pro
cess, will objectify everything which he
considers "his own," every opinion, idea,
and conviction which he has received
through acculturation, whether they per
tain to his personality, his culture, or his
special discipline. He will likewise objectify
the dogma which he has received through
instruction in educational institutions.
The critical personality always asks him
self, "What it is?" He recognizes that the
natural response to that question is a dog
matic response which must in turn be
objectified in an act of nonattachment and
investigated for its truth.
His reflections upon the history and pres
ent activity of his own personality will ulti
mately coincide with his reflections upon
his culture as ho grasps personality and
culture as necessarily given together.
Engaging in this process of education,
the individual will begin to see into his
own typicality and atypicality as a member
of his culture and come to understand him
self and his culture as a whole.
Towards Self-Knowledge
The process of education then is not, as
is assumed in American universities and
today at Stanford, merely a process of
training or indoctrination as they have been
regarded.
It includes them and is dependent upon
them, but it transcends them.
Education is not a process which, from
the point of view of culture and society,
servos merely to perpetuate their status
quos, but one that allows the individual
to approach a fundamental understanding
of culture and enact real criticism of him
self and of his society.
From the point of view of the individual
personality, education is not a process
which allows for the growth of dogmatism
blinding to the intellect or alienation de
structive to personal stability, but a process
of striving toward true self-knowledge,
which develops personal depth and in
tegrity.
(Editor's note: This is the sixth in a
leisurely series of articles on education at
Stanford.)

In the American university, and at Stan
ford in particular, the distinction between
education and training is viewed as the
distinction between general study and spe
cialization, and the question of education
and indoctrination is not discussed.
I hope to show that education can be
best understood in terms of education it
self, training, and indoctrination, and that
the distinction between education and
training cannot be made in the contem
porary fashion.
The view of education which members
of the acadcmic community entertain is
the problem to which we address our
selves. But one can hardly view the prob
lem from the point of view of the problem
itself.
As a starting orientation, therefore, for
encountering this unfamiliar view of edu
cation we turn attention to three personal
ity types to be found in the culture and
society.
Education and Personality
The first type of person holds opinions
on a number of issues and cannot criticize
his opinions. He possesses, furthermore, no
occupational skills. Included in this type
may be the surfer, the beatnik, or the
housewife.
A second type is proficient in various
skills and also voices opinions about cur
rent issues. His abilities may be developed
in academic or vocational skills, opening
to him occupations in engineering, medi
cine, business, law, or historical research.
But because of his "general education,"
he can set fortli views of current problems,
regardless of the area of his disciplining,
and yet he is unable to criticize his views.
A third type is capable of gaining in
sights which, regardless of his special
skills. £o beyond the realm of cultural
prejudice which grounds the opinions of
the first two. He may find difficulty with
the fact that many aspects of culture fun
damental to the lives of his contemporaries
are foreign to him.
He is unable, however, to articulate his
insight in an academic discipline and to
criticize his present difficulty and the basis
for his insight.
These personalities exemplify a problem
in contemporary education.
If that problem is to be regarded in
terms of education, training, and indoctri
nation, which of these processes do the
types exemplify? Furthfermore, we ask,
what are the processes themselves?
Instruction and Acculturation
Indoctrination is the process of leading
the individual into the acceptance of a
teaching without providing him a means of
criticizing what is taught for its truth or
validity.
The process takes two recognizable
forms: acculturation and instruction.
Acculturation brings the child to accept
the viewpoints of his culture. Instruction
is a similar process when the subject mat
ter of a discipline is given and received
uncritically.
Indoctrination as acculturation is pre
dominant in the development of the first
personality.

Setting forth opinions grounded in no
disciplined study, without any criticism, he
is the mere product of acculturation. He is
a dogmatist who maintains one point of
view and either denies the validity of all
others, or understands them only in terms
of his own.
Dogmatism and Alienation
Training is the process of learning sub
ject matter which does not in itself con
stitute a discipline, but serves as the struc
tural, operational, or communicative basis
of a discipline. Practically, training is the
acquisition of skills which are means to
ends but which are not ends in themselves.
The second person, then, is well trained,
in either academic or vocational skills. He
is also indoctrinated, first in the form of
acculturation, and secondly, if he has been
to the university, in the form of instruc
tion.
But while he may possess general or
special knowledge as well as skills, he still
harbors the same cultural prejudices as
everyone else. He is unable to criticize his
opinions, the goals of his training, and the

development.

on a number of issues and cannot criticize
his opinions. He possesses, furthermore, no
occupational skills. Included in this type
may be the surfer, the beatnik, or the
housewife.
A second type is proficient in various
skills and also voices opinions about cur
rent issues. His abilities may be developed
in academic or vocational skills, opening
to him occupations in engineering, medi
cine, business, law, or historical research.
But because of his "general education,"
he can set fortli views of current problems,
regardless of the area of his disciplining,
and yet he is unable to criticize his views.
A third type is capable of gaining in
sights which, regardless of his special
skills. £o beyond the realm of cultural
prejudice which grounds the opinions of
the first two. He may find difficulty with
the fact that many aspects of culture fun
damental to the lives of his contemporaries
are foreign to him.
He is unable, however, to articulate his
insight in an academic discipline and to
criticize his present difficulty and the basis
for his insight.
These personalities exemplify a problem
in contemporary education.
If that problem is to be regarded in
terms of education, training, and indoctri
nation, which of these processes do the
types exemplify? Furthfermore, we ask,
what are the processes themselves?
Instruction and Acculturation
Indoctrination is the process of leading
the individual into the acceptance of a
teaching without providing him a means of
criticizing what is taught for its truth or
validity.
The process takes two recognizable
forms: acculturation and instruction.
Acculturation brings the child to accept
the viewpoints of his culture. Instruction
is a similar process when the subject mat
ter of a discipline is given and received
uncritically.
Indoctrination as acculturation is pre
dominant in the development of the first
personality.

Setting forth opinions grounded in no
disciplined study, without any criticism, he
is the mere product of acculturation. He is
a dogmatist who maintains one point of
view and either denies the validity of all
others, or understands them only in terms
of his own.
Dogmatism and Alienation
Training is the process of learning sub
ject matter which does not in itself con
stitute a discipline, but serves as the struc
tural, operational, or communicative basis
of a discipline. Practically, training is the
acquisition of skills which are means to
ends but which are not ends in themselves.
The second person, then, is well trained,
in either academic or vocational skills. He
is also indoctrinated, first in the form of
acculturation, and secondly, if he has been
to the university, in the form of instruc
tion.
But while he may possess general or
special knowledge as well as skills, he still
harbors the same cultural prejudices as
everyone else. He is unable to criticize his
opinions, the goals of his training, and the
part training has played in his personal
development.
Lacking such critical thought, he also
holds a position of dogmatism.
The third personality differs from the
others in that, while he may be similarly
indoctrinated and trained, he is capable of
insight beyond the status quo of cultural
prejudice. His orientation toward life in
society, however, is not one of self-affirm
ing dogmatism, but what is traditionally
described as alienation.
This person is equally unable, however,
to criticize the foundations of his insight
and his alienation.
The Structure of Education
If these three personalities, the indoc
trinated, the trained, and the insightful,
are typical in our society and culture, we
want to understand whether or not any of
them are also educated.
We want to ask, in terms of the proc
esses themselves, is education merely a
name for a combination of training and in
doctrination, or for the goal of these proc
esses, or is it perhaps the process and goal
which transcends both the processes of
training and indoctrination and their
goals?
Education is a process of coming to criti
cize and understand oneself and one's cul
ture. It is dependent upon indoctrination
and training, but, as a process itself, it
goes beyond them.
Education is dependent upon indoctrina
tion in the forms of both acculturation and
instruction.
Acculturation provides the cultural sub
stance of personality which serves as sub
ject matter for the start of self-criticism
towards education itself
Instruction in knowledge made available
In the disciplines provides the basis for
criticism which pertains to the personality
but which transcends it to include criticism
of the culture as a whole.
Criticism And Prejudice
Such criticism and understanding of self
and culture is both well structured, well
grounded, and communicable.
But if education is truly to involve critic
ism and understanding and not mere preju
dice, then it must avoid indoctrination as
an end result.

Education is thus dependent upon train
ing, training in critical thought. Such critic
ism has two characteristics.
One is the recognition of one's indoctrin
ation, manifest in both forms. The other
is an act of non-attachment which allows
the individual to objectify dogma and in
doctrination.
Non-attachment is not to be understood
as a matter of removing oneself from con
cern for an issue or from involvement in
social circumstance.
Rather it is an act of non-attachment
which allows the individual to look directly
to the issue at hand, without confusing it
with his or others' personalities, enabling
him to see into the nature of the issue itself
and to see furthermore just what relation
it does have to his own life and personality.
It is as if I enable myself to watch a
play into which I project myself as a real
participant.
This act of spectating while participating
allows me to identify with the other actors
but to see at the same time just what my
relation to the other actors is, what may be
the nature of the issues under considera
tion, and what relevance they have to the
actors, this spectator included, and to the
play as a whole.
Nonattachm«>nt And Typicality
The critical person, engaging in this pro
cess, will objectify everything which he
considers "his own," every opinion, idea,
and conviction which he has received
through acculturation, whether they per
tain to his personality, his culture, or his
special discipline. He will likewise objectify
the dogma which he has received through
instruction in educational institutions.
The critical personality always asks him
self, "What it is?" He recognizes that the
natural response to that question is a dog
matic response which must in turn be
objectified in an act of nonattachment and
investigated for its truth.
His reflections upon the history and pres
ent activity of his own personality will ulti
mately coincide with his reflections upon
his culture as ho grasps personality and
culture as necessarily given together.
Engaging in this process of education,
the individual will begin to see into his
own typicality and atypicality as a member
of his culture and come to understand him
self and his culture as a whole.
Towards Self-Knowledge
The process of education then is not, as
is assumed in American universities and
today at Stanford, merely a process of
training or indoctrination as they have been
regarded.
It includes them and is dependent upon
them, but it transcends them.
Education is not a process which, from
the point of view of culture and society,
servos merely to perpetuate their status
quos, but one that allows the individual
to approach a fundamental understanding
of culture and enact real criticism of him
self and of his society.
From the point of view of the individual
personality, education is not a process
which allows for the growth of dogmatism
blinding to the intellect or alienation de
structive to personal stability, but a process
of striving toward true self-knowledge,
which develops personal depth and in
tegrity.
(Editor's note: This is the sixth in a
leisurely series of articles on education at
Stanford.)

In the American university, and at Stan
ford in particular, the distinction between
education and training is viewed as the
distinction between general study and spe
cialization, and the question of education
and indoctrination is not discussed.
I hope to show that education can be
best understood in terms of education it
self, training, and indoctrination, and that
the distinction between education and
training cannot be made in the contem
porary fashion.
The view of education which members
of the acadcmic community entertain is
the problem to which we address our
selves. But one can hardly view the prob
lem from the point of view of the problem
itself.
As a starting orientation, therefore, for
encountering this unfamiliar view of edu
cation we turn attention to three personal

society.

and yet he is unable to criticize his views.

tain to his personality, his culture, or his
special discipline. He will likewise objectify
the dogma which he has received through
instruction in educational institutions.
The critical personality always asks him
self, "What it is?" He recognizes that the
natural response to that question is a dog
matic response which must in turn be
objectified in an act of nonattachment and
investigated for its truth.
His reflections upon the history and pres
ent activity of his own personality will ulti
mately coincide with his reflections upon
his culture as ho grasps personality and
culture as necessarily given together.
Engaging in this process of education,
the individual will begin to see into his
own typicality and atypicality as a member
of his culture and come to understand him
self and his culture as a whole.
Towards Self-Knowledge
The process of education then is not, as
is assumed in American universities and
today at Stanford, merely a process of
training or indoctrination as they have been
regarded.
It includes them and is dependent upon
them, but it transcends them.
Education is not a process which, from
the point of view of culture and society,
servos merely to perpetuate their status
quos, but one that allows the individual
to approach a fundamental understanding
of culture and enact real criticism of him
self and of his society.
From the point of view of the individual
personality, education is not a process
which allows for the growth of dogmatism
blinding to the intellect or alienation de
structive to personal stability, but a process
of striving toward true self-knowledge,
which develops personal depth and in
tegrity.
