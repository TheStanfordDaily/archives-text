## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
Sponsor selection for Wilbur Hall
has hit another snag. Head sponsor
A 1 Taylor has accused faculty master
Eric Hutchinson of a breach in faith
for not accepting a selection commit
tee's list of names.
Meanwhile, Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert J. Wert issued a
statement questioning the whole role
of sponsors in freshman houses.
25 Chosen
Acording to Taylor, a selection
committee chose 25 sponsors plus al
ternates for next year after extensive
interviews, but Hutchinson contested
at least four names. Taylor said
Hutchinson indicated earlier no names

would be challenged provided proper
procedure was followed.
"Dr. Hutchinson has broken faith
with the Wilbur sponsors," Taylor
said. "He apparently has forgotten or
jettisoned statements made winter
quarter to abide by the committee's
decisions."
The sponsor selection committee of
two faculty residents, one freshman,
and four sponsors, including Taylor.
Under an agreement reached through
negotiations, Hutchinson has the
right to ask an appeal board to re
view selections he disapproves.
Hutchinson is out of town for the
week.
Dean Wert, chairman of CUE, ex
pressed alarm that few students ap

plied for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would bo
called for. In a statement to The
Daily he said:
"The Committee on Undergradu
ate Education is dismayed that only
some 50 students have applied for
25 sponsor positions in Wilbur Hall
for next year. This is less than half
as many as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one out
of two candidates raises grave ques
tions about whether the sponsor sys
tem is considered anachronistic by
today's undergraduates and whether
today's undergraduates are as genu
inely interested in the challenge of
assisting the University as they once
were.

"The Committee has heard reports
about the process leading to selection
of a recommended panel of 25 spon
sors plus alternates out of 50 appli
cants. In all probability the Commit
tee will undertake a thorough study
of this process including the criteria
established for selection, the facts
produced in forms and questionaires
used, and the desirability of being
the only university in the United
States which entrusts counselling and
advising of freshman men largely to
a group of self-perpetuating under
graduates who have insisted that only
they know enough to be experts in
picking their own successors.
"The events of tht past few weeks
have intensified the Committee's mis
givings about the process of spon
sor selection and even raise serious
questions about the continuance of
the sponsor system.
"The Commitee would be pleased
to hear the views of students and fac
ulty on this important matter."
