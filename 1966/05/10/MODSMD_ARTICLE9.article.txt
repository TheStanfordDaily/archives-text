As oi this morning, drinking
is legal at Stanford.
The new policy, passed by the
Board of Trustees last month pre
sents the immediate problem of en
forcement.
According to Joel Smith, Associate
Dean of Students, the first major un
dertaking will be the development of
house rules by the various living
groups. The Dean of Student's office
is most interested in getting some ex
perience in handling the liquor regu
lations.
The most significant development
so far, according to Dean Smith, is
the formation of the President' 6 advi
sory committee on liquor regulations.
Limited Application
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane also
reported interest in the work of the
committee. The main difficulty, he
says, is that the rules have no appli
cation to drinking outside residences
or eating clubs (i.e., hill parties on
campus or beer at Lake Lag.)
LASSU, accordingly, will watch
the commit tee's action with great in
terest to see what guidelines are
formed for the enforcement and han
dling of the liquor regulations.
