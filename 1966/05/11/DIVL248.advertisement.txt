The Honda Scrambler. Precise as a
Swiss Watch. And the most agile and
responsive machine of its type and class
ever made. The CL-77 Scrambler has
the same rugged superiority that's made
Honda a record breaker at the Grand
Prix. The twin-cylinder OHC3()5cc en
gine reaches 27 HP 8,500 rpm. Twin
carburetors perfonn with sharp smooth
acceleration on bill climbs, scrambles or
touring. Beats everything at this price!
