# LSD Fantasies Unleash Medical Horrors
## 
### KIRK HANEN Staff Editor (First in a Series 
As many as a quarter-million Americans
will embark on a very special type of "trip"
this year—one which at its best will escort
some through the vast wastelands of the hu
man mind. At its worst, it will deliver some
into mental institutions.
But no matter where the "trip" ends, LSD
will pay the freight.
Lysergic acid dyethylamide (LSD) has as
sumed a place along side the hydrogen bomb
in the thoughts of concerned Americans, and
concerned citizens of the world. Both are dy
namic, both are explosive.
But here the similarity between the two
ends. While no one doubts the destructive
powers of the H-bomb, LSD remains inside a
Pandora's Box—and medical science has yet
to raise the lid.

To some, LSD holds a key to the future. To
others, it answers some questions of the past
(many of the so-calied visions of Biblical
prophets have been attributed to the effects
of LSD).
For some, LSD is an "escape into" a new
world. For others, an "escape from" the real
world. To some, it heightens creative powers.
To others, it merely obscures barriers of
anxiety and inspires false confidence.
Discovered in Switzerland
LSD was first synthesized in Switzerland in
1938. After 28 years, medical science has made
relatively little progress toward understand
ing it. There is no evidence that LSD is phy
sically addictive —yet. The picture may change
radically when research in the psychedelies—
generic terminology for more than 80 halluco
genie ("mind-expanding") drugs — advances
past its current embryonic stage.
Most doctors agree, though, that LSD is po

tentially dangerous. If cases like that of a
five-year-old Brooklyn girl who accidently ate
an LSD-impregnated sugar cube and had to
be hospitalized for nearly a week are indica
tive of what could happen in the future, their
fears are legitimate.
Even more terrifying are the psychological
implications of the drug. Dependence on it can
be built up in the user's psyche. Taken fre
quently, larger and larger doses are required
to take-off on a psychedelic "trip."
Effects of LSD vary so greatly among users
that doctors cannot say with assurance just
what constitutes an excessive dose. What may
throw one into a catatonic stupor may only
put another nicely into "orbit."
Medical Possibilities
Though the pitfalls of LSD are only too ap
parent, it has shown itself to have some legiti
mate clinical uses, especially in the treatment
of alcoholism and psychosis.

Specialists in these fields report speeded re
covery in patients who before LSD had no re
course for insightful self-analysis. In some
cases, LSD has been used to help terminal
patients to face the end with a minimum of
mental and physical pain.
Up From The Underground
Help, hindrance, answer, anathema—what
ever LSD is, it is a part of Stanford.
A former pusher of the drug on campus
estimates that some 10 per cent of all Stan
ford undergraduates are users of LSD. The
estimate among graduate students is even
higher—about 20 per cent. Among professors,
it's anyone's guess (although reliable sources
insist that significant numbers of the faculty
are users.)
Stanford "trippens" are part of the fastest
growing radical movement ever to hit the
American college campus—the Psychedelic
Revolution. LSD will soon be as firmly en

trenched in Academe as Saturday afternoon
football, and may outlive it.
No longer are the psychedelics confined to
the shaggy-haired fringe. Their future is in
sured by the drug rage's spread from the
Bohemian left to the Ail-American Main
stream.
Why? The discerning collegiate whose hip
enough to take the trip simply won't buy the
time-worn cliches of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union.
Their "halo" effect censure of all drugs as
leading to the ultimate degradation has fallen
over its own ears and is currently somewhere
about the navel.
They realize that the now common railleries
against the so-called "living death"—heroine—
form only the most feeble of arguments
against the psychedelics.

mental and physical pain.
Up From The Underground
Help, hindrance, answer, anathema—what
ever LSD is, it is a part of Stanford.
A former pusher of the drug on campus
estimates that some 10 per cent of all Stan
ford undergraduates are users of LSD. The
estimate among graduate students is even
higher—about 20 per cent. Among professors,
it's anyone's guess (although reliable sources
insist that significant numbers of the faculty
are users.)
Stanford "trippens" are part of the fastest
growing radical movement ever to hit the
American college campus—the Psychedelic
Revolution. LSD will soon be as firmly en

trenched in Academe as Saturday afternoon
football, and may outlive it.
No longer are the psychedelics confined to
the shaggy-haired fringe. Their future is in
sured by the drug rage's spread from the
Bohemian left to the Ail-American Main
stream.
Why? The discerning collegiate whose hip
enough to take the trip simply won't buy the
time-worn cliches of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union.
Their "halo" effect censure of all drugs as
leading to the ultimate degradation has fallen
over its own ears and is currently somewhere
about the navel.
They realize that the now common railleries
against the so-called "living death"—heroine—
form only the most feeble of arguments
against the psychedelics.

PART TWO: LSD and the I*a*w.
As many as a quarter-million Americans
will embark on a very special type of "trip"
this year—one which at its best will escort
some through the vast wastelands of the hu
man mind. At its worst, it will deliver some
into mental institutions.
But no matter where the "trip" ends, LSD
will pay the freight.
Lysergic acid dyethylamide (LSD) has as
sumed a place along side the hydrogen bomb
in the thoughts of concerned Americans, and
concerned citizens of the world. Both are dy
namic, both are explosive.
But here the similarity between the two
ends. While no one doubts the destructive
powers of the H-bomb, LSD remains inside a
Pandora's Box—and medical science has yet
to raise the lid.

To some, LSD holds a key to the future. To
others, it answers some questions of the past
(many of the so-calied visions of Biblical
prophets have been attributed to the effects
of LSD).
For some, LSD is an "escape into" a new
world. For others, an "escape from" the real
world. To some, it heightens creative powers.
To others, it merely obscures barriers of
anxiety and inspires false confidence.
Discovered in Switzerland
LSD was first synthesized in Switzerland in
1938. After 28 years, medical science has made
relatively little progress toward understand
ing it. There is no evidence that LSD is phy
sically addictive —yet. The picture may change
radically when research in the psychedelies—
generic terminology for more than 80 halluco
genie ("mind-expanding") drugs — advances
past its current embryonic stage.
Most doctors agree, though, that LSD is po

tentially dangerous. If cases like that of a
five-year-old Brooklyn girl who accidently ate
an LSD-impregnated sugar cube and had to
be hospitalized for nearly a week are indica
tive of what could happen in the future, their
fears are legitimate.
Even more terrifying are the psychological
implications of the drug. Dependence on it can
be built up in the user's psyche. Taken fre
quently, larger and larger doses are required
to take-off on a psychedelic "trip."
Effects of LSD vary so greatly among users
that doctors cannot say with assurance just
what constitutes an excessive dose. What may
throw one into a catatonic stupor may only
put another nicely into "orbit."
Medical Possibilities
Though the pitfalls of LSD are only too ap
parent, it has shown itself to have some legiti
mate clinical uses, especially in the treatment
of alcoholism and psychosis.

Specialists in these fields report speeded re
covery in patients who before LSD had no re
course for insightful self-analysis. In some
cases, LSD has been used to help terminal
patients to face the end with a minimum of
mental and physical pain.
