# Draft Board's Scrutiny Halts Just At Fingertips
## 
### Associated Press 
The Selective Service System
has changed its mind and an
nounced that if a student tak
ing the forthcoming Draft De
ferment Exam doesn't want to
be fingerprinted, he won't be.
In response to protests over
the fingerprint requirement laid
down earlier, the System said
other positive identification will
be accepted. No examples were
provided, a spokesman saying
that this will be decided by sci
ence research associates which
will administer the exams.
The tests will be given May 14
and 21, June 3 and a yet un
announced date in June to the
nearly 900,000 students who
have registered. Those eligible
for the draft do not have to take
the tests, which are to be used
by local draft boards to help
determine student draft classifi
cations.
Voluntary
A bulletin of information Is
sued earlier by Selective Service
said fingerprinting of those tak
ing the tests would be required
to make certain that the draft
eligible persons only take the
tests themselves.
A spokesman for the Service
who said "we want everybody
to take the test," issued a state
ment saying:
"Use of fingerprint as a
means of identification is an ad
ministrative device, and com
pletely optional and voluntary.
"Any man who appears to
take the test and presents other
positive identification will be ad
mitted to the test wihout a
fingerprint."
Female Draftees
In other Selective Service
news, a spokesman noted that
when a girl gets a draft notice,
it probably results from a joke.
The question was raised be
cause of recent reports of girls
being ordered to take physical
examinations prior to their pos
sible induction into the Armed
Forces.
The spokesman said he has
noticed reports from time to

time that girls had been sent
draft notices. He said he guesses
this usually resulted from some
boy, as a joke, registering the
name and address of a girl.
