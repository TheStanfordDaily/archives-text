## The 						Losers' Tale 
### Bob Egelko 
The virtues of defeat are well
known by now to every ex-faith
ful reader of John R. Tunis'
books for boys, which I trust
takes in a fair percentage of the
males of Stanford. Losing builds
character. Not to mention char
acters. There is something at
tractive, let's face it, about fin
ishing on the bottom.
To a true loser, in fact, win
ning a ball game can seem as
unsatisfactory as a happy end
ing to King Lear. There is a
catharsis that simply isn't
reached.
Losing, however, is also con
sidered a bit un-American; and
there is also one's ego to attend
to. Restrained both externally
and internally, most of us must
be content to nurture our de
featist spirit by rooting for the
Mets. Or, for that matter, the
Stanford football team (which,
I am informed, is bound for
Pasadena next January; for
tunately, I won't be around to
see it).
Essence of Defeatism
However, there is another
way, possibly unique to Stan
ford. I discovered it this quarter
as a member of a softball team
called the Rennods.
Rennods, which is impossible
to spell unless you know what
it means, is, of course, Donner
spelled backwards with an "s"
tacked on.
There is no such thing as a
B softball team in the Univer
sity's egalitarian intramural
program, which means that
those house members who didn't
feel like sitting on the bench
while Donner's championship
baseball team went undefeated
were welcome to suffer together
through one of the more diffi
cult leagues on campus.
We had quite a season, under
whelming five opponents by an
aggregate score of 6 to 35. We
had the sense to forfeit the
other game.
It's Been Awhile
"My God, Bob, I haven't
played baseball since fifth
grade," was the average re
sponse to my frantic door
knocking crusade prior to our
first game. "That's all right,
come on out," I said. "We'll kill
'em." Little did I know.
So we bravely entered the
field against a dissipated look
ing crew from Engineering Me
chanics. We were up first. Our
second man singled. Our third

man doubled. That brought me
up.
"Easy man," the infield shout
ed to the pitcher. He lobbed the
ball in with the mandatory one
foot arc. Somehow I hit it into
the outfield. "Nothing to it," I
called from first base. We took
the field with a two-run lead.
The first out was recorded on
a pop fly to shortstop, with the
score six to two. "Right in
there, you've got him," I called
to our pitcher. He did, but our
infield didn't.
No Help
I believe we would have got
ten out of the inning with a lit
tle help from the umpire, but
he wouldn't let us use two extra
fielders to back up home plate
and first base.
E.M., which seemed a little
embarrassed at all the runs we
were giving them, even hit one
to the first baseman — me. I
made a diving stop, unfortunate
ly failing to notice that the ball
was headed for the second base
man, who would have thrown
to first if I had let him. Well, at
least I held them to one base.
Finally someone hit a home
run with the bases loaded to
make the score 12-2, ending the
game under the ten-run rule. It
only took us one-third of an in
ning.
With few worlds left to con
quer, we continued the season,
actually losing a few by respect
able scores — the one game I
missed was only 2-0. But our
reputation was made. Donner's
athletic chairman told me, with
justifiable pride, "That may be
the worst softball team in intra
mural history."
I don't think we were. But we
were amongst 'em.
New Heights
The penultimate game matched
the improving Rennods and un
beaten Cro Mem. It gave me new
insight into the resourcefulness
of a true loser. We led 1-0 after
four innings on what must have
been my second hit of the sea
son. Then in the fifth inning
they loaded the bases with two
out.
The next batter hit a little
pop fly, as Vin Scully would say,
halfway between the mound and
the plate. The catcher went out,
the pitcher came in, they looked
at each other, then decided the
sporting thing to do would be
to let the ball drop. One run
scored.
The catcher gave the ball to
the pitcher, who walked back
to the mound. While he was
walking, the man on third stole
home, which is illegal, of
course. Except against the Ren
nods.
With the ball game not quite
out of reach, I gained further
distinction for the team the
next inning with a sparkling
throw toward the plate. The
book says you're supposed to
aim at the cutoff man. However,
it doesn't say to hit him. Which
I did. Two runs scored.
Consolation
Actually there's value in a per
fect season such as ours. It is
good exercise. It teaches one
humility. It gives one a sense
of proportion.
As Baron de Coubertin, the
founder of the modern Olym
pics, said (as inscribed on a
plaque in my high school gym,
home of perennial last-place
basketball teams), "The essen
tial thing is not to have con
quered, but to have fought
well."
I wonder, though, what he
would have said about the Ren
nods.

a pop fly to shortstop, with the
score six to two. "Right in
there, you've got him," I called
to our pitcher. He did, but our
infield didn't.
No Help
I believe we would have got
ten out of the inning with a lit
tle help from the umpire, but
he wouldn't let us use two extra
fielders to back up home plate
and first base.
E.M., which seemed a little
embarrassed at all the runs we
were giving them, even hit one
to the first baseman — me. I
made a diving stop, unfortunate
ly failing to notice that the ball
was headed for the second base
man, who would have thrown
to first if I had let him. Well, at
least I held them to one base.
Finally someone hit a home
run with the bases loaded to
make the score 12-2, ending the
game under the ten-run rule. It
only took us one-third of an in
ning.
With few worlds left to con
quer, we continued the season,
actually losing a few by respect
able scores — the one game I
missed was only 2-0. But our
reputation was made. Donner's
athletic chairman told me, with
justifiable pride, "That may be
the worst softball team in intra
mural history."
I don't think we were. But we
were amongst 'em.
New Heights
The penultimate game matched
the improving Rennods and un
beaten Cro Mem. It gave me new
insight into the resourcefulness
of a true loser. We led 1-0 after
four innings on what must have
been my second hit of the sea
son. Then in the fifth inning
they loaded the bases with two
out.
The next batter hit a little
pop fly, as Vin Scully would say,
halfway between the mound and
the plate. The catcher went out,
the pitcher came in, they looked
at each other, then decided the
sporting thing to do would be
to let the ball drop. One run
scored.
The catcher gave the ball to
the pitcher, who walked back
to the mound. While he was
walking, the man on third stole
home, which is illegal, of
course. Except against the Ren
nods.
With the ball game not quite
out of reach, I gained further
distinction for the team the
next inning with a sparkling
throw toward the plate. The
book says you're supposed to
aim at the cutoff man. However,
it doesn't say to hit him. Which
I did. Two runs scored.
Consolation
Actually there's value in a per
fect season such as ours. It is
good exercise. It teaches one
humility. It gives one a sense
of proportion.
As Baron de Coubertin, the
founder of the modern Olym
pics, said (as inscribed on a
plaque in my high school gym,
home of perennial last-place
basketball teams), "The essen
tial thing is not to have con
quered, but to have fought
well."
I wonder, though, what he
would have said about the Ren
nods.
The virtues of defeat are well
known by now to every ex-faith
ful reader of John R. Tunis'
books for boys, which I trust
takes in a fair percentage of the
males of Stanford. Losing builds
character. Not to mention char
acters. There is something at
tractive, let's face it, about fin
ishing on the bottom.
To a true loser, in fact, win
ning a ball game can seem as
unsatisfactory as a happy end
ing to King Lear. There is a
catharsis that simply isn't
reached.
Losing, however, is also con
sidered a bit un-American; and
there is also one's ego to attend
to. Restrained both externally
and internally, most of us must
be content to nurture our de
featist spirit by rooting for the
Mets. Or, for that matter, the
Stanford football team (which,
I am informed, is bound for
Pasadena next January; for
tunately, I won't be around to
see it).
Essence of Defeatism
However, there is another
way, possibly unique to Stan
ford. I discovered it this quarter
as a member of a softball team
called the Rennods.
Rennods, which is impossible
to spell unless you know what
it means, is, of course, Donner
spelled backwards with an "s"
tacked on.
There is no such thing as a
B softball team in the Univer
sity's egalitarian intramural
program, which means that
those house members who didn't
feel like sitting on the bench
while Donner's championship
baseball team went undefeated
were welcome to suffer together
through one of the more diffi
cult leagues on campus.
We had quite a season, under
whelming five opponents by an
aggregate score of 6 to 35. We
had the sense to forfeit the
other game.
It's Been Awhile
"My God, Bob, I haven't
played baseball since fifth
grade," was the average re
sponse to my frantic door
knocking crusade prior to our
first game. "That's all right,
come on out," I said. "We'll kill
'em." Little did I know.
So we bravely entered the
field against a dissipated look
ing crew from Engineering Me
chanics. We were up first. Our
second man singled. Our third

man doubled. That brought me
up.
"Easy man," the infield shout
ed to the pitcher. He lobbed the
ball in with the mandatory one
foot arc. Somehow I hit it into
the outfield. "Nothing to it," I
called from first base. We took
the field with a two-run lead.
The first out was recorded on
a pop fly to shortstop, with the
score six to two. "Right in

As Baron de Coubertin, the

I wonder, though, what he
would have said about the Ren

The virtues of defeat are well
known by now to every ex-faith

books for boys, which I trust
takes in a fair percentage of the
males of Stanford. Losing builds
character. Not to mention char
acters. There is something at
tractive, let's face it, about fin
ishing on the bottom.
To a true loser, in fact, win
ning a ball game can seem as
unsatisfactory as a happy end
ing to King Lear. There is a
catharsis that simply isn't
reached.
Losing, however, is also con
sidered a bit un-American; and
there is also one's ego to attend
to. Restrained both externally
and internally, most of us must
be content to nurture our de
featist spirit by rooting for the
Mets. Or, for that matter, the
Stanford football team (which,
I am informed, is bound for
Pasadena next January; for
tunately, I won't be around to
see it).
Essence of Defeatism
However, there is another
way, possibly unique to Stan
ford. I discovered it this quarter
as a member of a softball team
called the Rennods.
Rennods, which is impossible
to spell unless you know what
it means, is, of course, Donner
spelled backwards with an "s"
tacked on.
There is no such thing as a
B softball team in the Univer
sity's egalitarian intramural
program, which means that
those house members who didn't
feel like sitting on the bench
while Donner's championship
baseball team went undefeated
were welcome to suffer together
through one of the more diffi
cult leagues on campus.
We had quite a season, under
whelming five opponents by an
aggregate score of 6 to 35. We
had the sense to forfeit the
other game.
It's Been Awhile
"My God, Bob, I haven't
played baseball since fifth
grade," was the average re
sponse to my frantic door
knocking crusade prior to our
first game. "That's all right,
come on out," I said. "We'll kill
'em." Little did I know.
So we bravely entered the
field against a dissipated look
ing crew from Engineering Me
chanics. We were up first. Our
second man singled. Our third

man doubled. That brought me
up.
"Easy man," the infield shout
ed to the pitcher. He lobbed the
ball in with the mandatory one
foot arc. Somehow I hit it into
the outfield. "Nothing to it," I
called from first base. We took
the field with a two-run lead.
The first out was recorded on
a pop fly to shortstop, with the
score six to two. "Right in
there, you've got him," I called
to our pitcher. He did, but our
infield didn't.
No Help
I believe we would have got
ten out of the inning with a lit
tle help from the umpire, but
he wouldn't let us use two extra
fielders to back up home plate
and first base.
E.M., which seemed a little
embarrassed at all the runs we
were giving them, even hit one
to the first baseman — me. I
made a diving stop, unfortunate
ly failing to notice that the ball
was headed for the second base
man, who would have thrown
to first if I had let him. Well, at
least I held them to one base.
Finally someone hit a home
run with the bases loaded to
make the score 12-2, ending the
game under the ten-run rule. It
only took us one-third of an in
ning.
With few worlds left to con
quer, we continued the season,
actually losing a few by respect
able scores — the one game I
missed was only 2-0. But our
reputation was made. Donner's
athletic chairman told me, with
justifiable pride, "That may be
the worst softball team in intra
mural history."
I don't think we were. But we
were amongst 'em.
New Heights
The penultimate game matched
the improving Rennods and un
beaten Cro Mem. It gave me new
insight into the resourcefulness
of a true loser. We led 1-0 after
four innings on what must have
been my second hit of the sea
son. Then in the fifth inning
they loaded the bases with two
out.
The next batter hit a little
pop fly, as Vin Scully would say,
halfway between the mound and
the plate. The catcher went out,
the pitcher came in, they looked
at each other, then decided the
sporting thing to do would be
to let the ball drop. One run
scored.
The catcher gave the ball to
the pitcher, who walked back
to the mound. While he was
walking, the man on third stole
home, which is illegal, of
course. Except against the Ren
nods.
With the ball game not quite
out of reach, I gained further
distinction for the team the
next inning with a sparkling
throw toward the plate. The
book says you're supposed to
aim at the cutoff man. However,
it doesn't say to hit him. Which
I did. Two runs scored.
Consolation
Actually there's value in a per
fect season such as ours. It is
good exercise. It teaches one
humility. It gives one a sense
of proportion.
