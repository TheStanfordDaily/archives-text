# Osborne States Pills Prescribed Before '62
## 
### 
Individual doctors within the Uni
versity Health Service prescribed
contraceptives to unmarried Stanford
coeds until 1962, according to Health
Service Executive Director Maurice
M. Osborne.
This information came in response
to questioning by The Daily about a
letter from a 1960 Stanford graduate
which appears on Page 6 of today's
paper.
The letter reads, in part:
"When I was at Stanford in the
late 1950'5, it was taken for granted
that birth control devices were avail
able for the asking at the student
clinic .... Although the pills were
not in general distribution at the
time, on one occasion I was supplied
with Enovid when I explained to the
doctor that I was expecting my boy
friend to visit for a week .... This
was not just one doctor, but was gen
eral policy within the clinic."
No Dispensing
According to Osborne, some Health
Service doctors occasionally pre
scribed birth control devices and pills
then, but did not dispense them.
Moreover, he said, the Health Serv
ice at the time had no specific or gen
eral policy on contraceptive. "It had
been left up to the individual doctor
to practice medicine to the best in
terest of each student patient as he
saw it," Osborne expalined.
In 1962, numerous complaints were
received from parents, religious
groups and alumni, Osborne said,
when a freshman woman who had
been prescribed oral contraceptives
by a Health Service doctor told other
women on her corridor about her ease
in obtaining the pills.
"Instead of keeping it on an indi
vidual doctor-patient relationship, this
particular patient apparently had
neurotic needs to exhibit the fact that
she had gotten a contraceptive pre
scription," Osborne said.
"Not surprisingly, other girls in
the freshman dorm were upset
enough to write or talk with parents
who felt strongly about the matter."
Pressure
Public pressure was exerted on the
administration, he explained, and
President Wallace Sterling directed
the eHalth Service to suspend any
further involvement in birth control.
The policy of complete noninvolve
ment lasted until late in 1963, when
Osborne successfully requested Ster
ling to allow the Health Service to
prescribe contraceptives to married
coeds.
Then, in a memo dated Nov. 11,
1963, Frederic O. Glover, Executive
Assistant to President Sterling, in
formed Osborne that:
"[Birth control] advice and mater
ials can be given at the Health Serv
ice to women students who demon

strate imminent intent to marry, and
that prior obtaining of a marriage
certificate, which is required by State
law, will be considered satisfactory
evidence of imminent intent."
In addition, the Health Service now
will discuss birth control with any
student, and will refer unmarried
coeds to private doctors from whom
they may obtain contraceptives.
Student Vote
In the ASSU elections April 20-21,
the student body voted 1866 to 853 to
urge that the Health Service "be
authorized to prescribe contraceptives
to any student desiring them."
The referendum was placed on the
ballot after the Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum (SSRF) collected 650
student signatures on a petition ask
ing that the matter be brought to a
vote.
After the vote, Dean of Undergrad
uate Education Robert J. Wert said
the administration had "no intention
whatsoever" of changing present con
traceptive policy.
Osborne said he felt the vote could
not "of itself change the policy at the
present time.
"I cannot alter the policy unilater
ally, any more than this student vote,"
he continued. "A much wider con
sensus will be needed in order to
effect any viable policy change."
Discussion
He added that he welcomed "open
minded discussion of the issues with
students, faculty and administration,
parents and others legitimately con
cerned."
Osborne, UCCM Campus Minister
Dick Roe, and a representative of the
SSRF will participate in a panel dis
cussion on "The Pill: A Question of
Responsibility" at 8 p.m. tomorrow in
the large lounge of Tresidder Union.

After the vote, Dean of Undergrad

"I cannot alter the policy unilater

he continued. "A much wider con

He added that he welcomed "open

Individual doctors within the Uni
versity Health Service prescribed
contraceptives to unmarried Stanford
coeds until 1962, according to Health
Service Executive Director Maurice
M. Osborne.
This information came in response
to questioning by The Daily about a
letter from a 1960 Stanford graduate
which appears on Page 6 of today's
paper.
The letter reads, in part:
"When I was at Stanford in the
late 1950'5, it was taken for granted
that birth control devices were avail
able for the asking at the student
clinic .... Although the pills were
not in general distribution at the
time, on one occasion I was supplied
with Enovid when I explained to the
doctor that I was expecting my boy
friend to visit for a week .... This
was not just one doctor, but was gen
eral policy within the clinic."
No Dispensing
According to Osborne, some Health
Service doctors occasionally pre
scribed birth control devices and pills
then, but did not dispense them.
Moreover, he said, the Health Serv
ice at the time had no specific or gen
eral policy on contraceptive. "It had
been left up to the individual doctor
to practice medicine to the best in
terest of each student patient as he
saw it," Osborne expalined.
In 1962, numerous complaints were
received from parents, religious
groups and alumni, Osborne said,
when a freshman woman who had
been prescribed oral contraceptives
by a Health Service doctor told other
women on her corridor about her ease
in obtaining the pills.
"Instead of keeping it on an indi
vidual doctor-patient relationship, this
particular patient apparently had
neurotic needs to exhibit the fact that
she had gotten a contraceptive pre
scription," Osborne said.
"Not surprisingly, other girls in
the freshman dorm were upset
enough to write or talk with parents
who felt strongly about the matter."
Pressure
Public pressure was exerted on the
administration, he explained, and
President Wallace Sterling directed
the eHalth Service to suspend any
further involvement in birth control.
The policy of complete noninvolve
ment lasted until late in 1963, when
Osborne successfully requested Ster
ling to allow the Health Service to
prescribe contraceptives to married
coeds.
Then, in a memo dated Nov. 11,
1963, Frederic O. Glover, Executive
Assistant to President Sterling, in
formed Osborne that:
"[Birth control] advice and mater
ials can be given at the Health Serv
ice to women students who demon

strate imminent intent to marry, and
that prior obtaining of a marriage
certificate, which is required by State
law, will be considered satisfactory
evidence of imminent intent."
In addition, the Health Service now
will discuss birth control with any
student, and will refer unmarried
coeds to private doctors from whom
they may obtain contraceptives.
Student Vote
In the ASSU elections April 20-21,
the student body voted 1866 to 853 to
urge that the Health Service "be
authorized to prescribe contraceptives
to any student desiring them."
The referendum was placed on the
ballot after the Stanford Sexual
Rights Forum (SSRF) collected 650
student signatures on a petition ask
ing that the matter be brought to a
vote.
After the vote, Dean of Undergrad
uate Education Robert J. Wert said
