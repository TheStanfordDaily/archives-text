# Cricketeers Win Fifth Over SJS
## 
### 
Stanford's cricket eleven
took the easiest victory of its
unbeaten season here Sunday
when outstanding bowling and
good fielding kept the San Jose
State club down to a bare 50
runs to Stanford's 51 for 3 wick
ets.
San Jose fell quickly under
Stanford's spin attack which
means slower bowling with
more curve off the pitch. Stan
ford's Anil Desai got a phenom
enal 5 wickets in 6 runs while
co-bowler Kazi Ahmed downed
2 in 3 runs.
Andrew Ma led the winners'
batting with 21 runs. Graham
Black followed with 10 and An

The eleven travels to Golden
Gate Park this Sunday to meet
