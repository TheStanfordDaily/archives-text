# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The
						Hairy Case Of A Locky London Lad 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
It is more regrettable than
astonishing that personnel of
the Stanford Department of
Athletics and a few outsiders
have attempted to influence
Patrick Morrison in his choice
of hinsute apparel. One can
surely see that Mr. Morrison is
aware of contemporary atti
tudes of dress, that he has
chosen his style thoughtfully,
and is courageous enough to
speak out his disapproval of en
forced conformity.
If Morrison indeed "made the
decision himself to join the
track team" does it follow that:
"therefore hfc has to comply
with the rules of his member
ship"? What rules, and who ar
ticulates and formalizes such
procedures? In what ways has
Morrison outraged the public
decency that he must be
brought to heel?
Remember that longer hair is
"in" in Great Britain. How un
diplomatic we are, if we allow
this criticism from a quasi-offi
cial source to go unchallenged,
especially when its target is a
guest in this country.
I view with concern the ac
tions of the Department of Ath
letics, particularly when as in
this case they concern a social
attitude which seems entirely
unrelated to the spirit of disci
plined competition and free
scholarship. I hope Morrison
will be neither frightened nor
discouraged, but will live un
shorn to run another day.

• Defense Of Jordan
Editor, The Daily:
In defense of Coach Jordan's
stand, it is my opinion that the
issue is totally out of propor
tion and is getting worse. I do
not condone the presure exerted
by the alumni's money, but the
department could not exist
without financial support. Nei
ther do I agree that Morrison is
"right" in his stand on an open
"hair" policy.
Sure it is his individual right
to have his hair as long as he
wishes. But it is also true that
he let down his teammates by
not following his coaches' wish
es.
I'm sure that his hair has
nothing to do with his athletic
performance. But it seems that
he is totally selfish in his atti
tude. He is making the whole
issue absurd.
Why, if it is such a "trivial"
thing, couldn't he have swal
lowed a little selfish pride to in
sure the success of the whole
teams' performance?
I would think that "individu
ality" can be asserted in many

ways other than letting one's
hair grow to any length imagi
nable. Big deal. Anyone can let
his or her hair grow to any
length, and get lots of attention
in the process, especially if its
the "in" thing to do, and repre
sents the "poor," neglected,
idealistic, rebellious "student"
image which is so "in" today.
But I would submit that to
be a "real" leader takes more
"hair" than this. It takes the
ability to be "humble" and have
"grace," and to compromise
some of those little "trivial"
things to achieve some higher
"ideal."
If Morrison is such a "leader",
both on and off the athletic
field, why couldn't he 6how
some real "hair" and exhibit
real "sportsmanship." From his
actions and his verbal comments
I would think that he has no
"respect" for his coach, nor for
his team which elected him cap
tain. Maybe it doesn't take any
"hair" to grow hair.

• London Crew-Cut
Editor, The Daily:
"Morrison's fate" resulted
from the pressures within
American society that seek con
formity in all spheres of life.
That the alumni should bother
to worry their shorn heads
about the connotations that oth
ers might attack to a long
haired athlete is illustrative of
the insecurity from which this
drive for conformity stems. On
what grounds do these egotisti
cal men and their university
lackeys presume to reduce the
individual to a uniform plucked
chicken?
Stanford's unilateral declara
tion of conformity has interest
ing parallels. Should the British
public complain about the crew
cut Yalies who lead the Oxford
crew to victory on the Thames?
Are the Stanford students who
study at the English campus
aware of the possible subversive
effects of Levis on the inhabi
tants of 'Robin Hood' country?

• What Price Athletics ?
Editor, The Daily:
It would be improper for me
to pronounce on the merits of
the Payton Jordan-Pat Morrison
incident without a fuller knowl
edge of the facts. The story as
originally reported will doubt
less provide ammunition for
those who say (unjustly, I
think) that Stanford has not
really changed at all; that it is
still the Farm, still the "old

Stanford" of bland comfort and
conformity.
Bad publicity, perhaps. Yet
the episode may prove of value
in bringing to the surface facul
ty and student attitudes toward
a big-time athletic policy, and
so provoke a debate long over
due.
I am not proposing the aboli
tion of athletics. I think there
is much to say for the expensive
Harvard-Yale system that ex
tends team athletic facilities to a
much larger number of stu
dents.
And I do not for the moment
speak of intrinsic evils humili
ating to a scholarly community
—the Buck of the Month Club,
frenzied recruiting, the bad aca
demic publicity of "nationally
visible" athletic success, prefer
ential admissions, out-of-season
practice and overlong practice
sessions in season, most of all
the extreme demands put on the
time and energy of athletes
who may be in academic diffi
culties.
All these matters must even
tually be faced openly by a uni
versity that wants to be among
the best.
The broader and seldom-men
tioned issue is the effect of ath
letic policy on "community
standards". I recall a Univer
sity of California coach saying
with pride that none of his ath
letes had been involved in the
Berkeley protests. I suspect he
was not unrepresentative.
The athletic establishment in
most major universities — and
this includes of course those
alumni who maintain a lifelong
concern for athletic prestige —
tends more than other groups to
admire and encourage the "pre
sentable" student, the well
groomed, gregarious, unintel
-1 e c t u a 1 or anti - intellectual
young man who will someday
effortlessly accept a corporate
image.
I do not want to suggest that
all or even most Stanford ath
letes fit this stereoype. Many of
our student-athletes are simply
too intelligent to submit to lives
of such quiet desperation. But I
do believe any athletic establish
ment as such is likely to be a
retarding force, and likely to ex
ert a conformist influence on
the students it deals with.
This is true not merely be
cause of the establishment's in
ner membership, but because the
pressures brought to bear on it
come from forces that are not
turly intellectual, forces and
persons not likely to respect ei
ther genuine individualism or
adventurous thought.

• What's In The 'Air?
Editor, The Daily:
I have frequently been out
raged by the juvenile behavior
of administrators at the high
school level in regard to that
thorn in the flesh, "personal ap
pearance," but I would have ex
pected university administrators
to have outgrown it.
What is it that blows in the
wind about Pat Morrison's hair
that so frigthens alumni and
bureaucrats alike? Is it dan
druff, or merely Freedom?

• Dear Coach . . .
Editor, The Daily:
This is an open letter to Track
Coach Pay ton Jordan:
Track has always appealed to
me as a sport where individual
dedication and performance
were highly regarded. Track
seemed to have less "jockism"
and conformity requirements
than any other major sport.
Considering your role in the
"Great Hair Affair" involving
Pat Morrison, Stanford's out
standing freshman dashman,
you apparently don't agree.
I appreciate the Athletic De
partment's desire to have its
traveling athletes dress and be
have in fairly respectable man
ners. Loud and obnoxious foot
ball players are unpleasant to a
lot of us (likewise for barefoot
students in classrooms and boys
with Shrimpton cuts in the Un
ion). But length of hair among
college males is in a state of
flux—and it's generally a minor
problem in the grand scheme of
things.
I'm sure that Morrison gets
a tremendous amount of static
from his teammates. The fact
that he doesn't think hair length
is important in running fast
may be aerodynamieally debata
ble, but his stand on principle
should be encouraged. Some of
his teammates are, after all,
just little boys and don't appre
ciate either differences in view
point or diversity. But you, Mr.
Jordan, presumably should
know better.
The presumption was that
Morrison would get a haircut
due to conforming pressures in
the fine American tradition; he
apparently can't see it that
way. Now it's time for you and
the rest of the kids on the team
to forget it. At least the fact

that Morrison's absence from
the freshman team Saturday
brought on a loss of five points
should impress somebody.
I have always thought that
you made a commendable effort
towards building team spirit,
Mr. Jordan. But don't you think
that you should try to get back
to the fundamentals, like en
couraging individuals to per
form us to their highest capa
cities and to respect diversity,
general values in all fields at
Stanford. Forget about the
greasy kidstuff. Otherwise, you
belong in the bush leagues.

• The Handbook Myth
Editor, The Daily:
The Morrison - Jo r d a n (or
should I say Morrison-alumni?)
conflict has confused me with
regard to the aims and princi
ples of this university. So I
spent yesterday afternoon seek
ing clarification in The Stanford
Handbook.
Page 4 began with, "Stanford
is a time of transition and ex
perimentation. It is the time to
try out various identities and
attempt to discover which self
you prefer."
On page 9, I read, ". . . from
this pioneer beginning has
sprung a quality of independ
ence which is intangible but
which, nevertheless, is really the
University's strongest tradition.
It means that Stanford keeps an
alert mind, is willing to follow
untried ways, and—above all
places a high value on the worth
of the individual."
The chapter entitled "An In
dependent University" began
with, "As an independent uni
versity, Stanford is entirely free
of political, sectarian, or other
forms of formal external influ
ence."
Perhaps it is a measure of
my confusion that I would con
sider the Buck Club a form of
"formal external influence." Or
perhaps my confusion results
from a failure to realize that
Stanford athletes must follow
an additional set of rules. For,
according to Mr. Jordan, they
must "accept the responsibility
that comes with representing
Stanford."
But don't all students, even
those who aren't athletes, repre
sent the university? And if this
is so, shouldn't we all cut our
hairs, shave our beards, etc?
And if this is so, shouldn't
someone write a new hand
book?
JEFF KANE
• ROTC Incognito ?
Editor, The Daily:
For some time I have sus
pected that the athletic coaches
and the ROTC officers are in
fact the same people.
If Mr. Morrison chooses to ap
pear in long hair, or, for that
matter, to carry a parasol, it is
primarily his own business.
It is somewhat amusing that
anyone should feel his mascul
inity threatened by the exist
ence of Mr. Morrison's hair.
There appears to be some
doubt as to what or who is 'rep
resented" by a Stanford ath
letic team. If in fact these teams
represent the alumni or the
"Stanford tradition", then it is
unlikely that they represent the
present students and faculty. If
they represent the students,
then unquestionably Mr. Morri
son's faction is under-repre
sented.
Many of the finest professors
and students have never felt
"represented" to the slightest
degree by any Stanford athletic
endeavor.
The increasing feeling among
many is that ROTC and the
jocks constitute a sort of Stan
ford Circus. Next year David
Harris might well spend a few
moments in publicly embarrass
ing them, pursuant to their exile
to the Big Ten or elsewhere.
One suspects that the con
siderable courage with which
Stanford confronted the Moth
ers' Club will to no small de
gree vanish before the insecure
wailers for the hairy chest.

• Man's Last Hope
Editor, The Daily:
More insidious than the anci
ent custom of making a sixth
sex of eunuchs, is modern wo
man's psychological emascula
tion of man. The castration com
plex is hydra-headed, but is
most manifest in delilahism—
the shaving and clipping of men
to make them like girls. Delilah
did in Sampson in ont stroke,
but today women make us do
ourselves in imperceptibly with
many strokes. Long live the dif
ference!
Ringling to the contrary, the
beard is the one way men can
decently proclaim their sex.
With women dressed shapeless
ly, swaggering in pants and
short hair, the unshorn head
and chin is man's last best
hope. True some women wear
long hair and are beginning to
wear beard wigs. But at least
the unshorn man can pull and
pluck them.
History is clear. Jesus and

Lincoln wore beards. Orgiastic
Rome fell beardless into dust.
As for communism, unwritten
law calls on party-members to
be clean shaven. And those few
Chinese Reds plotting behind
thin beards, would be exposed
by the hair suite that hirsute
Americans mighl wear.
But we must be considerate
of timorous age and beardless
youth. Let the old sport bald
ness and receding hairlines, and
the young grow long whatever
hair they have. In the meantime
wear wigs. Long live Washing
ton!
For leadership look to the
universities where the hairs of
freedom grow. True, henpecked
pedants may tout Wittgenstein
and Salinger over Socrates and
the Bald Bearded Bard. But
someone must act! already
coeds plot beard burnings. What
next The stocks? Hangings by
beard?
Surely we can count on the
military and athletic depart
ments to protect the male image.
I see men, standing at atten
tion, beards to the ground, men
running, locks blowing in the
wind. Long may they wave!
Not that we should act die
tatorially. Mass pressure to con
form is more democratic. Nor
be too open. Points for character
and leadership measured objec
tively by hair length will con
ceal the odor of morality be
neath the mask of science.
Men of the world arise! You
have only your hair to grow!

• Masculinity ?

What's wrong with masculini
ty today? Have men no pride
in being male?

• Fundamental Issue
Editor, The Dally:
Pat Morrison's dismissal from
the freshman track team be
cause of his refusal to cut his
hair brings into the open a fun
damental issue.
Does the athletic department
of Stanford University have the
right and/or obligation to dic
tate the specific image which an
athlete must present to the
public?
We recognize the value of a
team and team unity, but we
feel that true team unity and
spirit comes from mutual re
spect and encouragement of the
individuals comprising the team,
rather than a superimposed set
of values from without.
All that should be expected
of a member of the team is that
he compete to the best of his
ability, follow training rules per
taining to his athletic perform
ance, and conribute to the win
ning attitude of the team.
In no way did Pat Morrison
violate these criteria of team
membership as evidenced by his
freshman records in the 100, 220,
and as anchor man of the 440
relay team, by his willingness
to practice and by his election
as co-captain of the team.
Thus his dismissal from the
team stems from a totally ir
relevant base. In light of this
we ask the Athletic Department
change the policy in which it
dictates the image Stanford's
athletes must project.

• Shocking!
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's report in the New
York Times about Pat Morrison
is shocking! For the first time
in my life I've felt ashamed of
my connection with Stanford.
Since when is Stanford presum
ing to mold the image of its
students?
In the future any alumni
fund raisers that approach me
might have to show that they
are dressed and groomed in a
way that strikes my fancy—and
for all they know this might
mean having hair in the first
place, being barefoot, and wear
ing terrycloth kilts! They might
also have to assure me that
Payton Jordan has been dis
missed.

• Boy Scout Image
Editor, The Daily:
The sight of alumni, sports
writers, and track coaches con
cerning themselves with one
sprinter's haircut would be
merely ridiculous if it were not
also alarming.
Are we really to suppose it is
a "rule of membership" on the
Stanford track team that hair
is not to exceed a certain
length? Especially alarming is
the argument that members of
the team, by accepting "free
meals" and wearing the "Stan
ford uniform," have given up
their rights of personal choice
in matters unrelated to their
performance in track. Surely
the view of college athletes as
post-adolescent Boy Scouts is, or
ought to be, a thing of the past.
Morrison deserves full sup

port for his independence and
good sense.

• BAC Sore Spot
Editor, The Daily:
I was not entirely satisfied
with Tuesday's editorial discus
sion of Pat Morrison. I think
the most interesting aspect of
the issue, was not considered:
the policy that kept Morrison
from running Saturday was not
only immoral; it is stupid. The
BAC, in yielding to pressure
from "rich" alumni, has cut ite
own throat.
That Stanford lost a track
meet solely because Morrison
was not allowed to compete is
an example of the absurdity and
ultimately of the destructive
ness that results from basing
University policy on the whims
—or even on the considered
opinions—of men and women
whose only present connections
with the University are a long
expired student body card and
the money they give (or do not
give) to their alma mater.
I would not deny any man
his measure of nostalgia, but I
object violently when he drags
in me and my peers and at
tempts to cram his nostalgia
down our throats.
The results of this year's
ASSU presidential election indi
cate that Stanford students of
1966 are not especially repulsed
by long hair.
Who is, then?
John Hall certainly is, both
as a Stanford alumnus and as
a sportswriter.
And there are hundreds of
John Halls—insurance salesmen,
stockbrokers, missile engineers
—who feel the same way as he.
Their opinions are sacred as all
opinions are sacred. But these
sacred opinions simply cannot
be allowed to determine Univer
sity policy of 1966.
These "sensible and rational
people," contemporaries and de
scendants of the formulators of
the clean-cut image, have dem
onstrated their brand of ration
ality by throwing away a track
meet for the sake of winning a
beauty contest on the cinders.
For which there is unfortunate
ly no trophy.
The ugly fact is that Morri
son has the upper hand. He is
a good runner. The rich alumni
cannot afford to toss him off if
they have any commitment to
victory. And he will do nothing
so convenient as cutting his
hair. He will instead remain a
very sore spot in the BAC's tro
phy case until the expired stu
dent body cards wake up to the
foolishness they are perpetua
ting.
