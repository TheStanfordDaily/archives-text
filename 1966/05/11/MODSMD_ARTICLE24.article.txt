# Pills And Public Pressure
## 
### 
The revelation that the Health Service's ban
on prescribing contraceptives came about as a
result of pressure from groups outside the Uni
versity sheds a new light on Stanford's birth
control controversy.
What it means, in short, is that the adminis
tration once again has formulated a policy in
the best interests of public relations rather
than in the best interests of the University.
Dan Endsley, editor of Stanford Review and
a member of the Class of 1947, said recently
that to achieve quality, a university must have
money, and to attract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public image. True, to a
point. But "greatness," if you'll pardon the ex
pression, is a commodity that neither money
nor a "good image" can buy. It does require an
outstanding faculty, a good physical plant, and
an intelligent student body—all of which Stan
ford has. But it also requires something more,
something which Stanford does not have. The
missing ingredient? A situation in which the
central concern of the community is the enlight

enment and well-being of its members without
regard to what the outside world, in its fre
quent narrow-mindedness, may think—an at
mosphere in which ideas and practices are
debated on their merits, and not on their reper
cussions.
And so, when the President's Office out
lawed Health Service contraceptive traffic in
response to complaints of parents, alumni, and
religious groups, it acted with a half-closed
mind—a mind sensitive to finance, and ignor
ant of feeling. It paved the way for PACE, and
blocked the road to genuine understanding;
it deepened the "void at the center" of which
Professor Rhinelander has written.
This new information, we think, provides
sufficient grounds on which to call for a com
plete re-evaluation of a mal-created contra
ceptive policy. But more importantly, it rein
forces the conclusion that real progress toward
quality in the University, if it is ever to come
about, will be achieved in spite of, and not
because of, an unreceptive administration.
