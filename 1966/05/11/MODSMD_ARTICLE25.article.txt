## MIT Discontinues CIA Work 
### 
Our congratulations to the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology for announcing that it
will cut its connections with the
CIA at the end of June. Other
eminent and respectable univer
sities that have formed liaisons
with this shady character should
cut theirs.
Since 1951, MIT has had a
Center of International Studies,
established with the help of a
$300,000 CIA grant. Research
done there has been mostly in
Communist affairs. About a
sixth of the center's $750,000 an
nual budget has lately been paid
by the CIA, and this relation
ship is being reluctantly sev
ered. an MIT spokesman says,

for "practical not moral rea
sons." The CIA link, he said,
had been misunderstood and
caused confusion and embarrass
ment in India and other nations
where MIT works on economic
development programs.
No matter that MlT's work
for the CIA was strictly aca
demic at research at Cambridge
which the university insisted
upon the right to publish—the
CIA has a reputation so dark
and spooky that it was hardly
to be expected that the school
should escape being embar
rassed.
It has now been disclosed that
Stanford University has an en
gineering contract with CIA.

The university's engineering de
partment contends that this is
entirely respectable engineering
research. But the university
may find, as MIT has found,
that its contract is an embar
rassment which will cost Stan
ford loss of prestige and respect
among those of its students who
come from foreign countries
where the ClA's name is reviled.
The Harvard rule, as we have
said before, is the beet rule: no
direct contacts between the uni
versity and the CIA, but a right
of individual scholars to work
for and consult with it, at their
own discretion.
