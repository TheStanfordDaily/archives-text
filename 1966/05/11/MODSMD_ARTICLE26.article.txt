## Since When A Ban On Pills? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have been reading with in
terest the controversy over the
distribution of birth control in
formation and contraceptives on
the Stanford Campus. I simply
cannot imagine what all the
fuss is about.
When I was at Stanford in
the late 1950's, it was taken for
granted that birth control de
vices were available for the ask
ing at the student clinic. I re
member my first brush with
this was during my freshman
year when one of the doctors
informed me that as much as he
deplored premarital sex, he was
even more distressed by the
idea of illegitimate children, and
that if I ever needed any help
to apply to the Clinic. Although
I was somewhat surprised at the
time, I remembered his words
gratefully a year or so later and
was fitted for a diaphram there
at the clinic. To my certain
knowledge, so were a dozen or
so other girls of my acquaint
ance.
Although the pills were not in
general distribution at that
time, on one occasion I was sup
plied with Enovid when I ex
plained to the doctor that I was
expecting my boy friend to visit
for a week, and asked his help
In delaying my period.
This was not just one doctor,
but was general policy within
the clinic.
I cannot believe that Stanford
has changed that much.
I suspect that certain mem
bers of the Sexual Freedom
group have forgotten what most
women know instinctively (and
pity them if they don't): that it
Is much easier to get things by
request than by demand. I also
suspect that there are hundreds
of girls on campus who are curs
ing the publicity given to this
affair which has forced the ad
ministration to take a stand,
and interfered with the quiet
distribution of the very materi
als which are being so vocifer
ously demanded.

• Birth Control Methods
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter about contra
ceptives by John D. Black,
Counseling and Testing Center,
contains a paragraph that could
give rise to misunderstanding
with serious consequences. He
writes that "any woman can
purchase, without prescription,
in any good drug store, contra
ceptive preparations that are
far superior (boldface ours) in
safety and convenience to the
mechanical devices which have
improved family planning meas
urably for many years."
The only preparations this
could mean are the various va
ginal foams, suppositories, jel
lies, and creams. Experience and
careful experimentation over
the years have shown that such
preparations improve the relia
bility of vaginal diaphragms
and similar protective devices,
and they also provide an addi
tional safeguard in conjunction
with the condom. However, it is
generally agreed that they are
not as dependable when used
alone.
The methods that, when used
correctly, offer nearly complete
protection are: (1) diaphragm
plus vaginal jelly; (2) condom
plus vaginal jelly; (3) plastic
intrauterine devices; (4) oral
contraceptive pills. All these
methods except the second re
quire initial attention by a phy
sician. The pills, of course, are
not effective at all unless they
are taken faithfully on a regu
lar daily schedule for most of
every month.
Authoritative medical infor
mation about contraception can
be found in many books avail
able at libraries and book stores.
Especially recommended are The
Compile Book of Birth Control
(Ballantine Books, N.Y.) and
The Consumers Union Report, on
Family Planning (Consumers
Union of U.S., Mount Vernon,
N.Y.), both written by A. Gutt
macher, M.D.
We wish to stress that con
traception, regardless of the
method, is a medical problem.

Those who have decided to em
ploy a contraceptive procedure
should not have to depend upon
hearsay or non-expert advice. A
physician's counsel should be
sought, inside or outside of the
University administrative struc
ture.

• Mourning The Farm
Editor, The Daily:
Upon picking up a copy of the
L. A. Titmes April 30 I noticed
with some degree of sadness
that the students of one of Our
Nation's two greatest univers
ities thought so little about the
course of their education that
only 40 per cent of them voted
for a student body president—
and of those who did, most
voted for a spokesman divorc
ing himself from those princi
ples which throughout history
have made men, universities,
and nations great.
It is interesting to note that
the winner ran "as a symbolic
protest". To the reader it would
appear that this approach en
tails considerable amounts of
profound thinking and protest
ing, without a second thought
given to honest discussion, hard
work and practical application.
I can't help but think that
Stanford students are either
smitten by the "romance" of
the longhaired, bearded and
wire-rim spectacled set that pro
tests as a sign of its inability
to cope with the Real World
(that outside the haven of a
warm college dorm room)—or
they don't give a damn about a
figurehead position that has
long been filled by the most ver
bose "red-hot" of the fraternity
set, a symbol of glad-handing
and popularity seeking.
I suspect that the latter is

the case and that your student
body prfesident is a "joke" in
the eyes of most students there;
but unfortunately for Stanford,
the Real World (which tends to
rever its educational institu
tions) missed the humor of the
situation and made a front page
story of it.
A great man once remarked
that "Unless you have absolute
standards, you have no stand
ards at all." Your student body
president appears to advocate
removal of those very standards
that have long promoted excel
lence.
The problems that confront
Stanford are not peculiar to a
single campus, and they can cer
tainly be solved within the con
text of the principles and ideals
upon which Stanford, as well as
Our Nation, was founded. The
proof of eduaction is not the
number of scientific and social
"truths" a man can formulate,
but whether or not he can live
with his fellows in harmony, a
blend of differing ideas and
opinions.
Are strikes a reasonable sub
stitute for rational discussion?
Are fraternities living up to
their founding principles of fel
lowship and scholarship, or are
they self-emulating social clubs
devoted to tube watching? Is
abolition the answer? Is the
average 18-year-old freshman
qualified to set his own stand
ards of excellence and direct
his own course of study in a
field in which he has no ex
perience?
Solving a problem does not
mean eliminating the question.
Perhaps the answer lies with the
student who has never asked
himself what he believes in.
And, after he has established
a firm set of principles and
ideals, the next question he
must ask himself is, "Am I liv
ing up to these standards? Am
I being responsible to my be
liefs?"
