# Crocker: Is Stanford Sick?

### GEORGE N. CROCKER 
(Editor's Note: The following
column is reprinted from the

co Examiner and Is being used

Dave Harris is a student at
Stanford University. He was "a
moderate Democrat," he recalls,
when he came to Stanford from
a Fresno high school.
Today, after three years in the
hands of the Stanford faculty,
majoring in a department which
Stanford cryptically calls So
cial Thought, Harris is a pool of
confusion. His 20 year old men
tality is sodden with ineffable
dogma which—to the extent it
can be put into words at all—
is so disordered and contradic
tory that he can find nothing to
call it but "artistic socialism."
The adjective "artistic" should
not fool us. It is a shield to ex
empt his ideas from the test of
rationality. An artist accounts
only to his ego.
Mavericks
Every university turns out a
few mavericks — an occasional
charlatan, if you will; and for
that reason we should not be too
harsh on the University of Penn
sylvania, for example, because
the now-deposed tyrant of Gha
na, the self-styled Osagyefo (Be
loved Redeemer) Kwame Nkru
mah, went through that educa
tional mill, came out a vain
glorious Marxist, and proceeded
to ruin his country at the ear
liest opportunity.
Nor would we deny Dave Har
ris' right to espouse any non
sense he chooses; nor ordinarily
give his eccentricities more
than a smile. But the students
at Stanford, with knowledge
aforethought, have now elected
him their president. And that
raises the larger question: What
is going on at Stanford?
Harris' platform called for"
students being given free con
traceptives and opportunities to
take the drug LSD; for looking
into legalizing marijuana; for
all student social rules to be on
a voluntary basis. We need, says
Harris, "a freedom bordering on
the anarchic."
Strikes And Sit-ins
His idea of education includes
student strikes and sit-ins, and
the abolition of the grading sys
tem and required courses. He
wants the students and faculty
to elect the Stanford Board of
Trustees (himself to sit on the
board?)
He has an odd set of heroes.
High on the list is Mario Salvo,
who led the turmoil at UC and
then went on tour with Bettina
Aptheker, who later admitted
she had long been a Communist
Party member. Another idol is
Staughton Lynd, who violated
the wishes of his government by
going to North Vietnam with
Betina's Communist father for

amiable talks with the enemy
that is fighting American sol
diers.
The tragedy at Stanford is not
that there are many students
like Harris there for there are
not. It is that the campus has
long been in the grip of a liberal
establishment which stifles any
real dialogue on political philo-

Sophy and economics. In these
fields the faculty is stacked for
the Left. The students are in
tellectually shortchanged. They
have few tools of judgment.
Students live in the shadow
of their professors. Even when
they are ostensibly in rebellion,
they are likely to draw their
ideas from their professors or

from the materials given them
to read.
So in their ignorance and
boredom, Stanford students
choose a Dave Harris. And naive
alumni continue to subsidize, by
their gifts given with no strings
attached, an unbalanced faculty
which propagates all that they
abhor.

Dave Harris is a student at
Stanford University. He was "a
moderate Democrat," he recalls,
when he came to Stanford from
a Fresno high school.
Today, after three years in the
hands of the Stanford faculty,
majoring in a department which
Stanford cryptically calls So
cial Thought, Harris is a pool of
confusion. His 20 year old men
tality is sodden with ineffable
dogma which—to the extent it
can be put into words at all—
is so disordered and contradic
tory that he can find nothing to
call it but "artistic socialism."
The adjective "artistic" should
not fool us. It is a shield to ex
empt his ideas from the test of
rationality. An artist accounts
only to his ego.
Mavericks
Every university turns out a
few mavericks — an occasional
charlatan, if you will; and for
that reason we should not be too
harsh on the University of Penn
sylvania, for example, because
the now-deposed tyrant of Gha
na, the self-styled Osagyefo (Be
loved Redeemer) Kwame Nkru
mah, went through that educa
tional mill, came out a vain
glorious Marxist, and proceeded
to ruin his country at the ear
liest opportunity.
Nor would we deny Dave Har
ris' right to espouse any non
sense he chooses; nor ordinarily
give his eccentricities more
than a smile. But the students
at Stanford, with knowledge
aforethought, have now elected
him their president. And that
raises the larger question: What
is going on at Stanford?
Harris' platform called for"
students being given free con
traceptives and opportunities to
take the drug LSD; for looking
into legalizing marijuana; for
all student social rules to be on
a voluntary basis. We need, says
Harris, "a freedom bordering on
the anarchic."
Strikes And Sit-ins
His idea of education includes
student strikes and sit-ins, and
the abolition of the grading sys
tem and required courses. He
wants the students and faculty
to elect the Stanford Board of
Trustees (himself to sit on the
board?)
He has an odd set of heroes.
High on the list is Mario Salvo,
who led the turmoil at UC and
then went on tour with Bettina
Aptheker, who later admitted
she had long been a Communist
Party member. Another idol is
Staughton Lynd, who violated
the wishes of his government by
going to North Vietnam with
Betina's Communist father for

amiable talks with the enemy
that is fighting American sol
diers.
The tragedy at Stanford is not
that there are many students
like Harris there for there are
not. It is that the campus has
long been in the grip of a liberal
establishment which stifles any
real dialogue on political philo-

Sophy and economics. In these
fields the faculty is stacked for
the Left. The students are in
tellectually shortchanged. They
have few tools of judgment.
Students live in the shadow
of their professors. Even when
they are ostensibly in rebellion,
they are likely to draw their
ideas from their professors or

from the materials given them
to read.
So in their ignorance and
boredom, Stanford students
choose a Dave Harris. And naive
alumni continue to subsidize, by
their gifts given with no strings
attached, an unbalanced faculty
which propagates all that they
abhor.
