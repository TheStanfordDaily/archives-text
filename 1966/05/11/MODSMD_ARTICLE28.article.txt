"Well, you certainly took
your time in answering."
"Yes Jane."
"You know that I don't like
to be kept waiting."
"Yes Jane."
"I am calling about the Uni
versity."
"Yes Jane. University?"
"The University. The one I
founded to the glory of our
sons, mine . . . and yours."
"What?"
"The one with the church—
you remember."
"Oh yes, I destroyed it once."
"That was another mistake.
Anyway they're trying to des
troy it again and I want you
to talk to Guggenheim."
"Who?"
"Guggenheim, the President
of the Board of Trustees."
"Yes Jane."
"Right away."
"Yes Jane."

genheim."
"Ri-i-i-ight."
"Mr. Guggenheim, Jane is up-
CAt "
"Ri-i-i-ight."
"Mr. Guggenheim, when Jane
is upset, I get upset; When I
get upset, I do terrible things."
"Ri-i-i-ight."
"Mr. Guggenheim I want you
to take care of it for me."
"Ri-i-i-ight. Take care of what,
Lord?"
"The Jewish question, of
course."
"You Jewish? Funny, you
don't look it."
"Humph."
"What do you want me to do
about it Lord?"
"Don't worry about that Mr.
Guggenheim. You'll know when
the time comes."
"Ri-i-i-i-ight."

"This meeting of the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University

perative that we work out a fi
nal solution for the Jewish
question. Are there any sug
gestions?"
"I think that we should
change the Will."
"Ri-i-i-ight. Any other sugges
tions?"
"Let's vote."
"Ri-i-i-ight. All those in favor
of changing the Will?"
"Aye!"
