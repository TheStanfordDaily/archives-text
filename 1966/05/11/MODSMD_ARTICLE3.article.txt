# Regional Theatre Explosion Transforming Drama: Hewes
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
"The regional theatre explosion is
completely reshaping drama in this
country," Henry Hewes, drama critic
for the Saturday Review, told a Tues
day Evening Series audience last
night.
Hewes, who has both directed and
adapted plays, related the rapid rise
of 30 full-time theatres outside New
York City which are "beginning to
produce plays of comparable quality
to those being done in New York."
"These theatre can become the best
in the country, as they often are in
Europe." But, Hewes qualified, the
communities involved are going to
have to take the following positive
steps to complete the revolution:
Something Spec ial
The community must be willing to
raise the money to support unique
drama. Hewes believes repertory
theatres are presently too much alike
and each company should strive to
produce something special.
"We must work to develop audi
ences from all walks of life. Drama
critics are probably the worst possible
audience," he added.
The theatre should be a force for
vitality and change in society. "When
we quit changing, we become dead
people who are breathing."
It is the responsibility of the
regional theatre to encourage a maxi
mum of creativity at the risk of fail
ure.
Dull Sobriety
"The other problem is that there
isn't enough fun in the explosion. I
see too many worried actors, not
enough happy, joyous people partici
pating. There is too much dull sobri
ety," Hewes concluded.
Hewes also suggested that a lot of
the jargon associated with drama

could be redefined: "An 'experimental
play' is usually one that won't work.
One director defines 'community thea
tre' as summer stock done in cold
weather. And with 'repertory theatre'
you're never quite sure what's play
ing tonight."
As evidence of the changing atti
tude toward regional theatre, Hewes
cited the former reluctance of actors
to leave New York. "Today the actor
still worries that he will be isolated
from the theatre world. But this is
beginning to change. Some of the
critics are even beginning to travel
to see out of town performances."
