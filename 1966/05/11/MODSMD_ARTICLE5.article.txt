# Liberal, Conservative Debate Utopian Idea
## 
### WENDY WEINER 
A liberal and a conservative clashed
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday
and defended their definitions of Uto
pia, debating the topic: "All propo
sals for the elimination of war are
Utopian."
Willmoore Kendall, profesor of po

litical science at the University of
Dallas, Texas, was described by hfe
liberal opponent, Dr. Christian Bay
of the Stanford Political Science De
partment, as a "paradoxical man—as
conservative as a man can get, yet,
unquestionably brilliant."
Each of the professors began his
remarks by defining "Utopian." Ac
cording to Kendall, "a Utopian con
cept is something that, on the record,
hat> to be declared so grossly im
probable that it is a waste of time
trying to bring it about."
Utopia Desirable
Bay agreed with Kendall's analysis
that a Utopia is improbable, but said,
it is "also something desirable. I don't
agree that it is not worthwhile work
ing for Utopias." •
The statements by the conservative,
Kendall, and the liberal, Bay, ex
pressed opposing views toward the
nature of man. Kendall said that even
"psychiatrists, city planners, and edu
cators cannot in the forseeable fu
ture change the predatory nature of
man."
But an imminent World War 111
"won't be a predatory war," Kendall
continued, "but a war of diametrically
opposed ideas arising out of man's
noblest qualities and aspirations." It
will be a war "of Communism versus
Christiandom," he said.
