# Pre-Teen Summer Studies Set

"NATURAL SCIENCES 107, Man
in Society," reads the neatly bound,
olive-covered catalogue. "Basic con
cepts from psychology and sociology
which are personally relevant—the
concept of self, value systems, human
needs, and the causes of human be
havior."
A college catalogue? No, it for chil
dren from 10 to 14 years of age as a
part of the Hilltop Seminars, a school
of summer instruction being formed
this year by Stanford seniors and
recent graduates.
Non-Profit, Coeducational
The school, a non profit coeduca
tional project, was founded by Mark
Lohman, a graduate in economics last
year and presently a CORO Founda
tion intern in public affairs and
politics.
"Young people growing up today

face a world of increasingly imperson
al technology," says Lohman. "The
need for individual thinking is great
er than ever before and yet is too
often neglected in our schools."
Lohman says he hopes the Hilltop
Seminars will develop the thinking
process of young students. Class size
will not exceed ten pupils, and courses
will be characterized by "informal
activity and pupil participation."
Scholarships Available
While tuition is $135 for each of
two sessions, scholarship aid will per
mit 10 to 15 children of Mexican-Am
erican, Chinese, and Negro back
ground to attend without worry of
cost. Lohman says several fraterni
ties will help screen students and in
terview families for scholarships.
The school will be located on a 50-
acre site owned by Pacific High
School on Skyline Boulevard. All
classes will be outdoors, and bus

transportation will be available.
Divided into four departments,
courses will cover fine arts, creative
literature, natural scineces, and social
sciences. Fine arts courses will stress
experimentation in two- and three
dimensional composition. Another
seminar, in the natural sciences, will
study the interrelationship of plants,
animals, and man.
Encouraged To Participate
"Lengthy talks by teachers are to
bo avoided," says Lohman. "The Sem
inars consist of discussion and in
formal activity. Each pupil is chal
lenged and encouraged to partici
pate."
The school is governed by a board
of trustees consisting of Stanford
faculty members and professional
men in the Penninsula area. Others
will serve as faculty advisers. A local
bank has provided loans for initial
costs.

The school, a non profit coeduca
tional project, was founded by Mark
Lohman, a graduate in economics last
year and presently a CORO Founda
tion intern in public affairs and
politics.
"Young people growing up today

face a world of increasingly imperson
al technology," says Lohman. "The
need for individual thinking is great
er than ever before and yet is too
often neglected in our schools."
Lohman says he hopes the Hilltop
Seminars will develop the thinking
process of young students. Class size
will not exceed ten pupils, and courses
will be characterized by "informal
activity and pupil participation."
Scholarships Available
While tuition is $135 for each of
two sessions, scholarship aid will per
mit 10 to 15 children of Mexican-Am
erican, Chinese, and Negro back
ground to attend without worry of
cost. Lohman says several fraterni
ties will help screen students and in
terview families for scholarships.
The school will be located on a 50-
acre site owned by Pacific High
School on Skyline Boulevard. All
classes will be outdoors, and bus

transportation will be available.
Divided into four departments,
courses will cover fine arts, creative
literature, natural scineces, and social
sciences. Fine arts courses will stress
experimentation in two- and three
dimensional composition. Another
seminar, in the natural sciences, will
study the interrelationship of plants,
animals, and man.
Encouraged To Participate
"Lengthy talks by teachers are to
bo avoided," says Lohman. "The Sem
inars consist of discussion and in
formal activity. Each pupil is chal
lenged and encouraged to partici
pate."
The school is governed by a board
of trustees consisting of Stanford
faculty members and professional
men in the Penninsula area. Others
will serve as faculty advisers. A local
bank has provided loans for initial
costs.

"NATURAL SCIENCES 107, Man
in Society," reads the neatly bound,
olive-covered catalogue. "Basic con
cepts from psychology and sociology
which are personally relevant—the
concept of self, value systems, human
needs, and the causes of human be
havior."
A college catalogue? No, it for chil
dren from 10 to 14 years of age as a
part of the Hilltop Seminars, a school
of summer instruction being formed
this year by Stanford seniors and
recent graduates.
