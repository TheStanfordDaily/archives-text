# Morrison Writes Letter To Taylor
## 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
Freshman Pat Morrison with the
aid of the freshman track team has
drafted a letter stating their position
regarding Stanford's athletic policy
and presented it personally to Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor.
Co-captain of the frosh track team,
Tom Kommers, commented, "We hope
this statement will make our stand
clear. We hope that Taylor will realize
what we consider are the important
issues and what changes should be
made in the BAC's athletic policy con
cerning an athlete's dress and appear
ance."
Morrison in his attempt to clear
up his stand has also arranged a meet
ing with Chuck Taylor. He stated
that he hopes to remove some of the
barriers that have been created by
the 'mud-slinging coverage of my pro
test by the newspapers."
Discusses Matter
Morrison's decision to meet with
Taylor developed partly from a dis
cussion yesterday with Bob Stoecker,
captain of the varsity track team.
Coach Payton Jordan stated that he
has always had an open door to any
discussion of this sort and hopes that
a clarification of everyone's position
will be created in this meeting. He
added, "anyone that wants to come in
and discuss this problem with me or
Chuck Taylor is certainly welcome."

Chuck Taylor had visitors this
morning who did exactly this and he
also has received numerous letters
since Morrison did not compete
against the Cal frosh last Saturday.
Assistant Athletic Director, Bob
Young, commented that the letters
were half and half. Some support Mor
rison while others support the Ath
letic Department. He also stated that
Buck Club members who previously
were delinquent in the annual fund
raising program have suddenly made
contributions to Stanford's atheltic
program.
Coach Jordan's stand stems from a
memo sent out to all Stanford coaches
from Chuck Taylor.
It reads, "This memo is to reaffirm
our policy of the past on an athlete's
dress and appearance. All coaches are
requested to insure all competitive
atheletes, for both home and away
contests, be neatly dressed. They
should wear ties and have their hair
cut .... no mustaches or beards.
'I believe all coaches will agree with
me that this is a sound policy. In
talking to your squads, you can state
that this is a Department policy, as
well as your own if you wish."
Not Jeopardize Track
In a regular Monday meeting, Stan
ford's track team made it clear to
Payton Jordan that no matter what
their opinion may be regarding Stan
ford's athletic policy they were not
going to jeopardize the track team.
Jordan stated at the meeting,
"At this point in the season
everyone must compete at his
best. If any of you feel that you
do not want to put out your best
effort possible, I want you to
terminate competition now and
save any last-minute rush. Will
those of you who do not want to
comply with my wishes please
leave the room."
No one left the room.

In a statement to The Dally
Jordan said, "I am not denying
anyone the right to dissent. I
respect their right to do this.
I just do not want this conflict
to undermine the track team's
future performances."

Stanford will be competing in
the West Coast Relays next
weekend and in the AAWU
Championships the week after
that.
Varsity miler Dave Deubner
commented after the meeting,
'I sympathize with Pat but still
believe that we should be loyal
to Stanford track and Coach
Jordan. I feel that there is defin
itely a need for a change within
the Athletic Department but
feel that a change must come
through other channels."

Morrison in his attempt to clear
up his stand has also arranged a meet
ing with Chuck Taylor. He stated
that he hopes to remove some of the
barriers that have been created by
the 'mud-slinging coverage of my pro
test by the newspapers."
Discusses Matter
Morrison's decision to meet with
Taylor developed partly from a dis
cussion yesterday with Bob Stoecker,
captain of the varsity track team.
Coach Payton Jordan stated that he
has always had an open door to any
discussion of this sort and hopes that
a clarification of everyone's position
will be created in this meeting. He
added, "anyone that wants to come in
and discuss this problem with me or
Chuck Taylor is certainly welcome."

Chuck Taylor had visitors this
morning who did exactly this and he
also has received numerous letters
since Morrison did not compete
against the Cal frosh last Saturday.
Assistant Athletic Director, Bob
Young, commented that the letters
were half and half. Some support Mor
rison while others support the Ath
letic Department. He also stated that
Buck Club members who previously
were delinquent in the annual fund
raising program have suddenly made
contributions to Stanford's atheltic
program.
Coach Jordan's stand stems from a
memo sent out to all Stanford coaches
from Chuck Taylor.
It reads, "This memo is to reaffirm
our policy of the past on an athlete's
dress and appearance. All coaches are
requested to insure all competitive
atheletes, for both home and away
contests, be neatly dressed. They
should wear ties and have their hair
cut .... no mustaches or beards.
'I believe all coaches will agree with
me that this is a sound policy. In
talking to your squads, you can state
that this is a Department policy, as
well as your own if you wish."
Not Jeopardize Track
In a regular Monday meeting, Stan
ford's track team made it clear to
Payton Jordan that no matter what
their opinion may be regarding Stan
ford's athletic policy they were not
going to jeopardize the track team.
Jordan stated at the meeting,
"At this point in the season
everyone must compete at his
best. If any of you feel that you
do not want to put out your best
effort possible, I want you to
terminate competition now and
save any last-minute rush. Will
those of you who do not want to
comply with my wishes please
leave the room."
No one left the room.

Jordan said, "I am not denying
anyone the right to dissent. I
respect their right to do this.
I just do not want this conflict
to undermine the track team's
future performances."

Stanford will be competing in
the West Coast Relays next
weekend and in the AAWU
Championships the week after

Jordan. I feel that there is defin
itely a need for a change within
the Athletic Department but
feel that a change must come
through other channels."
