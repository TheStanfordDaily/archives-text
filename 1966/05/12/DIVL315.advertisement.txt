TWA 80/50 Club is not available on November 23, November 27. Oecember IB through 24, 1906. and January 2 through 4, 1967,
V2 off for travel in the USA! Going home 02* just going places, you can get
50% off the regular Jet Coach fare in the U.S. when you fly TWA. As
long as you're under 22, you're on —most any day of the year except a few
holiday peak-travel periods. Seats are on a stand-by basis —but service
includes everything: meals, movies and music, depending on the flight.
Here's all you do: fill out the application, prove your age, pay $3 for an
ID card. Just call your TWA campus representative, George Mayer, at
323-8550. He'll make it easy.
We're your kind of airline.
Headed for Detroit? I W \ has a new non-stop jet at 8:40 every morning.

V2 off for travel in the USA! Going home 02* just going places, you can get
50% off the regular Jet Coach fare in the U.S. when you fly TWA. As
long as you're under 22, you're on —most any day of the year except a few
holiday peak-travel periods. Seats are on a stand-by basis —but service
includes everything: meals, movies and music, depending on the flight.
Here's all you do: fill out the application, prove your age, pay $3 for an
ID card. Just call your TWA campus representative, George Mayer, at
323-8550. He'll make it easy.
We're your kind of airline.
Headed for Detroit? I W \ has a new non-stop jet at 8:40 every morning.
