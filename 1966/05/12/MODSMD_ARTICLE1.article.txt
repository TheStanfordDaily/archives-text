# Hansen, Ike, And LBJ Color SLAC's History
## High Tension 
### PAT McMAHON 
(Second In a series)
In September, 1961, the United
States Congress authorized the con
struction of a $114 million micro
scope which would cost $20 million
every year to operate.
SLAC had finally been approved,
after four years of study and evalua
tion by various federal agencies.
In 1957, the University submitted
the proposal for SLAC to three fed
eral agencies: the Atomic Energy
Commission, the Department of De
fense, and the National Science Foun
dation.
The following year, the National
Science Foundation, AEC's Advisory
Committee, and the President's Sci
ence Advisory Committee all recom
mended it.
Ike Recommends
The next encouragement for SLAC
came in a radio address by President
Eisenhower in May, 1959, when he
said, "I am recommending that the
Congress of the Federal Government
finance the construction, as a nation
al facility, of a large, new, electron
linear accelerator. Physicists con
sider the project — which has been
sponsored by Stanford University—
to be of vital importance. Because of

the cost, 6uch a project must become
a Federal responsibility."
Before the project was finally ap
proved, hearings were conducted to

investigate need, costs, possible con
flicts of interest, and the relationship
of Stanford to the national facility.
Before the contract itself was

signed Stanford was assured archi
tectural rights in accordance with
AEC specifications, and that the fa
cility would be open to anyone who
cared to observe operations.
Natural Outgrowth
SLAC was a natural outgrowth of
the electron accelerator research that
had previously been conducted at
Stanford—the culmination of three
decades of research. In the mid-thir
ties, the late Professor W. W. Hansen
developed the linear accqleration tech
nique which will be in use at SLAC.
Just before World War 11, Hansen,
working with the Varian brothers, de
veloped the klystron tube which now
serves the accelerator with its high
power radio waves which accelerate
the electrons.
Following the war, progress in the
electron accelerator field moved rap
idly. After several smaller models
were successfully tested, scientists at
Stanford built a 220-foot-long linear
accelerator known as Mark 111 which
eventually delivered one billion elec
tron volts.
Contract Signed
Professor of Physics Robert Hof
stadter won the Nobel prize in physics
for his precise examinations of atomic
nucler with the use of very high
energy electrons from the Mark 111.

In the spring of 1962, a contract
was signed between the Stanford
Trustees and the Atomic Energy Com
mission, and actual construction be
gan that July. However, in January,
1963, an unexpected controversy de
veloped over the stringing of power
lines through Woodside in the foot
hills.
Power Line Controversy
At that time, PG&E asked for per
mission to build a power line of 70-
foot-tall tubular steel poles either up
the hills to a source near Skyline
Boulevard or up the valley along the
proposed route for the new Junipero
Serra freeway to a source behind
Redwood City.
Both of these requests were re
jected by Woodside, and they said
they would only consider the lines if
they were put underground.
However, it was decided by the AEC
that because of the eventual need for
new lines, the pressure requirements
for the lines, and the cost (the under
ground lines would cost two million
dollars more), the burying of the
powerlines was not reasonable.
The view of Woodside might well
be expressed in the February 4, 1964,
editorial of The San Francisco Exami
ner which noted "The incomparable
vista in the Stanford Hills offers in

spiration and tranquility. It is a place
of serenity and beauty. We hope it
will be spared the unsightly sprawl
of an overhead power installation."
At this point it became necessary
for the land intended for the lines to
be condemned. It was determined in
a lower court that the Atomic En
ergy Commission had the right to do
this. However the decision was re
versed in the United States Court of
Appeals.
It was then necessary for an act of
Congress which clarified the authori
ty of the AEC with regard to genera
tion, sale or transmission of electric
power. On August 24, of last year,
President Johnson signed HR 8856
which allowed the power lines to be
strung, using the right of eminant
domain.
With the controversy settled, SLAC
has now nearly reached completion
of construction. Presently, the elec
tron beam has been turned on and
tested down to the two-thirds point
in the accelerator. Within a month
officials expect to have tested the
beam to its completion point. At that
time, some small experiments will be
undertaken while the beam is per
fected. Within a year, SLAC should
be in full operation with the first ma
jor experiments being performed.


Barely topping the trees, the poles
and powerlines (arrow above) were
the issue of the Woodside controver
sy, settled last August.

Before the project was finally ap
proved, hearings were conducted to

investigate need, costs, possible con
flicts of interest, and the relationship

Natural Outgrowth
SLAC was a natural outgrowth of
the electron accelerator research that
had previously been conducted at
Stanford—the culmination of three
decades of research. In the mid-thir
ties, the late Professor W. W. Hansen
developed the linear accqleration tech
nique which will be in use at SLAC.
Just before World War 11, Hansen,
working with the Varian brothers, de
veloped the klystron tube which now
serves the accelerator with its high
power radio waves which accelerate
the electrons.
Following the war, progress in the
electron accelerator field moved rap
idly. After several smaller models
were successfully tested, scientists at
Stanford built a 220-foot-long linear
accelerator known as Mark 111 which
eventually delivered one billion elec
tron volts.
Contract Signed
Professor of Physics Robert Hof
stadter won the Nobel prize in physics
for his precise examinations of atomic
nucler with the use of very high
energy electrons from the Mark 111.

In the spring of 1962, a contract
was signed between the Stanford
Trustees and the Atomic Energy Com
mission, and actual construction be
gan that July. However, in January,
1963, an unexpected controversy de
veloped over the stringing of power
lines through Woodside in the foot
hills.
Power Line Controversy
At that time, PG&E asked for per
mission to build a power line of 70-
foot-tall tubular steel poles either up
the hills to a source near Skyline
Boulevard or up the valley along the
proposed route for the new Junipero
Serra freeway to a source behind
Redwood City.
Both of these requests were re
jected by Woodside, and they said
they would only consider the lines if
they were put underground.
However, it was decided by the AEC
that because of the eventual need for
new lines, the pressure requirements
for the lines, and the cost (the under
ground lines would cost two million
dollars more), the burying of the
powerlines was not reasonable.
The view of Woodside might well
be expressed in the February 4, 1964,
editorial of The San Francisco Exami
ner which noted "The incomparable
vista in the Stanford Hills offers in

spiration and tranquility. It is a place
of serenity and beauty. We hope it
will be spared the unsightly sprawl
of an overhead power installation."
At this point it became necessary
for the land intended for the lines to
be condemned. It was determined in
a lower court that the Atomic En
ergy Commission had the right to do
this. However the decision was re
versed in the United States Court of
Appeals.
It was then necessary for an act of
Congress which clarified the authori
ty of the AEC with regard to genera
tion, sale or transmission of electric
power. On August 24, of last year,
President Johnson signed HR 8856
which allowed the power lines to be
strung, using the right of eminant
domain.
With the controversy settled, SLAC
has now nearly reached completion
of construction. Presently, the elec
tron beam has been turned on and
tested down to the two-thirds point
in the accelerator. Within a month
officials expect to have tested the
beam to its completion point. At that
time, some small experiments will be
undertaken while the beam is per
fected. Within a year, SLAC should
be in full operation with the first ma
jor experiments being performed.

and powerlines (arrow above) were
the issue of the Woodside controver
sy, settled last August.

In September, 1961, the United
States Congress authorized the con
struction of a $114 million micro
scope which would cost $20 million
every year to operate.
SLAC had finally been approved,
after four years of study and evalua
tion by various federal agencies.
In 1957, the University submitted
the proposal for SLAC to three fed
eral agencies: the Atomic Energy
Commission, the Department of De
fense, and the National Science Foun
dation.
The following year, the National
Science Foundation, AEC's Advisory
Committee, and the President's Sci
ence Advisory Committee all recom
mended it.

The next encouragement for SLAC
came in a radio address by President
Eisenhower in May, 1959, when he
said, "I am recommending that the
Congress of the Federal Government
finance the construction, as a nation

idly. After several smaller models
were successfully tested, scientists at
Stanford built a 220-foot-long linear
accelerator known as Mark 111 which
eventually delivered one billion elec
tron volts.
Contract Signed
Professor of Physics Robert Hof
stadter won the Nobel prize in physics
for his precise examinations of atomic
nucler with the use of very high
energy electrons from the Mark 111.

In the spring of 1962, a contract
was signed between the Stanford
Trustees and the Atomic Energy Com
mission, and actual construction be
gan that July. However, in January,
1963, an unexpected controversy de
veloped over the stringing of power
lines through Woodside in the foot
hills.
Power Line Controversy
At that time, PG&E asked for per
mission to build a power line of 70-
foot-tall tubular steel poles either up
the hills to a source near Skyline
Boulevard or up the valley along the
proposed route for the new Junipero
Serra freeway to a source behind
Redwood City.
Both of these requests were re
jected by Woodside, and they said
they would only consider the lines if
they were put underground.
However, it was decided by the AEC
that because of the eventual need for
new lines, the pressure requirements
for the lines, and the cost (the under
ground lines would cost two million
dollars more), the burying of the
powerlines was not reasonable.
The view of Woodside might well
be expressed in the February 4, 1964,
editorial of The San Francisco Exami
ner which noted "The incomparable
vista in the Stanford Hills offers in

spiration and tranquility. It is a place
of serenity and beauty. We hope it
will be spared the unsightly sprawl
of an overhead power installation."
At this point it became necessary
for the land intended for the lines to
be condemned. It was determined in
a lower court that the Atomic En
ergy Commission had the right to do
this. However the decision was re
versed in the United States Court of
Appeals.
It was then necessary for an act of
Congress which clarified the authori
ty of the AEC with regard to genera
tion, sale or transmission of electric
power. On August 24, of last year,
President Johnson signed HR 8856
which allowed the power lines to be
strung, using the right of eminant
domain.
With the controversy settled, SLAC
has now nearly reached completion
of construction. Presently, the elec
tron beam has been turned on and
tested down to the two-thirds point
in the accelerator. Within a month
officials expect to have tested the
beam to its completion point. At that
time, some small experiments will be
undertaken while the beam is per
fected. Within a year, SLAC should
be in full operation with the first ma
jor experiments being performed.

and powerlines (arrow above) were

In September, 1961, the United
States Congress authorized the con
struction of a $114 million micro
scope which would cost $20 million
every year to operate.
SLAC had finally been approved,
after four years of study and evalua
tion by various federal agencies.
In 1957, the University submitted
the proposal for SLAC to three fed
eral agencies: the Atomic Energy
Commission, the Department of De
fense, and the National Science Foun
dation.
The following year, the National
Science Foundation, AEC's Advisory
Committee, and the President's Sci
ence Advisory Committee all recom
mended it.
Ike Recommends
The next encouragement for SLAC
came in a radio address by President
Eisenhower in May, 1959, when he
said, "I am recommending that the
Congress of the Federal Government
finance the construction, as a nation
al facility, of a large, new, electron
linear accelerator. Physicists con
sider the project — which has been
sponsored by Stanford University—
to be of vital importance. Because of

the cost, 6uch a project must become
a Federal responsibility."
Before the project was finally ap
proved, hearings were conducted to

investigate need, costs, possible con
flicts of interest, and the relationship
of Stanford to the national facility.
Before the contract itself was

signed Stanford was assured archi
tectural rights in accordance with
AEC specifications, and that the fa
cility would be open to anyone who
cared to observe operations.
Natural Outgrowth
SLAC was a natural outgrowth of
the electron accelerator research that
had previously been conducted at
Stanford—the culmination of three
decades of research. In the mid-thir
ties, the late Professor W. W. Hansen
developed the linear accqleration tech
nique which will be in use at SLAC.
Just before World War 11, Hansen,
working with the Varian brothers, de
veloped the klystron tube which now
serves the accelerator with its high
power radio waves which accelerate
the electrons.
