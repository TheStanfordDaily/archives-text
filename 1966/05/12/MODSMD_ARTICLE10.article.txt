# LASSU To Elect '66 Officers
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
The legislature will hold officer
elections tonight. The two major posts
to be filled are the Speaker of the
Legislature and the Legislature Lai
son Officer.
Two resolutions will be proposed
dealing with the headline issues of
the past week. The first one supports
the track star, Patrick Morrison, in
his controversial stand against the
athletic department. The second pro
posal asks for on-campus worship fa
cilities other than Memorial Church
for the Jews and Catholics. The reso
lution infers that the solution to this
issue is long overdue, and the prob
lem should not have occurred.
A bill which could create a cor.flict
in-law is scheduled to come out of
committee. The bill proposes new
open-hours regulations. The new gen

cral hours outlined by the bill set
midnight as the week night limit,
and 2:30 on Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday. It would also remove restric
tions for graduate students. These
general limits would be subject to
approval within each living group,
which could restrict the hours further
for their convenience.
Discussion on the new Liquor pol
icy is also part of tonight's agenda.
The committee appointed last week,
reportedly has made no progress. The
ROTC resolution from last week will
also be brought back into discussion
for reconsideration.
The draft of the ASSU budget will
be presented tonight. The board
heads will be given opportunity to
review their allotted appropriations
at the meeting next week.
The meeting will take place in room
320 at 7:30 tonight.
