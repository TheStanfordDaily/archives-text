The final list of the twenty-five
Wilbur sponsors selected will not be
released until the results of the Ap
peal Committee's interview are
known, probably late next week.
A 1 Taylor, head sponsor, stated that
the Wilbur sponsors would like to cor

rect an important inaccuracy in
CUE's statement of Tuesday: there
were 65 applicants instead of the 50
which CUE reported.
The decline in applicants can be
explained by other than CUE's hints
of an anachronistic sponsor system
or of disinterested undergraduates. Ac
cording to Taylor, a Faculty Master
at Wilbur, in theory or in practice,
is seen by many students as the great
est deterrent to application—not to
mention CUE, which both controls all
undergraduate education and denies
undergraduates a vote in its deci
sions, Taylor concluded.
