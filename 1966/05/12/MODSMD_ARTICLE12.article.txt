# Loss Of PACE Pledges Denied
## 
### 
Daryl H. Pearson, General
Secretary of the University, told
The Daily yesterday that "we
have not had a single intima
tion that anyone would with
hold payment of a PACE
pledge."
In response to reports that
funds had been withdrawn from
PACE and other University
fund-raising projects, Pearson
issued the following statement
to The Daily: "The reports in
the press about the winner of
the recent student body elec
tions have resulted in Stanford's
receiving a number of letters
from alumni and friends stating
they were withholding their sup
port of the University.
"This is not too surprising
because from time to time
similar letters are provoked by
attention-getting, but not al
ways full or accurate reports.
Voluntary Support
While maintaining that it is
impossible to estimate how such
publicity will affect Stanford's
voluntary support, Pearson
made it clear that "there is un
doubtedly some diminuation of
immediate gift support." He em
phasized, however, that "in the
overall gift picture the enor
mous good that is coming out
of Stanford more than out
weighs such temporary losses as
are occasioned by particular in
cidents or policies."
Pearson expressed his belief
that Stanford's "undergirding of
respect for integrity and hon
esty" will never allow an im
portant mistake to go for long
without correction. "Nothing
would be more certain to reduce
Stanford's gift support drasti
cally and permanently than to
allow the promise of a gift or
the withholding of a gift to in
fluence the University's doing
what it is convinced is right,"
he stated.
"Nevertheless, I should be
less than honest if I did not
admit that we feel bad when
we receive letters indicating
dislike of what Stanford is do
ing," he added, "particularly
when they are based on incom
plete or inaccurate reports.
