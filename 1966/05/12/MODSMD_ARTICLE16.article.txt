# Slogan-Singing Evangelist Brings Victory Message

### MIKE COUZENS 
K. B. Sparks, the "Win With
Jesus" man, uses his retirement
for campus ministry. After 35
years as a seaman and marine
engineer, he became a fixture at
Berkeley and San Francisco
State, distributing literature and
button-holing students.
Yesterday he came to Stan
ford.
A white safari helmet em
blazoned "Win With Jesus" tops
his costume of gray work shirt
and pants, a necktie embroidered
with the same slogan, and two
lapel buttons: the SNCC hand
shake and — yes — Win With
Jesus.
"I was never good at public
speaking. So I pass out literature
to students. Many college stu
dents do not believe. But stu
dents are used to reading. If I
give a leaflet to a man who's 60
he probably won't read it,"
Sparks explained.
Since early 1965, Sparks, who
is 62, has spent his time on cam
puses. He prints many of his
own leaflets, and ordered 12,000
"Win With Jesus" buttons for
distribution.
"By 'Win With Jesus' I mean
that you win eternal life—for
giveness of sin."
Says one of his leaflets, "What
a boy or girl will WIN WITH
JESUS is a decent conversation,
a smokeless clean house, a de
pendable code of ethics, a drink
free husband or wife, a training
from childhood up which usually
stays all through life."
Against Drunkards
The Bible, he says, condemns
drunkards. He disagrees with
the change in liquor policy, re
ferring to figures on "terrific"
national liquor traffic.
Why do students disbelieve or
lose their belief? "It's because of
worldly teachings. The main one
is evolution. I have about 15
tracts on that —some of them by
professors, not just theologians.
"There is a concentration on
worldliness. The Bible teaches
that the love of money is the
root of all evil. Most kids go to
school to get a good education so
they can earn money."
Sparks does not feel there is
more sin on campuses today,
though he says there are some
organizations at Cal which are
openly sinful, "like the Sexual
Freedom League. They are for
abortion. I am against it unless

it is to save the mother's life. As
a general practice, it's murder."
Contraceptives arc objection
able because they encourage sex
before marriage. Birth control,
to Sparks, is "keeping God from
having a child born. The child
could be a President, or a great
writer."
He believes in racial equality.
"This button on my lapel is dis
tributed by one of the organiza
tions at Cal, I believe it's SNCC.
I don't endorse SNCC. I don't
think the church should be so
involved in politics. But I believe
in equality. That's what the
handshake means to me."
Bearded students are a special
interest to Sparks. "I want to be
sure to offer literature to these
people, not because I'm antago
nistic toward them, but because
I love them. They're repulsive to
some people, but not to me."
His efforts are important be
cause, "The world is full of evil
spirits. How would you explain

insanity? It's the working of evil
spirits. Jesus threw out evil
spirits. There are people today
who can do it. Oral Roberts is
one.
"Sin is causing the problem:
in the human race, in the human
heart."
Sparks' only formal training
was in a Methodist Sunday
school. He "lived in sin" and
drank heavily until 1950. Then
he began to leave the ship to
hand out leaflets. His only in
come is his retirement.
