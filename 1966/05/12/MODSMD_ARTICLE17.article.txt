## 
### 
Newsweek's chief European
correspondant Arnoud de Boreh
grave, a veteran of numerous
trips to Southeast Asia includ
ing the siege of Dienbienphu
and the current Vietnam war,
opened his talk to questions
yesterday afternoon in Tresid
der.
In the discussion he conclud
ed that the present war was
initially one chapter of the so
called "revolution of rising ex
pectations" in the underdevelop
ed world, and was aggravated
by U..S and French errors as
far back as 1946. But at the
same time, its inspiration and or
ganization did come from Hanoi,
and ultimately from the influ
ence of Red China.
Whatever the economic and
nationalistic aspirations of the
Vietnamese people were, they
are now a moot point, he said.
The war is now a Communist
directed "war of national libera
tion" admitting no easy solution
for either the United States or
for the Vietnamese people.
For the United States to ig
nore the continuing nationalistic
aspirations of the iVetnamesc,
those expressed by Tri Quang,
would be to invite political de
feat de Borchgrave explained.
But a simple withdrawal will not
bring peace and freedom to the
Asian people.
Faced with five years of
bloody defeat in Africa and Asia,
Chinas' leaders desparately need
a victory to justify their mili
tant policy to their own people.
De Borchgrave said a commu
nist victory in Vietnam would
be followed by a succession of
similar wars throughout Asia.
Since there has been no case
of successful nationalist revolu
tion against Communist rule in
Asia, American withdrawal
would squash any hope for an

independant Vietnam.
According to De Borchgrave,
the only hope for peace in Asia
demands that the United States
be prepared to remain in Viet-

nam until Hanoi and Peking are
convinced they have no profit
in this war.
But if this peace is to be main
tained for long in the underde
veloped world, the United States
will have to learn to recognize
and provide for the legitimate
economic and nationalistic needs
of the developing questions, ac
cording to de Borchgrave.
Adequate diplomatic contacts
and face-saving concessions have
been offered to both powers by
the United States. De Borch
grave concluded, unless the
United States indulges in some
military escalation that would
appear to threaten the security
of the Communist homelands,
the initiative for peace lies
solelv in their hands.
