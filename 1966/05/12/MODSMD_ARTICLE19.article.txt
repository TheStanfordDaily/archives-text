# All Draft Boards Receive Criteria
## 
### 
The Selective Service System
has promulgated advisory cri
teria to assist local boards in
classifying registrants who are
students.
According to the National Ser
vice Director's office, the cri
teria are based on year-end re
ports showing:
• The undergraduate stu
dent's scholastic standing among
| full-time male students in his
class;
• The graduate student's sat
isfactory progress toward com
pletion of degree requirements;
• And/or a satisfactory score
on the Selective Service Quali
fication Test.
An end of the,year report will
be forwarded to the local board
of each student who completes
the appropriate request in the
National Service Office, Bldg.
100, Inner Quad. For undergrad
uates, the SSS Form 109 will
show the rank-in-class by the fol
lowing categories: upper one
fourth, upper one-half, upper
two-thirds, upper three-fourths,
and lower one-fourth.
For graduate students, the
SSS Form 103 would not show
class standing, but would report
factual information concerning
the student's program.
All male students who expect
to be classified 11-S (Student
Deferment) for the next aca
demic year are urged to contact
the National Service Office as
soon as possible in order to ini
tiate their request for the Form
109 or 103.
