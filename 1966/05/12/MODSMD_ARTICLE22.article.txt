## THE
						COLLEGE PRESIDENT: HIS CAUSE AND CURE 
### author of "Rally Round the Flag, Boys!", "Dobie Gillis," etc 
Oh, sure, you've been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting married,
picketing—but can tyou pause for usta moment and give
thought to that dear, dedicated, ionelv man in the big white
house on the hill? I refer, of course, to Prexy.
(It is interesting to note that college Dresidents are al
ways called "Prexy." Similarly, trustees are always called
"Trixie." Associate professors are always called "Axy-Pixy."
Bursars are called "Foxy-Woxy." Students are called
"Algae.")
But I digress. We were speaking of Prexy, a personage
at once august and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well, sir, con
sider how Prexy spends his days. He is busy, busy, busy.
He talks to deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trus
tees, he talks to alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody ex
cept the one group who could lift his heart and rally his
spirits. I mean, of course, the appealingest, endearingest,
winsomest group in the entire college—delightful you, the
students.
It is Prexy's sad fate to be forever a stranger to your
laughing, golden selves. He can only gaze wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at
your games and sports and yearn with all his tormented
heart to bask in your warmth. But how? It would hardly
be fitting for Prexy to appear one day at the Union, clad in
an old rowing blazer, and cry gaily, "Heigh-ho, chaps!
Who s for sculling?"
No, friends, Prexy can't get to you. It is up to you to get
to him. Call on him at home. Just drop in unannounced. He
will naturally be a little shy at first, so you must put him at
his ease. Shout, "Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring a
little sunshine into your drear and blighted life!" Then
yank his necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike
around him until he is laughing merrily along with you.
Then hand him a package and say, "A little gift for you,
sir."
"For me?" he will say, lowering his lids. "You shouldn't

have."

"Yes, 1 should," you will say, "because this is a pack of
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and whenever I
think of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, I think of
you."
"Why, hey?" he will ask curiously.
"Because, sir, ' you will say, "though you are no longer
a young blade, still you gleam and function. Full though
you are of years and lumps, rheumy though your endocrines
and flaccid your hamstrings, still you remain sharp, inci
sive, efficacious."
"Thank you," he will say, sobbing.
"So it is with Personna," you will continue. "Naturally
you expect a brand-new blade to give a close, speedy shave.
But how about a blade that's had hard and frequent use'.'
Do you still expect a close, speedy shave? Well, sir, if it's a
Personna, that's what you'll get. Because, sir, like you, sir,
Personna is no flash-in-the-pan. Like you, sir, Personna
abides."
He will clasp your hand then, not trusting himself to
speak.
"Butaway with gloom!" you will cry jollily. "For I have
still more good news to tell you of Personna!"
"How is that possible?" he will say.
"Hearken to me," you will say. "Personna, in all its en
during splendor, is available not only in Double Edge style
but also in Injector style!"
He will join you then in the Personna rouser, and then
he will bring you a steaming cup of cocoa with a marsh
mallow on top. Then you will say, "Good-bye, sir. I will re
turn soon again to brighten your dank, miasmic life."
"Please do," he will say. "But next time, if you can pos
sibly manage it, try not to come at four in the morning."
