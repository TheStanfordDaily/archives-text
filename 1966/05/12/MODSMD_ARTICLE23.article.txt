# 'Buck' Club Aids Athletics
## 
### Dan Cabrera 
The Stanford Buck Club—or
ganized in 1934 by three Stanford
alumni—two lawyers, one sports
writer, was called then the Buck
of the Month Club because each
member would contribute one
dollar a month specifically for
the use of the Stanford adminis
tration in financial support of
the athletic program.

But the cost of tuition has
risen from $150 to the present
$525, a change only matched by
the ever-increasing excellence of
an academic education on this
campus.
Before the formation of the
Buck Club, no athletic scholar
ships existed at Stanford. Now,
with a membership exceeding
three thousand, including many
people who did not themselves
attend Stanford, the Buck Club
contributes some quarter of a
million dollars each year in sup
port of Stanford athletes.
Three Main Incentives
Why? Stanford Buck Club
President, John Ditz, lists three
main incentives behind the indi
vidual's generosity. The great
ness of Stanford heads the list.
But the reason extends much
deeper.
A member contributes because
he feels that competitive ath
letics provides something in the
learning process that one cannot
gain in the classroom. In addi
tion, the competitive process en-

countered must be one on a level
high enough to make the experi
ence worthwhile. This takes
money.
Stanford has never waived the
cost of tuition in order to draw
athletes. It probably never will.
Because of the relatively great
expense of a Stanford education,
there are a great number of
qualified students who could not
attend were it not for the schol
arship program.
A great void would exist in a
university lacking a sports pro
gram, Ditz commented. The ex
periences of leadership and team
effort, the increase in physical
fitness and the added self-confi
dence a student gains from
sports participation all speak for
the necessity of a rigorous ath
letics program.
No Strings Attached
The Buck Club turns what
ever money it receives over to
the administration with no
strings attached except that the
money be used for financing aca
demically qualified students
whose athletic abilities will raise
the level of the Stanford ath
letic teams.
"By providing monetary aid
for Stanford athletes, the Buck
Club member acts in accordance
with the belief, that the benefit
of a college athletic experience
is best realized when the Uni
versity's teams are competing
on a high level," Ditz sum
marized.
