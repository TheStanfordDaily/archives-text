# Netmen To Compete In LA League Meet
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
begins play today in the seventh
annual AAWU Championships
at UCLA. The host Bruins are
co-favorites with USC's Trojans,
but Bob Renker's Card squad
has a good chance of placing
third.
This year's tournament fea
tures team competition for the
first time instead of two sepa
rate tournaments of singles and
doubles play. As in meets dur
ing the regular season, each
team will enter six singles play
ers and three doubles teams.

After the first round winning
teams will be paired against
other winners, losers against
losers, until all eight places have
been determined. The new sys
tem places emphasis on team
depth rather than on a single
individuals' performance, but
the southern schools will still
dominate.
The Tribe netmen finished
their regular season last week
with four straight wins. Most
important was their 6-3 defeat
of Cal, which had beaten them
earlier in the season. Still, the
Cards had a disappointing sea
son with league losses to the
Bruins and Trojans and two non
league losses to San Jose State.
Stanford's six regulars, Jim
Beste, Brian Leek, Craig Baise,
John McCabe, Jamie Carroll, and
John McPherson, will represent
the team in singles play. The
same six will pair up for the
doubles.
Last year's conference champ,
Arthur Ashe, has graduated, but
teammate Charlie Pasarell
should retain the singles cup for
the Bruins this year. Pasarell,
who needed three sets to down
Jim Beste earlier this year, was
recently named to the U.S. Davis
Cup team.
