# RAM'S HEAD REVIEW
## Nitery Alive With Three One Acts 
### LARRY BIEHL 
A proud and dedicated group of
student players and playwrights have
moved into the Nitery, the intimate
and informal three-quartered stage
theater off White Plaza in the Old
Union, for a four night engagement
which began last night.
The triology of One Acts includes
Tennessee William's Ten Blocks on
the Camino Real, and two student
written productions: Valparaiso and
The Miracle Wolf of Gubbio.
A study of fantasy, William's plot
depicting the monthly festival to re
store the virginity of a gypsy's daugh
ter, apparently centers in a port of
Latin America. The scenes shift from
the plaza surrounding a decadent ho
tel to the brothel of the village gypsy.
A guitarist (Bob Butler) strolls and
strums throughout the drama, seem
ingly oblivious to the presence of a
corpse propped against a parched
fountain.
Free-Moving - Actors
The actors move about the stage
freely, invoking the audience's in
volvement. The staging is simple yet
suggestive so as not to distract from
the action on stage.
Director Emily Gill has successful
ly instilled her large cast with the ex
citement and intensity of William's
script. She is well schooled in an un
derstanding of Williams, an under
standing which manifests itself
through the ingenuity of set design
and enthusiasm of the actors in
volved.
ValparaLso, the second of the One
Acts is the least successful of the
three. Jim Bierman's original script
incorporates flash-backs and reverse
sequences to portray the tension of
Tristan (Bob Dwan), a twenty year
old student destined to suicide
through a basic inadequacy in coping
with the world's insensitivity.

Tristan's role is extremely difficult,
for the entire drama revolves about
the actor's ability to express his inner
most emotions through the guise of a
running monologue. We understand
what Tristan says but we find it dif
ficult to accept what he feels.
Theatrical Cliches
Actor Bob Dwan 6hys away from
total involvement, preventing the au
dience from incorporating themselves
in his dilemma. His movements on
stage are forced and embody too
many "theatrical cliches". This ap
pears to be the fault of everyone on
stage except for the character of
Nancy (Nancy Black) who seems to
express herself most naturally. Her
movements don't distract from what
she's saying; her character is real.
Much of the problem, I feel, lies in
the direction of the play. Better use
of lighting to isolate the characters
and reinforce their moods, a more
abstract set design to stress the dis
tortion of Tristan's dream like reality,
and more emphasis on natural, re
laxed expression of emotion might
have been beneficial. Bierman's ap
proach is an interesting one, but its
vitality is lost in production.
Blend of Humor and Trust
The Miracle Wolf of Gubbio is most
effective, a careful blend of humor
and truth. Using the technique of
play-within-a-play, Jim Bierman and
Sheldon Feldner's original plot
evolves about a renaissance student
drama festival presented on All Fool's
Night to honor Harliquino, King of
Fools. Discontent because their uni
versity fails to offer them opportuni
ties to develop individuality, the stu
dents are at first eager to lose them
selves in the Passion Play as if as
suming a projected role would add to
a definition of their identities. The
Passion Play simply leads to discon
tent, and the players begin to act a
play of their own, a play in which the
truths of their individualities are ex
posed.
Enthusiasm Transferred
The play immediately captures the
audience through a series of humor
ous episodes. The players are alive,
and their enthusiasm is quickly trans
ferred to the audience. The freedom
of the staging enables the players to
befriend the audience and involve
them in their frolic. When the clown
ing gives way to seriousness, the audi

ence remains receptive—the actors in
complete control. The action's explo
sive, the humor lusty and fresh, and
the actons totally involved in the por
trayal of their characters.
Most notable in their roles of Fabio
and The Inquisitor were Charles Ho
gan and Jim Callahan respectively.
Their flare and polish are a tribute
and indication of the capabilities of
Ram's Head.

what Tristan says but we find it dif

Theatrical Cliches
Actor Bob Dwan 6hys away from
total involvement, preventing the au
dience from incorporating themselves
in his dilemma. His movements on
stage are forced and embody too
many "theatrical cliches". This ap
pears to be the fault of everyone on
stage except for the character of
Nancy (Nancy Black) who seems to
express herself most naturally. Her
movements don't distract from what
she's saying; her character is real.
Much of the problem, I feel, lies in
the direction of the play. Better use
of lighting to isolate the characters
and reinforce their moods, a more
abstract set design to stress the dis
tortion of Tristan's dream like reality,
and more emphasis on natural, re
laxed expression of emotion might
have been beneficial. Bierman's ap
proach is an interesting one, but its
vitality is lost in production.
Blend of Humor and Trust
The Miracle Wolf of Gubbio is most
effective, a careful blend of humor
and truth. Using the technique of
play-within-a-play, Jim Bierman and
Sheldon Feldner's original plot
evolves about a renaissance student
drama festival presented on All Fool's
Night to honor Harliquino, King of
Fools. Discontent because their uni
versity fails to offer them opportuni
ties to develop individuality, the stu
dents are at first eager to lose them
selves in the Passion Play as if as
suming a projected role would add to
a definition of their identities. The
Passion Play simply leads to discon
tent, and the players begin to act a
play of their own, a play in which the
truths of their individualities are ex
posed.
Enthusiasm Transferred
The play immediately captures the
audience through a series of humor
ous episodes. The players are alive,
and their enthusiasm is quickly trans
ferred to the audience. The freedom
of the staging enables the players to
befriend the audience and involve
them in their frolic. When the clown
ing gives way to seriousness, the audi

ence remains receptive—the actors in
complete control. The action's explo
sive, the humor lusty and fresh, and
the actons totally involved in the por
trayal of their characters.
Most notable in their roles of Fabio
and The Inquisitor were Charles Ho
gan and Jim Callahan respectively.
Their flare and polish are a tribute
and indication of the capabilities of
Ram's Head.
A proud and dedicated group of
student players and playwrights have
moved into the Nitery, the intimate
and informal three-quartered stage
theater off White Plaza in the Old
Union, for a four night engagement
which began last night.
The triology of One Acts includes
Tennessee William's Ten Blocks on
the Camino Real, and two student
written productions: Valparaiso and
The Miracle Wolf of Gubbio.
A study of fantasy, William's plot
depicting the monthly festival to re
store the virginity of a gypsy's daugh
ter, apparently centers in a port of
Latin America. The scenes shift from
the plaza surrounding a decadent ho
tel to the brothel of the village gypsy.
A guitarist (Bob Butler) strolls and

Free-Moving - Actors

suggestive so as not to distract from
the action on stage.
Director Emily Gill has successful

citement and intensity of William's
script. She is well schooled in an un
derstanding of Williams, an under
standing which manifests itself
through the ingenuity of set design
and enthusiasm of the actors in
volved.
ValparaLso, the second of the One
Acts is the least successful of the
three. Jim Bierman's original script
incorporates flash-backs and reverse
sequences to portray the tension of
Tristan (Bob Dwan), a twenty year
old student destined to suicide
through a basic inadequacy in coping
with the world's insensitivity.

Tristan's role is extremely difficult,
for the entire drama revolves about
the actor's ability to express his inner

Enthusiasm Transferred
The play immediately captures the
audience through a series of humor
ous episodes. The players are alive,
and their enthusiasm is quickly trans
ferred to the audience. The freedom
of the staging enables the players to
befriend the audience and involve
them in their frolic. When the clown
ing gives way to seriousness, the audi

ence remains receptive—the actors in
complete control. The action's explo
sive, the humor lusty and fresh, and
the actons totally involved in the por
trayal of their characters.
Most notable in their roles of Fabio
and The Inquisitor were Charles Ho
gan and Jim Callahan respectively.
Their flare and polish are a tribute
and indication of the capabilities of
Ram's Head.
