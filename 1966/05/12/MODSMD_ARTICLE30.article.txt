# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Morrison Versus The Image-Makers 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Through the superficial fool
ishness displayed by the Athletic
Department comes a more dis
turbing aspect of Stanford's
athletic and educational policy.
Pressure from alumni seems to
have been strongly influential in
the decision to force Pat Morri
son to have his hair cut.
This desire to project a false
image which is not particularly
"representative" of the student
body is another example of Stan
ford's rather dishonest public re
lations policy (so long evidenced
by our hypocritical liquor pol
icy).
The idea that conformity is a
worthwhile picture of Stanford
to present to the rest of the
country (not to mention Morri
sons' English countrymen) is
completely incompatible with
the individual freedom this Uni
versity should be trying to real
ize.
It should be made clear to our
image-conscious alumni that,
while we need their money to
maintain and improve our high
level of education, they cannot
buy influence in University de
cision-making, particularly in
areas of individual freedom.
Such decisions must be made
by individuals qualified to make
them (i.e., administrators) in
conjunction with those who will
be affected by them (i.e., stu
dents).
Money implies neither right
nor ability to make others' de
cisions for them.

This is an open letter to every
one concerning Stanford's "im
age." I don't think we need one,
but if we do, I don't think it is
the sole property of the Stan
ford Buck Club, the L.A. Times,
or the Department of Athletics.
On the theory of "one scholar

—one vote," I would like to cast
my vote for the following col
lective image: of a school where
accomplishment is honored more
highly than conformity; where
minor, and even major devia
tions from the norm are wel
comed as natural byproducts of
intellectual vigor; where the
Athletic Department is more
concerned with the welfare of
its students than its own ease of
operation; and finally, a school
where Pat Morrison, and every
other reasonable human being,
could feel comfortable, produc
tive, and protected from the
pressures of the grosser por
tions of society.

Editor, The Daily:
We refuse to believe that Pay
ton Jordon can be serious in not
allowing Pat Morrison to com
pete in Stanford athletics mere
ly because of his personal
grooming. We do not feel that
the length of Morrison's hair
affects his athletic capabilities
in any respect.
We feel that Morrison's hair
cut is perfectly respectable,
though this is no concern of
Payton Jordon's. The decision
to have his hair cut lies in Pat
Morrison's hands. We commend
Pat Morrison for not sacrificing
his principles in the face of Vic
torian attitudes on the part of
the Athletic Department.

• Song Of Sampson
Editor, The Daily:
The following free translation
from the Book of Judges might
be of interest to your readers in
view of the current freshman
track team crisis:
Our hero has long flowing
hair,
his prowess surpasses the
bear;
The foe he oppresses
Because of his tresses—
All foemen, take heed and
beware!
But, oh hero, resist all
temptation;
Be deaf to the administration;
All unwitting we harbor
A spy who will barber
Your locks for the alien
nation.
For the man who conforms
loses power
To stand in this critical hour;
He falls from his height,
Is bereft of his sight,
And is put in the sheep-fold to
cower.
So heed not the cowardly song,
But let your hair flow free and
long;
Be a man, not a rabbit
In tonsure and habit,
And stand with the brave and
the strong!

• Public Property
Editor, The Daily:
The reason why Stanford is a
"great" university is because all
we ever do is bicker about little
things like contraceptives and

haircuts. Using the technique of
compromise, our administration
has been able to handle these
"little things"; it has avoided be
coming chaotic like Cal.
I believe that the Morrison
case has become totally out of
proportion because, although the
Stanford administration has
compromised, Morrison has not.
Morrison has his own personal
rights to groom as he pleases—
to a point. Like any Stanford
athlete, he represents us to the
general public. As a great sprin
ter, Morrison is in an unfortu
nate position for himself and
the University because he at
tracts more than the usual at
tention to himself and his per
sonal life. Therefore, he has
passed the point of mere self
representation, and what at one
time was a personal right, de
cision, and problem, has become
a public one.
As a responsible representa
tive of the Stanford community,
Morrison should realize that al
though the student may under

stand his reasons for long hair,
etc. the general public does not.
The private life of a public fig
ure is public property.

Our hero has long flowing
hair,
his prowess surpasses the

The foe he oppresses
Because of his tresses—
All foemen, take heed and

Be deaf to the administration;

The reason why Stanford is a
"great" university is because all
we ever do is bicker about little
things like contraceptives and

haircuts. Using the technique of
compromise, our administration
has been able to handle these
"little things"; it has avoided be
coming chaotic like Cal.
I believe that the Morrison
case has become totally out of
proportion because, although the
Stanford administration has
compromised, Morrison has not.
Morrison has his own personal
rights to groom as he pleases—
to a point. Like any Stanford
athlete, he represents us to the
general public. As a great sprin
ter, Morrison is in an unfortu
nate position for himself and
the University because he at
tracts more than the usual at
tention to himself and his per
sonal life. Therefore, he has
passed the point of mere self
representation, and what at one
time was a personal right, de
cision, and problem, has become
a public one.
As a responsible representa
tive of the Stanford community,
Morrison should realize that al
though the student may under

stand his reasons for long hair,
etc. the general public does not.

Our hero has long flowing
hair,
his prowess surpasses the

The foe he oppresses
Because of his tresses—
All foemen, take heed and

But, oh hero, resist all
temptation;
Be deaf to the administration;
All unwitting we harbor
A spy who will barber
Your locks for the alien

For the man who conforms

To stand in this critical hour;
He falls from his height,

And is put in the sheep-fold to

But let your hair flow free and

Be a man, not a rabbit
In tonsure and habit,
And stand with the brave and

The reason why Stanford is a
"great" university is because all
we ever do is bicker about little
things like contraceptives and

haircuts. Using the technique of
compromise, our administration
has been able to handle these
"little things"; it has avoided be
coming chaotic like Cal.
I believe that the Morrison
case has become totally out of
proportion because, although the
Stanford administration has
compromised, Morrison has not.
Morrison has his own personal
rights to groom as he pleases—
to a point. Like any Stanford
athlete, he represents us to the
general public. As a great sprin
ter, Morrison is in an unfortu
nate position for himself and
the University because he at
tracts more than the usual at
tention to himself and his per
sonal life. Therefore, he has
passed the point of mere self
representation, and what at one
time was a personal right, de
cision, and problem, has become
a public one.
As a responsible representa
tive of the Stanford community,
Morrison should realize that al
though the student may under

stand his reasons for long hair,
etc. the general public does not.
The private life of a public fig
