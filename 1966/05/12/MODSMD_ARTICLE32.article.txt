# The

Sponsor selection should raise some funda
mental questions about the freshman year at
Stanford. Unfortunately, the focus has been on
specific procedures, not substantive changes.
Dean Wert told The Daily Monday that "The
Committee (on Undergraduate Education)
would be pleased to hear the views of students
and faculty on this important matter." These
views must challenge assumptions which justify
the "freshman experience" or they will dissolve
into a parochial quibble.
The Dean's statement argued that lack of ap
plicants for sponsor positions raises questions
of "whether the sponsor system is considered
anarchronistic by today's undergraduates and
whether today's undergraduates are as genu
inely interested in the challenge of assisting the
University as they once were."
The statement is surprising in the context of
rising student concern. Initiative in overseas
campus reform, new humanities major, and jazz
year organization are but three examples. Un
dergraduates are "genuinely interested."
Is the sponsor system anachronistic? A sud
den change of interest in the wake of continu
ing controversy with the faculty master and
sometimes-capricious intervention by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education suggests
that discontent is quite exogenous to the "spon
sor system." The baby is not a fault, but one sus
pects the bathwater.
That Wilbur is "anachronistic" seems more
likely. The argument against dispersing the
freshmen through the men's residences is that
it would make upperclassemn a minority in all
men's housing. This, it is said, would drive them
all off campus or, with recent liberalization, to
drink.
The assumption to challenge is that freshmen
should live together. When "associates" are pa

raded in like a medicine show to give freshmen
a taste of the real University, they are clearly
being acclimatized too cautiously.
Sponsors, then, are influential precisely be
cause they represent the only close contact be
tween freshmen and people of greater experi
ence and presumably greater maturity. Their
very importance is an indictment of the present
system.
The usual incantation to justify having fresh
men together is a "class unity" which is not
called upon again until a senior class president
is elected by 25 per cent of those eligible to vote.
The ease with which freshmen can meet other
freshmen is a bogus argument. Cross-fertiliza
tion is preferable to in-breeding.
Dean Wert concluded with the assurance that
his committee will continue to challenge spon
sor selection procedures.
He wonders about "the desirability of being
the only University in the United States which
entrusts counseling and advising of freshmen
largely to a group of self-perpetuating under
graduates who have insisted that only they know
enough to be experts in picking their own suc
cessors."
If sponsors are constantly to be questioned
in this patronizing way about their own com
petence, is it any wonder that few apply?
This also misstates the situation. Sponsors
have not insisted that they be self-perpetuating,
and new selection procedures prevent this.
Finally, being "the only University" is not al
ways a source of shame. It can even be a sign
of leadership.
To argue on these terms, though, misses the
essential point: that Wilbur itself deserves scru
tiny. The sponsor system is not a fault, but points
to a broader malignancy. The first step is to rec
ognize the breadth of the problem.
