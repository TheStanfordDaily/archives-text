By JAMES RESTON
May is not the ideal month
for political demonstrations on
the campuses of California. The
roads along the Pacific are too
beautiful, the hills too green
and full of flowering trees, the
girls too diverting and the final
exams too close.
Yet the signbearers have
been loose here in the inner
quadrangle at Stanford again
this week, denouncing the uni
versity for making secret re
search contracts with the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency in
Washington. "No more classi
fied contracts," says one sign.
"Liberate the faculty," says
another, though the visible
members of the faculty looked
reasonably happy and even well
fed.
Independent Scholarship
Nevertheless, there is a prob
lem here, or at least the symbol
of a problem, that troubles not
only the comparatively few
protestors but members of the
faculty and administration at
Stanford as well.
These earnest young gradu
ate students are worried about
the reputation of their universi
ty for independent scholarship.
Actually, Stanford has only one
classified CIA contract and this
is in the engineering depart
ment. It was taken on the under
standing that it would have to
pass the same academic stand
ards that exist for all contracts
at Stanford, that it would avoid
any CIA overseas activities, and
any clandestine activities of that
agency.
Yet this clearly did not satisfy
the students, who sometimes do
not know whether they are
actually working on CIA proj
ects, and fear that Stanford,
which now gets about 40 percent
of its budget from the Federal
Government, may be in danger
of unbalancing its academic pro
gram and losing its reputation.
Hubert Heffner, the Associ

ate Provost for Research at
Stanford, was explaining to the
students that nobody was com
pelled to work on secret proj
ects and emphasizing that none
of the contracts had anything
to do with Vietnam, but he was
having a hard time.
"We protest," the student
bulletin said, our university's
involvement in any classified
research whatsoever. Such classi
fication, imposed for purely
political or ideological reason,
is a violation of one of the
fundamental principles of aca
demic freedom. The university
is the place for free and open
inquiry, for the disinterested
pursuit of knowledge. Any vio
lation of this principle must be
resisted.
One of the problems is that
the CIA has a dual function.
It is mainly a fact-gathering
arm of the Government, but on
the side it is also engaged in
secret political and military op
erations, designed in some
cases to oppose certain political
US interests.
What troubles many universi
ty administrators is that the
complaints about the compara
tively small CIA contracts with
the universities may raise ques
tions about the validity of the
far more important contracts
with other Federal departments
and agencies.
lobbying For Funds
These Government contracts
are now so valuable that some
universities have paid lobbyists
in Washington to see that they
get their fair share. Over 53
per cent of the total budget of
the University of California
came from Washington last
year. This amounted to $363,-
019,000 in 1965, $246, 475,0C0 of
it for atomic energy research.
The universities may not like
some of the problems raised by
this money but they like the
money. It may distort their
academic programs by over
emphasizing the sciences and
underemphasizing the human
ities, but these Federal funds
have now become so important
that most of the large universi
ties, even the most prestigious,
could scarcely get along now
without them.
The CIA takes the position

that there is no difference be
tween the Department of Agri
culture making a research con
tract with a university on new
strains of rice in Asia, and
the CIA making a research con
tract with Harvard, say, for a
study of Communism among
the labor unions of Japan. But
there is a strong feeling in the
university communities that
there is a fundamental differ
ence.
The point can and is being
argued out here with some
strong feeling, and the unfor
tunate thing about it is that
at least some of the contro

versy is unnecessary. For ex
ample, the same research work,
if proposed by the Library of
Congress, would not be contro
versial. The CIA has been casual
about the dangers of harming
the reputations not only of uni
versities but of distinguished
magazines. Archeologists and
journalists, free lance writers
and editors of academic journ
als, are not normally very
wealthy. Some of them are vul
nerable to money corruption,
and the CIA has not hesitated
to use them when it could. The
Stanford demonstration is only
one of the unfortunate reactions.
