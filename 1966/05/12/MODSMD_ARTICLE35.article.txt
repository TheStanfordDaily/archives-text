# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Dean Wert Misses The Point 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.

• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.
WILLIAM A. CUNHA
• UnfortiiDate Tone
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter be
cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

• Hutchison's Fault
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Wert should re
examine the premises of his
"logical" argument for question
ing of the value of the Wilbur
sponsor system. First, I see no
connection between apparent
lack of interest in a program
and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

Editor, The Daily:
The fruits of a recent Tues
day, Dean Wert's grave ques
tionings about the value of the
sponsor system—and the simul
taneous appearance of Western
Politica — would be even more
alarming if it were to appear
that there was any connection
between the two events.
GARY A. PATTON
• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.

ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.

• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.
WILLIAM A. CUNHA
• UnfortiiDate Tone
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter be
cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

• Hutchison's Fault
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Wert should re
examine the premises of his
"logical" argument for question
ing of the value of the Wilbur
sponsor system. First, I see no
connection between apparent
lack of interest in a program
and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

GARY A. PATTON
• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.
MAURICE M. OSBORNE, Jr.,

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
WILLIAM BARK
ProfeKHor of History
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and

• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.
WILLIAM A. CUNHA
• UnfortiiDate Tone
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter be
cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

• Hutchison's Fault
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Wert should re
examine the premises of his
"logical" argument for question
ing of the value of the Wilbur
sponsor system. First, I see no
connection between apparent
lack of interest in a program
and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

The fruits of a recent Tues

GARY A. PATTON
• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
WILLIAM BARK
ProfeKHor of History
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.

cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Wert should re
examine the premises of his
"logical" argument for question
ing of the value of the Wilbur
sponsor system. First, I see no
connection between apparent
lack of interest in a program
and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

GARY A. PATTON
• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
WILLIAM BARK
ProfeKHor of History
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.

• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.

administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Wert should re
examine the premises of his
"logical" argument for question
ing of the value of the Wilbur
sponsor system. First, I see no
connection between apparent
lack of interest in a program
and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

GARY A. PATTON
• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
WILLIAM BARK
ProfeKHor of History
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.
RICHARD ANDERMAN

• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.
WILLIAM A. CUNHA
• UnfortiiDate Tone
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter be
cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their

and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

GARY A. PATTON
• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
WILLIAM BARK
ProfeKHor of History
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.
RICHARD ANDERMAN
FRED JOHNSON
• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.
WILLIAM A. CUNHA
• UnfortiiDate Tone
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter be
cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

• Fills, Past & Present
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify some of
the points covered in the May 11
story on the contraceptive issue,
and to correct what I feel to be
some erroneous impressions
created by the article.
Prior to 1962, the Health Ser
vice had given no serious
thought, either pro or con, to the
need for a definitive policy on
contraception. For many years,
contraceptive devices had been
prescribed for both married
women students and for those
about to be married when they
desired it—as a commonly ac
ceptable part of medical prac
tice.
Beyond this, each physician
was expected to use his best
judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
WILLIAM BARK
ProfeKHor of History
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Wert's statement of
May 9 on the sponsor problem
misrepresents, largely through
omission, the issues involved.
From the article: "Dean Wert,
chairman of CUE, expressed
alarm that few students applied
for sponsor positions and indi
cated a thorough review would
be called for."
In a statement to The Daily
he said:
"The Committee on Under
graduate Education is dismayed
that only some 50 students have
applied for 25 sponsor positions
in Wilbur Hall for next year.
This is less than half as many
as have applied in previous
years. Being forced to select one
out of two candidates raises
grave questions about whether
the sponsor system is considered
anachronistic by today's under
graduates and whether today's
undergraduates are as genuinely
interested in the challenge of as
sisting the University as they
once were."
We acknowledge the possibili
ty that undergraduates are dis
satisfied with the composition
of the present sponsor group,
yet we point out that the spon
sors no longer have complete
autonomy in selection and that
they body's composition is sub
ject to change. We feel that the
smaller number of applications
received this year results from
the introduction of a faculty
master system into Wilbur and
the conflict that has occurred
between Professor Hutchinson
and the sponsors. It appears that
Professor Hutchinson wishes to
make employees of the spon
sors. Quite simply, the prospect
of dealing, as a sponsor, with
Professor Hutchinson is not very
inviting.
Perhaps a conflict between
the sponsors and the first facul
ty master was inevitable. In any
case, such a conflict now exists,
necessitating not only a review
of the sponsor system, but also
the competence of Professor
Hutchinson.
It is impossible for us to be
lieve that Dean Wert does not
understand that this conflict is
central to the need for revalua
tion; yet his statement belies
this understanding, and we must
suspect that we are not being
dealt with honestly.
There will be nothing, how
ever, not a solution to the spon
sor problem, nor a perfection
of the faculty master system,
until the University ceases to
obscure, willfully or not, the
real issues involved.
RICHARD ANDERMAN
FRED JOHNSON
• Ah, Mr. Wert
Editor, The Daily:
I was one of the applicants
for sponsor that didn't apply.
I've hashed in Wilbur for three
years, been in contact with each

succeeding freshman class.
Of the three directors of Wil
bur Hall, only one has had any
contention with the sponsors, or
the program, and only one has
been held in such low esteem by
the freshmen whom he is di
recting.
I am a close friend of one of
the sponsors, and despite his
urgings, and my already sincere
interest and belief in the value
of the sponsor program, I de
cided not to apply because of
the dogmatic and arbitrary tac
tics of the present faculty mas
ter. The question is not the val
ue of the sponsor program, but
the value of the faculty master
program, if this is how it is in
practice, and not theory.
I can also account for three
other "missing" applicants, all
for the same reason. Better ask
another question, Mr. Wert.
WILLIAM A. CUNHA
• UnfortiiDate Tone
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter be
cause I feel there is an unfor
tunate tone in Dean Werts let
ter about the sponsor program.
He implies, for instance, that
because fewer people have ap
plied to sponsor this year than
in previous years, there is a
shortage of qualified people.
Such an implication is a non
sequitur; for one cannot deter
mine the quality of people who
have applied by the number who
fill out application blanks.
Secondly, Dean Wert states
that people are not applying for
sponsor positions because they
are no longer interested in aid
ing the University. Unfortunate
ly, I feel the tragedy of the
present Wilbur Program is that
people do want to assist the
University, but that they are
being frustrated in their efforts
to do so.
The sponsors, for instance,
have usually conceived of their
role as one of personal relation
ships with freshmen. This year,
the sponsors have become in
volved in student politics and
administrative dealings not out
of choice but of necessity. Be
cause of this unfortunate expan
sion of the sponsor's role, many
people have not applied.
The onus for the shortage of
applications, must lie with the
administration and not the stu
dents.
Thirdly, Dean Wert criticizes
the present sponsor selection
procedure because the sponsors
think "only they know enough
to be experts in picking their
own successors." This, however,
is certainly not the case for on
the present selection committee
there are four sponsors, two
faculty residents, and one fresh
man who judge new applicants.
Yet regardless of this year's
selection committee, Dean
Wert's objection must be an
swered on more theoretical
grounds. For who I wonder is
better able to pick a sponsor
than a person who has lived
with the daily problem? Certain
ly Dean Wert would think it
impractical for students to set
criteria for selecting new deans.
Likewise I think it would be
impractical for the Dean's office
to set criteria for selecting new
sponsors.

• Hutchison's Fault
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps Mr. Wert should re
examine the premises of his
"logical" argument for question
ing of the value of the Wilbur
sponsor system. First, I see no
connection between apparent
lack of interest in a program
and its value, i.e. because only a

small minority of people show
an interest in social work, does
it logically follow that it is not
valuable?
Secondly, I, personally, can
testify that the shortage of ap
plicants was due, not to a lack
of interest or support in the
Sponsor System, but instead
largely due to the faculty mas
ter's arbitrary contentions with
the program.
As a head hasher at Wilbur
Hall, I can attest to the com
plete lack of communication be
tween the faculty master and
the freshmen. He apparently has
had little to do with them on a
personal level, and for the most
part has obstructed the one pro
gram that does seek to deal with
freshmen personally.
I considered quite seriously
applying for sponsor this year,
not for any political or idealistic
reasons, but merely looking for
ward to the personal contact
with freshmen, to help them de
velop and to be developed by
them.
It was Dr. Hutchinsons' con
tinual and arbitrary harassment
of this year's sponsors that
made me finally decide that it
might not be worth it. This
might be one premise that Mr.
Wert overlooked.

judgment in the care of individ
ual patients, in a context of con
fidential doctor-patient relation
ships, and it is certain that on
occasion individual Health Ser
vice doctors (myself included)
did prescribe contraceptive de
vices, and later pills, in the sin
cere belief that they were serving
the best interests of those in
dividuals.
I have no idea how often this
occurred, but I am quite sure
that there was not any general
policy making "birth control de
vices (or pills) available for the
alumna (Letters, The Daily, May
10). It is also sure that the Ad
ministration had not been in
volved in any policy discussion,
and was unaware of Health Ser
vice practices in this area.
That either prescribing or dis
pensing contraceptives to un
married women student could
remain confidential and of sole
concern to the doctor and the
student now seems to me to have
been very unrealistic, particu
larly with the increased demand
that came inevitably after the
introduction of oral contracep
tives in 1960.
With all the wisdom of the
"retrospectoscope" it appears
obvious to me now that some
students would inevitably share
their "secret" with others; that
this could all too easily be mis
interpreted as a general Health
Service policy (and thus a Uni
versity policy); that other stu
dents disapproving of it would
transmit their concerns to
friends and parents; and that,
has the Administration been
aware of the facts, it could not
in any case have approved of
such a policy or practice on be
half of the University.
In 1962, when the President
first learned, through a letter
from a parent, that contracep
tives had been prescribed to an
unmarried woman student, he
acted immediately to suspend all
activities of the Health Service
in the area of contraceptives.
The May 11 article gives the
impression that the Administra
tion had been aware of, and had
at least tacitly condoned the
Health Service practice, and had
been forced by "outside" pres
sures to change its position.
While there were indeed num
erous and forceful expressions
of concern from parents, alumni,
and some religious groups, the
President had acted first, not in
response to "pressures," but
from his own convictions, im
mediately upon becoming aware
of the situation.
I would also like to correct any
impression I may have given
that I wholly approve of Health
Services practices prior to 1962
(including my own), or that I
endorse such a policy or prac
tices now. The reasons I have
set forth at some length pre
viously (The Daily, Feb. 16), and
indicate that the issue is very

much more complex than I had
appreciated prior to 1962.
I do endorse the present pol
icy, and as I have repeatedly
stated, remain open to serious
and responsible discussion which,
however, must involve other
than just students and Health
Service.

• Martindale Report
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment on the re
port of the Ad Hoc Committee
of the Overseas Campus Board
(The Daily, May 2). In doing
this, I am replying to the cour
teous invitation issued by Stev
en Martindale, Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee.
First, with reference to the
Committee's suggestion that
"the program should focus on
the national, rather than the
European, experience," I have
serious reservations.
The trend in the world is defi
nitely toward an international
rather than a national outlook,
toward the general and eccu
menical rather than toward the
narrow view, toward cosmopoli
tanism and away from parochi
alism.
If the term "European experi
ence" can only mean a long,
thorough, sustained period of
living and studying in Europe,
then you are right and the term
is indeed inaccurate.
I believe, however, that the
General Studies Committee (of
which I was a member when
the Overseas Program was be
ing initiated) had something
more practical in mind.
The Overseas Program is
meant to be only an introduc
tion to a "European experi
ence," an introduction which
can be, and to my knowledge
often has been, followed up and
extended in later years. This
process of building upon the
original overseas experience
could, and should, go on profit
ably for the rest of one's life.
Another "practical" aspect of
the program as envisaged by the
General Studies Comittee is that
a six months' stay means that
many more students can partic
ipate.
A longer stay, two or three
times as long as the present
one, would doubtless be very
useful and pleasant for the
lucky ones who got to go on it
but they would for financial rea
sons be few in number as com
pared with those eligible under
the present system.
There would also in all likeli
hood be a much heavier empha
sis on linguistic preparation at
the continental branches. The
General Studies Committee care
fully avoided this strong empha
sis on linguistic preparation, be
cause the aim of the University
was to give this valuable intro
ductory foreign experience to as
broad a cross-section of Stan
ford undergraduates as possible.
Consequently, hampering and
restricting qualifications that
would make it a program pri
marily suited to language ma
jors were deliberately avoided.
The program was conceived and
constructed primarily as an im
portant part of the General
Studies Program at Stanford.
It is, as the Martindale Re
ports say, impossible to explore
European culture in six months,
but no one ever claimed that
this was possible. In actual fact,
however, many Stanford stu
dents do cover a great deal of
European (and Asian and Afri
can) ground while overseas.
The Martindale Report shows
that the Program is successful
in demonstrating the need to go
back again and again. If I may
judge from the many conversa
tions I have had in the last few
years, most Stanford men and
women who go to Europe on
the Overseas Program travel
widely and it seems to me that
the more widely they have done
this, the more eager they are to
go back and continue the proc
ess.
The Martindale Report has
some excellent suggestions
about libraries, guest lecture se
ries, closer contact with the sur
rounding Overseas communi
ties, and preparation for the
trip.
I agree that as much as pos
sible should be done to acquaint
Stanford people with the cul
ture of the host country. But
fortunately this does not have
to mean taking a narrow view
and declining to look beyond
the borders of that country. Eu
ropeans themselves are working
toward common markets and a
community of interests, stres
sing what they share rather
than what divides them.
I am glad the Martindale
Committee does not mean its
Report to be "final or defini
tive" and that it has invited
comment from members of the
faculty who have taught over
seas.
I admire their report for the
many valuable suggestions it
makes and for the open spirit
in which it asks for comment. I
mean this letter as an apprecia
tive and constructive response
to that invitation.
