# Stu-Fac Advisory Council To Review Athletic Policy
## 
### JANIE ARIES 
The President's Advisory Commit
tee on Athletics will meet today at
2:00 to review the controversy over
Pat Morrison.
Professor of Law John Hurlbut,
Chairman of the Committee said, "The
Committee has been asked by Ath
letic Director Taylor to acquaint itself
with the problem and take a look at
the policies involved. The Committee
is available for such advice and coun
sel as it can give either to the Presi
dent or the Athletic Director. It could
well be this isn't a matter that can be
handled in a few minutes. The most
that can be said is that we're going to
meet."
Committee Members
The Athletics Committee has eight
faculty members, including Taylor,
and three student members Dave Rob
bins, Dave Hawkins and Roger McNit.
Director of Athletics Chuck Taylor
requested that the problem be taken
to the Athletics Committee following
a meeting yesterday with four stu
dents representing the Track Team.
Mike Hughes and Dave Deubner,
members of the Varsity who have
been serving as a liaison between the
team, the Athletic Department and
the Administration; Tom Kommers,
co-captain of the Freshman Track
Team; and Dave Robbins, student
member of the Athletics Committee
were the four who met with Taylor.
Issue Discussion
According to Mike Hughes, "The
meeting was simply a discussion of
the issues in general, by involved and
interested parties, to determine how

this controversy might be resolved in
a controlled manner. Taylor felt, as all
of us did, that involving the Athletics
Committee at his request was the
most promising and appropriate
course of action."
Later in the afternoon Taylor and
Morrison met and agreed, Taylor said,
that with a problem of this nature it
would be appropriate to move into the
realm of the Athletics Committee.
Morrison concurred that this decision
is probably the wisest, most discrete
thing at the present time.
Taylor affirmed that there was no
agreement on philosophy. "We barely

clarified our positions to each other,"
Morrison stated.
As of now the Track Team will com
pote without Morrison today against
Santa Ana and Saturday in the West
Coast Relays.
Kearney Buskirk, member of the
Freshman Team commented, "We'll
have to do our best without Pat. It's
regrettable that he's not competing
because Santa Ana would be a tough
match even with Pat.
"For most of the Freshman Team,
this is the last meet of the season and
naturally we would like to finish the
season well."

season well."
The President's Advisory Commit
tee on Athletics will meet today at
2:00 to review the controversy over
Pat Morrison.
Professor of Law John Hurlbut,
Chairman of the Committee said, "The
Committee has been asked by Ath
letic Director Taylor to acquaint itself
with the problem and take a look at
the policies involved. The Committee
is available for such advice and coun
sel as it can give either to the Presi
dent or the Athletic Director. It could
well be this isn't a matter that can be
handled in a few minutes. The most
that can be said is that we're going to
meet."
Committee Members
The Athletics Committee has eight
faculty members, including Taylor,
and three student members Dave Rob
bins, Dave Hawkins and Roger McNit.
Director of Athletics Chuck Taylor
requested that the problem be taken
to the Athletics Committee following
a meeting yesterday with four stu
dents representing the Track Team.
Mike Hughes and Dave Deubner,
members of the Varsity who have
been serving as a liaison between the
team, the Athletic Department and
the Administration; Tom Kommers,
co-captain of the Freshman Track
Team; and Dave Robbins, student
member of the Athletics Committee
were the four who met with Taylor.
Issue Discussion
According to Mike Hughes, "The
meeting was simply a discussion of
the issues in general, by involved and
interested parties, to determine how

this controversy might be resolved in
a controlled manner. Taylor felt, as all
of us did, that involving the Athletics
Committee at his request was the
most promising and appropriate
course of action."
Later in the afternoon Taylor and
Morrison met and agreed, Taylor said,
that with a problem of this nature it
would be appropriate to move into the
realm of the Athletics Committee.
Morrison concurred that this decision
is probably the wisest, most discrete
thing at the present time.
Taylor affirmed that there was no
agreement on philosophy. "We barely

clarified our positions to each other,"
Morrison stated.
As of now the Track Team will com
pote without Morrison today against
Santa Ana and Saturday in the West
Coast Relays.
Kearney Buskirk, member of the
Freshman Team commented, "We'll
have to do our best without Pat. It's
regrettable that he's not competing
because Santa Ana would be a tough
match even with Pat.
"For most of the Freshman Team,
this is the last meet of the season and
naturally we would like to finish the
season well."
