# Rival Draft Test Scheduled For Saturday
## 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK 
Members of the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam, in coopera
tion with the Students for a Demo
cratic Society, will confront men tak
ing the Government's Selective Ser
vice Examination tomorrow with
their own special test, a spokesman
for the group announced yesterday.
The exam, "National Vietnam Ex
amination," and an accompanying
message, "Call for an Examination of
Conscience," which were drawn up by
the SDS, whose national headquarters
is in Chicago, will be distributed at
900 of the 1200 Selective Service test
centers throughout the nation, report
ed Norman Potter, SDS staff member
at the San Francisco regional office.
Potter pointed out that among those
who helped draw up the exam were
ex-Green Beret Donald Duncan,
Staughton Lund, Robert Sheer, and
Stanley Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum re
cently addressed the Stanford com

munity. Consultants included William
Sloan Coffin, Jr., D. F. Fleming, and
Linus Pauling.
Eighteen Questions
The exam contains eighteen multi
ple-choice questions. As an example,
"There were approximately 540,000
South Vietnamese in all branches of
the Saigon government's fighting
forces in 1965. About how many
South Vietnamese deserted during
1965?" Of the five answers suggested,
the highest, 113,000, is the correct one,
according to the documented answer
sheet which accompanies the ques
tions.
In the "Call for an Examination of
Conscience," the SDS explains that
their exam "will ask you questions
about the war—fair and objective
questions — and about how you see
your relation to it, and what kind of
government ours has become."
"When you kill a man, you kill a
man. And we think you'd better know

what you're doing when you do it,"
the "Call" declares.
Challenging the ethics of conscrip
tion and questioning the democratic
intentions of institutions which force
men to fight, the "Call" asks, "Why
doesn't the Government look for peo
ple who want to be soldiers in the
war?"
The report continues, "And if no-

ter in Encina Hall today and pick up their room assignments, according
to Dr. John D. Black, director of the Center.

body wants to fight, and if they
can't persuade us, then why don't
they quit trying to force us to fight?
After all, the thing about American
democracy is supposed to be that the
government belongs to the people. Or
maybe things have changed? . . .

"Maybe the real battle for democracy
is right here in America?"
Both the SCPV and the SDS at
tacked the Draft exam as smacking
of "a little old-fashioned class privi
lege." SCPV spokesmen agreed with
the SDS "Call" which claims that the
message of the Selective Service is
"If you're white and middle-class and

a Dean's-list kind of guy, relax. If
you're not, fall in."
A statement read by a member of
the SCPV at the SDS press confer
ence Wednesday announced opposi
tion to "an undemocratic and authori
tarian draft which coerces young men

to fight in an illegal, impractical, and
immoral war."
The SCPV also announced that it is
sending a letter to Professor E. R.
Hilgard, Chairman of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council,
requesting that the Council consider
refusing to allow the use of Stanford
facilities for administering the Se
lective Service test "for the same rea
sons that the Academic Senate of San
Francisco State College did so."
San Francisco State
On April 19, the Academic Senate
of San Francisco State unanimously
adopted a resolution deploring "the
utilization of class standing or exami
nation scores as criteria for deter
mining student draft status" and
recommending to the President of
San Francisco State that the registrar
no longer calculate or record calss
standings and that the College not
allow its facilities to be used to admin
ister the Selective Service test. Thev

charged that the test acts to the dis
advantage of students "who emerge
from backgrounds of relative cultural
deprivation" and students "whose
predilections and most developed ca
pacities lie in the Arts and Humani
ties."
"These criteria must inevitably sub
vert the best efforts of faculties," the
professors said, "because the compe
tition for grades resulting from such
criteria will discourage students from
exploring academic areas and activi
ties in which they are unsure of their
abilities to receive high grades."
They also charged that grades and
test scores are "neither demonstrably
nor apparently valid determinants of
the degree to which a student may
derive lifetime benefits from his edu
cational experience, nor the degree to
which he deserves to share in that ex
perience . . . nor, certainly, of the
degree to which he deserves to live
or die."

San Francisco State
On April 19, the Academic Senate
of San Francisco State unanimously
adopted a resolution deploring "the
utilization of class standing or exami
nation scores as criteria for deter
mining student draft status" and
recommending to the President of
San Francisco State that the registrar
no longer calculate or record calss
standings and that the College not
allow its facilities to be used to admin
ister the Selective Service test. Thev

charged that the test acts to the dis
advantage of students "who emerge
from backgrounds of relative cultural
deprivation" and students "whose
predilections and most developed ca
pacities lie in the Arts and Humani
ties."
"These criteria must inevitably sub
vert the best efforts of faculties," the
professors said, "because the compe
tition for grades resulting from such
criteria will discourage students from
exploring academic areas and activi
ties in which they are unsure of their
abilities to receive high grades."
They also charged that grades and
test scores are "neither demonstrably
nor apparently valid determinants of
the degree to which a student may
derive lifetime benefits from his edu
cational experience, nor the degree to
which he deserves to share in that ex
perience . . . nor, certainly, of the
degree to which he deserves to live
or die."
Members of the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam, in coopera
tion with the Students for a Demo
cratic Society, will confront men tak
ing the Government's Selective Ser
vice Examination tomorrow with
their own special test, a spokesman
for the group announced yesterday.
The exam, "National Vietnam Ex
amination," and an accompanying
message, "Call for an Examination of
Conscience," which were drawn up by
the SDS, whose national headquarters
is in Chicago, will be distributed at
900 of the 1200 Selective Service test
centers throughout the nation, report
ed Norman Potter, SDS staff member
at the San Francisco regional office.
Potter pointed out that among those
who helped draw up the exam were
ex-Green Beret Donald Duncan,
Staughton Lund, Robert Sheer, and
Stanley Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum re
cently addressed the Stanford com

munity. Consultants included William
Sloan Coffin, Jr., D. F. Fleming, and
Linus Pauling.
Eighteen Questions
The exam contains eighteen multi
ple-choice questions. As an example,
"There were approximately 540,000
South Vietnamese in all branches of
the Saigon government's fighting
forces in 1965. About how many
South Vietnamese deserted during
1965?" Of the five answers suggested,
the highest, 113,000, is the correct one,
according to the documented answer
sheet which accompanies the ques
tions.
In the "Call for an Examination of
Conscience," the SDS explains that
their exam "will ask you questions
about the war—fair and objective
questions — and about how you see
your relation to it, and what kind of
government ours has become."
"When you kill a man, you kill a
man. And we think you'd better know

what you're doing when you do it,"
the "Call" declares.
Challenging the ethics of conscrip
tion and questioning the democratic
intentions of institutions which force
men to fight, the "Call" asks, "Why

deprivation" and students "whose
predilections and most developed ca
pacities lie in the Arts and Humani
ties."
"These criteria must inevitably sub
vert the best efforts of faculties," the
professors said, "because the compe
tition for grades resulting from such
criteria will discourage students from
exploring academic areas and activi
ties in which they are unsure of their
abilities to receive high grades."
They also charged that grades and
test scores are "neither demonstrably
nor apparently valid determinants of
the degree to which a student may
derive lifetime benefits from his edu
cational experience, nor the degree to
which he deserves to share in that ex
perience . . . nor, certainly, of the
degree to which he deserves to live
or die."
Members of the Stanford Commit
tee for Peace in Vietnam, in coopera
tion with the Students for a Demo
cratic Society, will confront men tak
ing the Government's Selective Ser
vice Examination tomorrow with
their own special test, a spokesman
for the group announced yesterday.
The exam, "National Vietnam Ex
amination," and an accompanying
message, "Call for an Examination of
Conscience," which were drawn up by
the SDS, whose national headquarters
is in Chicago, will be distributed at
900 of the 1200 Selective Service test
centers throughout the nation, report
ed Norman Potter, SDS staff member
at the San Francisco regional office.
Potter pointed out that among those
who helped draw up the exam were
ex-Green Beret Donald Duncan,
Staughton Lund, Robert Sheer, and
Stanley Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum re
cently addressed the Stanford com

munity. Consultants included William
Sloan Coffin, Jr., D. F. Fleming, and
Linus Pauling.
Eighteen Questions
The exam contains eighteen multi
ple-choice questions. As an example,
"There were approximately 540,000
South Vietnamese in all branches of
the Saigon government's fighting
forces in 1965. About how many
South Vietnamese deserted during
1965?" Of the five answers suggested,
the highest, 113,000, is the correct one,
according to the documented answer
sheet which accompanies the ques
tions.
In the "Call for an Examination of
Conscience," the SDS explains that
their exam "will ask you questions
about the war—fair and objective
questions — and about how you see
your relation to it, and what kind of
government ours has become."
"When you kill a man, you kill a
man. And we think you'd better know

what you're doing when you do it,"
the "Call" declares.
Challenging the ethics of conscrip
tion and questioning the democratic
intentions of institutions which force
men to fight, the "Call" asks, "Why
doesn't the Government look for peo
ple who want to be soldiers in the
war?"
The report continues, "And if no-

body wants to fight, and if they
can't persuade us, then why don't
they quit trying to force us to fight?
After all, the thing about American
democracy is supposed to be that the
government belongs to the people. Or
maybe things have changed? . . .

"Maybe the real battle for democracy
is right here in America?"
Both the SCPV and the SDS at
tacked the Draft exam as smacking
of "a little old-fashioned class privi
lege." SCPV spokesmen agreed with
the SDS "Call" which claims that the
message of the Selective Service is
"If you're white and middle-class and

a Dean's-list kind of guy, relax. If
you're not, fall in."
A statement read by a member of
the SCPV at the SDS press confer
ence Wednesday announced opposi
tion to "an undemocratic and authori
tarian draft which coerces young men

to fight in an illegal, impractical, and
immoral war."
The SCPV also announced that it is
sending a letter to Professor E. R.
Hilgard, Chairman of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council,
requesting that the Council consider
refusing to allow the use of Stanford
facilities for administering the Se
lective Service test "for the same rea
sons that the Academic Senate of San
Francisco State College did so."
San Francisco State
On April 19, the Academic Senate
of San Francisco State unanimously
adopted a resolution deploring "the
utilization of class standing or exami
nation scores as criteria for deter
mining student draft status" and
recommending to the President of
San Francisco State that the registrar
no longer calculate or record calss
standings and that the College not
allow its facilities to be used to admin
ister the Selective Service test. Thev

charged that the test acts to the dis
advantage of students "who emerge
from backgrounds of relative cultural
deprivation" and students "whose
predilections and most developed ca
