# Prisoners Are We Takes 'Brig' To See
## 
### GRAHAM BAKER No. 1-69-12060 
Kenneth Brown's "The Brig"
is ostensibly a day in 1957's hap
penings in the military jail of a
U. S. Marine base in Japan, and
as such most of its audience last
Friday night seemed to under
stand it. On this superficial level
it was a disappointing play,
since it is singularly lacking in
both plot and characterization.
Yet the very lack of either a
substantial plot or much char
acterization and the ennui it
causes are a great strength in
this extraordinary piece of thea
ter.
Perhaps I can best explain
what I mean by giving my
thoughts as I watched. I, too,
expected a more or less conven
tional drama, and as the strict
discipline, the sadistic violence
and the crossing of white lines
ran on without, any apparent
purpose, my expectations were
unfulfilled. I became very bored;
I had assimilated the atmos
phere of the place, and it
seemed that there was no fur
ther reason to stay, but I de
cided to stick it out until inter
mission.
Me, A Sadist?
As I continued to watch, I be
came critical. I had started off
the evening intensely emphathe
tic towards Prisoner No. 2, but
this feeling disappeared and I
now noticed that the Warden
had missed one of his numerous
small breaches of discipline. I
was annoyed at the carelessness
of it. Shortly later one of the in
numerable kicks the guards
dealt the "maggots" seemed in
sufficient retribution for the of
fence of not being fast enough,
and I wished he would be more
thoroughly sadistic about the
whole thing. The violence was
not systematic enough to suit
me.
Then a sudden thought : who's
side was I on, anyway? 1 want
ed yet more of that awful vio
lence from which the "maggots"
had no possibility of defending
themselves. I was being critical
of four men because they were
not vicious, sadistic or systema
tic enough—men whose purpose
was to beat the prisoners into
total submission, to de-humanize
them completely, to make them
into simple automations, and
therefore good Marines.
So I came to know that this

was not simply a play about
cruelly in Marine Corps brigs
(although several ex-Marines
later assured me that the bru
tality was, if anything, under
stated). It was rather about the
world out here, about what you
and I are doing to each other,
or condoning to be done to oth
er people, or allowing to be done
to us without complaining. It
was about Rush, for instance.
University of Automatons
Prisoner No. 5 does exactly
what he is told, and so does
student No. 1-69-12060 on Reg
Day. in class, at the Library or,
say, in the "food square" at Tre
sidder. Both he and I have sub
mitted to a de-humanizing proc
ess so complete that the product
can be guaranteed. The only
way to abort the process is to
insist on your humanity, as does
Prisoner No. 6. This insistence
is immediately defined by the
guards, the university or whom
ever as insanity, so that they
can hide the fact that someone
can break out of the system.
The lack of plot and char
acterization was, then, intended
to make me react exactly as I
had, to force me to the awful
realization about the dehumani
zation of No. 1-69-12060: me.
The play demands a discipline
and a love of man beyond even
Stanislavski's capabilities, yet
director Charles Morrison has
somehow elicited these from his
excellent cast, so I could not
mention one of them without
mentioning them all. He and
they have devised a great deal
of tht most successful business
in the production and have add
ed a few telling lines to the
script. The cast and director
have even designed and built
their own suitably grim set.
Not to Give In
A critic, creature of a system
much bigger than he, past draft
age or a veteran, can perhaps
avoid confronting the meaning
of this play. As a societal auto
mation made to Time-Life plans,
to o so might shatter him. But
you and I, if we want to be
either human or educated, must
conquer the dehumanizing proc
ess. Not to give in to the guards
was a good way for me to be
gin.
If you think you are a human
being or might like to btcome
one, this play should be on your
must-see list.

A critic, creature of a system
much bigger than he, past draft
age or a veteran, can perhaps
avoid confronting the meaning
of this play. As a societal auto
mation made to Time-Life plans,
to o so might shatter him. But
you and I, if we want to be
either human or educated, must
conquer the dehumanizing proc
ess. Not to give in to the guards
was a good way for me to be
gin.
If you think you are a human
being or might like to btcome
one, this play should be on your
must-see list.
Kenneth Brown's "The Brig"
is ostensibly a day in 1957's hap
penings in the military jail of a
U. S. Marine base in Japan, and
as such most of its audience last
Friday night seemed to under
stand it. On this superficial level
it was a disappointing play,
since it is singularly lacking in
both plot and characterization.
Yet the very lack of either a
substantial plot or much char
acterization and the ennui it
causes are a great strength in
this extraordinary piece of thea
ter.
Perhaps I can best explain
what I mean by giving my
thoughts as I watched. I, too,
expected a more or less conven
tional drama, and as the strict
discipline, the sadistic violence
and the crossing of white lines
ran on without, any apparent
purpose, my expectations were
unfulfilled. I became very bored;
I had assimilated the atmos
phere of the place, and it
seemed that there was no fur
ther reason to stay, but I de
cided to stick it out until inter
mission.
Me, A Sadist?
As I continued to watch, I be
came critical. I had started off
the evening intensely emphathe
tic towards Prisoner No. 2, but
this feeling disappeared and I
now noticed that the Warden
had missed one of his numerous
small breaches of discipline. I
was annoyed at the carelessness
of it. Shortly later one of the in
numerable kicks the guards
dealt the "maggots" seemed in
sufficient retribution for the of
fence of not being fast enough,
and I wished he would be more
thoroughly sadistic about the
whole thing. The violence was
not systematic enough to suit
me.
Then a sudden thought : who's
side was I on, anyway? 1 want
ed yet more of that awful vio
lence from which the "maggots"
had no possibility of defending
themselves. I was being critical
of four men because they were
not vicious, sadistic or systema
tic enough—men whose purpose
was to beat the prisoners into
total submission, to de-humanize
them completely, to make them
into simple automations, and
therefore good Marines.
So I came to know that this

was not simply a play about
cruelly in Marine Corps brigs
(although several ex-Marines
later assured me that the bru
tality was, if anything, under
stated). It was rather about the
world out here, about what you
and I are doing to each other,
or condoning to be done to oth
er people, or allowing to be done
to us without complaining. It
was about Rush, for instance.
University of Automatons
Prisoner No. 5 does exactly
what he is told, and so does
student No. 1-69-12060 on Reg
Day. in class, at the Library or,
say, in the "food square" at Tre
sidder. Both he and I have sub
mitted to a de-humanizing proc
ess so complete that the product
can be guaranteed. The only
way to abort the process is to
insist on your humanity, as does
Prisoner No. 6. This insistence
is immediately defined by the
guards, the university or whom
ever as insanity, so that they
can hide the fact that someone
can break out of the system.
The lack of plot and char
acterization was, then, intended
to make me react exactly as I
had, to force me to the awful
realization about the dehumani
zation of No. 1-69-12060: me.
The play demands a discipline
and a love of man beyond even
Stanislavski's capabilities, yet
director Charles Morrison has
somehow elicited these from his
excellent cast, so I could not
mention one of them without
mentioning them all. He and
they have devised a great deal
of tht most successful business

Prisoner No. 6. This insistence
is immediately defined by the
guards, the university or whom
ever as insanity, so that they
can hide the fact that someone
can break out of the system.
The lack of plot and char
acterization was, then, intended
to make me react exactly as I
had, to force me to the awful
realization about the dehumani
zation of No. 1-69-12060: me.
The play demands a discipline
and a love of man beyond even
Stanislavski's capabilities, yet
director Charles Morrison has
somehow elicited these from his
excellent cast, so I could not
mention one of them without
mentioning them all. He and
they have devised a great deal
of tht most successful business
in the production and have add
ed a few telling lines to the
script. The cast and director
have even designed and built
their own suitably grim set.
Not to Give In
A critic, creature of a system
much bigger than he, past draft
age or a veteran, can perhaps
avoid confronting the meaning
of this play. As a societal auto
mation made to Time-Life plans,
to o so might shatter him. But
you and I, if we want to be
either human or educated, must
conquer the dehumanizing proc
ess. Not to give in to the guards
was a good way for me to be
gin.
If you think you are a human
being or might like to btcome
one, this play should be on your
must-see list.
Kenneth Brown's "The Brig"
is ostensibly a day in 1957's hap
penings in the military jail of a
U. S. Marine base in Japan, and
as such most of its audience last
Friday night seemed to under
stand it. On this superficial level
it was a disappointing play,
since it is singularly lacking in
both plot and characterization.
Yet the very lack of either a
substantial plot or much char
acterization and the ennui it
causes are a great strength in
this extraordinary piece of thea
ter.
Perhaps I can best explain
what I mean by giving my
thoughts as I watched. I, too,
expected a more or less conven
tional drama, and as the strict
discipline, the sadistic violence
and the crossing of white lines
ran on without, any apparent
purpose, my expectations were
unfulfilled. I became very bored;
I had assimilated the atmos
phere of the place, and it
seemed that there was no fur
ther reason to stay, but I de
cided to stick it out until inter
mission.
Me, A Sadist?
As I continued to watch, I be
came critical. I had started off
the evening intensely emphathe
tic towards Prisoner No. 2, but
this feeling disappeared and I
now noticed that the Warden
had missed one of his numerous
small breaches of discipline. I
was annoyed at the carelessness
of it. Shortly later one of the in
numerable kicks the guards
dealt the "maggots" seemed in
sufficient retribution for the of
fence of not being fast enough,
and I wished he would be more
thoroughly sadistic about the
whole thing. The violence was
not systematic enough to suit
me.
Then a sudden thought : who's
side was I on, anyway? 1 want
ed yet more of that awful vio
lence from which the "maggots"
had no possibility of defending
themselves. I was being critical
of four men because they were
not vicious, sadistic or systema
tic enough—men whose purpose
was to beat the prisoners into
total submission, to de-humanize
them completely, to make them
into simple automations, and
therefore good Marines.
So I came to know that this

was not simply a play about
cruelly in Marine Corps brigs
(although several ex-Marines
later assured me that the bru
tality was, if anything, under
stated). It was rather about the
world out here, about what you
and I are doing to each other,
or condoning to be done to oth
er people, or allowing to be done
to us without complaining. It
was about Rush, for instance.
University of Automatons
Prisoner No. 5 does exactly
what he is told, and so does
student No. 1-69-12060 on Reg
Day. in class, at the Library or,
say, in the "food square" at Tre
sidder. Both he and I have sub
mitted to a de-humanizing proc
ess so complete that the product
can be guaranteed. The only
way to abort the process is to
insist on your humanity, as does
Prisoner No. 6. This insistence
is immediately defined by the
guards, the university or whom
ever as insanity, so that they
can hide the fact that someone
can break out of the system.
