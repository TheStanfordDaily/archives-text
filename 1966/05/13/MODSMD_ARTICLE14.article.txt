# Once Upon A 'Happening' They All Lived So Happily

"Demonstrations to exercise
the spirit of castrophe, that is;
the war of nerves, sex, eye and
stomach; black mail; the coer
cion of the nuclear Santa Claus;
patriotic terrorism; moral mis
ery and exploitation: physical
misery and its political exploita
tion, Modern Art on its knees
on Wall Street, etc."
You have just read a descrip
tion of a theatrical happening
from the City Light* Journal
Number One.
Like "Out," Like "Stand Out"
Last week, I was invited to
take part in a "happening" in
San Francisco. The rooms of the
house were dark except for a
ultra-violet light which made all
white clothing really stand out.
A girl with bleached hair, mil
ing around the crowd, had a
dark tan and wore a white capri
outfit. When she passed the ul
tra-violet light, she looked like
a negative.

Every member is an actor and
Ihe scene is totally improvised.
Actors are the props and props
are the actors.
It seems like a big plot, and
you expect the little men in
white coats to come and take
you away. But, then, you begin
to let yourstlf go free and you
are transformed into one of the
plotters.
Amateur Charlie Chaplins
There was a white strobe light
flickering about one hundred
and sixty beats per minute. It
made the crowd appear like a
bunch of amateur Charlie Chap
lins. The music in this case was
a rock and roll combo but that's
not "necessarily a prerequisite.
The costumes worn (not by all)
varied from the "tamborine
man" to "bat man."
It was a unique trip and if
you are ever invited to a "hap
pening" you'll know what's hap
pening.
