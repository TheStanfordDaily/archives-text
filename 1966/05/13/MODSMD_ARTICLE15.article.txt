# 'Goodwoman' Superior
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Repertory Theater's pro
duction of Bertolt Brecht's "The
Goodwoman of Setzuan" is, with
one damaging reservation, an
altogether superior one. The
repertory company seems defini
tively on the ascent in every
way, and "Goodwoman" strikes
an appropriately hopeful note
on which to end the first sea
son.
One is aware, by now, that
when one attends a Brecht play,
one gets one's ear bent—nay, al
most rent asunder—by his per
sonal brand of propaganda.
"Goodwoman" contains the least
heavy dosage of his plays with
which I am familiar, and is, in
addition, an amusing and gen
erally dramatically compelling
vehicle; the propaganda is not
very deleterious.
"Goodwoman" is a kind of
parable. Three gods (played bril
liantly, humorously, flawlessly)
by Harold Gould, William Sharp
and Jack Fisher) are searching
China—the world, actually—for
people who are good in the abso
lute and old-fashioned sense.
They find only one, Shen Te, a
prostitute who lives solely for
love of others. The play is the
chronicle of her ultimately fu
tile efforts to live for others and
herself at the same time, to
cope with the corrupt capitalis
tic system without damaging
her integrity.
Performance
Jeanne Paynter, as Shen Te
(and Shui Ta, a spurious cousin,
mercenary and clever, whose
identity Shen Te assumes but
who threatens to overcome her
personality) represents the res
ervation I spoke of above. The
part is long and difficult, and
many rapidly changing moods
need to be struck. Miss Paynter
is generally strong; as the
tough-minded Shui Ta, she never
falters, and the scene in which
she tries to deal effectively with
the forces of degeneracy — her
faithless lover, her landlady—
while seven months pregnant, is
touching and masterfully
brought off.
As the innocent and loving
Shen Te, though, Miss Paynter

is less good. The play is stylized,
not realistic, and the characters
are, in most cases, caricatures.
The caricature, however, must
never know he is a caricature,
and Miss Paynter, in the early
parts of the play, is an actress
playing stylized innocence, not
the innocence itself, as she
should be.
Gerald Hiken, as Wong, the
water seller, has a slow first
scene, too, and his address to
the audience is flat and uncon
vincing. But Hiken picks up his
pacing and ability to underplay
extremely rapidly, and by the
middle of the second scene, the
slow beginning is forgotten, and
he is sympathetic and extremely
funny throughout the rest of
the evening.
Strong As
In the other major role, Paul
E. Richards (Yang Sun, Shen
Te's fickle lover) is strong as a
bull. His corruptible idealism—
he wants to be a pilot—is intelli
gently, subtly conveyed, and his
ambitiousness is a palpable and
threatening force in every scene
in which he appears.
The astonishing thing — or,
rather, one astonishing thing in
a production whose over-all ex
cellence continually delights—is
that of all the small but im
portant roles, none is badly han
dled. The cast as a whole merits
wider discussion and acclaim
than space permits; a few of the
most noteworthy actors include
Barbara Richards (Mi Tzu, the
landlady), Glenn Cannon (the
policeman — a cross between a
Nazi officer and James Cagney),
Jane Hoffman (Yang Sun's
mother—Miss Hoffman bears
an uncanny vocal and physical
resemblance, in her make up, to
Phyllis Diller; her comic touch
is not unworthy of comparison,
either), Ruth Hunt (Mrs. Shin,
a pseudo-cripple), and Carol
Androsky (a freeloading pauper
who helps make life miserable
for Shen Te). Miss Androsky's
apparently ineradicable New
yorkese is mildly distracting,
but in a play written by a Ger
man about Chinese people pre
sented in California, why not a
New York accent?

Sam Schacht, as Shu Fu, the
fatuous sugar daddy who courts
Shen Te, is absolutely brilliant
in most of his appearances. His
performance is somewhat
marred, though, by an abrupt
and disconcerting change of tone
in his final two scenes. This,
again, shows awareness of styli
zation that should be the audi
ence's, not the actor's privilege.
Mel Shapiro's direction is
first-rate. The play is difficult
to interpret, and the comedy
must never interfere with the
few but vital serious scenes.
Shapiro is a fine comedy direc
tor, but knows when to lay off,
and the dramatic impact of the
play is considerable as a result.
The pacing is tight, the block
ing superlative.
The set is a marvel, worthy
of any professional production
in the country: imaginative,
technically complex, but han
dled without a hitch. The final
scene, featuring the assumption
of the thoroughly debased trini
ty, is hysterical, and a technical
triumph. Kudos to set designer
Richard L. Hay, who also is re
sponsible for the excellent cos
tumes.
Li ting Goo
The make-up, designed by
Barbara Hiken, is effective and
impressive, and Paul Landry's
lighting illuminates (pardon
me) without intruding upon the
action.
Another plus-factor is Conrad
Susa's original music, simple
and intriguing, played by a sort
of Chinese jazz combo who re
main on a raised platform, in
full view, throughout the pro
ceedings. The band is good,
thought the trumpet player
fluffed a few of his entrances.
"Goodwoman," then, is tech
nically as successful, in different
ways, as "Prometheus Bound,"
no small compliment, and the
visual aspects are consistently
stunning. If Miss Paynter's in
adequacies — which may have
been due to opening night jit
ters—are mended, the produc
tion will be little short of a mas
terpiece; even as is, "The Good
woman of Setzuan" should not
be missed.

"Goodwoman" is a kind of
parable. Three gods (played bril
liantly, humorously, flawlessly)
by Harold Gould, William Sharp
and Jack Fisher) are searching
China—the world, actually—for
people who are good in the abso
lute and old-fashioned sense.
They find only one, Shen Te, a
prostitute who lives solely for
love of others. The play is the
chronicle of her ultimately fu
tile efforts to live for others and
herself at the same time, to
cope with the corrupt capitalis
tic system without damaging
her integrity.
Performance
Jeanne Paynter, as Shen Te
(and Shui Ta, a spurious cousin,
mercenary and clever, whose
identity Shen Te assumes but
who threatens to overcome her
personality) represents the res
ervation I spoke of above. The
part is long and difficult, and
many rapidly changing moods
need to be struck. Miss Paynter
is generally strong; as the
tough-minded Shui Ta, she never
falters, and the scene in which
she tries to deal effectively with
the forces of degeneracy — her
faithless lover, her landlady—
while seven months pregnant, is
touching and masterfully
brought off.
As the innocent and loving
Shen Te, though, Miss Paynter

is less good. The play is stylized,
not realistic, and the characters
are, in most cases, caricatures.
The caricature, however, must
never know he is a caricature,
and Miss Paynter, in the early
parts of the play, is an actress
playing stylized innocence, not
the innocence itself, as she
should be.
Gerald Hiken, as Wong, the
water seller, has a slow first
scene, too, and his address to
the audience is flat and uncon
vincing. But Hiken picks up his
pacing and ability to underplay
extremely rapidly, and by the
middle of the second scene, the
slow beginning is forgotten, and
he is sympathetic and extremely
funny throughout the rest of
the evening.
Strong As
In the other major role, Paul
E. Richards (Yang Sun, Shen
Te's fickle lover) is strong as a
bull. His corruptible idealism—
he wants to be a pilot—is intelli
gently, subtly conveyed, and his
ambitiousness is a palpable and
threatening force in every scene
in which he appears.
The astonishing thing — or,
rather, one astonishing thing in
a production whose over-all ex
cellence continually delights—is
that of all the small but im
portant roles, none is badly han
dled. The cast as a whole merits
wider discussion and acclaim
than space permits; a few of the
most noteworthy actors include
Barbara Richards (Mi Tzu, the
landlady), Glenn Cannon (the
policeman — a cross between a
Nazi officer and James Cagney),
Jane Hoffman (Yang Sun's
mother—Miss Hoffman bears
an uncanny vocal and physical
resemblance, in her make up, to
Phyllis Diller; her comic touch
is not unworthy of comparison,
either), Ruth Hunt (Mrs. Shin,
a pseudo-cripple), and Carol
Androsky (a freeloading pauper
who helps make life miserable
for Shen Te). Miss Androsky's
apparently ineradicable New
yorkese is mildly distracting,
but in a play written by a Ger
man about Chinese people pre
sented in California, why not a
New York accent?

Sam Schacht, as Shu Fu, the
fatuous sugar daddy who courts
Shen Te, is absolutely brilliant
in most of his appearances. His
performance is somewhat
marred, though, by an abrupt
and disconcerting change of tone
in his final two scenes. This,
again, shows awareness of styli
zation that should be the audi
ence's, not the actor's privilege.
Mel Shapiro's direction is
first-rate. The play is difficult
to interpret, and the comedy
must never interfere with the
few but vital serious scenes.
Shapiro is a fine comedy direc
tor, but knows when to lay off,
and the dramatic impact of the
play is considerable as a result.
The pacing is tight, the block
ing superlative.
The set is a marvel, worthy
of any professional production
in the country: imaginative,
technically complex, but han
dled without a hitch. The final
scene, featuring the assumption
of the thoroughly debased trini
ty, is hysterical, and a technical
triumph. Kudos to set designer
Richard L. Hay, who also is re
sponsible for the excellent cos
tumes.
Li ting Goo
The make-up, designed by
Barbara Hiken, is effective and
impressive, and Paul Landry's
lighting illuminates (pardon
me) without intruding upon the
action.
Another plus-factor is Conrad
Susa's original music, simple
and intriguing, played by a sort
of Chinese jazz combo who re
main on a raised platform, in
full view, throughout the pro
ceedings. The band is good,
thought the trumpet player
fluffed a few of his entrances.
"Goodwoman," then, is tech
nically as successful, in different
ways, as "Prometheus Bound,"
no small compliment, and the
visual aspects are consistently
stunning. If Miss Paynter's in
adequacies — which may have
been due to opening night jit
ters—are mended, the produc
tion will be little short of a mas
terpiece; even as is, "The Good
woman of Setzuan" should not
be missed.
The Repertory Theater's pro
duction of Bertolt Brecht's "The
Goodwoman of Setzuan" is, with
one damaging reservation, an
altogether superior one. The
repertory company seems defini
tively on the ascent in every
way, and "Goodwoman" strikes
an appropriately hopeful note
on which to end the first sea
son.
One is aware, by now, that
when one attends a Brecht play,
one gets one's ear bent—nay, al
most rent asunder—by his per
sonal brand of propaganda.
"Goodwoman" contains the least
heavy dosage of his plays with
which I am familiar, and is, in
addition, an amusing and gen

vehicle; the propaganda is not

part is long and difficult, and
many rapidly changing moods
need to be struck. Miss Paynter
is generally strong; as the
tough-minded Shui Ta, she never
falters, and the scene in which
she tries to deal effectively with
the forces of degeneracy — her
faithless lover, her landlady—
while seven months pregnant, is
touching and masterfully
brought off.
As the innocent and loving
Shen Te, though, Miss Paynter

is less good. The play is stylized,
not realistic, and the characters
are, in most cases, caricatures.
The caricature, however, must
never know he is a caricature,
and Miss Paynter, in the early
parts of the play, is an actress
playing stylized innocence, not
the innocence itself, as she
should be.
Gerald Hiken, as Wong, the
water seller, has a slow first
scene, too, and his address to
the audience is flat and uncon
vincing. But Hiken picks up his
pacing and ability to underplay
extremely rapidly, and by the
middle of the second scene, the
slow beginning is forgotten, and
he is sympathetic and extremely
funny throughout the rest of
the evening.
Strong As
In the other major role, Paul
E. Richards (Yang Sun, Shen
Te's fickle lover) is strong as a
bull. His corruptible idealism—
he wants to be a pilot—is intelli
gently, subtly conveyed, and his
ambitiousness is a palpable and
threatening force in every scene
in which he appears.
The astonishing thing — or,
rather, one astonishing thing in
a production whose over-all ex
cellence continually delights—is
that of all the small but im
portant roles, none is badly han
dled. The cast as a whole merits
wider discussion and acclaim
than space permits; a few of the
most noteworthy actors include
Barbara Richards (Mi Tzu, the
landlady), Glenn Cannon (the
policeman — a cross between a
Nazi officer and James Cagney),
Jane Hoffman (Yang Sun's
mother—Miss Hoffman bears
an uncanny vocal and physical
resemblance, in her make up, to
Phyllis Diller; her comic touch
is not unworthy of comparison,
either), Ruth Hunt (Mrs. Shin,
a pseudo-cripple), and Carol
Androsky (a freeloading pauper
who helps make life miserable
for Shen Te). Miss Androsky's
apparently ineradicable New
yorkese is mildly distracting,
but in a play written by a Ger
man about Chinese people pre
sented in California, why not a
New York accent?

Sam Schacht, as Shu Fu, the
fatuous sugar daddy who courts
Shen Te, is absolutely brilliant
in most of his appearances. His
performance is somewhat
marred, though, by an abrupt
and disconcerting change of tone
in his final two scenes. This,
again, shows awareness of styli
zation that should be the audi
ence's, not the actor's privilege.
Mel Shapiro's direction is
first-rate. The play is difficult
to interpret, and the comedy
must never interfere with the
few but vital serious scenes.
Shapiro is a fine comedy direc
tor, but knows when to lay off,
and the dramatic impact of the
play is considerable as a result.
The pacing is tight, the block
ing superlative.
The set is a marvel, worthy
of any professional production
in the country: imaginative,
technically complex, but han
dled without a hitch. The final
scene, featuring the assumption
of the thoroughly debased trini
ty, is hysterical, and a technical
triumph. Kudos to set designer
Richard L. Hay, who also is re
sponsible for the excellent cos
tumes.
Li ting Goo
The make-up, designed by
Barbara Hiken, is effective and
impressive, and Paul Landry's
lighting illuminates (pardon
me) without intruding upon the
action.
Another plus-factor is Conrad
Susa's original music, simple
and intriguing, played by a sort
of Chinese jazz combo who re
main on a raised platform, in
full view, throughout the pro
ceedings. The band is good,
thought the trumpet player
fluffed a few of his entrances.
"Goodwoman," then, is tech
nically as successful, in different
ways, as "Prometheus Bound,"
no small compliment, and the
visual aspects are consistently
stunning. If Miss Paynter's in
adequacies — which may have
been due to opening night jit
ters—are mended, the produc
tion will be little short of a mas
terpiece; even as is, "The Good
woman of Setzuan" should not
be missed.
The Repertory Theater's pro
duction of Bertolt Brecht's "The
Goodwoman of Setzuan" is, with
one damaging reservation, an
altogether superior one. The
repertory company seems defini
tively on the ascent in every
way, and "Goodwoman" strikes
an appropriately hopeful note
on which to end the first sea
son.
One is aware, by now, that
when one attends a Brecht play,
one gets one's ear bent—nay, al
most rent asunder—by his per
sonal brand of propaganda.
"Goodwoman" contains the least
heavy dosage of his plays with
which I am familiar, and is, in
addition, an amusing and gen
erally dramatically compelling
vehicle; the propaganda is not
very deleterious.
"Goodwoman" is a kind of
parable. Three gods (played bril
liantly, humorously, flawlessly)
by Harold Gould, William Sharp
and Jack Fisher) are searching
China—the world, actually—for
people who are good in the abso
lute and old-fashioned sense.
They find only one, Shen Te, a
prostitute who lives solely for
love of others. The play is the
chronicle of her ultimately fu
tile efforts to live for others and
herself at the same time, to
cope with the corrupt capitalis
tic system without damaging
her integrity.
Performance
Jeanne Paynter, as Shen Te
(and Shui Ta, a spurious cousin,
mercenary and clever, whose
identity Shen Te assumes but
who threatens to overcome her
personality) represents the res
ervation I spoke of above. The
part is long and difficult, and
many rapidly changing moods
need to be struck. Miss Paynter
