What is it that makes Snoopy
take off on his Sopwith Camel?
What is really for sale at Lucy's
phychiatric help booth? Does
Charlie Brown realize that God
is dead? Is there hidden mean
ing in Schroeder's rejection of
Lucy in favor of Beethoven?
Could this be (1) opening day
in Psychology I? (2) A three
hour essay exam in your Con
temporary Theology course?
(3) Would you believe the 25th
Annual Spring Sing, held this
Sunday in Frost Amphitheater
at 7:30? Although all three an
swers are probably correct, full
credit is given only for number
three.
"Good Grief, It's Spring," the
theme of this year's Spring
Sing, has inspired 21 campus
living groups to ask these ques
tions and many more, based
generally on Charlie Schulz'
"Peanuts" characters. Fourteen
different numbers will be pre
sented, and Spring Sing is ac
tually a competition among the
various living groups for prizes
awarded for originality and mu
sical excellence.
Students With A Vote!
Deans Winbigler and Smith
are judges along with Assist
ant Professor Helen Schrader
from Speech and Drama. Kerry
Townsend, 1965 Pre-Reg Chair
man, and Daily Entertainment
Editor Curt Keck add a student
voice to the judging, and, thanks
to heavy pressure from LASSU,
they will have full voting rights
instead of merely acting in an
advisory capacity. Progress!
Every possible type of music
is represented in this year's
Sing, including Beethoven's sth
and 9th symphonies from Kappa
Sigma-Naranja, a classical fugue
from Granada - Eucalypto and
friends (the firehouse, boat
house, and student police), sev
eral Beatles' hits from Beta Chi-
Stillman, and a completely origi
nal score and lyrics titled "The
Ballad of LBJ" from Los Arcos.
Sixty of Roble's world-renowned
Dollies have broken hundreds of
dates to compete, appropriately
choosing a medley of nursery
rhymes.
DU & Lathrop Threats
Two groups are threatening
to retire trophies this year.
With two victories behind them
Lathrop House has entered with
"Stanford in Stalingrad," the
sad tale of a forlorn Stanford
maiden at our latest overseas
campus behind the iron curtain.
Living color slides highlight
their number. Delta Upsilon has
also won for two years in a
row. and as Spring Sing experts
might have predicted, they are
entering with a medley of popu
lar tunes titled "Teasin , and
Quitcha Foolin Around." The
DU's have not yet decided on
costumes for this year as they
are awaiting designs and , sam
ples from their Brooks Brothers
fashion consultant.

The Mendicants, though not
competing, will also perform,
along with an outstanding new
freshman group, the Guild
Singers. They are four Wilbur
ites with two lovely assistants,
all offering an exciting new ap
proach to contemporary folk
music and a polished, harmonic
sound.
Tom Parker, ex-Beta Chi, ex
thorn in the side of the creative
writing department, ex-b lack
market supplier of all madras
shirts on campus, ex-Editor of
a Jewish newspaper, and ex-im
mortal Spring Sing emcee in
1964 will handle the Master of
Ceremonies duties this year.
Tom is currently a chef at a
posh Portola golf and tennis
club, spending his weekends as
a dutiful and debateable mem

ber of the Army Reserves. He is
a dental assistant first class. He
is also very funny and should
make Spring Sing the best in
years.
Spring Sing was originated as
a Spring project by Rally Comm
in 1941, and has since been
taken over by Axe Commission,
the group that puts on the card
stunts and rallies in the Fall.
Despite an almost, overwhelm
ing amount of bad publicity in
the Palo Alto TimÂ«N, a vast year
ly deluge of censory epistles
from alumnae and "friends" in
the Palo Alto community, and
an unbelievably minute budget
awarded to Axe Comm for
Spring Sing by LASSU ($225),
Spring Sing remains the out
standing student production of
Spring Quarter.
