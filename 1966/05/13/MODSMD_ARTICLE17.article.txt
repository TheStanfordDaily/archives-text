THEATER
Tin-: GOODWOMAN OF SETZUAN, Brecht's episodic but emi
nently playable parable of good and evil in ancient China is the
final offering of the Stanford Repertory Theatre, now in Mem Aud.
(See review.)
SPRING ONE ACTS is Ram's Head's annual contribution to ori
ginal drama. This year's Nitery program, combining an early Ten
nessee Williams work with two student-written plays, seems in
keeping with their tradition of interesting (but somewhat unpol
ished) theater.
Hans Conried stars as a nonconforming scientist forced to be
have "normally" in order to get a job in Ira Wallach's comedy
ABSENCE OF A CELLO at the Geary.
Marilyn Michaels sings, acts and clowns her way through the
life of that FUNNY GIRL Fanny Brice in this musical that Barbra
Streisand made famous lor vice-versa) on Broadway several sea
sons back. Incidentally, the Civic Light Opera's second production
at the Curran ("Funny Girl" is the first) is the truly great musical
"Fiddler on the Roof"—easily the best since "My Fair Lady."
"Fiddler" will open in June; don't miss it.
MAItCEL MARCEAU, undoubtedly one of the world's few really
brilliant performers, is now at the Circle Star.
FILMS
CARRY ON NURSE, one of the many British "Carry On" come
dies, will be the Tresidder movie today.
SHOOT THE PIANO PIxAYER, Francois Truffaut's "New Wave"
comedy, will be tomorrow's Tresidder flick.
Lee Marvin is big at the Park, where hi 6 Oscar winning dual
performance in the wildly funny Western satire CAT BALLOU
can be seen along with his touching portrayal of a washed up ball
player in Stanley Kramer's SHIP OF FOOLS.
A THOUSAND CLOWNS is the marvelously warm, funny and
tender film of Herb Gardner's hit Broadway play. At the Bijou, it
has Jason Robards and Barry Gordon in their original Broadway
roles, with the added attraction of film newcomer Barbara Harris.
Also on the bill is the joyous Melina Mercouri proving that prosti
tution can be fun but NEVER ON SUNDAY.
DARLING stars Julie Christie in her Oscar winning role as a
girl who goes to bed for fun and profit. Her brilliant performance
raises what might be just a good film to a really fine one. Sharing
the bill (but not the bed) with Julie at the Stanford are Sophia
Loren and Marcello Mastroianni in MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE.
Peter Sellers as Inspector Closeau is having a revival at the
Vansity, where THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK
both feature this enormously talented actor as an incredibly inept
detective. "Panther" is the better movie, but "Shot" has Elke
Sommer in a nudist camp, and that ought to be worth something.
OTHER
SPRING SING is Sunday night in Frost Amphitheatre. "Pea
nuts" is the theme this year, and since it's un-American not to like
"Peanuts," one risks being called subversive if he doesn't go.
THIS NIGHT FOR SONG is the title for Saturday's Glee Club
concert at Dink.
