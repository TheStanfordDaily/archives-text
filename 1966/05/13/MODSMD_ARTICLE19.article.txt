vigil at United Technology Cen

today enters its second week.
By ERIC PROKOSCH
Protesters at the Redwood
City napalm plant entered
their second week of vigil in the
midst of grim security guards
and a curious, if wary, public.
Meanwhile the normal produc
tion of the napalm bombs went
on inside as usual.
Most of the workers at the
plant have been uncomunieative;
and the security guards, of
course, are incorruptible. Per
haps the most important effect
of the first week's vigil has been
to maintain public interest in
the campaign against napalm.
On Tuesday a driver education
car from a Redwood City high
school passed, and the protest
ers handed out leaflets.
A man stopped across from
the plant on Wednesday and
took pictures. He used a camera
concealed under a folded news
paper and refused to talk to the
protesters. Many people have

paused to ask questions, or
merely have driven around the
site, and back toward the center
of town.
A person driving on Harbor
Boulevard, which is right off the
Bayshore Freeway, can see both
the vigil and the actual produc
tion of napalm bombs. The com
plete process! Mixture of the in
gredients, filling of the bomb
shells, removal of the bombs,
and the barges on which they
are shipped out is visible. The
plant is separated from the road
only by a wire fence; all the
operations are performed out
doors.
Community Feelings Strong
For the past month the na
palm controversy has aroused
strong feelings in Redwood City.
Letters which have appeared on
the editorial pages of the Red
wood City Tribune reveal a
broad diversity of views. A lady
from Menlo Park wrote that
"little Susie down the street"
would react to a napalm attack
in the same way as a Vietnam
ese: "great patches of skin and
flesh would peel off and her
screams would tear our hearts."
One writer deplored "napalm's
vicious, indiscriminate use in
Vietnam"; another applauded
napalm as "a legitimate and de
structive weapon of war, hor
ribly effective and quite suitable
for fighting communism and its
dedicated agents."
On the democratic issues
raised by the anti-napalm cam
paign one man wrote that the
referendum far from being a
"radical innovation" has long
been considered a California ver -
sion of the New England town
meeting; while another writer
suggested that "the defense and
security of our country are prop
erly left in the hands of our
elected officials."
On the motives and tactics of
the Redwood City Committee
Against Napalm, one man com
pared their action to a betrayal
by Judas, and condemned the
protesters' "anti-American tech

nique" of displaying a photo
graph of a child suffering from
burns "purportedly the result of
an American napalm bomb." An
other gentleman tartly observed,
"I see the 'Do Gooders' are still
panicked by the napalm issue in
Redwood City and are making
enough noises to cloud the irre
versible facts to the 'herd' that
will eventually follow them in
their self-motivated interests."
Commenting on the petition
for referendum which was filed
with the City Clerk on April 20,
the writer concluded: "I could
get more signatures for the
abolition of income tax and it
would make about as much
sense."
National Interest, Shown
Since N.B.C. television covered
the Redwood City napalm con
troversy on April 19, people
from different parts of the coun
try have written to the Redwood
City Tribune to express their op
inions. A letter from an Army
ex-officer in Tennessee, publish
ed last Tuesday, gives the view
of a person on the scene: "If
those of you who are opposed to
the production of napalm could
spend a week in the jungles of
Vietnam, I am sure that you
would change your mind. The
first time you were hit by a Viet
Cong ambush you would prob
ably pray for a jet to fly over
your position and drop napalm
on the men who are trying to
kill you."
Meanwhile, at the site, things
were going along as usual yes
terday. United Technology Cen
ter has not released its produc
tion figures, but members of the
Redwood City Committee
Against Napalm estimate that
between 4,000 and 4,500 bombs
have been produced up to now.
Another 6,000 empty bomb shells
are stacked in crates nearby
waiting to be filled. The crates
are marked "Do Not Drop." but,
as one protester remarked, these
words are presumably erased be
fore the bombs reach their des
tination.
