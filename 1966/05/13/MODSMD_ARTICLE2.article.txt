### STEVE GRUBER 
Patrick Morrison's hair was dis
cussed by two groups last night with
out a significant change in the policy
of the Department of Athletics.
The President's Advisory Commit
tee of Athletics, chaired by Dr. John
Hurlburt, a law professor, stated, "It
(continues to bo the responsibility
of the Department of Athletics to
formulate and apply these standards."
The Captains' Table, composed of
the captains of the athletic teams, met
after the President's Committee. No
decision was reached at this meet
ing, although the general feeling was
that each team should set its own
standards in the area of personal ap
pearance.
The President's Committee, in a
statement issued through the Uni
versity News Service, stated, "The
President's Committee was asked to
consider the problem suggested by
the Pat Morrison case concerning
standards governing the personal
appearance of Stanford athletes.
"The Committee is of the view that
it is highly desirable that there be
participation of Stanford athletes in
the formulation of the standards of
personal appearance for Stanford ath
letes, and the Committee recommends
that the department establish pro
cedures to provide for that partici
pation."
Chuck Taylor, Director of the De
partment of Athletics, told The Daily
last night, "I found the decision of
the Committee rewarding. There is
really no issue of Patrick Morrison's
hair because the freshman track sea
son is over. We are attempting to
determine a policy for the future."
According to Dave Duebner, captain
of the cross country team, "The only
conclusive result of the Captains'
Table meeting last night was that
most athletes agreed it would be im
practical to alienate those who do
nated to the athletic program."
Mike Hughes, who is acting as a
go-between the Athletic Department
and Morrison, told The Daily "When
this policy was referred to the Presi
dent's Committee, Morrison hoped
that any forthcoming recommenda
tions would correct the inconsistency
between the Department's policy and
the basic principle of a free, academic
community."
