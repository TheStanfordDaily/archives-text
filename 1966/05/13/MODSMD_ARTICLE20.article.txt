# Psychiatrist Pickets Firm
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon a broker
age firm on Santa Cruz Avenue,
Menlo Park, was picketed by a
Palo Alto psychiatrist in a dem
onstration against the United
Aircraft Corporation, whose sub
sidiary, United Technology Cen
ter, is making napalm in Red
wood City.
Dr. Oliver Henderson, a hand
some, bearded man in his early
50's, stood out on the sidewalk
with an oil painting showing
the words "STOP NAPALM"
against a background of smoke
and charred buildings.
Two high school girls stopped
to ask what he was doing. One
said: "I don't believe in pro
tests." The other said: "I do. I'd
like to protest the assistant prin
cipal." The conversation then
shifted to the case of Pat Mor
rison and the broader issues of
individuality and self-expression.
An employee of the firm came
out to mail a letter and mut
tered to Dr. Henderson, "Why
don't you go somewhere else?"
The girls turned on him. "He
has a right to his opinion," one
of them said.
Dr. Henderson told The DaiJy
he is satisfied with his picket
ing, and intends to continue as
long as it has an effect.
