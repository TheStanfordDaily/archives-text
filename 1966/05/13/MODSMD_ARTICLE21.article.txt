Future U.S. relations with
Communist China hinge critic
ally on our ability to distinguish
between the Peking government's
real view of its«lf and the image
it wishes the rest of the world to
see, according \o Professor Den
nis Dooiin, history, who took
part in a panel discussion to be
broadcast over station KXKX
FM tonight.
"If the Chinese Communists
were to act on the basis of the
images they project," said
Dooiin, "then we would be in
for a very scary period. Dooiin
is research curator of the East

Asian Collection at the Hoover
Institution.
Others taking part in the dis
cussion were Dr. Yuan-li Wu,
professor of international busi
ness at the University of San

After Wu pointed out that the
growth of China's mainland has
been significant but slow, Dooiin
put forward his own theory that
Communist China has not yet
reached the stage where "the
militancy of its political catech
ism can be diluted by rising af
fluence." Nor have recent ex
ternal events contributed to re
ducing the Peking government's
seemingly paranoiac belliger
ence.
"The African coups, the In
donesian reversal and the pres
ent 'no-win' situation for Com
munist China in Vietnam all can
be called staggering setbacks
for the Chinese model of
'people's war,' " said Dooiin.
