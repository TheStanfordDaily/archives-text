# Heffner Suggests Teaching Method

"In a democratic society, the
public must learn enough about
science to guide the course of
technological change," Profes
sor Hubert Heffner said yester
day at the dedication of the new
School of Technology at South
ern Illinois University.
Heffner, associate provost for
research and an electrical engi
neer at Stanford, discussed
methods of teaching science and
engineering. He suggested that
universities employ research
facilities to study the social con
sequences of both real and pre
dictable technological changes.
In the text of his address, he
described the Stanford program
in which physicists teach an un
dergraduate course on the de
velopment, use, and control of
the atomic bomb. Through this
study students become aware of
the complexities involved in pol
icy-making, he commented.
"Science-for-science courses
often serve more to befuddle or
bore the student," he continued.
Heffner advocated teaching
methods which would train sci
ence students to capitalize on
their curiosity and their think
ing ability.
"As a country, wc have not
been noted for our foresight and
preparation to avoid the ill ef
fects of technological innova
tions," he said.
