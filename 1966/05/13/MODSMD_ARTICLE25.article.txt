back spot. He spent half his
sophomore season at this spot.
With Lewis at half Ralston will

holds in the annual series. Jack
Chappie, and Paul Wiggin will
provide a professional touch to

Coach John Ralston until his
forces return next fall. The fact

and Stanford's initial contest
with San Jose underscores the
importance of tomorrow's tilt.
In last Saturday's Red-White
game in which the entire varsity
squad performed under game

two scoring passes and led the
White team to a 14-6 victory.
Washington will be starting at
offensive quarterback and will
lead the backfield composed of
halfback Dave Lewis, fullback
Tim Abena, and flanker Bob
Blunt.
Lewis although playing all of
last season at quarterback is not
