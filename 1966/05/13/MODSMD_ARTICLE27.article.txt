# 'BIG ROW' MEET
## Crewmen To Battle Bears 
### DAN CABRERA 
It's Cal this Sunday in Red
wood City Harbor. Wearing the
laurels of their win last week
end over UCLA and USC, the
Stanford crew meets UC Berke
ley in the annual Big Row re
gatta.
The race should be a close
one, although Cal lost to UCLA,
because tough Washington has
handled both teams by about
the same margin.
To date, the Stanford crews
have beaten Santa Clara, UCLA,
USC, Oregon State, Long Beach
State, UC Irvine, Orange Coast
College, and UC Santa Barbara.
Stanford's varsity boat lost one
of its fine oarsmen, Tim Cowles,
Tuesday when he injured his
hand while addressing corres
pondence for the Crew Associa
tion. Replacing Tim in the No. 3

position will be Buck Westfall
from the JV boat, a sophomore.
Without Cowles, the Varsity
boat still contains five men from
last year's first boat, while the
JV shell claims three returning
varsity oarsmen on the star
board side.
Although capturing the Har
bach Cup with a clean sweep of
USC and UCLA last week was
definitely a big win for the In
dian crew, meeting Cal each
year in the Big Row and being

years straight has singled Cal
out as the team to beat.

9:05 AM —Second Frosh
9:20 AM—Jr. Varsity
9:45 AM—Frosh
10:00 AM—Varsity race (Big
Row)
The meet will be held in Red
wood City Harbor, ten minutes
north of Stanford on the Bay
shore Freeway. Exiting on Har
bor Blvd., spectators may sim
ply follow the large signs to the
municipal marina, the fini6h
area of the races.
It's Cal this Sunday in Red
wood City Harbor. Wearing the
laurels of their win last week
end over UCLA and USC, the
Stanford crew meets UC Berke
ley in the annual Big Row re
gatta.
The race should be a close
one, although Cal lost to UCLA,
because tough Washington has
handled both teams by about
the same margin.
To date, the Stanford crews
have beaten Santa Clara, UCLA,
USC, Oregon State, Long Beach
State, UC Irvine, Orange Coast
College, and UC Santa Barbara.
Stanford's varsity boat lost one
of its fine oarsmen, Tim Cowles,
Tuesday when he injured his
hand while addressing corres
pondence for the Crew Associa
tion. Replacing Tim in the No. 3

position will be Buck Westfall
from the JV boat, a sophomore.
Without Cowles, the Varsity
boat still contains five men from
last year's first boat, while the
JV shell claims three returning
varsity oarsmen on the star
board side.
Although capturing the Har
bach Cup with a clean sweep of
USC and UCLA last week was
definitely a big win for the In
dian crew, meeting Cal each
year in the Big Row and being
defeated for the past eight
years straight has singled Cal
out as the team to beat.
