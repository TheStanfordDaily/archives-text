# Frosh End Season Without Morrison
## 
### 
The frosh track team con
cluded its season with a decisive
90-51 victory over Santa Ana
JC yesterday afternoon at Stan
ford Stadium. Santa Ana's
squad, victors over the USC
frosh and UCLA frosh this sea
son, was not at full strength,
hut then, of course, neither was
the Card frosh squqad.
Bob Bacon's surprising vic
tory in the 220 was the high
light of the meet. Santa Ana's
Preston won the 100 in the rela
tively slow time of 10 flat.

Peter Boyce high jumped 6'B"
to win, narrowly missing at
&IIV4". Mike Donley ran 1:55.1
for a comfortable margin in the
880, while A 1 Sanford led a
sweep in the mile. In that race
Bob Beukers and Brook Thomas
had best times of 4:22.4 in a sec
ond place tie.
The frosh victory raised their
season mark to 9-1. This record
gives the squad a just claim to
the top ranking among frosh
and JC squads in the entire
country.
