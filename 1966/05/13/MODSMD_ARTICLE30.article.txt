# Card Nine To End Season Against Cal Poly, Pomona
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team
which has shown that it can
beat the best and which is prob
ably one of the best on paper in
recent years will end a disap
pointing season this weekend
with two non - league games
against Cal Poly, Pomona.
The Tribe has beaten UCLA
four out of four and split two
two with Cal and USC to show

that they can beat the first divi
sion. However, fifth place Santa
Clara and cellar dweller Santa
Barbara have bounced the In
dians. Santa Clara won four out
of four and UCSB took one out
of four.
Both games will be played in
Sunken Diamond. They are
scheduled for 3:00 p.m. Friday
and 10:00 a.m. Saturday. The
reason for the Saturday morn
ing game is to avoid a conflict
with the varsity-alumni football
game which is slated for the af
ternoon.
Three Musketeers
The big three of Steve Hovley,
Frank Duffy, and Jim Hibbs
have been leading Stanford in
terrorizing opposing pitchers of
late. Centerfielder Hovley is hit
ting the ball at a .358 clip. Short
stop Duffy, the number four
hitter in the league (Hovley is
Catcher Hibbs is batting .324,
Catcher Hibbs is batting .324
good for seventh among league
batters.
The whole team has been hit
ting the long ball lately, espe
cially Hibbs. He leads the league
in home runs and has been hit
ting doubles with utter abandon.
Hibbs is a senior. Hovley and
Duffy will be back next season.
Last Game
Also finishing out his career
will be first baseman Pete Mid
dlekauff, easily the finest field
ing first baseman on the west
coast and probably in the na
tion. Although he had some bad
luck this year, last season he hit
over .400 for most of the year
and finished at .389.
Pitchers John Mason and Ter
ry Docken who will throw this
weekend are also graduating.
