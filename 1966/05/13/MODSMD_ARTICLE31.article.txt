# Stanford Track Stars Enter Weekend Relays
## 
### 
A twenty-nine man Stanford
track force invades Fresno to
morrow for the West Coast Re
lays, site of the Indians' 440
relay record last year, in final
preparation for next week's
AAWU championships.
Seven of the same men will
be competing in tonight's Coli
seum Relays in Los Angeles.
Larry Questad, whose brilliant
anchor leg a year ago climaxed
an unexpected Stanford win in
world-record time of 39.7, re
turns to anchor a foursome
which may be capable of a sim
ilar effort, although it has yet
to run up to its potential.
Strong- Field
Roger Cox, Donrt Forbes, Jim
Ward and Questad, who have
clocked 40.5 this year, will face
stiff opposition from the likes
of UCLA, New Mexico and San
Jose State in Los Angeles to
night and Fresno tomorrow. The
same four will stretch out for
the 880 relay.
Questad and Forbes will have
some familiar competition in the
Open 100 tomorrow from UC
LA's Norm Jackson and USC's
Dwight Middleton, along with
USC freshman Lennox Miller
who has beaten all four.
Jim EsheLman, Stanford's
only 16-foot vaulter, will get an

other shot at UCLA's Marc Sav
age in both meets. Savage set
an NCAA record of 16-9 to top
Eshelman's in last
month's dual meet; but both will
have to struggle to place in a
field that includes four 17-foot
ers, led by the world's best, John
Pennel.
Discus Duel
Also looking for revenge will
be Bob Stoecker, whose long
time discus foe Gary Carlsen of
USC is entered in both meets
along with A 1 Pemberton of
Washington and former Stan
ford great Dave Weill.
Craig Vaughan, the confer
ence's leading long jumper, will
face a strong field in Los An
geles tonight and be joined by
Bud Walsh for tomorrow's com
petition.
Walsh, whose 14.3 in the high
hurdles last week was his life
time best, will compete in both
the highs and the 440 intermedi
ates tomorrow, in addit ion to the
long jump.
Frosh high jumper Peter
Boyce, Stanford's best ever, will
take another shot at the seven
foot barrier tomorrow. The
Fresno runway is usually con
ducive to good jumps, and there
will be plenty of competition
with several seven-footers in the
field.
Other Stanford freshmen com
peting tomorrow are hurdler
Tom Kommers, who will join
Walsh and John Williamson in
the 120 highs, and distance man
Allen Sanford, who will move
up to the 5000 meters along with
Jim Letterer.

Roger Cox, Donrt Forbes, Jim
Ward and Questad, who have
clocked 40.5 this year, will face
stiff opposition from the likes
of UCLA, New Mexico and San
Jose State in Los Angeles to
night and Fresno tomorrow. The
same four will stretch out for
the 880 relay.
Questad and Forbes will have
some familiar competition in the
Open 100 tomorrow from UC
LA's Norm Jackson and USC's
Dwight Middleton, along with
USC freshman Lennox Miller
who has beaten all four.
Jim EsheLman, Stanford's
only 16-foot vaulter, will get an

other shot at UCLA's Marc Sav
age in both meets. Savage set
an NCAA record of 16-9 to top
Eshelman's in last
month's dual meet; but both will
have to struggle to place in a
field that includes four 17-foot
ers, led by the world's best, John
Pennel.
Discus Duel
Also looking for revenge will
be Bob Stoecker, whose long
time discus foe Gary Carlsen of
USC is entered in both meets
along with A 1 Pemberton of
Washington and former Stan
ford great Dave Weill.
Craig Vaughan, the confer
ence's leading long jumper, will
face a strong field in Los An
geles tonight and be joined by
Bud Walsh for tomorrow's com
petition.
Walsh, whose 14.3 in the high
hurdles last week was his life
time best, will compete in both
the highs and the 440 intermedi
ates tomorrow, in addit ion to the
long jump.
Frosh high jumper Peter
Boyce, Stanford's best ever, will
take another shot at the seven
foot barrier tomorrow. The
Fresno runway is usually con
ducive to good jumps, and there
will be plenty of competition
with several seven-footers in the
field.
Other Stanford freshmen com
peting tomorrow are hurdler
Tom Kommers, who will join
Walsh and John Williamson in
the 120 highs, and distance man
Allen Sanford, who will move
up to the 5000 meters along with
Jim Letterer.
A twenty-nine man Stanford
track force invades Fresno to
morrow for the West Coast Re
lays, site of the Indians' 440
relay record last year, in final
preparation for next week's
AAWU championships.
Seven of the same men will
be competing in tonight's Coli
seum Relays in Los Angeles.
Larry Questad, whose brilliant
anchor leg a year ago climaxed
an unexpected Stanford win in
world-record time of 39.7, re
turns to anchor a foursome
which may be capable of a sim
ilar effort, although it has yet
to run up to its potential.
