# History's New Image
## 
### 
The History Department, in adopting new
course requirements for its majors, acted with
a certain image of the Stanford undergraduate
in mind. The image reflected in the new require
ments is that of a student more autonomous and,
at the same time, more responsible.
The Department has established ten units of
independent reading in comparative history for
all its undergraduates. These units will entail no
scheduled lectures, no reading lists and no per
iodic check-ups. Rather, there will be one final,
comprehensive, four-hour examination, and stu
dents will be expected to prepare for it largely
on their own. The liistorians have torn down a
few fences and left the student to find the green
grass by himself.

In theory, at least, the new program will give
students an opportunity to roam intellectually
and to pursue in depth a topic of particular in
terest.
True, its success depends on a high degree of
personal responsibility â€”every history major will
have to be an honors student. But potentially
each Stanford student is such a scholar. And to
treat him otherwise is to short-change him.
Furthermore, high expectations themselves
may inspire Stanford students to live up to the
projected image, making the image a reality.
We applaud the History Department for its
step toward excellence because we, too, realize
the Stanford undergraduate today is not the
same as yesterday.
