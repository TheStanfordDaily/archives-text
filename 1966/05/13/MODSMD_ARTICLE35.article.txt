# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## Convention And Rationality 
### MICHAEL ANDERSON 
Editor's note: This Ls the seventh in a
leisurely series of articles on education at
Stanford.)

They say that Stanford is a very extraor
dinary place.
They say Stanford is a leader among
American universities, pioneering the over
seas campus idea, experimenting in curricu
lum reforms and interdepartmental pro
grams of study, liberalizing social regula
tions, participating in volunteer work in
Mississippi and Hong Kong, and expressing
dissatisfaction with the present order of
things by electing a restless advocate of
educational reform to the ASSU Presi
dency.
But for he who cares to examine the
place a bit more closely, it is obvious that
Stanford is not really so extraordinary af
ter all. It has succumbed to a paralyzing
disease, conventionalism. That disease is
present here in epidemic proportions. It
has infected department after department
Sleeping Sickness
Conventionalism, besides producing pa
ralysis and blindness, is first and foremost
a sort of sleeping sickness. The inflicted
lose consciousness and become immersed
in a dream world—but, strangely enough,
without even a slight awareness of being
asleep.
They assert, indeed, time and time again,
that they are perfectly healthy and wide
awake (far more awake, in fact, than their
companions dozing about them).
(You and I, Reader, may thank God that
we have not yet fallen prey to this dreadful
malady!)
What makes conventionalism so danger
ous? And is it really so übiquitous?
Social Awakening
All of us at Stanford, in our education
and experience, have come to recognize
"convention."
On the one hand, whenever we have
come into contact with societies different
from our own, we have become aware of
some of the conventions of that foreign
culture and also of the blindness, tenacity,
and even desperateness with which those
conventions are held.
On the other hand, we have also come
to perceive our own participation in con
vention. As we become more and more edu
cated, we begin to gain a perspective with
regard to our own cultural installation.
We can come to recognize that we our
selves are (or were) as typical of our cul
ture as are those foreigners of theirs. And
through this recognition of our own typi
cality we may attempt to loosen those
chains of convention and affirm our own
individuality.
Ingrained Prejudice
This suffices, I think, as a start for com
ing to see the character of the problem of
convention at Stanford.
Yet we will be able to understand that
problem—and likewise the relationship be
tween convention and education—only by
means of a much more radical—or one
might say unconventional—approach to the
idea.
In the first place, anyone who has busied
himself in any depth at all with the study
of a foreign culture—through disciplines
such as cultural history, comparative lit
erature, language study, anthropology, and
the like—has surely come to recognize how
deeply convention can reach into one's
thought structure, to what extent it can
control everything one thinks and does.
Provincialism
A local religion, for instance, often
blinds a member of a provincial society
from seeing beyond the narrow limits of his
cultural prejudices into the possibility of
a truer way of understanding reality. All
his judgments are determined beforehand
by the thought structure in which he takes

part. He is scarcely an individual, for con
vention dictates the way in which he turns
to the world about him.
But "local religion" was merely an ap
proach toward the concern of this article,
namely, education and convention at Stan
ford. So let us try for a moment to turn
toward ourselves.
Yes, But Not Me!
Can it be that somehow we have been
strong enough to avoid surrendering our
individuality to convention, in the radical
way in which it molds and controls one's
thought structure, while those foreigners
were obviously too weak? Or are we too
children of our culture, determined, in a
radical sense, by manifold cultural preju
dices —and often scarcely aware at all of
that fact?
I want to point here to a sort of conven
tionalism which extends far more deeply
into one's personality than most people
suppose.
I want to initiate a deeper critical atti
tude in the intellectual and social atmos
phere at Stanford. It cannot be achieved
by participating in a revolutionary social
movement, by attempting to reform or
overthrow the status quo, by rejecting so
cial norms in dress, hair styles, sexual
activities, religious and ethical stances, etc.,
or even through alienation (including in
tellectual alienation) from the Stanford
community.
I want to draw our attention to a sort
of conventionalism which lies at the very
roots of our thought—and hence of our ac
tion.
Education And Convention
What then can we say about education
as it has to do with this radical notion of
convention?
We are reminded of that inscription in
the ancient Greek temple which is dedi
cated to the god Eidos, "The first step in
education is grasping one's self as a type."
To grasp one's self as a type is to recog
nize one's own cultural installation — and
radically so. This recognition, which is in
fact not a single event but an ever recur
ring achievement for the true intellectual,
constitutes an emergence from one's typi
cality, a liberation from convention.
The means by which such a liberation is
realized can best be characterized as criti
cal thought. Since "criticism" will be the
topic of a later artie'e in this series, suffice
it to say that critical thought is that which
exposes convention as prejudice and which
surpasses convention by discovering those
understandings of reality which lie beyond
convention.
Convention V». Tradition
The employ of critical thought leads to
the discovery of tradition.
Tradition differs from convention in one
very important respect. Convention gives
itself dogmatically and as a matter of
course. It is never really questioned but
always assumed as naturally evident.
But tradition can be given only through
criticism (in the positive sense): it must
be discovered. Tradition is the fruit of the
emergence from convention by the great
men and even societies of the past, a fruit
which makes up a great heritage.
Tradition is discovered through critical
thought. By entering into sincere dialogue
with the great men of the past, which
standings— and prejudices — to be con
fronted by theirs, we succeed in deepening
our own self-consciousness and liberating
ourselves from our bondage to concention.
Tradition And Critical Thought
What then are the implications of criti
cal thought to education?
First, critical thought is the only means
for distinguishing between convention and
tradition. In fact, it is the only means for

even recognizing either convention or tra
dition as such.
Second, critical thought enables one to
engage on the one hand in the criticism of
current values and on the other hand in
the conservation of those values of the past
which are worthy of our honor.
One graphic example of what one might
learn through such a radical conservatism
which turns to the ancients in criticism of
current values comes readily to mind from
a study of Greek culture. Love, one notes,
is the ground and impetus of both educa
tion and philosophy for Plato; but where
does one find any trace of love at all in ei
ther education or philosophy at. Stanford.
Radical Reorientation Needed
The breakthrough from convenience to
critical thought is the breakthrough from
convention to tradition. It is a break
through because it entails a radical reorien
tation of thought structure — yours and
mine. The possibility arises for convention
to be investigated and tradition discovered.
Lest this doctrine of radical conserva
tism be abhorrent to the more liberal
Daily readers, it is well to note that it is
not an uncommon one in Western history.
Kierkegaard, for example, once warned
against "surpassing the ancients by not
getting as far."
16 that not indeed a warning to every
serious student? Are we not being blind
and presumptuous when we assume that
we have nothing to learn from the an
cients?!
Need For Leadership
In earlier articles of this series a con
vention has been described which is impor
tant enough to bear further comment. That
convention is the notion of the nature of
The University which is prevalent through
out the country and especially at Stanford.
The role of the university as servant of
society rather than leader is a convention
to which many, more or less vocally, ascribe.
Likewise the view of the university as a
technical training ground is a convention,
as is the attempt to measure Stanford's
"greatness" according to the standards of a
"result-conscious" society.
These conventions would not be so dan
gerous were they held only by the admin
istrators and bureaucrats—but their preva
lence among the faculty and students (the
so-called academicians) is a matter for
greater concern.
Goal of Education
How may Stanford overcome this burden
of convention? If Stanford University is
truly to become an educational community
(a goal, incidently, not a fact), then the
problem of convention, critical thought,
and tradition must come to be realized con
cretely.
Only by rediscovering the ancients will
it be possible to rediscover the true aca
demic spirit of criticality and openness and
freedom which has been cherished in the
past—but which is entirely lacking in the
present.
(Except, of course, Reader, in you and
me!)
Authentic Education
The problem of convention, critical
thought, and tradition strikes closely to
home. For Kierkegaard's admonition is di
rected toward every scholar. All who are
enmired in convention are in the danger of
"surpassing the ancients by not getting as
far!"
Authentic education has two important
parts. On the one hand education 'involves
the liberation from convention, that is, a
radical recognition of the convention it
self, of one's own typicality. On the other
hand it involves the discovery of a deeper
reality, which had been concealed by the
veil of conventional prejudice but which is
revealed through the insights of tradition.
Thp true student must face these de
mands of authentic education over and
over.

ture as are those foreigners of theirs. And
through this recognition of our own typi
cality we may attempt to loosen those
chains of convention and affirm our own
individuality.
Ingrained Prejudice
This suffices, I think, as a start for com
ing to see the character of the problem of
convention at Stanford.
Yet we will be able to understand that
problem—and likewise the relationship be
tween convention and education—only by
means of a much more radical—or one
might say unconventional—approach to the
idea.
In the first place, anyone who has busied
himself in any depth at all with the study
of a foreign culture—through disciplines
such as cultural history, comparative lit
erature, language study, anthropology, and
the like—has surely come to recognize how
deeply convention can reach into one's
thought structure, to what extent it can
control everything one thinks and does.
Provincialism
A local religion, for instance, often
blinds a member of a provincial society
from seeing beyond the narrow limits of his
cultural prejudices into the possibility of
a truer way of understanding reality. All
his judgments are determined beforehand
by the thought structure in which he takes

part. He is scarcely an individual, for con
vention dictates the way in which he turns
to the world about him.
But "local religion" was merely an ap
proach toward the concern of this article,
namely, education and convention at Stan
ford. So let us try for a moment to turn
toward ourselves.
Yes, But Not Me!
Can it be that somehow we have been
strong enough to avoid surrendering our
individuality to convention, in the radical
way in which it molds and controls one's
thought structure, while those foreigners
were obviously too weak? Or are we too
children of our culture, determined, in a
radical sense, by manifold cultural preju
dices —and often scarcely aware at all of
that fact?
I want to point here to a sort of conven
tionalism which extends far more deeply
into one's personality than most people
suppose.
I want to initiate a deeper critical atti
tude in the intellectual and social atmos
phere at Stanford. It cannot be achieved
by participating in a revolutionary social
movement, by attempting to reform or
overthrow the status quo, by rejecting so
cial norms in dress, hair styles, sexual
activities, religious and ethical stances, etc.,
or even through alienation (including in
tellectual alienation) from the Stanford
community.
I want to draw our attention to a sort
of conventionalism which lies at the very
roots of our thought—and hence of our ac
tion.
Education And Convention
What then can we say about education
as it has to do with this radical notion of
convention?
We are reminded of that inscription in
the ancient Greek temple which is dedi
cated to the god Eidos, "The first step in
education is grasping one's self as a type."
To grasp one's self as a type is to recog
nize one's own cultural installation — and
radically so. This recognition, which is in
fact not a single event but an ever recur
ring achievement for the true intellectual,
constitutes an emergence from one's typi
cality, a liberation from convention.
The means by which such a liberation is
realized can best be characterized as criti
cal thought. Since "criticism" will be the
topic of a later artie'e in this series, suffice
it to say that critical thought is that which
exposes convention as prejudice and which
surpasses convention by discovering those
understandings of reality which lie beyond
convention.
Convention V». Tradition
The employ of critical thought leads to
the discovery of tradition.
Tradition differs from convention in one
very important respect. Convention gives
itself dogmatically and as a matter of
course. It is never really questioned but
always assumed as naturally evident.
But tradition can be given only through
criticism (in the positive sense): it must
be discovered. Tradition is the fruit of the
emergence from convention by the great
men and even societies of the past, a fruit
which makes up a great heritage.
Tradition is discovered through critical
thought. By entering into sincere dialogue
with the great men of the past, which
standings— and prejudices — to be con
fronted by theirs, we succeed in deepening
our own self-consciousness and liberating
ourselves from our bondage to concention.
Tradition And Critical Thought
What then are the implications of criti
cal thought to education?
First, critical thought is the only means
for distinguishing between convention and
tradition. In fact, it is the only means for

even recognizing either convention or tra
dition as such.
Second, critical thought enables one to
engage on the one hand in the criticism of
current values and on the other hand in
the conservation of those values of the past
which are worthy of our honor.
One graphic example of what one might
learn through such a radical conservatism
which turns to the ancients in criticism of
current values comes readily to mind from
a study of Greek culture. Love, one notes,
is the ground and impetus of both educa
tion and philosophy for Plato; but where
does one find any trace of love at all in ei
ther education or philosophy at. Stanford.
Radical Reorientation Needed
The breakthrough from convenience to
critical thought is the breakthrough from
convention to tradition. It is a break
through because it entails a radical reorien
tation of thought structure — yours and
mine. The possibility arises for convention
to be investigated and tradition discovered.
Lest this doctrine of radical conserva
tism be abhorrent to the more liberal
Daily readers, it is well to note that it is
not an uncommon one in Western history.
Kierkegaard, for example, once warned
against "surpassing the ancients by not
getting as far."
16 that not indeed a warning to every
serious student? Are we not being blind
and presumptuous when we assume that
we have nothing to learn from the an
cients?!
Need For Leadership
In earlier articles of this series a con
vention has been described which is impor
tant enough to bear further comment. That
convention is the notion of the nature of
The University which is prevalent through
out the country and especially at Stanford.
The role of the university as servant of
society rather than leader is a convention
to which many, more or less vocally, ascribe.
Likewise the view of the university as a
technical training ground is a convention,
as is the attempt to measure Stanford's
"greatness" according to the standards of a
"result-conscious" society.
These conventions would not be so dan
gerous were they held only by the admin
istrators and bureaucrats—but their preva
lence among the faculty and students (the
so-called academicians) is a matter for
greater concern.
Goal of Education
How may Stanford overcome this burden
of convention? If Stanford University is
truly to become an educational community
(a goal, incidently, not a fact), then the
problem of convention, critical thought,
and tradition must come to be realized con
cretely.
Only by rediscovering the ancients will
it be possible to rediscover the true aca
demic spirit of criticality and openness and
freedom which has been cherished in the
past—but which is entirely lacking in the
present.
(Except, of course, Reader, in you and
me!)
Authentic Education
The problem of convention, critical
thought, and tradition strikes closely to
home. For Kierkegaard's admonition is di
rected toward every scholar. All who are
enmired in convention are in the danger of
"surpassing the ancients by not getting as
far!"
Authentic education has two important
parts. On the one hand education 'involves
the liberation from convention, that is, a
radical recognition of the convention it
self, of one's own typicality. On the other
hand it involves the discovery of a deeper
reality, which had been concealed by the
veil of conventional prejudice but which is
revealed through the insights of tradition.
Thp true student must face these de
mands of authentic education over and
over.

in a dream world—but, strangely enough,

malady!)
What makes conventionalism so danger
ous? And is it really so übiquitous?
Social Awakening
All of us at Stanford, in our education
and experience, have come to recognize
"convention."
On the one hand, whenever we have
come into contact with societies different
from our own, we have become aware of
some of the conventions of that foreign
culture and also of the blindness, tenacity,
and even desperateness with which those
conventions are held.
On the other hand, we have also come
to perceive our own participation in con
vention. As we become more and more edu
cated, we begin to gain a perspective with
regard to our own cultural installation.
We can come to recognize that we our
selves are (or were) as typical of our cul
ture as are those foreigners of theirs. And
through this recognition of our own typi
cality we may attempt to loosen those

phere at Stanford. It cannot be achieved
by participating in a revolutionary social
movement, by attempting to reform or
overthrow the status quo, by rejecting so
cial norms in dress, hair styles, sexual
activities, religious and ethical stances, etc.,
or even through alienation (including in
tellectual alienation) from the Stanford
community.
I want to draw our attention to a sort
of conventionalism which lies at the very
roots of our thought—and hence of our ac

Education And Convention
What then can we say about education
as it has to do with this radical notion of
convention?
We are reminded of that inscription in
the ancient Greek temple which is dedi
cated to the god Eidos, "The first step in
education is grasping one's self as a type."
To grasp one's self as a type is to recog
nize one's own cultural installation — and
radically so. This recognition, which is in
fact not a single event but an ever recur
ring achievement for the true intellectual,
constitutes an emergence from one's typi
cality, a liberation from convention.
The means by which such a liberation is
realized can best be characterized as criti
cal thought. Since "criticism" will be the
topic of a later artie'e in this series, suffice
it to say that critical thought is that which
exposes convention as prejudice and which
surpasses convention by discovering those
understandings of reality which lie beyond
convention.
Convention V». Tradition
The employ of critical thought leads to
the discovery of tradition.
Tradition differs from convention in one
very important respect. Convention gives
itself dogmatically and as a matter of
course. It is never really questioned but
always assumed as naturally evident.
But tradition can be given only through
criticism (in the positive sense): it must
be discovered. Tradition is the fruit of the
emergence from convention by the great
men and even societies of the past, a fruit
which makes up a great heritage.
Tradition is discovered through critical
thought. By entering into sincere dialogue
with the great men of the past, which
standings— and prejudices — to be con
fronted by theirs, we succeed in deepening
our own self-consciousness and liberating
ourselves from our bondage to concention.
Tradition And Critical Thought
What then are the implications of criti
cal thought to education?
First, critical thought is the only means
for distinguishing between convention and
tradition. In fact, it is the only means for

even recognizing either convention or tra
dition as such.
Second, critical thought enables one to
engage on the one hand in the criticism of
current values and on the other hand in
the conservation of those values of the past
which are worthy of our honor.
One graphic example of what one might
learn through such a radical conservatism
which turns to the ancients in criticism of
current values comes readily to mind from
a study of Greek culture. Love, one notes,
is the ground and impetus of both educa
tion and philosophy for Plato; but where
does one find any trace of love at all in ei
ther education or philosophy at. Stanford.
Radical Reorientation Needed
The breakthrough from convenience to
critical thought is the breakthrough from
convention to tradition. It is a break
through because it entails a radical reorien
tation of thought structure — yours and
mine. The possibility arises for convention
to be investigated and tradition discovered.
Lest this doctrine of radical conserva
tism be abhorrent to the more liberal
Daily readers, it is well to note that it is
not an uncommon one in Western history.
Kierkegaard, for example, once warned
against "surpassing the ancients by not
getting as far."
16 that not indeed a warning to every
serious student? Are we not being blind
and presumptuous when we assume that
we have nothing to learn from the an
cients?!
Need For Leadership
In earlier articles of this series a con
vention has been described which is impor
tant enough to bear further comment. That
convention is the notion of the nature of
The University which is prevalent through
out the country and especially at Stanford.
The role of the university as servant of
society rather than leader is a convention
to which many, more or less vocally, ascribe.
Likewise the view of the university as a
technical training ground is a convention,
as is the attempt to measure Stanford's
"greatness" according to the standards of a
"result-conscious" society.
These conventions would not be so dan
gerous were they held only by the admin
istrators and bureaucrats—but their preva
lence among the faculty and students (the
so-called academicians) is a matter for
greater concern.
Goal of Education
How may Stanford overcome this burden
of convention? If Stanford University is
truly to become an educational community
(a goal, incidently, not a fact), then the
problem of convention, critical thought,
and tradition must come to be realized con
cretely.
Only by rediscovering the ancients will
it be possible to rediscover the true aca
demic spirit of criticality and openness and
freedom which has been cherished in the
past—but which is entirely lacking in the
present.
(Except, of course, Reader, in you and
me!)
Authentic Education
The problem of convention, critical
thought, and tradition strikes closely to
home. For Kierkegaard's admonition is di
rected toward every scholar. All who are
enmired in convention are in the danger of
"surpassing the ancients by not getting as
far!"
Authentic education has two important
parts. On the one hand education 'involves
the liberation from convention, that is, a
radical recognition of the convention it
self, of one's own typicality. On the other
hand it involves the discovery of a deeper
reality, which had been concealed by the
veil of conventional prejudice but which is
revealed through the insights of tradition.
Thp true student must face these de
mands of authentic education over and
over.

They say that Stanford is a very extraor
dinary place.
They say Stanford is a leader among
American universities, pioneering the over

grams of study, liberalizing social regula
tions, participating in volunteer work in
Mississippi and Hong Kong, and expressing
dissatisfaction with the present order of
things by electing a restless advocate of
educational reform to the ASSU Presi
dency.
But for he who cares to examine the
place a bit more closely, it is obvious that
Stanford is not really so extraordinary af
ter all. It has succumbed to a paralyzing
disease, conventionalism. That disease is
present here in epidemic proportions. It
has infected department after department
Sleeping Sickness
Conventionalism, besides producing pa
ralysis and blindness, is first and foremost
a sort of sleeping sickness. The inflicted

in a dream world—but, strangely enough,
without even a slight awareness of being
asleep.
They assert, indeed, time and time again,
that they are perfectly healthy and wide
awake (far more awake, in fact, than their
companions dozing about them).
(You and I, Reader, may thank God that
we have not yet fallen prey to this dreadful
malady!)
What makes conventionalism so danger
ous? And is it really so übiquitous?
Social Awakening
All of us at Stanford, in our education
and experience, have come to recognize
"convention."
On the one hand, whenever we have
come into contact with societies different
from our own, we have become aware of
some of the conventions of that foreign
culture and also of the blindness, tenacity,
and even desperateness with which those
conventions are held.
On the other hand, we have also come
to perceive our own participation in con
vention. As we become more and more edu
cated, we begin to gain a perspective with
regard to our own cultural installation.
We can come to recognize that we our
selves are (or were) as typical of our cul
ture as are those foreigners of theirs. And
through this recognition of our own typi
cality we may attempt to loosen those
chains of convention and affirm our own
individuality.
Ingrained Prejudice
This suffices, I think, as a start for com
ing to see the character of the problem of
convention at Stanford.
Yet we will be able to understand that
problem—and likewise the relationship be
tween convention and education—only by
means of a much more radical—or one
might say unconventional—approach to the
idea.
In the first place, anyone who has busied
himself in any depth at all with the study
of a foreign culture—through disciplines
such as cultural history, comparative lit
erature, language study, anthropology, and
the like—has surely come to recognize how
deeply convention can reach into one's
thought structure, to what extent it can
control everything one thinks and does.
Provincialism
A local religion, for instance, often
blinds a member of a provincial society
from seeing beyond the narrow limits of his
cultural prejudices into the possibility of
a truer way of understanding reality. All
his judgments are determined beforehand
by the thought structure in which he takes

part. He is scarcely an individual, for con
vention dictates the way in which he turns
to the world about him.
But "local religion" was merely an ap
proach toward the concern of this article,
namely, education and convention at Stan
ford. So let us try for a moment to turn
toward ourselves.
Yes, But Not Me!
Can it be that somehow we have been
strong enough to avoid surrendering our
individuality to convention, in the radical
way in which it molds and controls one's
thought structure, while those foreigners
were obviously too weak? Or are we too
children of our culture, determined, in a
radical sense, by manifold cultural preju
dices —and often scarcely aware at all of
that fact?
I want to point here to a sort of conven
tionalism which extends far more deeply
into one's personality than most people
suppose.

our own self-consciousness and liberating
ourselves from our bondage to concention.
Tradition And Critical Thought
What then are the implications of criti
cal thought to education?
First, critical thought is the only means
for distinguishing between convention and
tradition. In fact, it is the only means for

even recognizing either convention or tra
dition as such.
Second, critical thought enables one to
engage on the one hand in the criticism of
current values and on the other hand in
the conservation of those values of the past
which are worthy of our honor.
One graphic example of what one might
learn through such a radical conservatism
which turns to the ancients in criticism of
current values comes readily to mind from
a study of Greek culture. Love, one notes,
is the ground and impetus of both educa
tion and philosophy for Plato; but where
does one find any trace of love at all in ei
ther education or philosophy at. Stanford.
Radical Reorientation Needed
The breakthrough from convenience to
critical thought is the breakthrough from
convention to tradition. It is a break
through because it entails a radical reorien
tation of thought structure — yours and
mine. The possibility arises for convention
to be investigated and tradition discovered.
Lest this doctrine of radical conserva
tism be abhorrent to the more liberal
Daily readers, it is well to note that it is
not an uncommon one in Western history.
Kierkegaard, for example, once warned
against "surpassing the ancients by not
getting as far."
16 that not indeed a warning to every
serious student? Are we not being blind
and presumptuous when we assume that
we have nothing to learn from the an
cients?!
Need For Leadership
In earlier articles of this series a con
vention has been described which is impor
tant enough to bear further comment. That
convention is the notion of the nature of
The University which is prevalent through
out the country and especially at Stanford.
The role of the university as servant of
society rather than leader is a convention
to which many, more or less vocally, ascribe.
Likewise the view of the university as a
technical training ground is a convention,
as is the attempt to measure Stanford's
"greatness" according to the standards of a
"result-conscious" society.
These conventions would not be so dan
gerous were they held only by the admin
istrators and bureaucrats—but their preva
lence among the faculty and students (the
so-called academicians) is a matter for
greater concern.
Goal of Education
How may Stanford overcome this burden
of convention? If Stanford University is
truly to become an educational community
(a goal, incidently, not a fact), then the
problem of convention, critical thought,
and tradition must come to be realized con
cretely.
Only by rediscovering the ancients will
it be possible to rediscover the true aca
demic spirit of criticality and openness and
freedom which has been cherished in the
past—but which is entirely lacking in the
present.
(Except, of course, Reader, in you and
me!)
Authentic Education
The problem of convention, critical
thought, and tradition strikes closely to
home. For Kierkegaard's admonition is di
rected toward every scholar. All who are
enmired in convention are in the danger of
"surpassing the ancients by not getting as
far!"
Authentic education has two important
parts. On the one hand education 'involves
the liberation from convention, that is, a
radical recognition of the convention it
self, of one's own typicality. On the other
hand it involves the discovery of a deeper
reality, which had been concealed by the
veil of conventional prejudice but which is
revealed through the insights of tradition.
Thp true student must face these de
mands of authentic education over and
over.

They say that Stanford is a very extraor

They say Stanford is a leader among

things by electing a restless advocate of

But for he who cares to examine the
place a bit more closely, it is obvious that

a sort of sleeping sickness. The inflicted

in a dream world—but, strangely enough,
without even a slight awareness of being

that they are perfectly healthy and wide
awake (far more awake, in fact, than their
companions dozing about them).
(You and I, Reader, may thank God that
we have not yet fallen prey to this dreadful
malady!)
What makes conventionalism so danger
ous? And is it really so übiquitous?
Social Awakening
All of us at Stanford, in our education
and experience, have come to recognize
"convention."
On the one hand, whenever we have
come into contact with societies different
from our own, we have become aware of
some of the conventions of that foreign
culture and also of the blindness, tenacity,
and even desperateness with which those
conventions are held.
On the other hand, we have also come
to perceive our own participation in con
vention. As we become more and more edu
cated, we begin to gain a perspective with
regard to our own cultural installation.
We can come to recognize that we our
selves are (or were) as typical of our cul
ture as are those foreigners of theirs. And
through this recognition of our own typi
cality we may attempt to loosen those
chains of convention and affirm our own
individuality.
Ingrained Prejudice
This suffices, I think, as a start for com
ing to see the character of the problem of
convention at Stanford.
Yet we will be able to understand that
problem—and likewise the relationship be
tween convention and education—only by
means of a much more radical—or one
might say unconventional—approach to the
idea.
In the first place, anyone who has busied
himself in any depth at all with the study
of a foreign culture—through disciplines
such as cultural history, comparative lit
erature, language study, anthropology, and
the like—has surely come to recognize how
deeply convention can reach into one's
thought structure, to what extent it can
control everything one thinks and does.
Provincialism
A local religion, for instance, often
blinds a member of a provincial society
from seeing beyond the narrow limits of his
cultural prejudices into the possibility of
a truer way of understanding reality. All
his judgments are determined beforehand
by the thought structure in which he takes

part. He is scarcely an individual, for con
vention dictates the way in which he turns
to the world about him.
But "local religion" was merely an ap
proach toward the concern of this article,
namely, education and convention at Stan
ford. So let us try for a moment to turn
toward ourselves.
Yes, But Not Me!
Can it be that somehow we have been
strong enough to avoid surrendering our
individuality to convention, in the radical
way in which it molds and controls one's
thought structure, while those foreigners
were obviously too weak? Or are we too
children of our culture, determined, in a
radical sense, by manifold cultural preju
dices —and often scarcely aware at all of
that fact?
I want to point here to a sort of conven
tionalism which extends far more deeply
into one's personality than most people
suppose.
I want to initiate a deeper critical atti
tude in the intellectual and social atmos
phere at Stanford. It cannot be achieved
by participating in a revolutionary social
movement, by attempting to reform or
overthrow the status quo, by rejecting so
cial norms in dress, hair styles, sexual
activities, religious and ethical stances, etc.,
or even through alienation (including in
tellectual alienation) from the Stanford
community.
I want to draw our attention to a sort
of conventionalism which lies at the very
roots of our thought—and hence of our ac
tion.
Education And Convention
What then can we say about education
as it has to do with this radical notion of
convention?
We are reminded of that inscription in
the ancient Greek temple which is dedi
cated to the god Eidos, "The first step in
education is grasping one's self as a type."
To grasp one's self as a type is to recog
nize one's own cultural installation — and
radically so. This recognition, which is in
fact not a single event but an ever recur
ring achievement for the true intellectual,
constitutes an emergence from one's typi
cality, a liberation from convention.
The means by which such a liberation is
realized can best be characterized as criti
cal thought. Since "criticism" will be the
topic of a later artie'e in this series, suffice
it to say that critical thought is that which
exposes convention as prejudice and which
surpasses convention by discovering those
understandings of reality which lie beyond
convention.
Convention V». Tradition
The employ of critical thought leads to
the discovery of tradition.
Tradition differs from convention in one
very important respect. Convention gives
itself dogmatically and as a matter of
course. It is never really questioned but
always assumed as naturally evident.
But tradition can be given only through
criticism (in the positive sense): it must
be discovered. Tradition is the fruit of the
emergence from convention by the great
men and even societies of the past, a fruit
which makes up a great heritage.
Tradition is discovered through critical
thought. By entering into sincere dialogue
with the great men of the past, which
standings— and prejudices — to be con
fronted by theirs, we succeed in deepening
our own self-consciousness and liberating
ourselves from our bondage to concention.

"greatness" according to the standards of a
"result-conscious" society.
These conventions would not be so dan
gerous were they held only by the admin
istrators and bureaucrats—but their preva
lence among the faculty and students (the
so-called academicians) is a matter for
greater concern.
Goal of Education
How may Stanford overcome this burden
of convention? If Stanford University is
truly to become an educational community
(a goal, incidently, not a fact), then the
problem of convention, critical thought,
and tradition must come to be realized con
cretely.
Only by rediscovering the ancients will
it be possible to rediscover the true aca
demic spirit of criticality and openness and
freedom which has been cherished in the
past—but which is entirely lacking in the
present.
(Except, of course, Reader, in you and
me!)
Authentic Education
The problem of convention, critical
thought, and tradition strikes closely to
home. For Kierkegaard's admonition is di
rected toward every scholar. All who are
enmired in convention are in the danger of
"surpassing the ancients by not getting as
far!"
Authentic education has two important
parts. On the one hand education 'involves
the liberation from convention, that is, a
radical recognition of the convention it
self, of one's own typicality. On the other
hand it involves the discovery of a deeper
reality, which had been concealed by the
veil of conventional prejudice but which is
revealed through the insights of tradition.
Thp true student must face these de
mands of authentic education over and
over.

They say that Stanford is a very extraor
dinary place.
They say Stanford is a leader among
American universities, pioneering the over

grams of study, liberalizing social regula
tions, participating in volunteer work in
Mississippi and Hong Kong, and expressing
dissatisfaction with the present order of
things by electing a restless advocate of
educational reform to the ASSU Presi
dency.
But for he who cares to examine the
place a bit more closely, it is obvious that
Stanford is not really so extraordinary af
ter all. It has succumbed to a paralyzing
disease, conventionalism. That disease is
present here in epidemic proportions. It
has infected department after department
Sleeping Sickness
Conventionalism, besides producing pa
ralysis and blindness, is first and foremost
a sort of sleeping sickness. The inflicted
lose consciousness and become immersed
in a dream world—but, strangely enough,
without even a slight awareness of being
asleep.
They assert, indeed, time and time again,
that they are perfectly healthy and wide
awake (far more awake, in fact, than their
companions dozing about them).
(You and I, Reader, may thank God that
we have not yet fallen prey to this dreadful
malady!)
What makes conventionalism so danger
ous? And is it really so übiquitous?
Social Awakening
All of us at Stanford, in our education
and experience, have come to recognize
"convention."
On the one hand, whenever we have
come into contact with societies different
from our own, we have become aware of
some of the conventions of that foreign
culture and also of the blindness, tenacity,
and even desperateness with which those
conventions are held.
On the other hand, we have also come
to perceive our own participation in con
vention. As we become more and more edu
cated, we begin to gain a perspective with
regard to our own cultural installation.
We can come to recognize that we our
selves are (or were) as typical of our cul
ture as are those foreigners of theirs. And
through this recognition of our own typi
cality we may attempt to loosen those
chains of convention and affirm our own
individuality.
Ingrained Prejudice
This suffices, I think, as a start for com
ing to see the character of the problem of
convention at Stanford.
Yet we will be able to understand that
problem—and likewise the relationship be
tween convention and education—only by
means of a much more radical—or one
might say unconventional—approach to the
idea.
In the first place, anyone who has busied
himself in any depth at all with the study
of a foreign culture—through disciplines
such as cultural history, comparative lit
erature, language study, anthropology, and
the like—has surely come to recognize how
deeply convention can reach into one's
thought structure, to what extent it can
control everything one thinks and does.
Provincialism
A local religion, for instance, often
blinds a member of a provincial society
from seeing beyond the narrow limits of his
cultural prejudices into the possibility of
a truer way of understanding reality. All
his judgments are determined beforehand
by the thought structure in which he takes

part. He is scarcely an individual, for con
vention dictates the way in which he turns
to the world about him.
But "local religion" was merely an ap
proach toward the concern of this article,
namely, education and convention at Stan
ford. So let us try for a moment to turn
toward ourselves.
Yes, But Not Me!
Can it be that somehow we have been
strong enough to avoid surrendering our
individuality to convention, in the radical
way in which it molds and controls one's
thought structure, while those foreigners
were obviously too weak? Or are we too
children of our culture, determined, in a
radical sense, by manifold cultural preju
dices —and often scarcely aware at all of
that fact?
I want to point here to a sort of conven
tionalism which extends far more deeply
into one's personality than most people
suppose.
I want to initiate a deeper critical atti
tude in the intellectual and social atmos
phere at Stanford. It cannot be achieved
by participating in a revolutionary social
movement, by attempting to reform or
overthrow the status quo, by rejecting so
cial norms in dress, hair styles, sexual
activities, religious and ethical stances, etc.,
or even through alienation (including in
tellectual alienation) from the Stanford
community.
I want to draw our attention to a sort
of conventionalism which lies at the very
roots of our thought—and hence of our ac
tion.
Education And Convention
What then can we say about education
as it has to do with this radical notion of
convention?
We are reminded of that inscription in
the ancient Greek temple which is dedi
cated to the god Eidos, "The first step in
education is grasping one's self as a type."
To grasp one's self as a type is to recog
nize one's own cultural installation — and
radically so. This recognition, which is in
fact not a single event but an ever recur
ring achievement for the true intellectual,
constitutes an emergence from one's typi
cality, a liberation from convention.
The means by which such a liberation is
realized can best be characterized as criti
cal thought. Since "criticism" will be the
topic of a later artie'e in this series, suffice
it to say that critical thought is that which
exposes convention as prejudice and which
surpasses convention by discovering those
understandings of reality which lie beyond
convention.
Convention V». Tradition
The employ of critical thought leads to
the discovery of tradition.
Tradition differs from convention in one
very important respect. Convention gives
itself dogmatically and as a matter of
course. It is never really questioned but
always assumed as naturally evident.
But tradition can be given only through
criticism (in the positive sense): it must
be discovered. Tradition is the fruit of the
emergence from convention by the great
men and even societies of the past, a fruit
which makes up a great heritage.
Tradition is discovered through critical
thought. By entering into sincere dialogue
with the great men of the past, which
standings— and prejudices — to be con
fronted by theirs, we succeed in deepening
our own self-consciousness and liberating
ourselves from our bondage to concention.
Tradition And Critical Thought
What then are the implications of criti
cal thought to education?
First, critical thought is the only means
for distinguishing between convention and
tradition. In fact, it is the only means for

even recognizing either convention or tra
dition as such.
Second, critical thought enables one to
engage on the one hand in the criticism of
current values and on the other hand in
the conservation of those values of the past
which are worthy of our honor.
One graphic example of what one might
learn through such a radical conservatism
which turns to the ancients in criticism of
current values comes readily to mind from
a study of Greek culture. Love, one notes,
is the ground and impetus of both educa
tion and philosophy for Plato; but where
does one find any trace of love at all in ei
ther education or philosophy at. Stanford.
Radical Reorientation Needed
The breakthrough from convenience to
critical thought is the breakthrough from
convention to tradition. It is a break
through because it entails a radical reorien
tation of thought structure — yours and
mine. The possibility arises for convention
to be investigated and tradition discovered.
Lest this doctrine of radical conserva
tism be abhorrent to the more liberal
Daily readers, it is well to note that it is
not an uncommon one in Western history.
Kierkegaard, for example, once warned
against "surpassing the ancients by not
getting as far."
16 that not indeed a warning to every
serious student? Are we not being blind
and presumptuous when we assume that
we have nothing to learn from the an
cients?!
Need For Leadership
In earlier articles of this series a con
vention has been described which is impor
tant enough to bear further comment. That
convention is the notion of the nature of
The University which is prevalent through
out the country and especially at Stanford.
The role of the university as servant of
society rather than leader is a convention
to which many, more or less vocally, ascribe.
Likewise the view of the university as a
technical training ground is a convention,
as is the attempt to measure Stanford's
"greatness" according to the standards of a
"result-conscious" society.
These conventions would not be so dan
gerous were they held only by the admin
istrators and bureaucrats—but their preva
lence among the faculty and students (the
so-called academicians) is a matter for
