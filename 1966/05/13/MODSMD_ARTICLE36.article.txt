# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						Morrison Case: Opinion 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your
tale.

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of

seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re

Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track

Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging

absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this

If Mr. Vincent had exercised

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.

• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.

• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your
tale.

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go

Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro

should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun

for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con

If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he

years; we will only take con

I think it only fair to all mem

something to try and change.

at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.

• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.

• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

they all turn out junk for Chap

RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.

ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.

• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.

• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.

• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

Editor,

(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your
tale.

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con

archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.

• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

Editor,

(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total

subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.

tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your
tale.

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.
LUCIO P. RUOTOLO

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen

"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin

function as mentor and land

students cannot be forced into

they attain the role they seek

neither is life itself, and there

Not all of these citations re

cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in
quiry." Therefore, my dear, un
til you have come to the end of
the trail, shake not at me your
tale.

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.

•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen

absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.

• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun

There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the

must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The

I haven't seen anyone men

that very few men can lead by

anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass

great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you

• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total

subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but

I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On

that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.
LUCIO P. RUOTOLO

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,

(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but

I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On

that "Nature unifies every

Hence man, before he begins to

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the

We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur

Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj

way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his

The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's

radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.

•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.
RICK SEAMAN
Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

Editor,

(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but

scribed by Miss Savery

I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On

that "Nature unifies every

Hence man, before he begins to

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.

rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.

Wilbur
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.
DAN ENDSLEY, '47
Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com

scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.

• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea

• In His Maidenforni...
Editor, The Daily:
Last night I had a dream in

which I opened a Stanford Daily,
and on the back page was a po
litical cartoon. It showed an ex
cellent caricature of Dave Harris
giving a speech before a large,
informal crowd; he was standing
there in his underwear, which
was simply reeking. The caption
read "It's time for a change."
When I awoke and remem
bered the dream, I was certain
it had to be a dream, because
The Daily does not have any po

iitical cartoonists on its staff:
they all turn out junk for Chap
arral.

Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.
RICH TOWER
• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.
NICK DAVIS
• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.
CHRIS MARTIN
• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.
DAVID W. SEAMAN
• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.
TERRENCE O'CONNOR
• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
other constituencies, be forced
to assume a role they reject. It
is clear that in the area of per
sonal behavior they reject cer
tain traditional standards em
braced by their elders with vary
ing degrees of enthusiasm. The
elders will have to learn that
nothing they do can force the
skeptical to embrace these val
ues—and that the university
cannot succeed with tasks
where parents have already
failed. To insist on trying is a
waste of effort and emotion po
tentially damaging to the cen
tral purpose.
"On the other hand, students
will have to learn how to distin
guish between what is central
and what is peripheral, and be
tween the institution's proper

function as mentor and land
lord and its impossible assign
ment as surrogate parent. If
students cannot be forced into
a role they reject, neither can
they attain the role they seek
for themselves without the un
derstanding and support of the
other people in the university."
About readers who decry
frank discussion of controver
sial topics in campus publica
tions . . . Some "merely mutter
that the subject is not 'suit
able' . . .
"Nothing the Review will ever
publish is above criticism and
debate, whatever its source; and
nothing that happens on a uni
versity campus, good or evil, is
unsuitable for adult discussion
in an alumni magazine.
"Free discussion is the essence
of university life. This discus
sion is not always pleasant, but
neither is life itself, and there
is no human advance without
it."
Not all of these citations re
late to fund raising—which, in
cidentally, is NOT one of the
functions of the Stanford Alum
ni Association—but all seem
relevant to the subject matter
of yesterday's Daily editorial. It
seems to me that the basic val
ues expressed are not incompati
ble. In any event, these samples
are representative of the campus
coverage provided to 27,000
alumni subscribers. I should add
that I have not been stoned. On
the contrary, I have received
quite a few reader commenda
tions—and not one complaint.

Editor,
The Stanford Review
(Editor's note: Mr. Endsley's
remarks, as paraphrased in The
Daily Wednesday, were made
Sunday evening at an AWS
Symposium discussion. The
Daily regrets any inferences
made to the effect that the para
phrased statement was the total
ity of Mr. Endsley's views on the
subject.)
• No Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
It is reassuring to know that
there are benevolent people such
as the Ad Hoc Committee who
are willing to go out of their
way to protect the University,
its faculty and students, from
the horrors of government con
tracts.
They say that they are defend
ing "academic freedom" but
nothing could be further from

the truth. They do not seem to
realize that they are attempting
to impose their own political
views on the rest of the campus.
The English and Philosophy
Departments have absolutely no
qualifications for judging the
worthiness of a scientific re
search project. They seem to
want to judge the contracts by
their own standards of "morali
ty"—standards which certainly
are not universally accepted and
are extremely narrow in scope.
Would these same people
agree to let someone who
doesn't agree with them (some
of these people actually exist)
determine whether their re
search is worthy?
They want to stay in their
ivory towers, free from the prob
lems of the dirty, outside world.
The government of this country
is not our enemy—it seems hon
orable to me to work on a proj
ect which would help to
strengthen its defense.
The University, believe it or
not, is a part of this country and
there is nothing wrong with it
doing something useful for the
country. If we limit all research
to projects which do not offend
our easily offended committee
and which could not ever be
used for "murder" (committee
definition), then we could do
away with most of our scientific
and engineering departments.
Perhaps this is what the com
mittee wants.
Students and faculty are not
forced to work on any contract
and certainly are free to make
their own moral choices — they
do not need a group of profes
sional protestors to do it for
them.

• In Defense Of Us All
Editor, The Dally:
As a prominent member of
the unthinking, unsavory, but
socially suave Stanford com
munity so perceptively de
scribed by Miss Savery
(chuckle) (The Daily, May 6),
I must rise in defense of us all
by agreeing with Schiller (On
the Aesthetic Education of Man,
in a Series of Letters, 1795)
that "Nature unifies every
where, but reason unifies again.
Hence man, before he begins to
philosophize, is closer to the
truth than the philosopher who
has not yet concluded his in

• The 'Radical'
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Dave Harris has
won and we are all waiting for
the new revolution, it is well for
the spectators of the theoretical
life to review their concept of
the radical.
By "the radical" I intend the
radical idea, be it found in Dave
Harris, Jonathan Ketchum, or
Ohlendorf and Cornberg.
The idea of the radical has
already drawn some reflective
attention. Harris' etymological
remark was, "radical means
getting to the roots of things."
The lazy mind generates var
ious representational compari
sons which are inadequate to
the conceptual idea of the radi
cal. I see three ways of grasping
the radical: as extreme, as deep,
and as fundamental.
Many people superficially as
sociate 'extremeist' with the no
tion of the radical. The radical,
they imagine, is not of the gold
en mean.
According to some spectrum
of viewpoints implied by "the is
sue" (be it politics or educa
tion), the radical person is
thought to be an extreme leftist.
A true radical, however, is not
necessarily a leftist, and a left
ist is not automatically a true
radical.
The moderates who classify
viewpoints spatially cannot un

derstand disagreements until
they see the radical root from
which the issue issues forth.
If we look for the roots, the
biologist steps forth to announce
that the roots are underground
and that the roots support the
superstructure of stem and
fruit. The psychologist will add
that the roots must be deep to
be secure. The metaphysician
will note that the roots are hid
den (although he ma*' keep
quiet about it).
We have a special concern for
Stanford's roots, which are bur
ied deep under railroad ties, a
founding grant, and piles of
IBM cards.
Finally the historian appears
to announce the radical proj
ect of cultural history. The only
way to be a radical is to be an
active, radical historian: this is
the promise of Stanford's his
tory.
The election of Dave Harris
is a major event in Stanford's
present history: education has
become a real topic for a large
part of the Stanford commun
ity.
There seem to be several sub
communities of boredom, re
sentment, technical proficiency
(craftsmanship), and even philo
sophical wonder.
If we are to fullfill the prom
ise of the historical present we
should look further into the
idea of the radical. Let us not
look merely more 'deeply,'
rather let us try to grasp con
ceptually the idea of the radi
cal.
That which is radical is fun
damental. In an educational
controversy each opponent holds
that his idea of education is
deeper or more adequate to the
tasks at hand or more radical or
better or more highly cultured.
In an argument the one who
truly understands his opponent
is the more fundamental. He
sees the real values of the oppo
sition; his own position has
still greater value.
The radical should not merely
disagree with "the-middle-of-the
road" partisan; his position
must not be merely different
lest it be a passing fad. The
radical's position must include
the positive values which his
opponents have.
But Ihe radical thinker must
go further. He must be willing
to advocate some things which

seem of negative value at the
moment.
Let us not confuse the essen
tial negativity of critical educa
tion with the colorful difference
of Harris's visual aspects.
Let us imagine the possibility
that the radical liberal is also a
radical conservative and that
the new revolution Is a period
in Stanford's evolution.
JEFF WATTLES
•Learning To Lead
Editor, The Daily:
I can't defend the manner in
which the "ROTC instructor, who
is presently the subject of so
much controversy, requested, or
demanded (or what ever you
like), that ROTC cadets give
blood intended for troops of the
US and its allies in Vietnam. I
can't defend his manner; I
wasn't there.
However, I find nothing
whatever wrong, in itself, with
requesting these cadets to give
blood to men they are being
trained to lead.
Mr. Wilson, in Monday's Daily,
sobbed loudly that "leaders were
led." Others have lamented the
same situation, "we are leaders,
not to be led but to lead!"
I haven't seen anyone men
tion yet that these cadets are
being trained to lead, that they
are not capable of leading now,
that very few men can lead by
instinct; neither have I seen
anyone mention yet that one of
the cardinal rules to learn is
that the man with the brass
stars on his theatre of opera
tions ribbons probably knows a
great deal more about the mili
tary than you do (unless you
too have brass stars on your
theatre of operations ribbons).
Personally, I would be very
reluctant to follow a new gradu
ate from a "Progressive Train
ing School for Future Leaders"
into a fire-fight if I felt that he
had no real idea of the meaning
and use of a chain of command.
LEWIS GRAY
• Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
Without defending the use of
LSD, I would like to criticize
the manner in which your fea
ture article (The Daily, May 11:
"Fantasies Unleash Medical Hor
rors") treated the "problem".
In the first place, it was chock
full of misinformation:
No one in his right mind
would attribute the visions re
counted in the Bible to a drug
that was synthesized in 1938—
synthesized, mind you, not dis
covered in a natural state.
LSD will never be shown to
be physically addictive, as the
article implied it might. It has
been used by individuals now
for some years with no indica
tions of physical addiction what
soever. What other proof is
necessary?
As far as the very nebulous
area of psychological addiction
is concerned, it would be well to
keep in mind the fact that the
phrase "psychological addiction"
is not in the least an accurate
pejorative term; that is, it does
not in the least indicate whether
or not LSD is a good thing or
a bad thing— since one can say
we are also "psychologically ad
dicted" to such things as sex,
sun-bathing, and sports cars.
The "danger" of LSD typified
by the five-year-old's accidental
ingestion of LSD in Brooklyn
is a "danger" shared by aspirin,
rat poison, and mother's tran
quilizers—to give this sensation
al incident as an example of the
"danger" of LSD is absurd.
To give the "former pusher's"
estimate of the extent of LSD
use on this campus seems to me
to be irresponsible journalism.
Ten per cent is an awfully
high figure, implying as it does
that there are around four hun
dred undergraduates who use
LSD at Stanford. Twenty per
cent is even more fantastic, im
plying that there are some eight
hundred graduates using LSD.
The impression this gives to the
reader is that LSD is running
rampant at Stanford.
I doubt if this is a very intelli
gent way to talk about The
Farm, especially when one real
izes that the outside world is
quite prone to hysteria these
days— witness the way the na
tion's newspapers jumped on

the Pat Morrison case.
If anything is necessary to
the full understanding of LSD,
it is responsible disemination of
information. Your feature story
was hardly that. Why not leave
sensationalism to the Chronicle?
Why not use your heads?
