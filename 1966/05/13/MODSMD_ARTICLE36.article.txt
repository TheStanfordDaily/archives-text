# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The
						Morrison Case: Opinion 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Phil Vinvent's letter in May
10's Daily reflected regrettable
ignorance and superficial under
standing of the issues involved
in the current controversy over
the individualism of atheltes.
First of all, Mr. Vincent is
completely incorrect in stating
that he is "sure that Morrison
gets a tremendous amount of
static from his teammates." Pat
gets no static because he is re
spected for his athletic ability
and character, and is not judged
on the basis of his personal
habits; that this is true is quite
evident in the code of ethics
which the team as a whole com
posed in support of a teammate
and the whole conception of in
dividualism in atheltics.
Secondly, there are 110 "little
boys" on the track team; every
man on the squad, whether or
not in agreement concerning
this matter, has carefully and
seriously considered his stand,
and is assuming personal re
sponsibility for his position.
Thirdly, I cannot emphasize
enough that no one on the track
and field team, nor the team as
a whole, is directing any criti
cism toward Coach Jordan.
Whether or not we agree with
Mr. Jordan's personal stand, we
realize that is acting out of a
desire to do whatever he feels
he can to contribute to the best
interests of track and field and
of athletics as a whole at Stan
ford University.
We respect him greatly for
his commitment just as I am
sure he respects us for the same

reasons, even if our views do not
coincide.
And finally, Mr. Vincent's
statement that Coach Jordan
"should try to get back to fun
damentals, like encouraging
athletes to perform to their
highest capacities," is totally
absurd. If Vincent took the time
to examine the records of this
season, he would see that there
have been many outstanding
performances and improve
ments, which have been due in
no small measure to the en
couragement and coaching of
Pavton Jordan.
If Mr. Vincent had exercised
the same care in his letter to
The Daily that Coach Jordan
and the members of the track
and field team have in putting
forth their point s-of-view, he
might have emerged as an ar
ticulate critic rather than be
coming a victim of his own
simplistic thinking.

• Ugly Indian
Editor, The Daily:
I have been disturbed for
some time now about the image
projected by our Stanford In
dian. You will notice, please,
that not only does he have
shoulder-length hair, but wears
pig-tails as well. Furthermore,
Indians have long been known
as pagan rowdies and have fre
quently shown contempt for es
tablished authority.
The Stanford Indian is pres
ent at all our athletic contests,
his picture is pasted to the win
dows of hundreds of Stanford
automobiles and he appears in
dozens of forms in books, pam
phlets, signs, and emblems. .
If he is to represent our Uni
versity, then I think the least
we can expect is that he con
form to our image. I therefore
suggest ho improve his personal
appearance at once by having a
crewcut and getting rid of the
silly feathers in his hair.

• A Comic Travesty
Editor, The Daily:
When our athletic director
states to the press that he has
given Pat Morrison "time to ad
just to our ways" he reflects a
Buck Club conception of the
University that must continue to
embarrass all serious students
and teachers.
That a track and field coach
should take it uopn himself
rigidly to define "the rules of
the house" (the consequences of
his childish demand clearly ex
tended beyond the limits of the
gym) is surely a comic travesty
upon the idea of a university.
This is not the first time at
Stanford that an English track
star has experienced insensitive
treatment from people who
should know better.

• Drawing The Line
Editor, The Daily:
Keerist!! If it isn't research
contracts with the evil CIA, it's
haircuts, people preventives at
the Health Service or something.
Somebody's always got the beak
about something these days.
When you read the small print
in The Daily stories on these
subjects you often notice the
same names apeparing over and
over again. Fine. Every school
is going to have those people
who think that the school is go
ing to hell in a handbasket and
let this be known to one and all
at every opportunity.
The problem is that these peo
ple aren't even consistent in
their approach, as was pointed
out in a letter to the editor the
other day. They say that the
University should pass no moral
judgment about proper sexual
conduct by withholding contra
ceptives and then turn right
around and blame the University
for not making a moral judg
ment concerning the acceptance
of research contracts.
Now the bitching is starting
about whether or not the people
who pay for the athletic pro
gram, and a lot of other things,
should be able to call some of the
shots. The University is being
"immoral" for letting them do
so.
At my high school, such prob
lems had a quick and easy ans
wer. It was run by Jesuit priests
and they simply said, "We didn't
ask you to come here, so if you
don't like it, get out." This was
an attitude bred from having
run boys' high schools for over
four hundred years. They were
fairly sure that they knew what
they were doing.
Unfortunately, no one in the
United States has been running
a major university for four hun
dred years, if that is a criterion
for having sound judgment. As
Berkeley found out too late, this
doesn't work in colleges.
Therefore, it appears that this
confrontation between students
and administration is going to
take place. Hopefully, this con
frontation can take place across
a meeting table and not a picket
line.
If such an exchange is going
to take place in the most orderly
manner, the University must
draw the line. It must set down

for all to read exactly where it
stands, in general, on what peo
ple have chosen to call moral
issues.
Is it going to have no morals
whatsoever — "the personal
morals and actions of students
are none of our business; we'll
take any contract; we'll take
anybody's money; our business
is simply the education of people
who choose to attend" — or is it
going to take some more moral
stance—"the alumni who pay
for so many things can make
our decisions up to the point
where . . .; our concern is the
whole student, his whole life and
not just the information he
picks up by being here for four
years; we will only take con
tracts which are judged moral
on the basis of . . ."
I think it only fair to all mem
bers of the University com
munity that they know where
the University intends to draw
this line, either as a guideline
for their own actions, or as
something to try and change.
If we're going to argue, let's
at least decide what, in a general
way, we're arguing about.

• Pedestalism
Editor, The Daily:
Pat Morrison's suspension
from the track team (The Daily,
May 9) reveals an interesting
aspect of the Stanford athletic
department's policy.
The obvious implication is
that departmental policy is gov
erned not by the coaches, the
athletic director (Chuck Tay
lor), or the administration, but
by our "influential and, needless
to say, rich alumni". It is truly
a sad state of affairs if this is
the case.
It appears that Mr. Taylor has
relayed the alumni's sentiments
to Mr. Morrison via Coach Jor
dan; hence, the athletic depart
ment is allowing the alumni to
determine its policies. The
power to formulate these poli
cies should lie entirely within
the athletic department and no
other influences should be
brought into play.
In the Morrison case, it seems
as if the department is trying
to insure the alumni's financial
endowments by placating them
at the expense of a highly tal
ented athlete.
They have decided to sacri
fice Morrison's track future sim
ply because he values his indi
viduality more than the wishes
of some narrow-minded alumni.
The athletic department and
the the alumni possess an un
warranted fear that Morrison
may damage the Stanford "im
age".
In the first place one may
wonder just what "image" the
department is referring to and
secondly it seems that an ath
lete should be judged by his ac
complishments and perform
ances rather than how he ap
pears or what "image" he casts.
If only the athletic department
was enlightened enough to judge
Morrison by his accomplish
ments, there would obviously
be no doubt as to his accepta
bility.
Athletics involves many sacri
fices by a person but it should
not be allowed to question his
individuality. Maybe someday
Stanford's athletic department
will realize this and leave its
"lofty pedestal" to come back
down to earth.
However, until they realize
that individuality and athletics
are compatible, we must be con
tent to let them employ their
archaic policies and bask in the
glory of Stanford athletics of
a few decades ago.

• Buying A Team
Editor,. The Daily:
How much does an alumnus
have to be worth (in dollars) to
pay for trivial changes in a stu
dent's behavior?
The business over trackman
Morrison's hair is an outrage.
The question of hairstyles is not
a black and white problem, like
cleanliness; it is relative, and
should be a personal decision.
The whole matter of kow-tow
ing to rich alumni's wishes here
and at other schools sickens me.
These "influential" alums are
a minority; I'm an alumnus too
(especially in the eyes of the
Alumni Fund office), but no
one asked my opinion on the
hair. I'm tempted to make my
million so I can buy off the Ath
letic Department and force ath
letes to dress and groom the way
I like.

• Sophomorism
Editor, The Daily:
As a spectator of Stanford
track for the past four years,
I am very familiar with what is
called Payton Jordan's "show
manship".
However, this year I was able
to see the other side of the
facade, and I observed what is
really a three-ringed circus with
'Payt' the genial whipmaster.
This may sound harsh, but I
once heard him berate a minor
official for ten minutes because
he had not worn a sportcoat of
the proper color.
The whole idea of a Stanford
"image" in the field of athletics
seems to me to be particularly

ridiculous. Track is, after all, a
game, and none of the athletes'
reputations will be made or des
troyed on the track.
But to get down to the case
in question. I heard a few
months ago from a fairly reli
able source that local high school
coaches were putting the pres
sure on Jordan to make Pat
Morrison conform to their ideas
of how a respectable great
sprinter should appear.
It seems they were afraid that
Morrison's image would pervert
their highly impressionable
boys. Since when does Stanford
submit to such sophomoric pres
sures?
Thus I feel that the only ques
tions Mr. Jordan should ask an
athlete are "How fast?' and
How far?' and not 'How long?'
And therefore I congratulate
Pat Morrison on his abilities as
an athlete and his courage as
an individual.

• Criticizing Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Marx's letter to The Dally
(May 9) shows the typical com
plaint of many of the so-called
"intellectuals," the people who
have nothing better to do than
go around looking for things to
criticize.
These people protest every
possible "questionable" activity
on or off campus by picketing,
writing vehement letters, and
making speeches at noon rallies
that supposedly further freedom
of debate.
Criticism, especially strong
criticism, is very often good,
and the United States needs it
badly.
But when people such as Mr.
Marx criticize in such terms as
"Living in this country today
offers us two choices: accept
and enjoy the diseased caresses
of Goliath or grow weary with
forced submission to continual
rape," then they go too far.
If Mr. Marx thinks the United
States is that perverted, then I
am more than happy to make
a email contribution to the price
of a plane ticket to anywhere
Mr. Marx wants to go.

• Not Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
To be sure I had not, in some
lunatic moment, actually ut
tered the puerile words attrib
uted to me in Wednesday's Daily
editorial, I hastily checked back
through the archives for an en
tire year. Happily, the results of
this quest support my own
memory: I am not guilty. Ei
ther there has been a mistake
or there is another Dan Ends
ley, '47.
Further, I want to stress that
I would never accept responsi
bility for the words selected to
convey the thought (". . . To
achieve quality, a university
must have money, and to at
tract donations, a university
must cultivate a good public
image"); and that even after
rephrasing I would not accept
ownership of the thought Itself
without qualifying remarks sim
ilar in import to those offered
by the writer of the editorial.
Had I seen those words at
tributed to another, I would
have been one of the first to
rank their author with the idi
ots. Perhaps what I have ac
tually said is as shallow as the
statement I complain about; but
it is better to be convicted for
what one has done than for what
one has not, so I offer in evi
dence some of my obiter dicta
of the past few months:
"Stanford is a private insti
tution and, as with all private
universities, there is a very
large gap between tuition and
endowment income and what it
takes to keep the place going.
The gap is plugged by money
from a great many sources, and
the failure of individual alumni
to contribute at a significant
level wouldn't mean the doors
would close. It would mean,
however, that Stanford inevita
bly would become a different
kind of institution: A public or
quasi-public university." But:
. . Let us not forget, either,
that the largest single source of
income at Stanford—aside from
SLAC, which is a national fa
cility—is still tuition: not any
one corporation or foundation
or government department, but
students . . And:
. . Alumni can be quite as
dense and unresponsive, as
myth-prone, and altogether as
infuriating as anyone else." 'It
is a fact that only about a
fourth of Stanford's alumni
serve her in any way, financial
ly or otherwise." However:
"Most of those who care want
to help, not hurt; build not des
troy. They continue to lend their
support in spite of many flaws
both fancied and real."
On the way a university ac
tually operates . . . "Indirectly
if not directly, eventually if not
initially, each of the constituen
cies [student, alumni, faculty,
administration! will control its
own actions; if not formally,
through concerted group effort,
then informally, as the sum of
all individual efforts."
On the student role . . . "Stu
dents cannot, any more than
