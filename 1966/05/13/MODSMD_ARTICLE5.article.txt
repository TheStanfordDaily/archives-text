# Suit Tests Religion Policy
## 
### BILL WERTZ Associate Editor 
Five Stanford students will file suit
in Sarta Clara County Court this
morning against Stanford University
for "denial of religious freedom."
The students are Martin H. Gerry
and James Johnston, both second-year
law students, Jerome Silbergeld, a
senior history major, David Ileskett,
a senior English major and Tom
Forstenzer, a graduate student in his
tory.
The suit will claim that the reso
lution passed by the Board of Trus
tees in February permitting sectarian
worship services in Memorial Church
"discriminates de facto against those
religious groups which find the at
mosphere and decoration of Memorial
Church so repugnant to the basic na
ture of their religious belief as to
make it impossible for them to hold
services in Memorial Church."
The suit further charges that the
Board of Trustees' resolution "grants

tie facto privileges of sectarian wor
ship on campus to some religious
groups and denies do facto the privi
lege of sectarian worship on campus
to other religious groups."
Rabbi Ramiliant, who has been in
volved in the worship site issue, made
the following statement to the Daily
concerning the suit: "As the rabbi for
the Jewish students at Stanford and
as a representative of the B'nai
B'rith Hillel Foundation, I wish to
disassociate myself from the intended
legal action of these students. I want
to add that I consider their action at
this time rash. I believe that both the
adminisration and the Board of Trus
tees are interested in resolving this
matter in an equitable fashion."
Asks Injunction
The suit will ask for an injunction
preventing the enforcement of the
Board of Trustees' resolution and a
declaratory judgment affirming the
plaintiffs' rights to hold sectarian
worship services on the campus and
outside of Memorial Church.
Gerry and Heskett had requested
permission to hold and participate in

a Unitarian worship service on cam
pus, but outside of Memorial Church.
Silbergeld had requested permission
to hold Jewish services outside of
Memorial Church.
Denied Service
All three were denied permission by
Associate Dean of Students Joel
Smith because such worship services
are contrary to the regulations of the
University as set forth in the Board
of Trustees' February resolution.
Speaking to The Daily last night
Dean Smith said he felf the suit
would be unprofitable.
"I think it is important that people
at Stanford who are disappointed with
the present religious policy of the
University express their point of
view," Dean Smith said. However,
"reasonable and forceful protests of
Stanford's religious policy have been
effectively expressed through the
Committee on Religious Affairs.
"I doubt that this lawsuit can add
anything worthwhile to what has al
ready been done, and in fact it may
well be interpreted as being either
frivolous or menacing."
