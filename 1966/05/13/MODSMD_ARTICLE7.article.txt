# Policy Clash On Open House Regs
## Schmidt Elected 1966-67 LASSU Speaker ROTC Bill, Religion, Athletics On Agenda 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
The student legislature created a
conflict in law last night when the
body passed a by-laws amendment to
liberalize open-house policy which will
become effective on May 20. This ac
tion implies that student judicial
councils will no longer be responsible
for open-house hours, and that the
University will have to decide wheth
er to enforce present policy or not.
The resolution proposes new open
house hours, whereby any visitor of
the opposite sex would be allowed in
non - lobby areas Sunday through
Thursday from 12 noon to 12 mid
night, and on weekends from 10 a.m.
until 2:30.
The bill also removes dead letter re
strictions for graduate students.
Those new hours would be subject

to approval within each living group,
which could restrict the hours for
their convenience.
Schmidt Elected
Carl Schmidt was elected Speaker
of the Legislature for next year. Tom
Forstenzer was elected to the newly
created post of Laison Officer. Both
were the only nominees for their posi
tions.
Acting on the recent Morrison-Jor
dan controversy, LASSU recommend
ed to the Committee of 15 that a sub
committee be established to conduct
a complete re-evaluation of the prac
tice and policies of the Department
of Athletire, relations between the
Department and the rest of the Uni
versity, and the value of inter-colle
giate athletics in general.
A resolution declaring that "no ath
lete or other representative of the
University shall be kept from repre
senting Stanford because of his per
sonal appearance" failed due to lack
of a quorum.
ROTC Recommendation
The legislature struck the entire
resolution passed last week concern
ing the questionability of basing
R.O.T.C. grades on donations of blood
and of the academic standard of
R.O.T.C. courses. Representatives
questioned evidence presented and
wished to make amends for personal
attacks made at Major Hamil.
An alternative bill was passed,
stating that "questions concerning the
academic merits of certain depart

ments and courses have arisen, with
specific regard to R.0.T.C." LASSU
directed the Education Commission,
Academic Council and Administration
to formulate a definitive statement
concerning these questions, and the
Speaker to submit a list of specific
departments, courses, criticisms, and
recommendations for consideration by
the investigating bodies.
Jewish Worship
The Legislature commended the
stand of the Rabbi and the Jewish
community to worship on campus
now and urged that the Board of
Trustees re interpret their February
declaration on sectarian worship in a
bill sponsored by Sandy McKenzie,
ASSU President. It was also decided
that the Speaker look into possible
legal action that might be taken by
students, such as investigating the
unconstitutionality of the present
situation
The bill resulted from a refusal by
the Jewish Rabbi at Stanford to lead
worship in Memorial Chuch which is
"dedicated to Christian worship."
Legislative sponsor McKenzie stated
that "the current policy has the effect
of barring some religious groups from
worshipping on campus and thus con
travents the intentions of the Foun
ders by favoring one group."
In other action, the legislature re
defined the Chief of Student Police
payroll in the by-laws of the constitu
tion and provided a "token" salary
for the executive secretary.
