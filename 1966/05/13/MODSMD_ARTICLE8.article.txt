# 'Civil Liberties' Theme Enters Pill Discussion
## 
### 
A panel discussion on oral contra
ceptives at Tresidder last night fo
cused on the role of individual liber
ties and responsibilities in an ordered
society. Panelists were Maurice M.
Osborne, executive director of the
Health Service, Dick Roe, UCCM cam
pus minister, and Victor Lovell, ex
ponent of SSRF views, from Counsel
ing and Testing.
'Contraceptives Not Dangerous'
In his opening remarks, Dr. Os
borne emphasized medical responsi
bility, but admitted "available con
traceptives are by and large not dan
gerous." He also argued that if stu
dents were dependent upon parental
financing, it would seem absurd to
ask the university to do what parents
would not do.
Lovell argued, "The issue at Stan
ford is freedom, not sexual conduct."
He emphasized the need for civil liber
ties because "sex is a matter of in
dividual taste, not morality."
After the recent referendum showed
a 2 to 1 majority in favor of the
Health Service issuing contraceptive
pills to all students requesting them,
Lovell felt that the university com
munity had reached a consensus.
Outside Pressures
He contended outside pressures were
influencing Health Service policy, and
that outside groups had no proper
concern with those who live on cam
pus. Dr. Osborne, however, countered
that "Off-campus er nmunities do
have something to do with this com
munity."
Lovell added he did not want to
make the Health Service a scapegoat
for a bureaucratic problem, but
warned, "A good society tries to give
individuals choices."
Freodom-ResponsibiUty
Roe emphasized the responsibility
that comps with freedom. He said,
"To sav let everyone make his own

choice is not satisfactory." The ques
tion of responsibility for the secular
man, in a period of frustration, calls
for a new sense of order and respon
sibility.
He continued, "We have not begun
to prepare ourselves to accept this
new freedom. If we do not base our
decisions on the authority of the past,
what basis will we use? The past, is a
part of us. The really sensitive per
son does not react in total rejection."
Roe said "no policy" might be best,
to encourage a healthy doctor-patient
relationship, but both Lovell and Os
borne agreed that a stated policy was
better so everyone knew where they
stood. *

have something to do with this com
munity."
Lovell added he did not want to
make the Health Service a scapegoat
for a bureaucratic problem, but
warned, "A good society tries to give
individuals choices."
Freodom-ResponsibiUty
Roe emphasized the responsibility
that comps with freedom. He said,
"To sav let everyone make his own

choice is not satisfactory." The ques
tion of responsibility for the secular
man, in a period of frustration, calls
for a new sense of order and respon
sibility.
He continued, "We have not begun
to prepare ourselves to accept this
new freedom. If we do not base our
decisions on the authority of the past,
what basis will we use? The past, is a
part of us. The really sensitive per
son does not react in total rejection."
Roe said "no policy" might be best,
to encourage a healthy doctor-patient
relationship, but both Lovell and Os
borne agreed that a stated policy was
better so everyone knew where they
stood. *
A panel discussion on oral contra
ceptives at Tresidder last night fo
cused on the role of individual liber
ties and responsibilities in an ordered
society. Panelists were Maurice M.
Osborne, executive director of the
Health Service, Dick Roe, UCCM cam
pus minister, and Victor Lovell, ex
ponent of SSRF views, from Counsel
ing and Testing.
'Contraceptives Not Dangerous'
In his opening remarks, Dr. Os
borne emphasized medical responsi
bility, but admitted "available con
traceptives are by and large not dan
gerous." He also argued that if stu
dents were dependent upon parental
financing, it would seem absurd to
ask the university to do what parents
would not do.
Lovell argued, "The issue at Stan
ford is freedom, not sexual conduct."
He emphasized the need for civil liber
ties because "sex is a matter of in
dividual taste, not morality."
After the recent referendum showed
a 2 to 1 majority in favor of the
Health Service issuing contraceptive
pills to all students requesting them,
Lovell felt that the university com
munity had reached a consensus.
Outside Pressures
He contended outside pressures were
influencing Health Service policy, and
that outside groups had no proper
concern with those who live on cam
pus. Dr. Osborne, however, countered
that "Off-campus er nmunities do
have something to do with this com
munity."
Lovell added he did not want to
make the Health Service a scapegoat
for a bureaucratic problem, but
warned, "A good society tries to give
individuals choices."
