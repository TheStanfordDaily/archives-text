# Davisâ€™ Trumpet To Rock Out Jazz Year End
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The final activities of the Stanford Jazz
Year will take place Sunday and Monday. The
final concert of the year features Miles Davis
and his quintet Sunday in Memorial Audi
torium at 2 p.m.
Today, critic and syndicated columnist Ralph
J. Gleason, consultant to the Jazz Year, will
give a lecture on "The Future of Jazz," in
which he will analyze present trends in jazz,
make some prognostications about the prob
able implications for the music, and sum
marize the aims and achievements of the
Stanford Jazz Year.
Davis, whose performances have been limit
ed in recent months because of prolonged
illness, makes his only Bay Area appearance
of the winter and spring Sunday in Mem Aud.
The trumpeter, consistent winner for the
past decade of every major jazz readers' and
critics' poll, is currently leading what many
consider to be his most exciting combo since
the Davis group that featured John Coltrane
and Cannonball Abberley.
Still Tickets Left
Jazz Year director Rick Bale said there are
still several main floor tickets for the Davis

concert available at the Tresidder box office.
"We're a little surprised we haven't com
pletely sold out," Bale said, "although we ex
pect to early this week, but we're glad that
those who forgot to get seats earlier will still
be able to attend."
Miles Davis has been active and influential
in every major jazz style since the mid-1940'5,
when he played in the bands of Charlie Park
er, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter and Billy
Eckstine.
In 1948, he led two bands in New York,
one a quintet with Kai Winding and Allen
Eager and the other a nine-piece group that
pioneered the "cool" style of jazz.
The nonet, whose members included drum
mer Max Roach, pianist John Lewis, and saxo
phonists Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan, with
arrangements by Davis, Mulligan and Gil
Evans, recorded a Capital LP entitled "Birth
of the Cool." The album, not extremely popu
lar at first, has become one of the largest sell
ing modern jazz recordings in history.
Talented DavLs Alumni
Since the early 1950'5, Davis has led a
quintet or sextet. The 1956-57 version, which

launched the career of tenorist John Coltrane,
and the 1958 sextet, including Coltrane, altoist
Cannonball Adderley and pianist Bill Evans,
recorded several albums now considered small
group classics.
Other alumni of the Davis bands are ten
orists Hank Mobley and George Coleman, pi
anists Red Garland and Wynton Kelly, bassist
Paul Chambers, and drummers Philly Joe
Jones and Jimmy Cobb.
In addition to leading the combos, Davis
continued his association with arranger Gil
Evans with a number of recordings featuring
Davis' trumpet and flugelhorn solos with a
big band background writted by Evans.
The albums (porgy and Bess, Sketches of
Spain, Miles Apart, Quiet Nights) form an im
portant part of jazz big band history, accord
ing to most critics, and can be found in the
record libraries of many listeners who do not
consider themselves jazz devotees.
Won't Fit A Stereotype
Davis, berated by many and applauded by
some for his refusal to cater to the popular
conception of the Negro entertainer, rarely, if
ever, communicates with the audience except

through his music. He has long been a de
fender of the jazz artist's integrity, and has
recently become involved in forming a Jazz
Musicians' Union.
The goals of the union, he says, are to in
sure employment for many more jazzmen, to
provide training workshops for young players,
and to improve conditions in nightclubs hir
ing mainly jazz musicians.
Drummer Is Featured
His current quintet, which will perform
Sunday here, spotlights youthful drummer
Anthony Williams. YVilliams, only 20, has in
fluenced many of the new drummers with
his concepts of freedom within a rhythmic
context. Also prominently featured in the
quintet is pianist Herbie Hancock, composer
of the popular "Watermelon Man" recorded
by Mongo Santamaria, among others.
Davis is scheduled to fly to the West Coast
Saturday, play a college concert in Portland,
perform at Stanford the next day, and then
return to New York.
Tickets for his appearance, on sale at Tres
idder, are priced at $2.50 and $3.50 for Stan
ford students, $3 and $4 for the general public.

pect to early this week, but we're glad that
those who forgot to get seats earlier will still
be able to attend."
Miles Davis has been active and influential
in every major jazz style since the mid-1940'5,
when he played in the bands of Charlie Park
er, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter and Billy
Eckstine.
In 1948, he led two bands in New York,
one a quintet with Kai Winding and Allen
Eager and the other a nine-piece group that
pioneered the "cool" style of jazz.
The nonet, whose members included drum
mer Max Roach, pianist John Lewis, and saxo
phonists Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan, with
arrangements by Davis, Mulligan and Gil
Evans, recorded a Capital LP entitled "Birth
of the Cool." The album, not extremely popu
lar at first, has become one of the largest sell
ing modern jazz recordings in history.
Talented DavLs Alumni
Since the early 1950'5, Davis has led a
quintet or sextet. The 1956-57 version, which

launched the career of tenorist John Coltrane,
and the 1958 sextet, including Coltrane, altoist
Cannonball Adderley and pianist Bill Evans,
recorded several albums now considered small
group classics.
Other alumni of the Davis bands are ten
orists Hank Mobley and George Coleman, pi
anists Red Garland and Wynton Kelly, bassist
Paul Chambers, and drummers Philly Joe
Jones and Jimmy Cobb.
In addition to leading the combos, Davis
continued his association with arranger Gil
Evans with a number of recordings featuring
Davis' trumpet and flugelhorn solos with a
big band background writted by Evans.
The albums (porgy and Bess, Sketches of
Spain, Miles Apart, Quiet Nights) form an im
portant part of jazz big band history, accord
ing to most critics, and can be found in the
record libraries of many listeners who do not
consider themselves jazz devotees.
Won't Fit A Stereotype
Davis, berated by many and applauded by
some for his refusal to cater to the popular
conception of the Negro entertainer, rarely, if
ever, communicates with the audience except

through his music. He has long been a de
fender of the jazz artist's integrity, and has
recently become involved in forming a Jazz
Musicians' Union.
The goals of the union, he says, are to in
sure employment for many more jazzmen, to
provide training workshops for young players,
and to improve conditions in nightclubs hir
ing mainly jazz musicians.
Drummer Is Featured
His current quintet, which will perform
Sunday here, spotlights youthful drummer
Anthony Williams. YVilliams, only 20, has in
fluenced many of the new drummers with
his concepts of freedom within a rhythmic
context. Also prominently featured in the
quintet is pianist Herbie Hancock, composer
of the popular "Watermelon Man" recorded
by Mongo Santamaria, among others.
Davis is scheduled to fly to the West Coast
Saturday, play a college concert in Portland,
perform at Stanford the next day, and then
return to New York.
Tickets for his appearance, on sale at Tres
idder, are priced at $2.50 and $3.50 for Stan
ford students, $3 and $4 for the general public.


MILES DAVIS
The final activities of the Stanford Jazz
Year will take place Sunday and Monday. The
final concert of the year features Miles Davis
and his quintet Sunday in Memorial Audi
torium at 2 p.m.
Today, critic and syndicated columnist Ralph
J. Gleason, consultant to the Jazz Year, will
give a lecture on "The Future of Jazz," in
which he will analyze present trends in jazz,
make some prognostications about the prob
able implications for the music, and sum
marize the aims and achievements of the
Stanford Jazz Year.
Davis, whose performances have been limit
ed in recent months because of prolonged
illness, makes his only Bay Area appearance
of the winter and spring Sunday in Mem Aud.
The trumpeter, consistent winner for the
past decade of every major jazz readers' and
critics' poll, is currently leading what many
consider to be his most exciting combo since
the Davis group that featured John Coltrane
and Cannonball Abberley.

Cannonball Adderley and pianist Bill Evans,
recorded several albums now considered small
group classics.
Other alumni of the Davis bands are ten
orists Hank Mobley and George Coleman, pi
anists Red Garland and Wynton Kelly, bassist
Paul Chambers, and drummers Philly Joe
Jones and Jimmy Cobb.
In addition to leading the combos, Davis
continued his association with arranger Gil
Evans with a number of recordings featuring
Davis' trumpet and flugelhorn solos with a
big band background writted by Evans.
The albums (porgy and Bess, Sketches of
Spain, Miles Apart, Quiet Nights) form an im
portant part of jazz big band history, accord
ing to most critics, and can be found in the
record libraries of many listeners who do not
consider themselves jazz devotees.
Won't Fit A Stereotype
Davis, berated by many and applauded by
some for his refusal to cater to the popular
conception of the Negro entertainer, rarely, if
ever, communicates with the audience except

through his music. He has long been a de
fender of the jazz artist's integrity, and has
recently become involved in forming a Jazz
Musicians' Union.
The goals of the union, he says, are to in
sure employment for many more jazzmen, to
provide training workshops for young players,
and to improve conditions in nightclubs hir
ing mainly jazz musicians.
Drummer Is Featured
His current quintet, which will perform
Sunday here, spotlights youthful drummer
Anthony Williams. YVilliams, only 20, has in
fluenced many of the new drummers with
his concepts of freedom within a rhythmic
context. Also prominently featured in the
quintet is pianist Herbie Hancock, composer
of the popular "Watermelon Man" recorded
by Mongo Santamaria, among others.
Davis is scheduled to fly to the West Coast
Saturday, play a college concert in Portland,
perform at Stanford the next day, and then
return to New York.
Tickets for his appearance, on sale at Tres
idder, are priced at $2.50 and $3.50 for Stan
ford students, $3 and $4 for the general public.
