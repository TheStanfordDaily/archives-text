# LSD: The Problems – – – And The Promise
## Paulsen: Professional Analysis Must Precede 'Trip' To Insure Safe Return 
### KIRK HANEN 
THE DAILY: Dr. Paulsen, what type of
personality is most clearly associated with the
LSD or Marijuana user?
PAULSEN: It may be easier to describe the
type of personality he wouldn't be. One, he
wouldn't be a reactionary or ultra-conserva
tive. Two, he would be willing to see and have
experienced some degree of flexibility in his
past. Three, he would probably be an indivi
dual who wouldn't support "Johnson's War."
Four, he would probably be an individual who
would be against rigidity and inflexibility in
education here at Stanford, or any place else,
and who realizes that society is just going to
have to change, and that perhaps LSD offers
one vehicle of facilitating such change.
THE DAILY: Have you had any experience
with LSD yourself?
PAULSEN: Yes.
THE DAILY: Would you care to describe
this?
PAULSEN: O.K. The first—and only—time
I labored under the "delusion" that LSD had
something to do with creativp processes. Since
I'm interested in art and paint a bit, I thought
I'd enhance my latent ability—which needs
enhancement —by taking LSD. Nothing much
happened in that direction. What actually oc
curred was the development of an extremely
intense degree of feeling that I'd never ex
perienced before without the use of LSD. And,
secondly, an awareness of a complete disre
gard of the external environment and a com
plete preoccupation — an intensely abnormal
preoccupation—with myself and the processes
of thinking and feeling in myself.
The usual distortions of vision and sound
were, of course, prevalent. These are the "gar
den variety" effects of the drug and are usual
ly experienced.
But, more important, the problem has to do
with whether any insight is developed into
the individual. I didn't experience this phe
nomenon. However, there are any number of
articles in the LSD literature that contend—
and even demand—that you believe that very
insightful results come out of LSD. Well, I
didn't have this experience. On the other hand,
I only took it once.
THE DAILY: It's been said that the greater
the availability of LSD, the greater the addic
tion rate. What is your reaction to this?
PAULSEN: If addiction rate means the ease
with which one can repeatedly have the ex
perience—yes, I agree. If this means the more
it's available, the more it would increase the
numbers of users of it, then I don't know that
that would be so—any more than the student
body would be more inclined toward alcohol
ism just because more alcohol is available.
LSD is readily available because of the illicit
import situation. I would think the societal
reaction to prohibition—and antagonism to in
dividuals who are trying to be different—is
the prime motive which may lead to greater
usage. But again, it would be the individuals
who would be against rigidification in society
who would be tempted to use the drug.
The other problem with using the word "ad
diction" is that I'm not in a position to say
categorically whether not taking the drug re
sults in unpleasant or negative physiological
symptoms as one would have with heroine or
demerol.
On the other hand, as with any drug — in

eluding love—there can be a tendency toward
habituation. To that extent, LSD can be ha
bituating. But, on the whole, I don't classify
LSD as an addictive drug.
THE DAILY: What experiences have you
had with patients who have taken excessive
does of LSD?
PAULSEN: We see students who take not
so much an excessive dose, which would then
be called an "over-dose," but who take LSD
repeatedly. The range would be somewhere
around 8-10, or in the upper limits, 15 inci
dents, experiences, or "trips"—whatever you
want to call them. This, then, would put the
individual in the precarious position of devel
oping negative effects or results from the
LSD. Of course, what is interesting is that it
often has to go beyond even this number of
episodes before the individual may become
aware that he is experiencing negative or de
leterious effects of LSD. Of course with some,
negative effects are not accessible to knowl
edge or insight.
In my experience, the greatest number ol
trips by one student was 41. This individual
was so decompensated that medical leave was
necessary. I've had no further contact with
him since he left the area.
THE DAILY: What effect, if any, do you
think the "Open-Liquor policy recently adopt
ed by the Board of Trustees will have on the
LSD situation at Stanford?
PAULSEN: I don't think it will have any
effect at all, anymore than prohibiting LSD
itself could—because that isn't the problem.
The problem is: "Why?" and "For what rea
sons?". I'm not so much interested in how
many people take LSD, but I'm somewhat
disconcerted that many individuals are not
willing or able to discuss taking the drug
before it's taken.
The main reason here is that some people
see LSD as a way of resolving, partially or
predominantly, emotional problems. Three
predominant reactions to LSD can be dis
cussed, in my opinion. First of all, that in
which the drug would have no lasting effect
on the individual; perhaps one group—maybe
30 per cent—would react so. Another group—
also perhaps. 30 per cent—would manifest bet
ter function or become more insightful,
thought again the data is questionable. But
the remainder may become impaired or even
psychotic. And, occasionally, an individual who
is quite stable and has no history of moderate
or severe emotional problems, will take the
drug and have to be hospitalized for periods
varying from two to six months. It would be
helpful to know exactly what happens in those
cases. It would seem that LSD will not pre
dominantly resolve emotional problems. But
unfortunately, this is one of the prime moti
vations for which some people take LSD.
THE DAILY: How might such hang-ups" —
if you'll forgive the non-medical terminology
—be avoided?
PAULSEN: As in the cast just mentioned,
it would be better if the potential user had
some sort of professional assessment, or, at
least, discussion to determine what likelihood
there would be of his having a severe reac
tion.
This reminds me of research we did in 1959
with four psycho-tropic drugs—of which LSD
was one. It was my job to assess personality

Editor's Note: With unqualified
speculation as to the nature and
effects of LSD seemingly at an
all-time high, The Daily has in
vited Drs. James Paulsen and Ed
win Lipinski, both clinical psy
chiatrists at Cowell Health Cen
ter, to attempt to clarify certain
stereotypes attached to LSD.

and the desirability of having certain subjects
participate in the program. I rejected one-half
of the volunteers because we couldn't take
the risk of deleterious reactions in those al
ready somewhat unstable. Of course, in this
experimental study the volunteers who were
accepted had four different experiences with
four diffrent drugs. There were no "violent"
reactions, psychoses, or hospitalizations. In
one subject, who became extremely anxious
and tense, we terminated the episode with the
injection of a potent tranquilizer.
THE DAILY: Would you care to comment
on the Marijuana situation?
PAULSEN: I think it is an over-rated drug,
an over-emphasized problem, and something
that is not worth a great deal of anguish.
What is necessary is to diminish hypocrisy
and unjust legislation regarding the drug.
Marijuana, itself, I don't consider danger
ous. While I have heard of deaths from as
pirin—not from over-doses, but from ordinary
does —I've never heard of anyone dying from
"Pot."
THE DAILY: In conclusion, what advice do
you have for the prospective user of LSD?
PAULSEN: If you have the "urge' 'to try
LSD, for whatever reasons, be pleased to re
member that the person who is a psychiatrist
to himself has a fool for a patient.
