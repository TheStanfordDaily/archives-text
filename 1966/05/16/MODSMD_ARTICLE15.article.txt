# Lipinski: Science Has No Documented Estimate Of Current LSD Use In U.S.
## 
### 
THE DAILY: Three witnesses recently told
the Senate Narcotics Subcommittee that re
ports of widespread use of LSD are "exag
gerated." Do you agree with this?
LIPINSKI: It's hard to know what they
mean by "widespread". The statistics that are
available in this area are extremely question
able. On the other hand, there's no doubt that
on an impressionistic basis, there's increasing
use of LSD in the general population and this
seems to be particularily true in the college
age group.
THE DAILY: A former distributor of LSD
on the Stanford campus estimated in a Daily
article that LSD usage among graduates is as
high as 20 per cent, with that of undergradu
ates running at about 10 per cent. Does this
estimate sound credible to you?
LIPINSKI: This relates back to my former
statement that the statistics in this field are
extremely questionable. In the main, especial
ly with the current legal status of LSD, peo
ple are quite non-revealing of their use of the
drug. Therefore, it's hard to gather any mean
ingful data.
Furthermore, we read all sorts of state
ments about this from people who say that
one per cent of the student population is using
it to those who place the estimate at 35 per
cent. All of these estimates, to me, sound
questionable. A researcher at the University of
Florida stated that they had no problem with
LSD there. So, it's hard to accept any figures.
THE DAILY: No doubt you've had experi
ence with persons who have had excessive
doses of LSD. Could you describe some of
these?
LIPINSKI: The problem isn't so much with
excessive doses, because it's hard to say what
an excessive dose is. On the other hand there
have been a large number of people in the
last couple of years who have had bad "trips,"
and this has been on the basis of 75 micro
grams to 1200-plus micrograms. To begin with,
the people constitute a highly biased sample;
they've had bad "trips"—that's why they've
come to see me.
Secondly, I don't for one minute suppose
that those whom I see constitute the entire
sample of those who are having bad "trips."
In terms of the ones who have a negative or
untoward reaction to LSD, the reactions vary
all the way from panic state to full-blown
psychosis.
THE DAILY: Would you care to comment
on any attempted cases of suicide.
LIPINSKI: A great many of the people who
have a negative reaction tend to experience a
period of time following the bad "trip" in
which they're depressed and suicidal ideas oc
cupy much of their thought.
With regard to specific suicide attempts, I
have not had anybody who has attempted, but
many have had a very difficult time control
ling these impulses.
I have indirect information that a person
who did commit suicide was presumably an
LSD user, but this is entirely hearsay.
When I indicated before that large num
bers of people have untoward reactions to
LSD, I would expect that the number exper
iencing such negative reactions is small in ab
solute terms. But when we get 20-plus pa
tients with severe negative reactions in less
than two years, that's a lot of people to us.

THE DAILY: What sort of personality type
is typified by the LSD or Marijuana user?
LIPINSKI: To begin with, this bears on
some current research that I am engaged in.
I am not aware of any personality type as
such, but I'm certainly trying to find out if
we can define parameters of personality or
any other parameters which would help us to
understand not so much who uses LSD, but
who may have a bad "trip." This research is
not as yet completed.
Secondly, I am not at all sure that it is wise
to group together Marijuana users and people
who use LSD. A great number of people who
have used LSD have also used Marijuana in
the past. Frequently these same persons have
smoked cigarettes and they've also used alco
hol.
THE DAILY: Are there any "good" reasons
for taking LSD?
LIPINSKI: If good reasons mean therapeu
tic reasons, there is divided opinion on this.
A great many people take so-called "polar"
stands. Some say it has no place at all in any
form of therapy, while others say this is the
main adjunct to psycho-therapeutic treatment.
A number of people have used LSD for a pe
riod of years in the treatment of chronic al
coholism.
With respect to the use of LSD in the treat
ment of a wide variety of psychological ill
nesses, again we encounter much literature
on its use in varied parts of the world. There
is no real agreement on who it benefits and
who it doesn't.
It seems to depend a great deal on the rela
tionship between the doctor and his patient,
and the specific technique he applies in the
use of LSD even more than the drug itself.
THE DAILY: What effect, if any, do you
foresee from legislation pending in the States
which would make LSD illegal or restrict it's
use?
LIPINSKI: I am afraid that legislation
which would restrict use of LSD would prob
ably have a great many detrimental effects.
My own personal feeling is that it would not
decrease the use of LSD but merely tend to
increase the panic of those who have bad
"trips" and realize that they can't go any
place for help for fear of being reported.
The impression that I have and that amongst
other medical people who have had experience
with LSD in its multiple forms, is that it
should not be restricted or made non-available,
but that it be used in a controlled setting.
A controlled setting seems to mean that a
patient will have undergone a preparatory pe
riod; that a working relationship will be
formed with the doctor; that the environment
will be suitable to decrease the incidence of
bad responses; and that should the patient
want the experience terminated, it can be
terminated medically.
THE DAILY: Do you think doctors should
be compelled to report LSD users in compli
ance with a recent Food and Drug Administra
tion order?
LIPINSKI: Absolutely not.
I feel that if I had to report those who use
LSD, I'd have to report many other people
who talk to me who are engaged in a variety
of other illegal activities — not the least of
which is fornication.
