"In Northern Califor
nia," said Ruff, "we have
had over 3,700 students

10,000 since we started in
Northern California 5
years ago. To the best of
our knowledge, there is
no school in this field
serving so many stu

The Bay Area Institute
alone has six fully equip
ped schools employing 26
highly trained teachers
and support personnel.
Course constantly
improved
Teaching methods are
continually being refined.
For example, in the last
six months, after several
years of research and ex
perimentation by Evelyn
Wood, a whole new train
ing program was insti
tuted, giving improved
results, with heavy em
phasis on technical read
ing and study tech
niques.
As a result of these new
methods, the average
graduate Is now reading
faster than 1,500 words
per minute.

"The average executive or
professional man Is simply
swamped by the high vol
ume of reading material
that passes across his desk
daily." This comment was
recently made by John Man
son, Director of Industrial
Development for Reading
Dynamics of Northern Cali
fornia. Mr. Manson Is re
sponsible for scheduling

ing us to train their entire
departments In this new
form of reading," he said.
