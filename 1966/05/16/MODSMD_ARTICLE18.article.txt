# Institute Director Receives Highest National Award
## Reading Machines Made Obsolete 
### 
One of the major prob
lems faced by the teacher
of fast reading, when the
method is machine ori
ented, is that most stu
dents lose the acquired
skill shortly after leaving
the course.
The machine acts as a
pacer, forcing the eye to
move rapidly down the
page. When the machine
is no longer available,
the student tends to re
vert to his previous read
ing patterns.
The Wood Method
teaches the student to
use his hand as a pacer.
As his pacer is always
with him, he can retain
and constantly improve
his acquired skill.


Evelyn Wood, Founder of Reading Dynamics, congratulates Howard
J. Ruff, Northern California Institute Director, at a recent national
convention, on receiving the award for outstanding Reading Dy
namics Institute of 1965.
