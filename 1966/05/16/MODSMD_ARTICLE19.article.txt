# Evelyn Wood, Reading Dynamics Founder, Stresses Comprehension
## 
### 
"Reading is a waste of time, slow or fast, if you don't
understand what you are reading," stated Evelyn
Wood at a recent teacher training conference. "If
you aren't comprehending, you aren't reading."
Mrs. Wood was also critical of skimming techniques
commonly used in speed reading courses, and in
formed her teachers that their students must increase
comprehension at the sama time they are achieving
high speeds. She said, "Skipping words is dangerous,
as you don't know whether or not you have skipped
a word which could change the whole meaning of the
sentence." "You read five times faster,"

she pointed out, "no t by
reading every fifth word, but
by reading five times as
many words in the same
amount of time. It is impos
sible to tell which words to
skip or disregard until you
have seen them all and de
termined their relative im
portance and mean in g."
Mrs. Wood emphasized that
using her technique of rapid
reading, every word on the
page is perceived.
