# Rapid Reading Course Signing Summer Classes
## 
### 
With more than 10,000 graduates in the Bay Area
and more than 150,000 across the Nation, Evelyn
Wood Reading Dynamics Institute has announced a
series of summer classes starting in June. A limited
number of classes is also being offered in San Fran
cisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Palo Alto, Salinas, and
Monterey in May.

The Reading Dynamics In
stitute reports that the av
erage reading speed of grad
uates is above 1,500 words
per minute. If students can
not at least triple their pres
ent reading rates with good
comprehension, they are of
fered a full tuition refund.
Less than 1.5% have asked
for the refund during the 5
years the course has been
offered here.
School teacher makes
discovery
Evelyn Wood first observed
dynamic reading 18 years
ago when a professor at the
University of Utah read her
term paper at an amazing
6,000 words per minute.
Mrs. Wood's curiosity caused
her to look for other excep
tional readers, and over the
next few years, she found 50
people who could read faster
than 1,500 words per minute,
with fine comprehension,
outstanding recall, and great
satisfaction in reading,
She was now sure It was

i possible to read faster than
anyone had thought, but the
question of how these peo
ple did it was not yet an
swered. It took 18 years of
toil and research, working
with "natural" fast readers,
before she began to find
the answers. Her quest led
her to experiment with stu
students at the Jordan High
School In Jordan, Utah,
where she was the English
teacher and girl's counselor.
Eventually a technique was
developed whereby the aver
age student was able to
learn to read 3 to 10 times
faster.
She taught her method at
the University of Utah for
three years, refining It even
more. Further studies were
conducted at the University
of Delaware, and the first
Reading Dynamics Institute
was opened in Washington,
D.C. In September, 195 9.
Since that time Institutes
have been opened all over
the country, and many au
thorities have accepted Mrs.
Wood's basic conclusions.
