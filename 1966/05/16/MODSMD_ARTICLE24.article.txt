I Until this year, Lee Ann Taylor had been relegated
in school to the "slow reader" groups and main
tained average grades only with maximum effort.
After completing the Reading Dynamics course,
however, her reading speed increased from 250 to
3,000 words per minute, and she improved from
average to honor grades. She is now Student Body
Secretary of Contra Costa College. Through her
enthusiastic endorsement, a number of her friends
, have registered for the course.
