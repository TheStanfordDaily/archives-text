Dr. Robert Hutchins, former President
of the University of Chicago and
founder of the Great Books Program,
once said, "To destroy our Western
Civilization, we don't have to burn all
the books. We merely have to leave
them unread for one generation." The
principal problem we have to face to
day, as the frontiers of human knowl
edge are being thrust back, is that this
knowledge is being committed to print,
and it must be read before it can be
used.
Advances have been made in almost
every field of human endeavor. We
run faster, fly higher, and dive deep
er, but we still read at the same speed
that our grand-parents did: 300 words
per minute. With the discovery of
Reading Dynamics, this is no longer
necessary.
The whole philosophy of learning
could be changed if every person in
this country would take the time to

use his dormant capabilities for faster
reading. No industry could use the
same standards and techniques it used
25 years ago and expect to continue
in existence. Yet, we remain satisfied
with the same old reading standards
and techniques.
This would be fine if there were no
better technique available, but a ma
jor breakthrough in this field has oc
curred. Victor Hugo said, "There is
nothing in this world so powerful as
an idea whose time has come." Read
ing Dynamics is such an idea.
Some day our national survival may
depend on how well we are able to
utilize our greatest resource: the
minds of our young people. The "new
math" was first published in very
much its present form in the 1890's.
Do we have to wait 70 years for each
valuable new concept to gain accept
ance? Not if we can help it!
