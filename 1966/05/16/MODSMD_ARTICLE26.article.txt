# Cal Crews Swamped in Card Wake
## The
						Stanford Crew 
### DAN CABRERA 
With a performance unequaled
in a half-century, the Stanford
Crew yesterday rowed Cal un
derwater before a cheering
crowd of three hundred in the
Annual Big Row.
Stanford has not accomplished
a clean sweep against Cal since
1916.

By winning all five of their
races against the Bears, the
crew exceeded the total number
of Stanford wins in Big Rows
of the past decade.
Sun, a perfectly blue sky and
calm water added up to ideal
racing conditions and all shells
performed at peak.
Giving some indication of

things to come, the third frosh
boat smothered the St. Mary's
squad by nearly five lengths in
the first race of the day, cross
ing the finish line over twenty
seconds ahead of their oppo
nents.
Although a last, minute substi
tution took place because of an
illness, the slot being filled by
Roger Sullivan, the third Var
sity shell handled Cal by a
length. Starting even went
ahead by lVs lengths midway
through the race, Stanford
stopped gaining ground for a
while at the 1500 meter point.
Hiking their stroke up to 38 per
minute at the finish, the Indian
oarsmen held their lead and put
the first feather of the day in
coach Will Condon's cap.
Maintaining a half-shell lead
most of the way on the 2000
meter course, the second frosh
boat pulled out at the finish
when the Cal coxswain seemed
to lose his bearing and swerved

off a straight line. Stanford fin
ished ahead by five seconds, a
Ilength victory.
The strength of the Cal JV
boat was well-known to our
oarsmen when they took the
water yesterday, and they knew
they would have a tough race.
Because the Varsity boat lost
Tim Cowles Friday when he cut
off the tip of his finger, Carl
Langley from the JV boat was
moved up to replace him.
The switch did not destroy the
balance necessary against Cal,
as the JV shell pulled out a a i
length win in one of the most
thrilling contests of the morn
ing.
The JV boat "Sam Schwaba
eher" was able to efface a three
seat lead Cal held after the 300
meter mark and came on strong
approaching the line, winning by
the tight-stomached margin of
three seconds.
"Lemon's Lunch" Served
The loss of his favored JV's
set Cal coach Jim Lemon's gum
chewing rate up at least ten a
minute, and by ten in the morn
ing, "Lemon's Lunch" had be
gun. Keyed for this race all sea
son, the Stanford crew coined
the phrase in anticipation of
proving to their coach Will Con
don that his efforts have not
"gone out the other ear."
The Indian freshmen were on
a rampage of their own, having
already won two races in the
meet, and when the first boat
backed into starting position,
muscles were tauter than an E
string.
Every stroke counted because
of the even positions over the
entire 2000 meters, Stanford had
met. after that photo - finish
earned their fifth set of Cal
jerseys in the Big Row. The win
ning margin was a scant half a

second, in fact, over a course
time of 6:06.5.
The sourest course of "Lem
on's Lunch" was yet to be
served, however, as the Cal crew
backed into the starting posi
tion with an ego-building nine
year winning streak to uphold.
When the starter had finished
barking "Ready. Ready (o row.
Row!", the Stanford crew left
their stomach butterflies at the
blocks and immediately grabbed
a quarter-length over the Bears.
Trying to even up the margin at
the S(K)-meter mark, the Cal
crew went into a power stroke
but was unable to gain the lead.
250 meters from the finish,
Stanford stretched their advan
tage to a healthy 1H lengths,
and muscled it up to twice that
margin in a teeth-gritting twen
ty-stroke wire-approach.
Condon Dunked
With the finishing touch com
pleted in their Big Row sweep,
the Stanford crew went under
standably BEAR CAT HOG
WIN NUTS, mobbed and hugged
their coach Will Condon, threw
their coxswains into the bay and
then dunked Condon himself.
Cal Coach Jim Lemon compli
mented Condon on his fine crew,
noting that "all we collected out
of the day were two broken
oars."
Commenting on the race, Con
don said "The fact that the oth
ers boats all won probably add
ed that final length to the Var
sity win." The Varsity also es
tablished a new course record,
turning in a time of 5:56.5.
Western Sprints Next
Next Saturday Condon will
take three boats — the first
Frosh, the JV's and the Varsity
—to the Western Intercollegiate
Sprint in Vallejo. Heading the
list of grudges-to-be-settled is
Washington, the only team that
has beat the Varsity ail season.
