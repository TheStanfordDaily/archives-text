# WASHINGTON STARS
## Varsity Tramples Alumni 
### 
Stanford's spring football
came to a climatic finish on Sat
urday with the varsity pounding
out a 41-10 victory over the
alumni.
For the most part, however,
the alumni squad was composed
of varsity players who were sent
in to relieve the ailing grads.
Gene Washington and Mark
Marquess led the successful var
sity aggregration with Washing
ton winding up for two long
scoring passes to halfback Bob
Blunt who also had a fine day.
Blunt, however, did not do any
running from his halfback spot
and was used mainly as a decoy
at flanker. He spent about half
of last season recovering from

a knee injury.
Washington'e soft lobs to
Blunt highlighted the contest,
although Tim Abena and Dave
Lewis ran well on occassion.
Lewis ran for 47 yards for a
5.1 average. He also scored a
touchdown but still had his
troubles hanging onto the pig
skin fumbling twice.
The game began on a sour
note when Washington fumbled
on the first play and Glenn

Myers recovered lor the Alumni
on the 19. Dick Norman then
connected with Dale Rubin for
the first score of the tilt.
Washington knotted the score
near the end of the first quarter
with a 25 yard touchdown bomb
to Blunt.
Washington ran for 74 yards
and completed four of five
passes for 90 more. The varsity
gained 412, 281 by rushing.
