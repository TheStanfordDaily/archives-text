# Stanford Trackmen Outshone In Relays
## 
### 
Though sometimes buried in
Olympic-class competition, Stan
ford trackmen still turned in
some good performances in
weekend relays at Los Angeles
(Coliseum) and Fresno (West
Coast).
With seven of their men run
ning on five hours' Bleep after
Friday night's meet in Los An
geles, the Cards scored 22 points
at Fresno to finish fourth
among colleges in the open divi
sion.
Even the better Stanford ef
forts went largely unnoticed,
both because of the numerous
record and near-record perform
ances elsewhere and because the
Indians not unexpectedly failed
to get a first place.
The sprint relay team, praised
by Coach Payton Jordan for
general improvement, notably
on the exchanges, settled for a

second and third at Los Angeles
and a fourth at Fresno.

twice by USC's Gary Carlsen,
threw the discus over 186 feet
in going unplaced at Los An
geles and was second among
collegians, fifth overall, with

ing to place, ran another fine

Though sometimes buried in
Olympic-class competition, Stan
ford trackmen still turned in
some good performances in
weekend relays at Los Angeles
(Coliseum) and Fresno (West
Coast).
With seven of their men run
ning on five hours' Bleep after
Friday night's meet in Los An
geles, the Cards scored 22 points
at Fresno to finish fourth
among colleges in the open divi
sion.
Even the better Stanford ef
forts went largely unnoticed,
both because of the numerous
record and near-record perform
ances elsewhere and because the
Indians not unexpectedly failed
to get a first place.
The sprint relay team, praised
by Coach Payton Jordan for
general improvement, notably
on the exchanges, settled for a

second and third at Los Angeles
and a fourth at Fresno.

Forbes and Larry Quest a d

wind-aided 9.6 was good for fifth

ly caught Rivers of New Mexico
and Jones of UCLA as well.

twice by USC's Gary Carlsen,
threw the discus over 186 feet
