# Netters Third In AAWU Meet
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis squad
boat Cal Saturday by the nar
rowest of margins to take third
place in the AAWU Champion
ships behind USC and host
UCLA. A first-round 9-0 shutout
against Washington gave the
Tribe a shot at USC's Trojans,
but the Southlanders were too
strong.
In the consolation bracket Jim
Beste regained the form which
has made him one of America's
top players in crushing Cal's
Chuck Darley, 6-1, 6-0. Darley
had beaten Beste in three prior
meetings this year
Brian Leek and Craig Baise
both lost, but John McCabe beat
Cal's Ron Batchelder. Jamie
Carroll won easily at fifth sin
gles, and John McPherson de
feated Jan Kucera to give the
Cards an enviable 4-2 lead with
only doubles play remaining.
Beste and Leek lost in straight
sets at first doubles, though, and
McPherson and McCabe dropped
a long three-setter. The match
was finally clinched by Carroll
and Baise, who combined for a
three set victory at second dou
bles.
