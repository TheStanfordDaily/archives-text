# The 						Open-House Conflict
## 
### 
Legislature passed into law Thursday eve
ning a bill which, by liberalizing overly-restric
tive regulations on open-house hours, should
help to humanize the campus.
There is, however, a hitch to it. The bill
created a conflict between ASSU law and a
University policy which, since a crackdown
two years ago, permits each living group a
total of about ten hours on two specified days
during which visitors of the opposite sex may
enter a dormitory room. The Legislature's bill
will allow individual living groups to set open
house hours for an unlimited amount of time
within the periods of noon to midnight on
weekdays and 10 a.m. until 2:30 a.m. on week
ends.
The change was based on a study begun
Autumn Quarter by a subcommittee of the Leg
islature's Student Affairs Committee. In Jan
uary the subcommittee conducted a poll which
showed students overwhelmingly in favor of a
liberalized policy. At the same time, the ad
ministration's Student Affairs and Services
Committee took up the question, and promised
a report at the end of Winter Quarter. The
committee, however, is still bogged down in
bureaucracy, and reportedly will produce either

no report at all or one that ignores the senti
ments of the student body.
The administrative arguments against lib
eralization of open house hours seem to be
two. The first is that more frequent visitors
would interfere with individual privacy. In
contrast, the Legislature's poll, which, inci
dentally, was conducted with the aid of the
Registrar's Office and also that of A 1 Abrams,
a graduate student in statistics, showed that stu
dents overwhelmingly felt a liberalized policy
would have little or no effect on their privacy.
The second argument is that the administration
would like to bring the matter before the Board
of Trustees, but is reluctant to do so at the pres
ent time. We would reply that reluctance is no
way to deal with a reluctant Board, and more
over, that open house hours should not be the
concern of a group which knows little or no
thing of student attitudes and feelings.
The Committee of 15 reportedly will discuss
the conflict when it meets today. We urge the
Committee to reject the arguments of the bu
reaucracy and recommend that the University
go along with a very reasonable and well
thought-out change.

enter a dormitory room. The Legislature's bill
will allow individual living groups to set open
house hours for an unlimited amount of time
within the periods of noon to midnight on
weekdays and 10 a.m. until 2:30 a.m. on week
ends.
The change was based on a study begun
Autumn Quarter by a subcommittee of the Leg
islature's Student Affairs Committee. In Jan
uary the subcommittee conducted a poll which
showed students overwhelmingly in favor of a
liberalized policy. At the same time, the ad
ministration's Student Affairs and Services
Committee took up the question, and promised
a report at the end of Winter Quarter. The
committee, however, is still bogged down in
bureaucracy, and reportedly will produce either

no report at all or one that ignores the senti
ments of the student body.
The administrative arguments against lib
eralization of open house hours seem to be
two. The first is that more frequent visitors
would interfere with individual privacy. In
contrast, the Legislature's poll, which, inci
dentally, was conducted with the aid of the
Registrar's Office and also that of A 1 Abrams,
a graduate student in statistics, showed that stu
dents overwhelmingly felt a liberalized policy
would have little or no effect on their privacy.
The second argument is that the administration
would like to bring the matter before the Board
of Trustees, but is reluctant to do so at the pres
ent time. We would reply that reluctance is no
way to deal with a reluctant Board, and more
over, that open house hours should not be the
concern of a group which knows little or no
thing of student attitudes and feelings.
The Committee of 15 reportedly will discuss
the conflict when it meets today. We urge the
Committee to reject the arguments of the bu
reaucracy and recommend that the University
go along with a very reasonable and well
thought-out change.
