# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## Exploring The Inhumanities 
### JOEL KUGELMASS 
(Editor's note: This is the eighth in a
leisurely series of articles on education at
Stanford.)

We are now in an age, surprisingly
enough, when many, many people can read
and when there is far too much to be read.
This fact is in itself remarkable, as are the
many attendant social implications, not all
of which are cheering.
However, we ought to make the more im
portant observation that general literacy
has not had nearly the intellectual ramifi
cations we would hope to see.
One particular consequence, especially rel
evant to the modern university, is a growth
in our culture of what I will call the "in
humanities."
Humanism And Its Appearance
At this time in the socio-cultural con
tinuum the discriplincs which compose the
humanities have become separated from
their historical and rightful end of man's
self understanding and of the meaning and
import of the human existence.
Coincidentally, those people who support
and invest the humanities with their own
imagination and intellect have often failed
to develop the humanism which gives sig
nificance to works of literature, philosophy,
art, or music. Instead, they put their at
tention to grades or to securing a position
in the university, be they student or teach
-er.
The personal and intellectual involvement
in the humanities, which characterizes hu
manism, is giving up its ghost; humanism
has come to mean socialization into the
academic institution.
The disciplines within this "new human
ism," the inhumanities, appear from a sup
erficial perspective identical with the hu
manities, just as the post-literate man—a
man whose parents could read— with his
lan Flemming tucked neatly in his glove
compartment, looks very different from the
preliterate.
The Works And The Workers
The body of writing which grounds the
humanist and the inhumanist disciplines are
the same; Jacque Barzun's fine essay,
"Meditations on the Literature of Spying,"
which 1 shall quote later, proves, for ex
ample, that the modern critic is not con
fined to study of the great works.
Students are far more catholic, hearing
Bach in Music I during the morning, and
"Roll over Beethoven" during the evening.
The issue here is not that of classical music
versus rock and roll, but the damning di
chotomy between what we study by neces
sity and what we read through desire.
What in fact distinguishes these post-liter
ates from the Medieval Christian humanist
or even the Frenchman of letters is not
what they study, but how they study, not
where they study (be it university or public
library) but why they study.
This distinction becomes easier to grasp
as the historical gap between the pursuit of
the humanities and the proliferation of
the inhumanities widens.
Approaches
The inhumanist concerns himself with
literature, art, music, or philosophy usually
for one of two characteristic reasons: Either
he finds those subjects entertaining, and
being caught within a recent analystic at
mosphere which views fun as an unaccept
able final cause, he legitimizes his pleasure
by translating it into a critical position; he
talks about what he does, rather than sim
ply doing it.
At his worst, this kind of student will
often, when being "candid," claim that in
terpretation actually destroys the work and

the possibility of our involvement within.
He fails to see that criticism is not para
phrase.
The other motivation, sympathetic to the
first, I call the Sir Hillary Stance. A moun
tain-climber of artistic heights, he thinks
about the humanities because "they are
there."
Occasionally this arm-chair mountaineer
formalizes his activity by invoking the "art
for art's sake" argument, in contrast to the
long-standing "art for man's sake" human
ism of previous intellectual epochs.
Importantly, even when the former self
justification is taken without qualification,
it does not by its nature imply that "critic
ism for criticism's sake" can survive; sur
vive, that is, except in the context of to
day's tolerant apathy.
We must remember that paradoxically,
the contemporary writer yearns for publica
tion more than ever before, and the sub
sequent social acceptance of his work stands
as one of his major commitments.
Lower And Upper Depths
I do not mean to decry either pleasure or
the spirit of adventure, both of which are
concurrent throughout our history with the
highest humanistic efforts. But, within the
realm of fundamentalities, especially those
which express values, our enslavement to
those two motives has taken the toll.
The humanities have been transformed
into the inhumanities, disciplines whose con
nections to Man on the deepest level are
empty and courtly formalities, or at best
accidental associations.
Upwards, among the efforts of any of the
Estates at the university, this isolation pre
sents itself in the rejection of genuine
interdisciplinary spirit and in the ironic dil
letantism of the specialist.
Humanism And The University Structure
We are surely tired of that criticism, but
it persists and persists being just. This situa
tion reaches full seriousness, when, as Tal
cott Parsons wrote last year (I)aedulus,
Winter) the separation between disciplines
devoted by subject to the conduct of hu

man life and those to "pure knowledge" be
comes "institutionalized in the distinction
between arts and science faculties and the
applied 'professional' faculties."
The University structure now promotes
the self-destructive humanities we have
been mourning.
The Post-Literate Humors
If we are not to fall into the inhumanities
in our criticisms, we must remember that
whatever disciplines are popular today, they
are the work of men, of in particular, the
post-literate.
As Barzun writes, the espisonage story
satisfies us in its illusion of reality, of
pointless death, of lives revolving about be
trayal, of man running scared, scared,
scared. The man who leads this modern life
finally "is imperturbable not by tempera
ment or by philosophy, but from expertise."
Elsewhere we meet another description
by Louis .Rubin, not of a fictional character,
but of the modern student. He is often
"fact-grubbing, unimaginative, uncritical. . .
the kind of person, who, with less intelli
gence, is to be found behind the counter
of a bank . . ."
Ability And Remoteness
If we may combine the current temper
with our omnipresent technical proficiency,
we discover a Mind which can read too
easily, which can analyse, criticize, para
phrase, and dispatch any object to some slot
in the Reader's Guide with total detach
ment and facility.
Is he not a man who can read too well,
read even with closed eyes and distracted
mind, read with such infidelity and aliena
tion that he is indistinguishable from the
ancient scribe copying works which he
does not understand, presenting a scene like
that of the preliterate using books as
kindling?
But, then, that earlier man used books
to preserve himself—are we nearly as
creative?
Perhaps, ultimately, the world will not
end with a bang, nor a whimper, but a
snore.
