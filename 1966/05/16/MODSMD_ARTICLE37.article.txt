# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Alumni Support Jordan 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As an alumnus of Stanford
and a resident of the area since
1935, I have always enjoyed the
school sports program. Year
after year it has been a real
pleasure to watch the clean-cut
Stanford student perform to his
utmost.
Now suddenly because some
character desires to rebel
against tradition and authority,
Coach Jordan and the Athletic
Department are given a nega
tive press.
I have always been of the Im
pression that if one has a desire
to be a member of a group, or
ganization, or team, he must
meet certain stipulations rela
tive to training, grooming, etc.
The organization so specifies,
not the individual.
Can't you or any of the long
haired sympathizers imagine
what misgivings Coach Jordan
must have had in denying
almost certain points and un
doubtedly a track victory? Nev
ertheless, he had the intestinal
fortitude to uphold and support
the school and other team mem
bers not quite so selfish.
Congratulations Coach Jordan
and Chuck Taylor who certainly
deserves the support of students
and alumni—on a subject that
shouldn't merit a single line of
publicity in the press.

• Very Disappointed
Editor, The Daily:
For many years Mr. Rockwell
and I have enjoyed attending
athletic events at Stanford, in
cluding season tickets for the
football games. We have always
been impressed with the good
sportsmanship and the fine ap
pearance of the well-trained
teams. We realize that this is a
result of fine principles and
rules willingly adhered to by the
athletes.

Consequently we were very
disappointed to read that such
an outstanding athlete as Mr.
Morrison was not willing to
abide by the rules, and we are
particularly disappointed to
learn that so many students are
supporting his defiance. We
have always felt that Stanford
was a happy exception to the
deplorable "beat-nick" trend, so
these recent events are very dis
illusioning. If Mr. Morrison is
allowed to get away with this,
other athletes will fall in line,
and the image of the clean-cut,
clean-shaven athlete will be lost.
I am sure we speak for hun
dreds of fellow members of the
Stanford Buck Club when we
declare 100 per cent support for
the Athletic Department on this
issue.

Editor, The Daily:
Even though it is not particu
larly popular among certain
student and professorial groups
today to take a stand for ad
herance to the established poli
cies of Stanford University, I
want you to know that many of
your alumni do believe that
these policies, which set stand
ards of appearance and conduct,
should be maintained. Those who
wish to express individual ideas
of personal appearance or moral
standards that deviate from
those that are set by the uni
versity should look for an edu
cation elsewhere. We know of
too many deserving young peo
ple of high morals and good
character who have not been
able to gain entrance to Stan
ford for lack of room.
I am proud to know that the
Stanford Athletic Department
has the courage to back its poli
cies, even at the cost of possibly
losing a track meet.

As a Stanford Alumnus and

Editor, The Daily:
As a widow of a Stanford
alumnus, a daughter of an alum
nus, and a mother of three who
graduated from Stanford, I'm
very disturbed with the stand
The Daily and the students have
taken in regard to the young
English track star.
Mr. Patrick Morrison's defi
ance of the reasonable request
of Payton Jordon, track coach,
and the athletic department to
conform to a reasonable request
of maintaining a neat appear
ance is not unreasonable.
The image of Stanford is put
forth by her athletes and stu
dents, and due to the standards
athletically and scholastically
Stanford has become one of the
foremost universities in the
world.
There should be more alle
giance to the university on Mr.
Morrison's part, and not just
self. The standards set are in
the best interests of Stanford.

• In Agreement
Editor, The Daily:
I am in agreement with the
Stanford Athletic Department in
setting standards for sports par
ticipation by students, including
personal appearances. It should
be expected that a neat and or
derly personal appearance be a
uniform standard for all stu
dents, particularly those repre
senting the University.

• A World Out There
Editor, The Daily:
We couldn't help ourselves.
We had to write The Stanford
Daily to say, "Wake up. Stu
dents, and support the Athletic
Department's stand on Morri
son!"
This is a simple vote for law
and authority which most civi
lized people consider essential.
You students in your clois
tered-ivory-towered environment
must realize there is a world
out here where the rest of us
live and you best mature a bit
and learn to accept rules, regu
lations and authority before you
come and join us.

We have attended Stanford's
Athletic events for a number of
years and always have been

Pat Morrison to get a little

• Higher Standards
Editor, The Daily:
We all need a set of standards

• Learning The Rules
Editor, The Daily:
... If Mr. Morrison does not
learn the age-old give and take
rules at his tender age when is
he going to learn them? It's go
ing to be brought home to him
forceably sooner of later that a
certain amount of conformation
to rule is mandatory in this
world we live in. If he wants to
be "different" then please allow
him to be. The "difference" be
ing that he doesn't run on track
with his golden locks flying in
the breeze. Too bad he isn't
George. Of course you could call
him "Georgous Pat".
What are you people trying
to do down there? Rival U.C.'s
reputation?

• Jesus A Beatnik?
Editor, The Daily:
When I first read of the un
fortunate publicity that resulted
when Payton Jordon insisted
that Pat Morrison either trim
his hair or not participate in
track, my first reaction was to
wonder what possible reasons
could force a publicity sensitive
athletic department to create
such a stir.
I thought that it might have
been a strange irrational quirk
in Mr. Jordan's personality that
made him dislike deviation in
the length of ones hair. But
knowing the sensitivity of his
own job to publicity, his actions
were more likely the result of
even greater pressure and pub
licity from out side the Univer
sity by perhaps influential alum
ni who have always taken a
paternal interest in athletics.
Since Stanford alumni no
doubt partially because of their
Stanford education are unemo
tional logical thinkers, what
logical reasons could they have

for objecting to the length of
ones hair?
My first thought was that the
engineers among them realized
that long hair hindered Mr. Mor
rison's performance in tr a
perhaps for aerodynamic rea
sons similar to those that en
courage swimmers to shave off
body hair before a meet. But
then why insist on cutting his
hair when a bathing cap would
serve just as well?
Discarding this possibility, my
next thought was that Stanford
alumni or the athletic depart
ment perhaps because of their
broader experience felt that any
deviation from the ideal of a
white, Anglo-Saxon, clean cut,
all-American boy naturally im
plied at least juvenile rebellion
or maybe even natural inferiori
ty or immorality. But then no
pressures have been applied to
eradicate other evidences of de
viation from the campus. For
example, no one has pressured
the university to paint Negro
students white or reshape orien
tal students eyes or even insist
ed that Vietnicks take a bath
and put on clean levis.
There is another argument
against the existence of such a
general philosophy in alumni.
If such pressure had been exert
ed for these reasons then the
University administration follow
ing their long tradition of toler
ance towards unpopular ideas
without regard to outside pres
sure such as liberalized social
regulations, liquor on campus,
and birth control information
would certainly have defended
Morrison against this criticism.
Discarding this possibility, I
was forced to conclude that the
criticism of Morrison was not
rational and might stem from
some small psychological prob
lem that is more prevclant in
older Stanford graduates. I
would like to put forth a theory.
Since most Stanford alumni
and administrators are products
of the Christian tradition which
demands that children against
their natural inclinations attend
church every Sunday, they have
been affected by this pressure
in their youth. They have thus
rebelled in an unconscious man
ner against their church by ir
rationally disliking long hair.
No one can deny that Jesus
Christ, the major figure in their
childhood church experiences,
had hair down to his shoulders.

• Policy At Fault
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the freshman
track team, I wish to clarify
certain issues that are becoming
clouded by misinformation. It is
unfortunate that ignorant indi
viduals, such as Mr. Vincent are
maligning Coach Jordan. Coach
Jordan only implements Ath
letic Department policy; he ha 6
no choice in his position. The
Athletic Department's policy is
not necessarily a manifestation
of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari
fy this point because some
Daily readers might get the im
pression that the freshman team
acquiesced in signing the letter,
whereas, in reality, the team as
a whole actively supports Pat's
stand.

• Bad Taste
Editor, Thr Dally:
I wish to register a serious
protest to the publication of the
column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad
taste, is extremely offensive to
people of good will and good
intention, and is another con
tribution to the alienation of
student journalists from many
faculty and others who would
like to be their friends.

• Jesus A Beatnik?
Editor, The Daily:
When I first read of the un
fortunate publicity that resulted
when Payton Jordon insisted
that Pat Morrison either trim
his hair or not participate in
track, my first reaction was to
wonder what possible reasons
could force a publicity sensitive
athletic department to create
such a stir.
I thought that it might have
been a strange irrational quirk
in Mr. Jordan's personality that
made him dislike deviation in
the length of ones hair. But
knowing the sensitivity of his
own job to publicity, his actions
were more likely the result of
even greater pressure and pub
licity from out side the Univer
sity by perhaps influential alum
ni who have always taken a
paternal interest in athletics.
Since Stanford alumni no
doubt partially because of their
Stanford education are unemo
tional logical thinkers, what
logical reasons could they have

for objecting to the length of
ones hair?
My first thought was that the
engineers among them realized
that long hair hindered Mr. Mor
rison's performance in tr a
perhaps for aerodynamic rea
sons similar to those that en
courage swimmers to shave off
body hair before a meet. But
then why insist on cutting his
hair when a bathing cap would
serve just as well?
Discarding this possibility, my
next thought was that Stanford
alumni or the athletic depart
ment perhaps because of their
broader experience felt that any
deviation from the ideal of a
white, Anglo-Saxon, clean cut,
all-American boy naturally im
plied at least juvenile rebellion
or maybe even natural inferiori
ty or immorality. But then no
pressures have been applied to
eradicate other evidences of de
viation from the campus. For
example, no one has pressured
the university to paint Negro
students white or reshape orien
tal students eyes or even insist
ed that Vietnicks take a bath
and put on clean levis.
There is another argument
against the existence of such a
general philosophy in alumni.
If such pressure had been exert
ed for these reasons then the
University administration follow
ing their long tradition of toler
ance towards unpopular ideas
without regard to outside pres
sure such as liberalized social
regulations, liquor on campus,
and birth control information
would certainly have defended
Morrison against this criticism.
Discarding this possibility, I
was forced to conclude that the
criticism of Morrison was not
rational and might stem from
some small psychological prob
lem that is more prevclant in
older Stanford graduates. I
would like to put forth a theory.
Since most Stanford alumni
and administrators are products
of the Christian tradition which
demands that children against
their natural inclinations attend
church every Sunday, they have
been affected by this pressure
in their youth. They have thus
rebelled in an unconscious man
ner against their church by ir
rationally disliking long hair.
No one can deny that Jesus
Christ, the major figure in their
childhood church experiences,
had hair down to his shoulders.

• Policy At Fault
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the freshman
track team, I wish to clarify
certain issues that are becoming
clouded by misinformation. It is
unfortunate that ignorant indi
viduals, such as Mr. Vincent are
maligning Coach Jordan. Coach
Jordan only implements Ath
letic Department policy; he ha 6
no choice in his position. The
Athletic Department's policy is
not necessarily a manifestation
of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari
fy this point because some
Daily readers might get the im
pression that the freshman team
acquiesced in signing the letter,
whereas, in reality, the team as
a whole actively supports Pat's
stand.

Editor, Thr Dally:
I wish to register a serious
protest to the publication of the
column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad
taste, is extremely offensive to
people of good will and good
intention, and is another con
tribution to the alienation of
student journalists from many
faculty and others who would
like to be their friends.
ITAROLD M. BACON

Editor, The Daily:
As an alumnus of Stanford
and a resident of the area since
1935, I have always enjoyed the
school sports program. Year
after year it has been a real
pleasure to watch the clean-cut
Stanford student perform to his
utmost.
Now suddenly because some
character desires to rebel
against tradition and authority,
Coach Jordan and the Athletic
Department are given a nega
tive press.
I have always been of the Im
pression that if one has a desire
to be a member of a group, or
ganization, or team, he must
meet certain stipulations rela
tive to training, grooming, etc.
The organization so specifies,
not the individual.
Can't you or any of the long
haired sympathizers imagine
what misgivings Coach Jordan
must have had in denying
almost certain points and un
doubtedly a track victory? Nev
ertheless, he had the intestinal
fortitude to uphold and support
the school and other team mem
bers not quite so selfish.
Congratulations Coach Jordan
and Chuck Taylor who certainly
deserves the support of students
and alumni—on a subject that
shouldn't merit a single line of
publicity in the press.

• Very Disappointed
Editor, The Daily:
For many years Mr. Rockwell
and I have enjoyed attending
athletic events at Stanford, in
cluding season tickets for the
football games. We have always
been impressed with the good
sportsmanship and the fine ap
pearance of the well-trained
teams. We realize that this is a
result of fine principles and
rules willingly adhered to by the
athletes.

Consequently we were very
disappointed to read that such
an outstanding athlete as Mr.
Morrison was not willing to
abide by the rules, and we are
particularly disappointed to
learn that so many students are
supporting his defiance. We
have always felt that Stanford
was a happy exception to the
deplorable "beat-nick" trend, so
these recent events are very dis
illusioning. If Mr. Morrison is
allowed to get away with this,
other athletes will fall in line,
and the image of the clean-cut,
clean-shaven athlete will be lost.
I am sure we speak for hun
dreds of fellow members of the
Stanford Buck Club when we
declare 100 per cent support for
the Athletic Department on this
issue.

Mr. Patrick Morrison's defi

column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad
taste, is extremely offensive to
people of good will and good
intention, and is another con
tribution to the alienation of
student journalists from many
faculty and others who would
like to be their friends.

As an alumnus of Stanford
and a resident of the area since
1935, I have always enjoyed the
school sports program. Year
after year it has been a real
pleasure to watch the clean-cut
Stanford student perform to his
utmost.
Now suddenly because some
character desires to rebel
against tradition and authority,
Coach Jordan and the Athletic
Department are given a nega
tive press.
I have always been of the Im
pression that if one has a desire
to be a member of a group, or
ganization, or team, he must
meet certain stipulations rela
tive to training, grooming, etc.
The organization so specifies,
not the individual.
Can't you or any of the long
haired sympathizers imagine
what misgivings Coach Jordan
must have had in denying
almost certain points and un
doubtedly a track victory? Nev
ertheless, he had the intestinal
fortitude to uphold and support
the school and other team mem
bers not quite so selfish.
Congratulations Coach Jordan
and Chuck Taylor who certainly
deserves the support of students
and alumni—on a subject that
shouldn't merit a single line of
publicity in the press.

• Very Disappointed
Editor, The Daily:
For many years Mr. Rockwell
and I have enjoyed attending
athletic events at Stanford, in
cluding season tickets for the
football games. We have always
been impressed with the good
sportsmanship and the fine ap
pearance of the well-trained
teams. We realize that this is a
result of fine principles and
rules willingly adhered to by the
athletes.

Consequently we were very
disappointed to read that such
an outstanding athlete as Mr.
Morrison was not willing to
abide by the rules, and we are
particularly disappointed to
learn that so many students are
supporting his defiance. We
have always felt that Stanford
was a happy exception to the
deplorable "beat-nick" trend, so
these recent events are very dis
illusioning. If Mr. Morrison is
allowed to get away with this,
other athletes will fall in line,
and the image of the clean-cut,
clean-shaven athlete will be lost.
I am sure we speak for hun

• Learning The Rules
Editor, The Daily:
... If Mr. Morrison does not
learn the age-old give and take
rules at his tender age when is
he going to learn them? It's go
ing to be brought home to him
forceably sooner of later that a
certain amount of conformation
to rule is mandatory in this
world we live in. If he wants to
be "different" then please allow
him to be. The "difference" be
ing that he doesn't run on track
with his golden locks flying in

him "Georgous Pat".

• Jesus A Beatnik?
Editor, The Daily:
When I first read of the un
fortunate publicity that resulted
when Payton Jordon insisted
that Pat Morrison either trim
his hair or not participate in
track, my first reaction was to
wonder what possible reasons
could force a publicity sensitive
athletic department to create
such a stir.
I thought that it might have
been a strange irrational quirk
in Mr. Jordan's personality that
made him dislike deviation in
the length of ones hair. But
knowing the sensitivity of his
own job to publicity, his actions
were more likely the result of
even greater pressure and pub
licity from out side the Univer
sity by perhaps influential alum
ni who have always taken a
paternal interest in athletics.
Since Stanford alumni no
doubt partially because of their
Stanford education are unemo
tional logical thinkers, what
logical reasons could they have

for objecting to the length of
ones hair?
My first thought was that the
engineers among them realized
that long hair hindered Mr. Mor
rison's performance in tr a
perhaps for aerodynamic rea
sons similar to those that en
courage swimmers to shave off
body hair before a meet. But
then why insist on cutting his
hair when a bathing cap would
serve just as well?
Discarding this possibility, my
next thought was that Stanford
alumni or the athletic depart
ment perhaps because of their
broader experience felt that any
deviation from the ideal of a
white, Anglo-Saxon, clean cut,
all-American boy naturally im
plied at least juvenile rebellion
or maybe even natural inferiori
ty or immorality. But then no
pressures have been applied to
eradicate other evidences of de
viation from the campus. For
example, no one has pressured
the university to paint Negro
students white or reshape orien
tal students eyes or even insist
ed that Vietnicks take a bath
and put on clean levis.
There is another argument
against the existence of such a
general philosophy in alumni.
If such pressure had been exert
ed for these reasons then the
University administration follow
ing their long tradition of toler
ance towards unpopular ideas
without regard to outside pres
sure such as liberalized social
regulations, liquor on campus,
and birth control information
would certainly have defended
Morrison against this criticism.
Discarding this possibility, I
was forced to conclude that the
criticism of Morrison was not
rational and might stem from
some small psychological prob
lem that is more prevclant in
older Stanford graduates. I
would like to put forth a theory.
Since most Stanford alumni
and administrators are products
of the Christian tradition which
demands that children against
their natural inclinations attend
church every Sunday, they have
been affected by this pressure
in their youth. They have thus
rebelled in an unconscious man
ner against their church by ir
rationally disliking long hair.
No one can deny that Jesus
Christ, the major figure in their
childhood church experiences,
had hair down to his shoulders.

• Policy At Fault
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the freshman
track team, I wish to clarify
certain issues that are becoming
clouded by misinformation. It is
unfortunate that ignorant indi
viduals, such as Mr. Vincent are
maligning Coach Jordan. Coach
Jordan only implements Ath
letic Department policy; he ha 6
no choice in his position. The
Athletic Department's policy is
not necessarily a manifestation
of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari
fy this point because some
Daily readers might get the im
pression that the freshman team
acquiesced in signing the letter,
whereas, in reality, the team as
a whole actively supports Pat's
stand.

Editor, The Daily:

rules at his tender age when is
he going to learn them? It's go

• Jesus A Beatnik?
Editor, The Daily:
When I first read of the un
fortunate publicity that resulted
when Payton Jordon insisted
that Pat Morrison either trim
his hair or not participate in
track, my first reaction was to
wonder what possible reasons
could force a publicity sensitive
athletic department to create
such a stir.
I thought that it might have
been a strange irrational quirk
in Mr. Jordan's personality that
made him dislike deviation in
the length of ones hair. But
knowing the sensitivity of his
own job to publicity, his actions
were more likely the result of
even greater pressure and pub
licity from out side the Univer
sity by perhaps influential alum
ni who have always taken a
paternal interest in athletics.
Since Stanford alumni no
doubt partially because of their
Stanford education are unemo
tional logical thinkers, what
logical reasons could they have

for objecting to the length of
ones hair?
My first thought was that the
engineers among them realized
that long hair hindered Mr. Mor
rison's performance in tr a
perhaps for aerodynamic rea
sons similar to those that en
courage swimmers to shave off
body hair before a meet. But
then why insist on cutting his
hair when a bathing cap would
serve just as well?
Discarding this possibility, my
next thought was that Stanford
alumni or the athletic depart
ment perhaps because of their
broader experience felt that any
deviation from the ideal of a
white, Anglo-Saxon, clean cut,
all-American boy naturally im
plied at least juvenile rebellion
or maybe even natural inferiori
ty or immorality. But then no
pressures have been applied to
eradicate other evidences of de
viation from the campus. For
example, no one has pressured
the university to paint Negro
students white or reshape orien
tal students eyes or even insist
ed that Vietnicks take a bath
and put on clean levis.
There is another argument
against the existence of such a
general philosophy in alumni.
If such pressure had been exert
ed for these reasons then the
University administration follow
ing their long tradition of toler
ance towards unpopular ideas
without regard to outside pres
sure such as liberalized social
regulations, liquor on campus,
and birth control information
would certainly have defended
Morrison against this criticism.
Discarding this possibility, I
was forced to conclude that the
criticism of Morrison was not
rational and might stem from
some small psychological prob
lem that is more prevclant in
older Stanford graduates. I
would like to put forth a theory.
Since most Stanford alumni
and administrators are products
of the Christian tradition which
demands that children against
their natural inclinations attend
church every Sunday, they have
been affected by this pressure
in their youth. They have thus
rebelled in an unconscious man
ner against their church by ir
rationally disliking long hair.
No one can deny that Jesus
Christ, the major figure in their
childhood church experiences,
had hair down to his shoulders.

• Policy At Fault
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the freshman
track team, I wish to clarify
certain issues that are becoming
clouded by misinformation. It is
unfortunate that ignorant indi
viduals, such as Mr. Vincent are
maligning Coach Jordan. Coach
Jordan only implements Ath
letic Department policy; he ha 6
no choice in his position. The
Athletic Department's policy is
not necessarily a manifestation
of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari
fy this point because some
Daily readers might get the im
pression that the freshman team
acquiesced in signing the letter,
whereas, in reality, the team as
a whole actively supports Pat's
stand.

• Bad Taste
Editor, Thr Dally:
I wish to register a serious
protest to the publication of the
column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad
taste, is extremely offensive to
people of good will and good
intention, and is another con
tribution to the alienation of
student journalists from many
faculty and others who would
like to be their friends.
ITAROLD M. BACON

Editor, The Daily:
As an alumnus of Stanford
and a resident of the area since
1935, I have always enjoyed the
school sports program. Year
after year it has been a real
pleasure to watch the clean-cut
Stanford student perform to his
utmost.
Now suddenly because some
character desires to rebel
against tradition and authority,
Coach Jordan and the Athletic
Department are given a nega
tive press.
I have always been of the Im
pression that if one has a desire
to be a member of a group, or
ganization, or team, he must
meet certain stipulations rela
tive to training, grooming, etc.
The organization so specifies,
not the individual.
Can't you or any of the long
haired sympathizers imagine
what misgivings Coach Jordan
must have had in denying
almost certain points and un
doubtedly a track victory? Nev
ertheless, he had the intestinal
fortitude to uphold and support
the school and other team mem
bers not quite so selfish.
Congratulations Coach Jordan
and Chuck Taylor who certainly
deserves the support of students
and alumni—on a subject that
shouldn't merit a single line of
publicity in the press.

• Very Disappointed
Editor, The Daily:
For many years Mr. Rockwell
and I have enjoyed attending
athletic events at Stanford, in
cluding season tickets for the
football games. We have always
been impressed with the good
sportsmanship and the fine ap
pearance of the well-trained
teams. We realize that this is a
result of fine principles and
rules willingly adhered to by the
athletes.

Consequently we were very
disappointed to read that such
an outstanding athlete as Mr.
Morrison was not willing to
abide by the rules, and we are
particularly disappointed to
learn that so many students are
supporting his defiance. We
have always felt that Stanford
was a happy exception to the
deplorable "beat-nick" trend, so
these recent events are very dis
illusioning. If Mr. Morrison is
allowed to get away with this,
other athletes will fall in line,
and the image of the clean-cut,
clean-shaven athlete will be lost.
I am sure we speak for hun
dreds of fellow members of the
Stanford Buck Club when we
declare 100 per cent support for
the Athletic Department on this
issue.

• Bad Taste
Editor, Thr Dally:
I wish to register a serious
protest to the publication of the
column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad

As an alumnus of Stanford
and a resident of the area since
1935, I have always enjoyed the
school sports program. Year
after year it has been a real
pleasure to watch the clean-cut
Stanford student perform to his
utmost.
Now suddenly because some
character desires to rebel
against tradition and authority,
Coach Jordan and the Athletic
Department are given a nega

I have always been of the Im
pression that if one has a desire
to be a member of a group, or
ganization, or team, he must
meet certain stipulations rela
tive to training, grooming, etc.
The organization so specifies,
not the individual.
Can't you or any of the long

what misgivings Coach Jordan
must have had in denying
almost certain points and un
doubtedly a track victory? Nev
ertheless, he had the intestinal
fortitude to uphold and support
the school and other team mem

Congratulations Coach Jordan

shouldn't merit a single line of

Editor, The Daily:
For many years Mr. Rockwell

been impressed with the good
sportsmanship and the fine ap

Consequently we were very

have always felt that Stanford
was a happy exception to the

forceably sooner of later that a

• Jesus A Beatnik?
Editor, The Daily:
When I first read of the un
fortunate publicity that resulted
when Payton Jordon insisted
that Pat Morrison either trim
his hair or not participate in
track, my first reaction was to
wonder what possible reasons
could force a publicity sensitive
athletic department to create
such a stir.
I thought that it might have
been a strange irrational quirk
in Mr. Jordan's personality that
made him dislike deviation in
the length of ones hair. But
knowing the sensitivity of his
own job to publicity, his actions
were more likely the result of
even greater pressure and pub
licity from out side the Univer
sity by perhaps influential alum
ni who have always taken a
paternal interest in athletics.
Since Stanford alumni no
doubt partially because of their
Stanford education are unemo
tional logical thinkers, what
logical reasons could they have

for objecting to the length of
ones hair?
My first thought was that the
engineers among them realized
that long hair hindered Mr. Mor
rison's performance in tr a
perhaps for aerodynamic rea
sons similar to those that en
courage swimmers to shave off
body hair before a meet. But
then why insist on cutting his
hair when a bathing cap would
serve just as well?
Discarding this possibility, my
next thought was that Stanford
alumni or the athletic depart
ment perhaps because of their
broader experience felt that any
deviation from the ideal of a
white, Anglo-Saxon, clean cut,
all-American boy naturally im
plied at least juvenile rebellion
or maybe even natural inferiori
ty or immorality. But then no
pressures have been applied to
eradicate other evidences of de
viation from the campus. For
example, no one has pressured
the university to paint Negro
students white or reshape orien
tal students eyes or even insist
ed that Vietnicks take a bath
and put on clean levis.
There is another argument
against the existence of such a
general philosophy in alumni.
If such pressure had been exert
ed for these reasons then the
University administration follow
ing their long tradition of toler
ance towards unpopular ideas
without regard to outside pres
sure such as liberalized social
regulations, liquor on campus,
and birth control information
would certainly have defended
Morrison against this criticism.
Discarding this possibility, I
was forced to conclude that the
criticism of Morrison was not
rational and might stem from
some small psychological prob
lem that is more prevclant in
older Stanford graduates. I
would like to put forth a theory.
Since most Stanford alumni
and administrators are products
of the Christian tradition which
demands that children against
their natural inclinations attend
church every Sunday, they have
been affected by this pressure
in their youth. They have thus
rebelled in an unconscious man
ner against their church by ir
rationally disliking long hair.
No one can deny that Jesus
Christ, the major figure in their
childhood church experiences,
had hair down to his shoulders.

• Policy At Fault
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the freshman
track team, I wish to clarify
certain issues that are becoming
clouded by misinformation. It is
unfortunate that ignorant indi
viduals, such as Mr. Vincent are
maligning Coach Jordan. Coach
Jordan only implements Ath
letic Department policy; he ha 6
no choice in his position. The
Athletic Department's policy is
not necessarily a manifestation
of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari

• Jesus A Beatnik?
Editor, The Daily:
When I first read of the un
fortunate publicity that resulted
when Payton Jordon insisted
that Pat Morrison either trim
his hair or not participate in
track, my first reaction was to
wonder what possible reasons
could force a publicity sensitive
athletic department to create
such a stir.
I thought that it might have
been a strange irrational quirk
in Mr. Jordan's personality that
made him dislike deviation in
the length of ones hair. But
knowing the sensitivity of his
own job to publicity, his actions
were more likely the result of
even greater pressure and pub
licity from out side the Univer
sity by perhaps influential alum
ni who have always taken a
paternal interest in athletics.
Since Stanford alumni no
doubt partially because of their
Stanford education are unemo
tional logical thinkers, what
logical reasons could they have

for objecting to the length of
ones hair?
My first thought was that the
engineers among them realized
that long hair hindered Mr. Mor
rison's performance in tr a
perhaps for aerodynamic rea
sons similar to those that en
courage swimmers to shave off
body hair before a meet. But
then why insist on cutting his
hair when a bathing cap would
serve just as well?
Discarding this possibility, my
next thought was that Stanford
alumni or the athletic depart
ment perhaps because of their
broader experience felt that any
deviation from the ideal of a
white, Anglo-Saxon, clean cut,
all-American boy naturally im
plied at least juvenile rebellion
or maybe even natural inferiori
ty or immorality. But then no
pressures have been applied to
eradicate other evidences of de
viation from the campus. For
example, no one has pressured
the university to paint Negro
students white or reshape orien
tal students eyes or even insist
ed that Vietnicks take a bath
and put on clean levis.
There is another argument
against the existence of such a
general philosophy in alumni.
If such pressure had been exert
ed for these reasons then the
University administration follow
ing their long tradition of toler
ance towards unpopular ideas
without regard to outside pres
sure such as liberalized social
regulations, liquor on campus,
and birth control information
would certainly have defended
Morrison against this criticism.
Discarding this possibility, I
was forced to conclude that the
criticism of Morrison was not
rational and might stem from
some small psychological prob
lem that is more prevclant in
older Stanford graduates. I
would like to put forth a theory.
Since most Stanford alumni
and administrators are products
of the Christian tradition which
demands that children against
their natural inclinations attend
church every Sunday, they have
been affected by this pressure
in their youth. They have thus
rebelled in an unconscious man
ner against their church by ir
rationally disliking long hair.
No one can deny that Jesus
Christ, the major figure in their
childhood church experiences,
had hair down to his shoulders.

• Policy At Fault
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the freshman
track team, I wish to clarify
certain issues that are becoming
clouded by misinformation. It is
unfortunate that ignorant indi
viduals, such as Mr. Vincent are
maligning Coach Jordan. Coach
Jordan only implements Ath
letic Department policy; he ha 6
no choice in his position. The
Athletic Department's policy is
not necessarily a manifestation
of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari
fy this point because some
Daily readers might get the im
pression that the freshman team
acquiesced in signing the letter,
whereas, in reality, the team as
a whole actively supports Pat's
stand.

• Bad Taste
Editor, Thr Dally:
I wish to register a serious
protest to the publication of the
column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad
taste, is extremely offensive to
people of good will and good
intention, and is another con
tribution to the alienation of
student journalists from many
faculty and others who would
like to be their friends.
ITAROLD M. BACON

Editor, The Daily:
As an alumnus of Stanford
and a resident of the area since
1935, I have always enjoyed the
school sports program. Year
after year it has been a real
pleasure to watch the clean-cut
Stanford student perform to his
utmost.
Now suddenly because some
character desires to rebel
against tradition and authority,
Coach Jordan and the Athletic
Department are given a nega
tive press.
I have always been of the Im
pression that if one has a desire
to be a member of a group, or
ganization, or team, he must
meet certain stipulations rela
tive to training, grooming, etc.
The organization so specifies,
not the individual.
Can't you or any of the long
haired sympathizers imagine
what misgivings Coach Jordan
must have had in denying
almost certain points and un
doubtedly a track victory? Nev
ertheless, he had the intestinal
fortitude to uphold and support
the school and other team mem
bers not quite so selfish.
Congratulations Coach Jordan
and Chuck Taylor who certainly
deserves the support of students
and alumni—on a subject that
shouldn't merit a single line of
publicity in the press.

• Very Disappointed
Editor, The Daily:
For many years Mr. Rockwell
and I have enjoyed attending
athletic events at Stanford, in
cluding season tickets for the
football games. We have always
been impressed with the good
sportsmanship and the fine ap
pearance of the well-trained
teams. We realize that this is a
result of fine principles and
rules willingly adhered to by the
athletes.

Consequently we were very
disappointed to read that such
an outstanding athlete as Mr.
Morrison was not willing to
abide by the rules, and we are
particularly disappointed to
learn that so many students are
supporting his defiance. We
have always felt that Stanford
was a happy exception to the
deplorable "beat-nick" trend, so
these recent events are very dis
illusioning. If Mr. Morrison is
allowed to get away with this,
other athletes will fall in line,
and the image of the clean-cut,
clean-shaven athlete will be lost.
I am sure we speak for hun
dreds of fellow members of the
Stanford Buck Club when we
declare 100 per cent support for
the Athletic Department on this
issue.

of his personal views. Whether
they are or not is irrelevant.
What is at fault is the policy of
the Athletic Department. They
mistakenly try to impose their
aesthetic values and ideas of
what is "presentable" upon in
dividual athletes. Criticism
should be directed toward the
policy, not Coach Jordan.
I also wish to emphasize that
the freshman track team draft
ed the letter to Mr. Taylor Sun
day night as a group. Pat had a
part no larger than any other
single member of the team in
formulating the content of the
policy statement. The Daily
erred in stating Pat wrote the
letter to Mr. Taylor. In fact,
Terry Barnett, Bob Beukers, and
myself put the view of the
group on paper. I wish to clari
fy this point because some
Daily readers might get the im
pression that the freshman team
acquiesced in signing the letter,
whereas, in reality, the team as
a whole actively supports Pat's
stand.

• Bad Taste
Editor, Thr Dally:
I wish to register a serious
protest to the publication of the
column by Robert E. Stone,
"Jews? Jews in MY Church?"
in The Daily of May 11.
Many of us are working as
best we can to provide appro
priate facilities for Jewish and
other non - Christian worship.
These problems, like others I
need not mention, require cour
teous and sensitive treatment.
The column to which I take
exception is in outrageously bad
taste, is extremely offensive to
people of good will and good
intention, and is another con
tribution to the alienation of
student journalists from many
faculty and others who would
like to be their friends.
