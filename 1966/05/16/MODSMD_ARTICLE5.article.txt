# Tuesday Evening Series Cancelled
## 
### 
The Tuesday Evening Series, a lec
ture program which dates back to
1891, has been cancelled, the Uni
versity has announced.
The cancellation includes a sched
uled lecture set for Tuesday, May
17, by Dr. Robert J. Glaser, Dean
of the Stanford Medical School.
The Committee on Public Exercises,
which sponsors the lecture series and
other University events, listed declin
ing attendance and the pressure of
other University-sponsored events as
the reason for the cancellation.

the individual style and effort of his
staffers. A staffer was assigned to
most departments with the editors
covering certain larger fields.
In his introduction, Fisher provides
the reader with two solid suggestions
for choosing courses well worth the
price of the Review if the reader read
no further.
The Best Gauge
"The best gauge of a course's value
is whether or not it achieves its ob
jectives," he notes. "This, and the
rating of the professor, should be the
most legitimate factors for student
consideration in planning course
schedules."
While generally excellent in its pre
sentation, the Review does have its
weak points. The editors found Teach
ing Assistant Richard Blakely's per
formance in French 3 so outstanding
that they promoted him to Professor
Blakely. Most readers will be hard
put to find English 409 "Erotica in
Modern Literature" in the University
Courses and Degrees. Typographical
errors are a mild anoyance at times,
but the content of the Review more
than makes up for these mechanical
faults.
Looking to the future, Fisher sees
no reason why the "Scratch Sheet"
must limit itself to a review of
courses. In years to come he believes,
"It could become in effect a review of
Stanford."
