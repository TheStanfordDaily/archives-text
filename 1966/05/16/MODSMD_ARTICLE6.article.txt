# 'Quality Of Life' Topic At Confab
## 
### 
Thirteen faculty members and sev
eral students addressed over one
thousand returning alumni, parents,
and friends concerning "The Quality
of Life" Saturday at the 1966 Stan
ford Conference.
Dave Harris and a panel of students
addressed the group following the
main body of speeches. Their topic
was student activism and its role in
the future.
Harris noted that the new activism
will increase, and rapidly. He called
the attitude a "revolution of values"
that stems from a "refusal" of stu
dents to be content with old stand
ards.
Professor Philip Rhinelander also
spoke on student • activism. He noted
"student activists reflect the very ten
dencies against which they rebel —
their rejection of authority tends to
be quite machine-like and personal."
Student Activists
He added, "The more extreme stu
dent activists do not seem to discrimi
nate among particular individuals ac
cording to their individual views;
they do not declare for liberal admin
istrators as against reactionary ad
ministrators.
"The opposition, as publicly formu
altcd, is impersonal and sweeping:
'Abolish the Regents'; 'You can't
trust anyone over 30.' "
Rhinelander concluded, "The ma
chine is a good servant but a bad mas
ter. When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels—or some of both."
Art and Loneliness
Professor of Speech and Drama Wil
liam Sharp discussed art as a re
sponse to human loneliness.
Sharp said, "Art is by far the most
satisfying way of realizing you are
not alone, that someone else sees
what you see in the same way, be
cause art can't talk back."
He also noted in relation to his role
as director of the Repertory Theater
"My own communication with other
people has convinced me that any real
kind of communication is extremely
difficult. One of the joys of art is that
if it speaks to you, it speaks to you
finally, surely, and without explana
tion.
Life a Pastiche
"Our life is a pastiche of sentimen
tal comedies, farces, tragedies, and
third-rate melodramas," he added.
The program began at 9:30 a.m.
with a film prsented by Australian
graduate student Mike Rubbo. The
film, "The True Source of Knowledge
These Days" was filmed, directed,
and produced by Rubbo.
Following the film panels discussed
Stanford Today and Tomorrow and
athletics. Moderating these panels was

Associate Dean Robert R. Hind of Un
dergraduate Education.
President Sterling spoke at the
luncheon meeting on the Bowman
Alumni House Patio. Other speakers
included Professors Lewis Spitz,
John Kaplan, John McCarthy, Ernest
Hilgard, Ronald J. P. Lyon, Mark
Mancall and Hubert Heffner.
The Stanford Conference Program
began in 1933 when an alumna from
the class of 1930 wrote to her class
president to ask: "What does Dr.
Graham Stuart think of the League
of Nations now?" Her question
prompted the University and the
Alumni Association to arrange an af
ternoon of faculty lectures on campus
for alumni of the Classes of 1929-31.
A few dozen people were expected,
and over two hundred came.
For this beginning the Conference
Program has grown into "the greatest
academic road show in the country."
This year, the 1966 Conference Pro
gram visited over twenty cities across
the United States.

dencies against which they rebel —
their rejection of authority tends to
be quite machine-like and personal."
Student Activists
He added, "The more extreme stu
dent activists do not seem to discrimi
nate among particular individuals ac
cording to their individual views;
they do not declare for liberal admin
istrators as against reactionary ad
ministrators.
"The opposition, as publicly formu
altcd, is impersonal and sweeping:
'Abolish the Regents'; 'You can't
trust anyone over 30.' "
Rhinelander concluded, "The ma
chine is a good servant but a bad mas
ter. When the University becomes a
vast teaching machine, it turns out
robots or rebels—or some of both."
Art and Loneliness
Professor of Speech and Drama Wil
liam Sharp discussed art as a re
sponse to human loneliness.
Sharp said, "Art is by far the most
satisfying way of realizing you are
not alone, that someone else sees
what you see in the same way, be
cause art can't talk back."
He also noted in relation to his role
as director of the Repertory Theater
"My own communication with other
people has convinced me that any real
kind of communication is extremely
difficult. One of the joys of art is that
if it speaks to you, it speaks to you
finally, surely, and without explana
tion.
Life a Pastiche
"Our life is a pastiche of sentimen
tal comedies, farces, tragedies, and
third-rate melodramas," he added.
The program began at 9:30 a.m.
with a film prsented by Australian
graduate student Mike Rubbo. The
film, "The True Source of Knowledge
These Days" was filmed, directed,
and produced by Rubbo.
Following the film panels discussed
Stanford Today and Tomorrow and
athletics. Moderating these panels was

Associate Dean Robert R. Hind of Un
dergraduate Education.
President Sterling spoke at the
luncheon meeting on the Bowman
Alumni House Patio. Other speakers
included Professors Lewis Spitz,
John Kaplan, John McCarthy, Ernest
Hilgard, Ronald J. P. Lyon, Mark
Mancall and Hubert Heffner.
The Stanford Conference Program
began in 1933 when an alumna from
the class of 1930 wrote to her class
president to ask: "What does Dr.
Graham Stuart think of the League
of Nations now?" Her question
prompted the University and the
Alumni Association to arrange an af
ternoon of faculty lectures on campus
for alumni of the Classes of 1929-31.
A few dozen people were expected,
and over two hundred came.
For this beginning the Conference
Program has grown into "the greatest
academic road show in the country."
This year, the 1966 Conference Pro
gram visited over twenty cities across
the United States.
Thirteen faculty members and sev
eral students addressed over one
thousand returning alumni, parents,
and friends concerning "The Quality
of Life" Saturday at the 1966 Stan
ford Conference.
Dave Harris and a panel of students
addressed the group following the
main body of speeches. Their topic
was student activism and its role in
the future.
Harris noted that the new activism
will increase, and rapidly. He called
the attitude a "revolution of values"
that stems from a "refusal" of stu
dents to be content with old stand
ards.
Professor Philip Rhinelander also
spoke on student • activism. He noted
"student activists reflect the very ten
dencies against which they rebel —
their rejection of authority tends to
be quite machine-like and personal."
