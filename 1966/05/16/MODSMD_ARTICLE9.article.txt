# Registrar to Revamp With IBM
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
In the next four years the entire
record-keeping procedure of the Uni
versity may be revolutionized by IBM
machines, Dr. Harvey Hall, registrar,
revealed in a Daily interview last
week.
Dr. Hall outlined the following
changes that will be put into effect
in the near future:
• Next year student's names and
addresses will be put on name tapes,
making it possible for selective mail
ings. For instance, if the History
Department wishes to send out a let
ter to all history majors, it will no
longer be necessary to sort through
all the individual student cards.
Optical Scanner
• An optical scanner will be install
ed that will read end - of • quarter
grades direclly from a sheet sub
mitted by the instructor, thus elimi
nating the need for the secretarial
work now needed und reducing the
probability of error.
• The "1235" optical scanner will

soon simplify the class card system
that has been in operation since 1951.
Students will turn in a single sheet
with the class numbers of the courses
they wish to take that can be read by
the machine and transferred to class
enrollment lists.
Dr. Hall stated that these changes
may eventually lead to the possibility
of "on the line registration" enabling
a student to call in his class choices.
Tap^s
Every fall quarter students now re
ceive a copy of their permanent rec
ord sheet containing all their courses,
grades, and units for their quarters at
Stanford. Beginning next year, in ad
dition to these sheets, the IBM ma
chines will produce tapes containing
the same information now appearing
on the record sheets.
At the end of four' years, all stu
dents registered it Stanford will have
their records on these tapes, making
it possible to discontinue the visual
records and condensing the present
filing system.

However, Dr. Hill added, "It is dif
ficult to divorce ourselves from the
concept of having a printed record in
our hands," and it would be some
time before the present system could
be completely changed.
Registrar's File
One possible substitute for the rec
ords now distributed to students
would be a file in the registrar's office
available to students for looking up
their own records.
When the IBM 360 is installed with
many terminals throughout the cam
pus, the record tapes would enable
counselors, instructors, or adminis
trators to obtain a copy of a student's
record in a matter of minutes, Dr.
Hall explained.
Five years after a student leaves
Stanford, his entire scholastic record,
including his high school transcript
recommendation letters, and tost
scores, in microfilmed and placed on
file. Dr. Hall concluded that the new
computor system might eventually be
utilized in this capacity.
