# Civ: Enlightenment... Or The Black Death?
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH Assistant Editor 
(Editor's Note: This is the first in a series
of articles on opinions, problems and sugges
tions concerning the Stanford Western Civ
program.)

Western Civ is Plato, Marx, McNeill, Wolin
. . . walking to the Civ Libe . . . sweating over
a blue book . . . writing a check for a foot
high pile of paperbacks . . . throwing a water
balloon in a civ riot. Western Civ is becoming
excited, stimulated, sometimes bored, often
frustrated.
Civ is a constant topic of conversation, es
pecially among freshmen. Praise of the course
is high: "After taking Western Civ, I don't
think I'll ever feel uninformed or uneducated
again"; "I feel I'm learning to understand his
tory, not merely learning it."
Complaints, however, are equally strong.
"It seems to me to be little more than a class
where students learn phrases to be dropped
at cocktail parties." "The department is just
trying to get a lot of liberal ideas down our
throats." "It has to be suffered through."
Ideas Emphasized
Favorable comments about the Civ program
mainly emphasize the ideas studied. One
freshman girl noted, "It's a good way to get
people to think about beliefs they've never be
fore questioned. It gives us an introduction to
the type of studying college requires, and pre
sents a background for subjects we will later
study in depth." Another mentioned, "Civ

deals with topics I'd always wondered about.
I had this picture of college—finding out what
Socrates said, for example—and this is what
you get in Civ."
A third freshman praised instructors who
"are trying to get us to come down to the nit
ty gritty and really think about this life."
Civ Instructor Donald Buck, commenting on
Western Civ, contrasted it to a course he had
previously taught at Cal. The latter was a
"traditional set-up" with a textbook and two
lectures a week for 500-700 students, "in short,
a preparatory course for exams."
Stanford's Civ program, he emphasized,
"has reoriented my whole thinking on teach
ing . . . for the better."
Purpose of Civ
Explaining his views on the purpose of Civ,
Mr. Buck explained, "We think and act on the
basis of past heritage. Civ tries to present a
means by which a student can begin to dis
cover historically who he is. In that sense, the
basic Civ format is marvelous."
Students, too, stress the idea that Civ should
relate to modern life, in some cases praising
correlations with today's world, and in others
complaining that "it doesn't apply today."
The most frequent complaints about Civ
concern class size, reading assignments, and
definitions of the program.
Nearly every instructor questioned on the
weaknesses of the system responded imme
diately that classes are too big. Instructor
Jacqueline Strain emphasized that "smaller

classes are the most important thing. The
problem, however, is that smaller classes
means more instructors and therefore more
money."
Instructor Douglas K. Wood answered that
"the first thing to be done is to get twice as
many instructors" or, if this is impossible,
seriously consider making the course volun
tary."
Reading Assignments
Concerning the syllabus, freshman Richard
Young stated, "Some things (like Rousseau)
make me violent, but some (such as Hannah
Arendt) put me to sleep. Most of the readings
are really good, but some are just junk."
A freshman girl complained that "second
quarter was especially abominable. It was
dull; there was the syllabus source problem;
the assignments were too long."
Many of the complaints center around the
variety and disunity of the readings. Demands
are made for reading more books in their en
tirety and for a basic textbook.
"I hate reading all these miscellaneous, me
diocre paperbacks," explained one freshman
boy. "I think they should go ahead and have
us buy some of the good hardbacks like Wo
lin and Weber."
Another complained of the technical diffi
culties in getting materials. "Half of the peo
ple are discouraged at the beginning of the
year just because they have so much trouble
at the Civ Libe. The new arrangement with
the syllabus sources has been much better."

Freshman Jori Woods added that "It's so
disconnected; it's hard to remember any
thing" and suggested that one assignment
could be read and discussed for an entire
week.
Instructors are also aware of the difficulties
in making various assignments relate to each
other. According to Miss Strain, she and three
other Civ instructors are preparing a Western
Civ syllabus to be published by Holt, Rine
hart, and Winston. It will consist of one major
source book of two or three volumes supple
mented with about five paperbacks each quar
ter.
The new syllabus will be optional for Stan
ford Civ instructors next year. "It has more
unity than the present program. Basic themes
run all through the course, not just for one
quarter," Miss Strain said.
Purpose Questioned
Along with the disunity of the readings, stu
dents question the purpose of the survey
course. On a questionnaire filled out at Roble,
one freshman wrote: "Civ is frustrating and
seemingly pointless. It covers too much super
ficially and far too rapidly."
In a discussion group at Wilbur, a freshrran
boy observed, "I think we've come around to
the fact that someone is going to have to
positively define Western Civ. If it is truly a
survey course, the students should be warned
and accept it. It seems that most of the prob
lems that arise are merely due to unexpressed
goals and trying to throw too many conflict

ing purposes into one course."
The title of the course is History of Western
Civilization, but the question arises, is it really
history? Freshman Dirk Speas said, "It's not
history, but that's fine with me. But why not
blatently say it's a philosophy class?"
Probably the most frequent freshman com
plaint, however, is simply the heavy reading
load. "I end up spending fifty percent of my
time on Civ," claimed Bob Ziegler.
Mr. Buck admitted that the combination of
a survey course and a heavy reading load was
a serious gripe of many of his students. "We
do skim over the top of Western civilization,
and some students frankly can't hang on," he
added, continuing, "Students aren't taking just
Civ; they do have a commitment to other
classes, and some simply throw in the sponge."
Enough Work
One freshman girl commented, "Why not
make it a five-unit course? It has enough
work!"
Dr. David Savage, director of the Civ pro
gram, replied, however, "That's no solution.
I hate to think that students just think in
terms of units and grades."
Many students and instructors offered con
crete suggestions to allieviate their com
plaints. Suggested changes include a two-year
Civ program, more independent sections, al
terations in the "reading-discussion" format,
"pass-fail" grading, and a total reappraisal of
the freshman and general studies programs to
eliminate overlap.

Freshman Jori Woods added that "It's so
disconnected; it's hard to remember any
thing" and suggested that one assignment
could be read and discussed for an entire
week.
Instructors are also aware of the difficulties
in making various assignments relate to each
other. According to Miss Strain, she and three
other Civ instructors are preparing a Western
Civ syllabus to be published by Holt, Rine
hart, and Winston. It will consist of one major
source book of two or three volumes supple
mented with about five paperbacks each quar
ter.
The new syllabus will be optional for Stan
ford Civ instructors next year. "It has more
unity than the present program. Basic themes
run all through the course, not just for one
quarter," Miss Strain said.
Purpose Questioned
Along with the disunity of the readings, stu
dents question the purpose of the survey
course. On a questionnaire filled out at Roble,
one freshman wrote: "Civ is frustrating and
seemingly pointless. It covers too much super
ficially and far too rapidly."
In a discussion group at Wilbur, a freshrran
boy observed, "I think we've come around to
the fact that someone is going to have to
positively define Western Civ. If it is truly a
survey course, the students should be warned
and accept it. It seems that most of the prob
lems that arise are merely due to unexpressed
goals and trying to throw too many conflict

ing purposes into one course."
The title of the course is History of Western
Civilization, but the question arises, is it really
history? Freshman Dirk Speas said, "It's not
history, but that's fine with me. But why not
blatently say it's a philosophy class?"
Probably the most frequent freshman com
plaint, however, is simply the heavy reading
load. "I end up spending fifty percent of my
time on Civ," claimed Bob Ziegler.
Mr. Buck admitted that the combination of
a survey course and a heavy reading load was
a serious gripe of many of his students. "We
do skim over the top of Western civilization,
and some students frankly can't hang on," he
added, continuing, "Students aren't taking just
Civ; they do have a commitment to other
classes, and some simply throw in the sponge."
Enough Work
One freshman girl commented, "Why not
make it a five-unit course? It has enough
work!"
Dr. David Savage, director of the Civ pro
gram, replied, however, "That's no solution.
I hate to think that students just think in
terms of units and grades."
Many students and instructors offered con
crete suggestions to allieviate their com
plaints. Suggested changes include a two-year
Civ program, more independent sections, al
terations in the "reading-discussion" format,
"pass-fail" grading, and a total reappraisal of
the freshman and general studies programs to
eliminate overlap.
(Editor's Note: This is the first in a series
of articles on opinions, problems and sugges
tions concerning the Stanford Western Civ
program.)

Western Civ is Plato, Marx, McNeill, Wolin
. . . walking to the Civ Libe . . . sweating over
a blue book . . . writing a check for a foot
high pile of paperbacks . . . throwing a water
balloon in a civ riot. Western Civ is becoming
excited, stimulated, sometimes bored, often
frustrated.
Civ is a constant topic of conversation, es
pecially among freshmen. Praise of the course
is high: "After taking Western Civ, I don't
think I'll ever feel uninformed or uneducated
again"; "I feel I'm learning to understand his
tory, not merely learning it."
Complaints, however, are equally strong.
"It seems to me to be little more than a class
where students learn phrases to be dropped
at cocktail parties." "The department is just
trying to get a lot of liberal ideas down our
throats." "It has to be suffered through."
Ideas Emphasized
Favorable comments about the Civ program
mainly emphasize the ideas studied. One
freshman girl noted, "It's a good way to get
people to think about beliefs they've never be
fore questioned. It gives us an introduction to
the type of studying college requires, and pre
sents a background for subjects we will later
study in depth." Another mentioned, "Civ

deals with topics I'd always wondered about.
I had this picture of college—finding out what
Socrates said, for example—and this is what
you get in Civ."
A third freshman praised instructors who
"are trying to get us to come down to the nit
ty gritty and really think about this life."
Civ Instructor Donald Buck, commenting on
Western Civ, contrasted it to a course he had
previously taught at Cal. The latter was a
"traditional set-up" with a textbook and two
lectures a week for 500-700 students, "in short,
a preparatory course for exams."
Stanford's Civ program, he emphasized,
"has reoriented my whole thinking on teach
ing . . . for the better."
Purpose of Civ
Explaining his views on the purpose of Civ,
Mr. Buck explained, "We think and act on the
basis of past heritage. Civ tries to present a
means by which a student can begin to dis
cover historically who he is. In that sense, the
basic Civ format is marvelous."
Students, too, stress the idea that Civ should
relate to modern life, in some cases praising
correlations with today's world, and in others
complaining that "it doesn't apply today."
The most frequent complaints about Civ
concern class size, reading assignments, and
definitions of the program.
Nearly every instructor questioned on the
weaknesses of the system responded imme
diately that classes are too big. Instructor
Jacqueline Strain emphasized that "smaller

classes are the most important thing. The
problem, however, is that smaller classes
means more instructors and therefore more
money."
Instructor Douglas K. Wood answered that
"the first thing to be done is to get twice as
many instructors" or, if this is impossible,
seriously consider making the course volun
tary."
Reading Assignments
Concerning the syllabus, freshman Richard
Young stated, "Some things (like Rousseau)
make me violent, but some (such as Hannah
Arendt) put me to sleep. Most of the readings
are really good, but some are just junk."
A freshman girl complained that "second
quarter was especially abominable. It was
dull; there was the syllabus source problem;
the assignments were too long."
Many of the complaints center around the
variety and disunity of the readings. Demands
are made for reading more books in their en
tirety and for a basic textbook.
"I hate reading all these miscellaneous, me
diocre paperbacks," explained one freshman
boy. "I think they should go ahead and have
us buy some of the good hardbacks like Wo
lin and Weber."
Another complained of the technical diffi
culties in getting materials. "Half of the peo
ple are discouraged at the beginning of the
year just because they have so much trouble
at the Civ Libe. The new arrangement with
the syllabus sources has been much better."

Freshman Jori Woods added that "It's so
disconnected; it's hard to remember any
thing" and suggested that one assignment

study in depth." Another mentioned, "Civ

deals with topics I'd always wondered about.
I had this picture of college—finding out what
Socrates said, for example—and this is what
you get in Civ."
A third freshman praised instructors who
"are trying to get us to come down to the nit
ty gritty and really think about this life."
Civ Instructor Donald Buck, commenting on
Western Civ, contrasted it to a course he had
previously taught at Cal. The latter was a
"traditional set-up" with a textbook and two
lectures a week for 500-700 students, "in short,
a preparatory course for exams."
Stanford's Civ program, he emphasized,
"has reoriented my whole thinking on teach
ing . . . for the better."
Purpose of Civ
Explaining his views on the purpose of Civ,
Mr. Buck explained, "We think and act on the
basis of past heritage. Civ tries to present a
means by which a student can begin to dis
cover historically who he is. In that sense, the
basic Civ format is marvelous."
Students, too, stress the idea that Civ should
relate to modern life, in some cases praising
correlations with today's world, and in others
complaining that "it doesn't apply today."
The most frequent complaints about Civ
concern class size, reading assignments, and
definitions of the program.
Nearly every instructor questioned on the
weaknesses of the system responded imme
diately that classes are too big. Instructor
Jacqueline Strain emphasized that "smaller

classes are the most important thing. The
problem, however, is that smaller classes
means more instructors and therefore more
money."
Instructor Douglas K. Wood answered that
"the first thing to be done is to get twice as
many instructors" or, if this is impossible,
seriously consider making the course volun
tary."
Reading Assignments
Concerning the syllabus, freshman Richard
Young stated, "Some things (like Rousseau)
make me violent, but some (such as Hannah
Arendt) put me to sleep. Most of the readings
are really good, but some are just junk."
A freshman girl complained that "second
quarter was especially abominable. It was
dull; there was the syllabus source problem;
the assignments were too long."
Many of the complaints center around the
variety and disunity of the readings. Demands
are made for reading more books in their en
tirety and for a basic textbook.
"I hate reading all these miscellaneous, me
diocre paperbacks," explained one freshman
boy. "I think they should go ahead and have
us buy some of the good hardbacks like Wo
lin and Weber."
Another complained of the technical diffi
culties in getting materials. "Half of the peo
ple are discouraged at the beginning of the
year just because they have so much trouble
at the Civ Libe. The new arrangement with
the syllabus sources has been much better."

Freshman Jori Woods added that "It's so
disconnected; it's hard to remember any
thing" and suggested that one assignment
could be read and discussed for an entire
week.
Instructors are also aware of the difficulties
in making various assignments relate to each
other. According to Miss Strain, she and three
other Civ instructors are preparing a Western
Civ syllabus to be published by Holt, Rine
hart, and Winston. It will consist of one major
source book of two or three volumes supple
mented with about five paperbacks each quar
ter.
The new syllabus will be optional for Stan
ford Civ instructors next year. "It has more
unity than the present program. Basic themes
run all through the course, not just for one
quarter," Miss Strain said.
Purpose Questioned
Along with the disunity of the readings, stu
dents question the purpose of the survey
course. On a questionnaire filled out at Roble,
one freshman wrote: "Civ is frustrating and
seemingly pointless. It covers too much super
ficially and far too rapidly."
In a discussion group at Wilbur, a freshrran
boy observed, "I think we've come around to
the fact that someone is going to have to
positively define Western Civ. If it is truly a
survey course, the students should be warned
and accept it. It seems that most of the prob
lems that arise are merely due to unexpressed
goals and trying to throw too many conflict

ing purposes into one course."
The title of the course is History of Western
Civilization, but the question arises, is it really
history? Freshman Dirk Speas said, "It's not
history, but that's fine with me. But why not
blatently say it's a philosophy class?"
Probably the most frequent freshman com
plaint, however, is simply the heavy reading
load. "I end up spending fifty percent of my
time on Civ," claimed Bob Ziegler.
Mr. Buck admitted that the combination of
a survey course and a heavy reading load was
a serious gripe of many of his students. "We
do skim over the top of Western civilization,
and some students frankly can't hang on," he
added, continuing, "Students aren't taking just
Civ; they do have a commitment to other
classes, and some simply throw in the sponge."
Enough Work
One freshman girl commented, "Why not
make it a five-unit course? It has enough
work!"
Dr. David Savage, director of the Civ pro
gram, replied, however, "That's no solution.
I hate to think that students just think in
terms of units and grades."
Many students and instructors offered con
crete suggestions to allieviate their com
plaints. Suggested changes include a two-year
Civ program, more independent sections, al
terations in the "reading-discussion" format,
"pass-fail" grading, and a total reappraisal of
the freshman and general studies programs to
eliminate overlap.
(Editor's Note: This is the first in a series
of articles on opinions, problems and sugges
tions concerning the Stanford Western Civ
program.)

Western Civ is Plato, Marx, McNeill, Wolin
. . . walking to the Civ Libe . . . sweating over
a blue book . . . writing a check for a foot
high pile of paperbacks . . . throwing a water
balloon in a civ riot. Western Civ is becoming
excited, stimulated, sometimes bored, often
frustrated.
Civ is a constant topic of conversation, es
pecially among freshmen. Praise of the course
is high: "After taking Western Civ, I don't
think I'll ever feel uninformed or uneducated
again"; "I feel I'm learning to understand his
tory, not merely learning it."
Complaints, however, are equally strong.
"It seems to me to be little more than a class
where students learn phrases to be dropped
at cocktail parties." "The department is just
trying to get a lot of liberal ideas down our
throats." "It has to be suffered through."
Ideas Emphasized
Favorable comments about the Civ program
mainly emphasize the ideas studied. One
freshman girl noted, "It's a good way to get
people to think about beliefs they've never be
fore questioned. It gives us an introduction to
the type of studying college requires, and pre
sents a background for subjects we will later
study in depth." Another mentioned, "Civ

deals with topics I'd always wondered about.

ing purposes into one course."
The title of the course is History of Western
Civilization, but the question arises, is it really
history? Freshman Dirk Speas said, "It's not
history, but that's fine with me. But why not
blatently say it's a philosophy class?"
Probably the most frequent freshman com
plaint, however, is simply the heavy reading
load. "I end up spending fifty percent of my
time on Civ," claimed Bob Ziegler.
Mr. Buck admitted that the combination of
a survey course and a heavy reading load was
a serious gripe of many of his students. "We
do skim over the top of Western civilization,
and some students frankly can't hang on," he
added, continuing, "Students aren't taking just
Civ; they do have a commitment to other
classes, and some simply throw in the sponge."
Enough Work
One freshman girl commented, "Why not
make it a five-unit course? It has enough
work!"
Dr. David Savage, director of the Civ pro
gram, replied, however, "That's no solution.
I hate to think that students just think in
terms of units and grades."
Many students and instructors offered con
crete suggestions to allieviate their com
plaints. Suggested changes include a two-year
Civ program, more independent sections, al
terations in the "reading-discussion" format,
"pass-fail" grading, and a total reappraisal of
the freshman and general studies programs to
eliminate overlap.

of articles on opinions, problems and sugges
tions concerning the Stanford Western Civ
program.)

Western Civ is Plato, Marx, McNeill, Wolin
. . . walking to the Civ Libe . . . sweating over
a blue book . . . writing a check for a foot
high pile of paperbacks . . . throwing a water
balloon in a civ riot. Western Civ is becoming
excited, stimulated, sometimes bored, often
frustrated.
Civ is a constant topic of conversation, es
pecially among freshmen. Praise of the course
is high: "After taking Western Civ, I don't
think I'll ever feel uninformed or uneducated
again"; "I feel I'm learning to understand his
tory, not merely learning it."
Complaints, however, are equally strong.
"It seems to me to be little more than a class
where students learn phrases to be dropped
at cocktail parties." "The department is just
trying to get a lot of liberal ideas down our
throats." "It has to be suffered through."
Ideas Emphasized
Favorable comments about the Civ program
mainly emphasize the ideas studied. One
freshman girl noted, "It's a good way to get
people to think about beliefs they've never be
fore questioned. It gives us an introduction to
the type of studying college requires, and pre
sents a background for subjects we will later
study in depth." Another mentioned, "Civ

deals with topics I'd always wondered about.
I had this picture of college—finding out what
Socrates said, for example—and this is what
you get in Civ."
A third freshman praised instructors who
"are trying to get us to come down to the nit
ty gritty and really think about this life."
Civ Instructor Donald Buck, commenting on
Western Civ, contrasted it to a course he had
previously taught at Cal. The latter was a
"traditional set-up" with a textbook and two
lectures a week for 500-700 students, "in short,
a preparatory course for exams."
Stanford's Civ program, he emphasized,
"has reoriented my whole thinking on teach
ing . . . for the better."
Purpose of Civ
Explaining his views on the purpose of Civ,
Mr. Buck explained, "We think and act on the
basis of past heritage. Civ tries to present a
means by which a student can begin to dis
cover historically who he is. In that sense, the
basic Civ format is marvelous."
Students, too, stress the idea that Civ should
relate to modern life, in some cases praising
correlations with today's world, and in others
complaining that "it doesn't apply today."
The most frequent complaints about Civ
concern class size, reading assignments, and
definitions of the program.
Nearly every instructor questioned on the
weaknesses of the system responded imme
diately that classes are too big. Instructor
Jacqueline Strain emphasized that "smaller

classes are the most important thing. The
problem, however, is that smaller classes
means more instructors and therefore more
money."
Instructor Douglas K. Wood answered that
"the first thing to be done is to get twice as
many instructors" or, if this is impossible,
seriously consider making the course volun
tary."
Reading Assignments
Concerning the syllabus, freshman Richard
Young stated, "Some things (like Rousseau)
make me violent, but some (such as Hannah
Arendt) put me to sleep. Most of the readings
are really good, but some are just junk."
A freshman girl complained that "second
quarter was especially abominable. It was
dull; there was the syllabus source problem;
the assignments were too long."
Many of the complaints center around the
variety and disunity of the readings. Demands
are made for reading more books in their en
tirety and for a basic textbook.
"I hate reading all these miscellaneous, me
diocre paperbacks," explained one freshman
boy. "I think they should go ahead and have
us buy some of the good hardbacks like Wo
lin and Weber."
Another complained of the technical diffi
culties in getting materials. "Half of the peo
ple are discouraged at the beginning of the
year just because they have so much trouble
at the Civ Libe. The new arrangement with
the syllabus sources has been much better."

Freshman Jori Woods added that "It's so
disconnected; it's hard to remember any
thing" and suggested that one assignment
could be read and discussed for an entire
week.
Instructors are also aware of the difficulties
in making various assignments relate to each
other. According to Miss Strain, she and three
other Civ instructors are preparing a Western
Civ syllabus to be published by Holt, Rine
hart, and Winston. It will consist of one major
source book of two or three volumes supple
mented with about five paperbacks each quar
ter.
The new syllabus will be optional for Stan
ford Civ instructors next year. "It has more
unity than the present program. Basic themes
run all through the course, not just for one
quarter," Miss Strain said.
Purpose Questioned
Along with the disunity of the readings, stu
dents question the purpose of the survey
course. On a questionnaire filled out at Roble,
one freshman wrote: "Civ is frustrating and
seemingly pointless. It covers too much super
ficially and far too rapidly."
In a discussion group at Wilbur, a freshrran
boy observed, "I think we've come around to
the fact that someone is going to have to
positively define Western Civ. If it is truly a
survey course, the students should be warned
and accept it. It seems that most of the prob
lems that arise are merely due to unexpressed
goals and trying to throw too many conflict

ing purposes into one course."
The title of the course is History of Western
Civilization, but the question arises, is it really
