Dftar Miunsy and Daddy,
Here I am at last! The cam
pus is pretty with lots of trees,
and my room is nice. I know
you wanted me to have a single
room, but my roomate Alfonso
is okay. We don't talk very
much because he's always smok
ing a pipe and reading some
orange book with this Japanese
guy named Zen on the cover.

They have church services on
Sunday, and I'll go every week
like you told me to. My English
T.A. is quite radical. have
an essay due Friday on how Wi
have been victimized by society
Our sponsor told us all about
the rulers —we're not supposed
to drink alcoholic beverages, but
that doesn't affect me anyway.
The girls have to be home by
2:30, but I won't be going out.
Love and kisses—Your Johnny
