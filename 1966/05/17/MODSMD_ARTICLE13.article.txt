Dear Mommy and Daddy,
It's just about time for exams
to start, but I haven't studied
much because we have so much
fun around here just B.S.ing. I
think I'll pass anyway. Dean
Twirt told us that they like to
keep us in here.
My Western Civ book says
that Christ was a deluded fa
natic. Alfonso has converted to
Buddhism, and he talks a lot
about the most stuff he believes
in.
I've met a nice girl—you'd
like her, Mommy. She has long
blond hair and is from La Jolla.
I've never taken out a surfer
before.
Love—Johnny
