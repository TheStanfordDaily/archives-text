Dear Mother and Father,
Mid-terms are over now. My
grades were poor, but everyone
is pulling for me. You still pass
with D's.
They're trying to change the
liquor policy, but it won't make
any difference in our present
drinking habits. Everyone has
booze in his room. In fact, you
can do almost anything you
want around here, except kill
someone, and some guys have
even tried that. You should have
seen the flood on the first floor
yesterday.
Yes, that was my English
teacher's picture you saw in the
Vietnam story. I won't grow my
hair like that, so please don't
persist in this Annapolis busi
ness. I'm in ROTC, I gave
blood, and that's enough.
Love—John
