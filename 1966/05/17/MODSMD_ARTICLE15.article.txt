Dear Mom and Dad,
Just have a minute. . . I know
you want me to join Dad's old
frat, but I think I'm going to
live off campus with Alfonso.
Anything would be better than
what they call food here.
Sally's fine, and we're pulling
for the Health Service to change
their policy. I'm trying to grow
a beard, and I'm tiot taking the
draft test because I may become
a pacifist with Alfonso and
claim exemption as a C.O.
Don't bug me about church.
It's a waste of time, and I need
Sunday mornings to recuperate.
John
