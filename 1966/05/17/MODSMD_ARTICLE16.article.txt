Mother who bore
Me,
Father from whose
Seed
I have flow'red,
Awake!
The walls of my room
Cower
about my head.
God
is dead.
Man
has fled
from the earth and
has left
behind himâ€”you.
I'm tripped
out,
as it were.
Flunked out, tripped
out.
Don't worry.
I promise that this Sunday
I
Won't miss church.
Jonathan
