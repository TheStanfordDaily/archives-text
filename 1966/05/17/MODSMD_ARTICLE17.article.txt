### BARB EHRLICH Staff Editor 
"You are coming to Stanford.
You will arrive here with many
freshmen from high schools all
over the country. You will be
moving into a new, exciting, and
challenging way of life," ex
plains the Stanford Handbook.
Such were the expectations of
the freshmen. Were they satis
fied? Would they have come if
they had known what Stanford
was "really" like?
"Yes," said the vast majority
of freshmen asked. Of forty-five
freshmen men and women
polled, only four wished they
had not come.
"I'd change nothing," said a
Roble freshman. "I'm crazy
about every aspect of this
place."
But "yes" was often less than
enthusiastic. "Sure I'd come,"
said one boy. "I'm a masochist."
Academe on Society
"Through your years at Stan
ford, academics are of prime
importance," says the Hand
book, but some freshmen felt
differently.
"I didn't realize what a social
place this was," said a girl from
Cleveland. "It hit me really
wrong, it was such a party
school. I really love California,
but it's just not as intellectual
as I expected."
Some complaint about classes,
especially English, was general.
"Some of the classes, like Eng
lish, are worse than my high
school class," said one freshman.
"But I suppose the TA system
can't be helped.
"They're not as hard as I
thought, either—there's nothing
that's really beyond belief."
"It's just not intellectually
stimulating," said another Ro
ble coed. "This place has a long
way to go. I don't like the con
stant worry over our outside
image—how we have to keep
the alumni happy because it's
their money. Well, it's my
money, too."
Down On WUburness
But agreement on academics
is by no means unanimous. Said
freshman Marguerite Olson,
"People criticize Stanford for
lack of intellectual atmosphere,
but given the courses I've taken,
I think that there definitely is
an intellectual and stimu 1 " Jng
atmosphere."
The boys' major complaint
was the Wilburness: "The archi
tecture is poor; the dorms are
old and run down. There's just
no incentive for keeping them
up. Stanford needs coed hous
ing."
Yet for most freshmen college
was the most total education ex
perience of their lives. Summed
up one coed from St. Louis:
"I'm getting my parents used
to the idea that I'm going off
and doing things on my own
now, and Stanford's a good
place to start. I feel like I'm
living instead of just studying.
For freshmen it's a good place
to be."

the freshmen. Were they satis
fied? Would they have come if
they had known what Stanford
was "really" like?
"Yes," said the vast majority
of freshmen asked. Of forty-five
freshmen men and women
polled, only four wished they
had not come.
"I'd change nothing," said a
Roble freshman. "I'm crazy
about every aspect of this
place."
But "yes" was often less than
enthusiastic. "Sure I'd come,"
said one boy. "I'm a masochist."
Academe on Society
"Through your years at Stan
ford, academics are of prime
importance," says the Hand
book, but some freshmen felt
differently.
"I didn't realize what a social
place this was," said a girl from
Cleveland. "It hit me really
wrong, it was such a party
school. I really love California,
but it's just not as intellectual
as I expected."
Some complaint about classes,
especially English, was general.
"Some of the classes, like Eng
lish, are worse than my high
school class," said one freshman.
"But I suppose the TA system
can't be helped.
"They're not as hard as I
thought, either—there's nothing
that's really beyond belief."
"It's just not intellectually
stimulating," said another Ro
ble coed. "This place has a long
way to go. I don't like the con
stant worry over our outside
image—how we have to keep
the alumni happy because it's
their money. Well, it's my
money, too."
Down On WUburness
But agreement on academics
is by no means unanimous. Said
freshman Marguerite Olson,
"People criticize Stanford for
lack of intellectual atmosphere,
but given the courses I've taken,
I think that there definitely is
an intellectual and stimu 1 " Jng
atmosphere."
The boys' major complaint
was the Wilburness: "The archi
tecture is poor; the dorms are
old and run down. There's just
no incentive for keeping them
up. Stanford needs coed hous
ing."
Yet for most freshmen college
was the most total education ex
perience of their lives. Summed
up one coed from St. Louis:
"I'm getting my parents used
to the idea that I'm going off
and doing things on my own
now, and Stanford's a good
place to start. I feel like I'm
living instead of just studying.
For freshmen it's a good place
to be."
"You are coming to Stanford.
You will arrive here with many
freshmen from high schools all
over the country. You will be
moving into a new, exciting, and
challenging way of life," ex
plains the Stanford Handbook.
Such were the expectations of
the freshmen. Were they satis
fied? Would they have come if
