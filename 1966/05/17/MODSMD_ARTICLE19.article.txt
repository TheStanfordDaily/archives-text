# Draws To A Close
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY Managing Editor 
At Stanford, freshmen tumble
into college life.
They come in a traditional
spin of pre-reg excitement, into
a frantic scene of shouting, lug
ging, unpacking, crying, laugh
ing and shaking hands. It is the
same every year.
Eight months ago, the fresh
men—the Class of 1969—threw
themselves full force at Stan
ford's sandstone walls. This
spring they finally recovered
from the blow.
Agony and Ecstacy
The first week was agony for
the shy ones, ecstacy for the
politicians and extroverts. From
the very beginning, a game
(soon to grow old) was the in
troit and amen of every conver
sation.
"Hi! I'm Peter. Where are you
from? La Jolla? Gee, do you
know a guy . .
But no one complained. They
stumbled blindly from one intro
duction to another, from one in
struction to another, following
the pre-reg schedule in near-per
fect unison.
There was music, by Juan
Serrano, roses in the women's
dorms, serenades on the lawns,
and a considerable number of
dinner exchanges.
Optimism
A few had fuzzy doubts about
the mass blind dating system,
but these were usually squashed
by a roommate's careless com
ment: "At a place like this, any
body you get will be wonder
ful!"
The first week nobody com
plained about the food and
everybody went to church. A
small group skipped President
Sterling's tea and a rather large
group skipped the discussions on
Ellison, Orwell, and Salinger.
No one managed to avoid be
ing herded into the first home
football game, which had been
preceeded by an embarrassingly
unenthusiastic rally, but which
was, nonetheless, exciting.
A few days later, the panic
over registration began; the
forms were exasperating and
complicated, the procedure too
complex, the choices too impor
tant.
There was disappointment and
exultation expressed over lan
guage placement results and
over the dittoed lists of Special
English students. It felt a little
like high school for those
placed high or accepted into
honors classes, and somewhat
strange for those who were not.
Serious Business
But school began and even
freshmen got down to the seri
ous business of college life.
There were slang words and
jargon to memorize ("Do they
really call it Memorial As
phalt?), blue bicycles to buy,
several thousand Civ books to
resell, social regs to review,
classrooms to find, and —daily—
several Post Office trips to
make.
After some time, everyone got
set for Big Game, and all the
new discoveries normally asso
ciated with a first college term
filled the freshmen with happi
ness, disappointment and awe.

There were encounters with
midterms, the real dorm food,
disappointing TA's, Nobel Prize
winners, noisy corridors, intel
lectuals, pseudo - intellectuals,
corn kings, No-Doz, mononucle
osis, pot, flicks, Gaieties, and
the savored, subtle "velvet ham
mer."
The first applications were
taken for overseas campuses,
the first seminars finally got off
the ground; computer dating hit
it big. And the most often ques
tion heard on Quad was: "After
all I've heard about Stanford —
are these really the 'elite' of our
country?"
Commotion Dies
With time, the commotion over
"Sex in the Wilbur Parking Lot"
died, along with the Hoover
Tower jokes and the initial reso
lutions to remember everybody's
name.
For many, loneliness set in.
The boys and girls back home
seemed somehow more beauti
ful, the family happier, the
hometown an Illyria, a Came
lot, an Emerald City. Few knew
their roommates or friends well
enough to talk about it, so none
did, and some were disconsolate
for weeks.
But most pulled out of the
doldrums soon enough. There
were so many things to do, to
see, to talk about, that the fresh
men were forced to buck up.
The Civ Test
Or book up, as it were; finals
came. What gnashing of teeth
ensued over Civ! What moaning,
what indigestion, what des
paired melancholy, what com
pulsive eating, what feverish
notetaking and page turning!
But that, too, passed, and the
Sadducees and the Phairasees
were left forgotten in a thou
sand closed Bultmann's.
En masse, the Freshman class
packed up and went home.
Winter quarter opened much
more quietly, for now they all
had grown used to the college
routine, to hill parties and San
Francisco dates, to the horrors
of the Civ Libe, to the mechan
ics of the language lab. They
felt much more sophisticated,
much more College Joe, much
more confident.
Almost all ventured into the
stacks for the first time (just
to look around, mind you), and
skiing became the foremost
thought in everybody's mind.
They took for the hills in Volks
wagens, Mustangs, and Woodies,
hauling poles and suitcases, re
freshments and an occasional
typewriter.
Fine Life
"This college life isn't so bad!"
they exclaimed. The English pa
pers were easier to write, the
friends easier to talk to, the
weekends more fun, the classes
easier to skip. College life was
pretty fine.
Then the identity crises start
ed hitting them one by one.
They found it impossible to live
matter-of-factly with Wilbur
sponsors, the SSR.F, idealistic
Civ instructors, people with new
ideas, with foundation-shaking
philosophies and arguments to
back them up. They found them
selves forced into personal eval
uations of war, sex, religion,
politics, education.

The crisis did not happen in
one fell swoop; it came quietly
to those who felt it, and not at
all to many, but the effects were
clearly observable. More mean
ingful opinions, more exciting
discussions, more penetrating
essays, more moments of pro
found contemplation started
creeping into daily life.
The boys were taken through
the additional agony and excite
ment of rush, exposed to row
life, hill life, beach life, hill life,
row life. Once again The Game
was reinstated; they drank
punch, grinned, shook hands,
raised their hopes, and awaited
the pin or the ding with quiet
frenzy.
Vacation
Then, again, the finals were
over, and the freshmen took off,
some for work projects, some
for the mountains, some for the
beaches. Many went home —and
a few enjoyed the vacation so
much they forgot to come back.
By the time they finally re
turned, Stanford had blossomed
into Spring.
The lake was filled to its rim,
the ivy had grown green on the
school's only ivy-covered hall,
grass covered the Stanford hills,
and finally, the flowers bloomed
on inner Quad.
Stanford seemed to blossom in
other ways, too. Issues came to
a head. Decisions were made;
policies were changed. Much was
said about religion, liquor, sex,
the war, the draft, fraternities,
dope, education, authority, hair
and David Harris. The freshmen,
probably more than any other
class, were vitally interested in
these issues, and talked about
them, and most came to some
conclusions they knew would be
hard to explain to the folks back
home.
Sun Worshippers
All, of course, was not intense
intellectualism, for who could
work when the boys were ca
noeing on the lake? The sun
decks filled to overflowing. At
tendance at meals in girls'
dorms fell by an astounding
rate; bathing suits filled to over
flowing.
Parties and rush parties and
spring formals and pledge for
mals and pinnings and nights on
the beach all seemed to prove
that in Spring a young man's
fancy turns to other things. As
predicted, attendance at class
dropped, and students not only
forgot about the primary
sources readings in Civ — they
often forgot the class altogether,
Ateinosphere Changed
The girls got together to
draw for sophomore housing,
put on a strawberry brunch,
held an art show in the Roble
lobby. The boys reluctantly got
together for a draft test, and
began packing their books and
bottles into cardboard boxes.
The atmosphere around fresh
men dorms had changed, the at
titude was more congenial, and
though life was increasingly hec
tic, the students were propor
tionately more self-confident.
They had grown a lot during the
year—they had arrived — and
most of them knew it. College
life was pretty fine.
And one fourth of it is nearly
over.
