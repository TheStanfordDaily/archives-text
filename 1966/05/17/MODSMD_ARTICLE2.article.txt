# 'Civ Comm" To Conduct Opinion Poll
## 
### 
A newly-formed Civ evaluating
committee will distribute a poll to all
freshmen this week in an effort to
determine student reaction to the
course.
The group, called the Freshman Civ
Evaluating Committee, was formed
last week to discuss goals and prob
lems of the Western Civilization pro
gram.
Specific Requests
The group had originally approached
members of the department to ask
for general changes in the course and
were advised to formulate specific re
quests for improvements.
"The poli," said Pat McConeghy,
chairman of the group, "is designed
to determine what students think the
course's aims should be and what they
think the aims presently are."
McConeghy said the Civ Comm de
cided that unclearly stated goals re
sulted in students misunderstanding
the purposes of the course.
"Many students," commented a
member, "seem to be disappointed
when the class doesn't turn out the
way they imagined it would."
Varied Purposes
He also pointed out that purposes
seem to vary from instructor to in
structor. "Some seem to be trying to
acquaint students with a vast number
of historical facts and others seem to
be trying to shock them into thinking
for themselves," he said.
The committee also discussed prob
lems with sources and suggestions to
cut or increase the number of re
quired quarters of Civ. Several alter
native programs were mentioned, in
cluding one where the class would be
optional Winter and Spring Quarters.
One member suggested the course
be divided into two branches of spe
cialization, one for history and one
for philosophy.
According to McConeghy, the Civ
Comm poll also contains some ques
tions in reference to these alternative
programs.
Results In Daily
The question sheet will be distrib
uted in Wilbur during dinner and to
individual rooms in Roble and Bran
ner. The results will be compiled and
reported in The Daily next week.
A meeting of Civ instructors is be
ing held this week to discuss un
graded or "pass-fail" grading in Civ.
According to Dr. David Savage, the
University has authorized the Civ de
partment to try the system if the de
partment wishes next year.
