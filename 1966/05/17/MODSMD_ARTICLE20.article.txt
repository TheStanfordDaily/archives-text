# 'Aging' Frosh Reveal Attitude Changes
## 
### LANG Associate Editor 
More tolerant, more liberal—
that's how many freshmen de
scribe themselves after almost
eight months at Stanford.
Roble freshman Heather Drew,
who calls herself "quite conser
vative," said, "I've become more
open-minded and tolerant. I'm
not thinking only of political
things, but of social standards—
your values change.
"I used to have the feeling that
everyone should have the same
values as I do, but now I think
people should be able to live as
they believe. I don't condemn
them for their actions. But I've
decided what's right for me."
Unlike Their Parents
"They come quite conservative
personally as well as politically
and become a great deal more
liberal," said Miss Cora Mack,
director of Branner Hall. "They
find that they're quite different
from their parents."
Unlike most freshmen, Victor
Owen of Serra House felt that
"it hasn't been a very big
change, because my attitudes
started changing before I got
here. I've become more tolerant,"
he added, "you have to around
here."
Sex And Religion
Sex and religion—traditionally
the areas of most change—are
no longer so frequently men
tioned. Notwithstanding the in
fluence of the SSRF and Robert
MacAfee Brown, most freshmen
have retained the attitudes they
brought with them.
"My roommate, a sex hypro
crite, and I hassle over abortion
and prostitution all the time,"
said one Wilbur freshman, "but
my attitudes remain prudish as
ever."
"I do not believe that re
ligious attitudes have changed

very much," said a Roble girl
who attends church every Sun
day, "because not that many peo
ple had them to begin with."
r'udent Politics
The "liberalizing" is more
evident in a political context.
In recent years the freshman
class has been the most conser
vative in the University. A Daily
poll taken in October, 1964,
showed that freshman support
for Go Id water was the strongest
on campus; Wilbur Hall, the
only living group on campus
which did not go for Johnson,
gave him 53 per cent of its vote.
Yet by spring quarter this
year's freshmen were ready to
strongly support Dave Harris—
whom one girl's mother de
scribes as a "Cal reject"—and
surely not only because he is a
Wilbur sponsor.
Harris* Questions
"Dave Harris did something
for the student body in run
ning," commented Miss Sally
Mahoney, director of Roble Hall.
"Articulateness isn't the only
thing. He raised questions for in
dividuals who haven't thought
about anything all year, and he
raised them in a personal way."
"I've become more tolerant
and more questioning," said
Roble freshman Sue Weiss.
"That's a paradox—you're tol
erant of others' beliefs and ques
tioning toward your own. That's
what I feel Stanford has done
for me—especially in Civ."
But there is always dissent.
Intensified Conservatism
"I hold very conservative
views and actually this year they
haven't changed very much;
they've gotten more so," said
.Scott Morton of Serra.
"I kind of feel that things here
are on a superficial level and
that, people really don't get to
know each other," he contin

ued. "They don't seem to know
who are their friends and who
are their enemies; everybody is
just a kind of competitor for
some vague goal, I guess gradua
tion from the University."
As this remark implies, the
most startling changes have
come in ideas about the value
and methods of education.
"I used to be a terrible intel
lectual snob," said one Roble
girl. "Now I can't be."
"I really hate to see some
one go home after three quarters
here and say that they haven't
gotten anything here study
wise," said Liz Hardy of Roble.
"People come here expecting
college to lead them by the hand

through some wonderful realiza
tion of what life is really like,"
she added.
John Bergholt, who lives in
Cedro, remarked, "Coming from
a predominantly Midwestern
conservative anti-intellectual en
vironment, I have moved to a
predominantly Midwestern con
servative anti-intellectual atmo
sphere in the guise of a radical
University."
Attitudes towards self-involve
ment of all sorts have also
changed. Barbara Simon of
Roble has found that "active in
volvement is necessary even if
it's not directly effective."
Miss Mack reports that "at
Branner when they first came I

don't think they wanted to pick
up the reins and take off," but
that now the girls are much
more enthusiastic about running
the dorm.
John Lamson, Holladay's
freshman LASSU representa
tive, said, "Any positive influ
ence an underclassman gets is
from the leftists, the liberal kids
in LASSU. But I think school
changed me more than LASSU
did."
Unlimited Participation
But participation is not limit
ed to student government—"that
was high school," said one girl.
'To be president of something
ot- to be LASSU rep is an easily
identifiable position," said Miss
Mahoney. "People may not want
to assume traditional types of
offices. They're finding invol
vement in different kinds of
things."
Barbara Buckhom, Roble R.A.,
who helped with the organiza
tion of last week's successful all
freshman art show, saw a great
increase in this type of involve
ment. "This was a spontaneous
function," she said. "When the
whole thing came about it had
a relevancy for the people it
drew together."
Willingness To Listen
"It's too easy to say political
views have changed," observed
Miss Mahoney. "The willingness
to listen to other views has
changed. In September I felt
that people were listening only
out of politeness. I think there's
more real listening now."
Listening—and questioning—
and accepting or rejecting . . .
"I used to adjust myself to
school," reflects Sue Weiss, "but
now I can see that somethimes
maybe the teacher is wrong,
maybe the book is wrong, may
be the system is wrong. I'm just
learning that things aren't al
ways right."
