# Frosh Athletes Spectacular
## Frosh In Action! 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
When Stanford sports fans
saw the talent that came to the
Farm last September their en
thusiasm swelled. All eyes were
eager for a year of fine frosh
action.
But the young athletes and
their coaches had. even bigger
plans, and now, as the competi
tion comes to a close, this year's
frosh squads boast the most co
lossal set of records in the
school's history.
Not one team did less than
outstanding and losses were un
usually rare. Three squads went
undefeated, four had one loss,
two bowed twice and one lost
four—that is all.
The football squad began the
trend last fall with their unde
feated slate. Their 4-0-0 record
was comprised of overwhelming
victories — 24-13 against USC,
50-0 smear over San Jose State,
28-15 shame of Cal and a de
cisive 49-13 win from UCLA.

365. George Buehler traveled the
most on aerials at 112, while
the fabulous frosh quarteback
Gene Washington tossed 256
yards worth, and averaged 8.9
a carry to boot.
Bill Shoemaker's 37 points top

was followed by Nate Kirtman
who collected 26. Both Brough
ton and Washington totalled 24
points.
The big bad basketball team
finished its slate with a flour
ishing 15-2 mark.
Guard Don Griffin's deadly
scoring eye was relentless as
that eager marksman popped
15.3 per game. Griffin also grab
bed 107 rebounds during the
season—third best on the squad.
Top RelKHinder
It was the frosh's 6-4 Vfc cen
ter Mai McElwain who did the
best job off the boards. McEl
wain picked 194 and averaged
11.4. Forward Pete Hamm grab
bed 110 rebounds for a 6.5 avg.
Ray Young coached the best
frosh team Stanford ever had
this year which just finished its
season with an almost unbeliev
able 27-1-2 overall record and an
unbeaten league mark of 10-0-1.
Shining on the diamond for
this supcrsquad were thirdbase
man Bob Boone, who batted .365
for 115 at-bats, and outfielder
Chuck Hoffmeister, who hit .374.
Shortstop Ron Shotts led the
league with 3 homers besides
batting in 13 league play.
Stanford's freshman wrestling
team won 6 and lost only 1.
They took first place against
tough competition in the North
ern California Invitational, and
were far out ahead of second
place Cal Poly.
Len Borchers, varying from
152 to 160 lbs., accumulated 29
points during the season and
didn't allow any of his opponents
even one.
Smith's Swimmers
Coach Jim Smith's water po
loists finished the schedule with
12 wins and 4 losses. Louis Ni
colao was the top scorer at .410
percentage for 68 goals.
Smith's frosh swimmers wound
up an undefeated season with 7
wins and went on to take third
in the National AAU Cham
ionships.
Altogether, this year's swim
mers set 10 records. The 440
relay group marked a venerable
3:14.5 time. Dick Roth set a na
tional college freshman record in
the 200 Independent Medley.
The class of '69 cindermen
took only 1 defeat in 10 outings.
Pat Morrison was outstanding in
smashing two frosh records. He
did the 100 in 9.6 and the 220
in 21.0.

Boyce's Bound
Peter Boyce set a new frosh
and school record in the high
jump with a 6' 10%" leap. Tom
Kommers tied the high hurdles
14.5 mark and set a new time
in the intermediate hurdles in
38.2.
The frosh netmen went 9-0
this year, beating the City Col
lege of SF which had won the
Northern Cal Intercollegiate in
frosh and JC division.
With their sole loss to Wash
ington, the crew rowed through
to a 10-1 season. The number one
shell continues on to the West
ern sprints this weekend at Val
lejo.
Over at the links, Greg Pit
zer's consistently fine play
helped the linksmen to an 11-1
record Pitzer was accompanied
by talented teammates Bob Rid
dell, George Bevan and Joe Con
nolly.

This year's frosh "sports spec
tacular" must end on an optimis
tic note. With such talented ath
letes filing into next year's var
sity squads, the future of Stan
ford sports in the next few years
looks favorable.
A prime example of this in
vigorating frosh potential was
the recent varsity-alumni grid
iron battle which featured great
backfield performances by Gene
Washington and Marc Marquess
as well as other frosh.
So it seems that the eyes of
Stanford sports fans may be set
for some fine varsity action for
next year with the newly ele
vated class of '69 stars.
