# A 						Comprehensive View Of General Studies Advisors

"My advisor gives me less
assistance than the Courses and
Degrees Catalogue, less counsel
than my Civ TA, and less in
spiration than Wilbur" comment
ed one freshman discovering that
pre-reg was about to repeat its
cycle.
However, another freshman,
Sandy Shapiro, noted, "My ad
visor seemed to be well-informed
about different professors and
encouraged me to experiment
with my program."
Advising for General Studies
varies a great deal, the dif
ference resting with the indi
vidual advisor.
Department Heads Select
"Different department heads
select their candidate for advi
sors on the basis of which pro
fessors are available and will
have time for the added duties,"
said Dr. Harvey Hall, registrar
and chairman of the Subcommit
tee on Advising to the General
Studies Committee. Other pro
fessors also volunteer to advise
freshmen, or to continue advis
ing them.
Students interested in the
humanities are usually given an
advisor in the humanities, pre
med in the sciences, and engi
neers, engineering profs. Stu
dents in the same living groups
are assigned to one advisor, and

those with no preference for a
general field are used to fill up
the groups of 10-15 advisees.
Next fall, students will be in
corporated into the pre-reg pro
gram of advising. Sponsors and
members of the pre-reg commit
tee will be briefed by Dr. Hall
on information to help the fresh
men register. Hall said, "Stu
dents can better help the fresh
men with the mechanics of reg
istration—where to go, what to
do in the Pavilion."
Referral Agency
The responsibility for assist
ing the student in planning his
program remains with the advis
or, Hall emphasized. He said
that he saw the advisor's role as
one to direct the student toward
considering majors, and also as
a "referral agency." That is, an
advisor should direct students to
other people who can help them
with particular questions con
cerning majors, the draft, and
other such areas.
Advisors see their own roles
differently, which might account
for the varied opinions about
the position. Associate Director
of Admissions Douglas R. Walk
er, an advisor for 6 years, noted
in an interview with The Daily
that he has tried to develop a
"personal relationship" with his
advisees. He felt that there was
"little in the way of recommen
dations" due to the standard
freshman course requirements.
Walker added that he thought
an advisor should be "a good
person to drop by and talk to."
He felt the advising and counsel
ing were "good therapy."
Criticisms
Professor John H. Thomas of
Statistical Biology hoped that
students could see any member
of the faculty should the student
have a "problem." He had sev
eral criticisms of the system in
general. He thought that the ad
visors had too much "routine,
clerical work" which could be
handled in the Registrar's Office.
Thomas also wondered if cer
tain juniors and seniors might
be better qualified to advise
students. "I don't know too much
about Psych 1, or Soc. 1,"
Thomas continued, "after all, it's
been twenty years since I've
taken those courses."
Thomas said that the present
role of an advisor, as he saw it,
was to point out the choices and
pitfalls, but to leave the final
decision to the student.
The Subcommittee on Advis
ing of which Dr. Hall is chair
man consists of students and
faculty mutually interested in
the advising program. Besides
Dr. Hall, professors on the com
mittee include Drs. Grommon,
Krauskopf, Farnsworth, and
Walker.
Survey Completed
The committee has just com
pleted a survey of the freshman
advisors, and while the results
are not completely summarized
it was found that 80 per cent
enjoyed advising.
New advisors for the Class of
'70 are now being selected, Hall
noted. Once selected, he added,
members of the committee will
talk to the advisors and try to
inform them of their duties and
offer suggestions.

general. He thought that the ad
visors had too much "routine,
clerical work" which could be
handled in the Registrar's Office.
Thomas also wondered if cer

be better qualified to advise
students. "I don't know too much
about Psych 1, or Soc. 1,"
Thomas continued, "after all, it's
been twenty years since I've
taken those courses."
Thomas said that the present
role of an advisor, as he saw it,
was to point out the choices and

The Subcommittee on Advis
ing of which Dr. Hall is chair
man consists of students and
faculty mutually interested in
the advising program. Besides
Dr. Hall, professors on the com
mittee include Drs. Grommon,
Krauskopf, Farnsworth, and
Walker.
Survey Completed
The committee has just com
pleted a survey of the freshman
advisors, and while the results
are not completely summarized
it was found that 80 per cent
enjoyed advising.
New advisors for the Class of
'70 are now being selected, Hall
noted. Once selected, he added,
members of the committee will
talk to the advisors and try to
inform them of their duties and
offer suggestions.
"My advisor gives me less
assistance than the Courses and
Degrees Catalogue, less counsel
than my Civ TA, and less in
spiration than Wilbur" comment
ed one freshman discovering that
pre-reg was about to repeat its
cycle.
However, another freshman,
Sandy Shapiro, noted, "My ad
visor seemed to be well-informed
about different professors and
encouraged me to experiment
with my program."
Advising for General Studies
varies a great deal, the dif
ference resting with the indi
vidual advisor.
Department Heads Select
"Different department heads
select their candidate for advi
sors on the basis of which pro
fessors are available and will
have time for the added duties,"
said Dr. Harvey Hall, registrar
and chairman of the Subcommit
tee on Advising to the General
Studies Committee. Other pro
fessors also volunteer to advise
freshmen, or to continue advis
ing them.
Students interested in the
humanities are usually given an
advisor in the humanities, pre
med in the sciences, and engi
neers, engineering profs. Stu
dents in the same living groups
are assigned to one advisor, and

those with no preference for a
general field are used to fill up
the groups of 10-15 advisees.
Next fall, students will be in
corporated into the pre-reg pro
gram of advising. Sponsors and
members of the pre-reg commit
tee will be briefed by Dr. Hall
on information to help the fresh
men register. Hall said, "Stu
dents can better help the fresh
men with the mechanics of reg
istration—where to go, what to
do in the Pavilion."
Referral Agency
The responsibility for assist
ing the student in planning his
program remains with the advis
or, Hall emphasized. He said
that he saw the advisor's role as
one to direct the student toward
considering majors, and also as
a "referral agency." That is, an
advisor should direct students to
other people who can help them
with particular questions con
cerning majors, the draft, and
other such areas.
Advisors see their own roles
differently, which might account
for the varied opinions about
the position. Associate Director
of Admissions Douglas R. Walk
er, an advisor for 6 years, noted
in an interview with The Daily
that he has tried to develop a
"personal relationship" with his
advisees. He felt that there was
"little in the way of recommen
dations" due to the standard
freshman course requirements.
Walker added that he thought
an advisor should be "a good
person to drop by and talk to."
He felt the advising and counsel
ing were "good therapy."

Professor John H. Thomas of
Statistical Biology hoped that
