### RISSA WHITE Associate Editor 
Students and professors alike
overwhelmingly praised the
Freshman Seminar Program, ex
perimentally initiated this year
"to encourage creativity and de
velopment in the individual stu
dent." The only "complaint" was
that the limitations of the budg
et prevented some from partici
pating.
Students cite close student
professor relationships as the
outstanding aspect of the pro
gram. Professors almost unani
mously termed the program
"great." They were impressed
with their classes, and many ad
mitted that they learned a great
deal from their students.
The program's success has led
to its extension for a minimum
of two more years, according to
Elizabeth Webb, freshman semi
nar director. Next year's pro
gram is already expanded to 45
seminars from this year's 38.
20 Per Cent Participated
The program started with a
grant by an anonymous donor,
and continued when more than
500 students applied for 260
openings. Approximately 20 per
cent of the freshman class par
ticipated in the seminars.
Seminars consisted of from
two to eight students each. They
were not advanced placement
programs, and most listed only
"interest and enthusiasm" as
prerequisites. Members volun
teered and were chosen at ran
dom. They met once or twice a
week over a period of two quar
ters for three units of credit per
quarter.
By meeting for two quarters
rather than the usual one, "stu
dents and instructor, working
together for approximately two
thirds of an academic year, were
able to establish among them
selves a genuine sense of both
intellectual and social commu
nity," noted Mrs. Webb.
Personal Contact With Profs
"The seminar approach is good
especially for first quarter
freshmen," commented Linda
Schuck, who studied Analysis of
Human Behavior with Prof. Ju
dith Polefka. "The first time we
met, I felt that this was sort of
my family, something to identi
fy with in a big university com
munity."
"Meeting at the professor's
home is important," pointed out
Marianne Medved, who met with
Prof. John Goheen for Readings
in Ancient Medieval Philosophy.
"We met on an informal basis
with Prof. Goheen, and also got
to know a small group of stu
dents well."
Carolyn Cotter felt the rela
tionship with the professor
served to destroy the idea that
a "professor is some big guy in
the sky—they're human!" She
was enrolled in "Modern Ballads
and Their Backgrounds" under
Prof. Claude Simpson.
Some Dissatisfied
Not every student wa6 pleased
with his professor. Nancy Hoch
berg felt her instructor's level
of learning was above the
course material. "We didn't
know where we were going and
he didn't know how to direct
us." She was enrolled in Prof.
S. G. O'Hair's Knowledge and
Belief, but dropped out for the
second quarter.
On the whole, however, pro

lessors "made" the course. Mar
ty Cooper was pleased with the
partnership basis established in
her Introduction to Experimen
tal Pathology lab. Only one oth
er student, Dan Maloney; a
third year medical student, Bob
Sherman; and the professor—

Dr. Robert Rosan, participated.
The seminar was devoted to
an experiment on the use of
lasers on the retinas of rabbits.
Though the seminar is over now,
research is continuing. Because
the field is new, "no one knew
any more than anyone else."

Commenting on this seminar,
Dr. Rosan said, "I didn't know
who was lecturing to whom. I'm
extremely impressed by the kind
of freshmen here. My only com
plaint is that we had trouble
convincing them that they're
equal. I also wish we had more
space. We had 34 applicants for
2 positions."
Not Enlightened Coffee Break
"The seminar is a difficult
thing to teach," notes Prof. Den
nis Doolin, who taught Modern
Chinese Literature. "The in
structor must keep it informal
and yet not let it turn into an
enlightened coffee break."
Dr. Rosan was vehemently
opposed to grades. "They are
assmine on almost any occa
sion, but for this seminar pro
gram, they are repulsive. How
can you grade an experiment?"
Said Bill Bently, a student in
Psychological Approaches to
Animal Behavior: "Grades help
keep you on your toes. But we
weren't worried about grades.
Everyone in the cla6s was in
terested in the subject or he
wouldn't have signed up. We
enjoyed our work."
Grading Was Liberal
"Professors were pretty lib
eral with the grades," admitted
Carolyn Cotter. "In fact, some
students outside of the seminar
program complained because
our grades raised our averages."
Most professors agreed that
they graded on an A/B curve
and all but ignored the grades.
Marks weren't released until the
second quarter of the seminar.
"Interest in the subject mat
ter, rather tha"n the need to
work for grades, has led many
students to devote even moro
time to seminar study than to
courses in which they are re
ceiving letter grades on a regu
lar basis," pointed out Mrs.
Webb.
Freshmen were excited to find
how much their seminars re
lated to Civ. Marianne Medved
noted that in her class, "the
same subject matter was ap
proached differently. The semi
nar covered a more limited area,
and therefore was more in
depth."

2 positions."
Not Enlightened Coffee Break
"The seminar is a difficult
thing to teach," notes Prof. Den
nis Doolin, who taught Modern
Chinese Literature. "The in
structor must keep it informal
and yet not let it turn into an
enlightened coffee break."
Dr. Rosan was vehemently
opposed to grades. "They are
assmine on almost any occa
sion, but for this seminar pro
gram, they are repulsive. How
can you grade an experiment?"
Said Bill Bently, a student in
Psychological Approaches to
Animal Behavior: "Grades help
keep you on your toes. But we
weren't worried about grades.
Everyone in the cla6s was in
terested in the subject or he
wouldn't have signed up. We
enjoyed our work."
Grading Was Liberal
"Professors were pretty lib
eral with the grades," admitted
Carolyn Cotter. "In fact, some
students outside of the seminar
program complained because
our grades raised our averages."
Most professors agreed that
they graded on an A/B curve
and all but ignored the grades.
Marks weren't released until the
second quarter of the seminar.
"Interest in the subject mat
ter, rather tha"n the need to
work for grades, has led many
students to devote even moro
time to seminar study than to
courses in which they are re
ceiving letter grades on a regu
lar basis," pointed out Mrs.
Webb.
Freshmen were excited to find
how much their seminars re
lated to Civ. Marianne Medved
noted that in her class, "the
same subject matter was ap
proached differently. The semi
nar covered a more limited area,
and therefore was more in
depth."
Students and professors alike
overwhelmingly praised the
Freshman Seminar Program, ex
perimentally initiated this year
"to encourage creativity and de
velopment in the individual stu
dent." The only "complaint" was
that the limitations of the budg
et prevented some from partici
pating.
Students cite close student
professor relationships as the
outstanding aspect of the pro
gram. Professors almost unani
mously termed the program
"great." They were impressed
with their classes, and many ad
mitted that they learned a great
deal from their students.
The program's success has led
to its extension for a minimum
of two more years, according to
Elizabeth Webb, freshman semi
nar director. Next year's pro
gram is already expanded to 45
seminars from this year's 38.
20 Per Cent Participated
The program started with a
grant by an anonymous donor,
and continued when more than
500 students applied for 260
openings. Approximately 20 per
cent of the freshman class par
ticipated in the seminars.
Seminars consisted of from
two to eight students each. They
were not advanced placement
programs, and most listed only
"interest and enthusiasm" as
prerequisites. Members volun
teered and were chosen at ran
dom. They met once or twice a
week over a period of two quar
ters for three units of credit per
quarter.
By meeting for two quarters
rather than the usual one, "stu
dents and instructor, working
together for approximately two
thirds of an academic year, were
able to establish among them
selves a genuine sense of both
intellectual and social commu
nity," noted Mrs. Webb.
Personal Contact With Profs
"The seminar approach is good
especially for first quarter
freshmen," commented Linda
Schuck, who studied Analysis of
Human Behavior with Prof. Ju
dith Polefka. "The first time we
met, I felt that this was sort of
my family, something to identi
fy with in a big university com
munity."
"Meeting at the professor's
home is important," pointed out
Marianne Medved, who met with
Prof. John Goheen for Readings
in Ancient Medieval Philosophy.
"We met on an informal basis
with Prof. Goheen, and also got
to know a small group of stu
dents well."
Carolyn Cotter felt the rela
tionship with the professor
served to destroy the idea that
a "professor is some big guy in
the sky—they're human!" She
was enrolled in "Modern Ballads
and Their Backgrounds" under
Prof. Claude Simpson.
Some Dissatisfied
Not every student wa6 pleased
with his professor. Nancy Hoch
berg felt her instructor's level
of learning was above the
course material. "We didn't
know where we were going and
he didn't know how to direct
us." She was enrolled in Prof.
S. G. O'Hair's Knowledge and
Belief, but dropped out for the
second quarter.
On the whole, however, pro

lessors "made" the course. Mar
ty Cooper was pleased with the
partnership basis established in
her Introduction to Experimen
tal Pathology lab. Only one oth
er student, Dan Maloney; a
third year medical student, Bob
Sherman; and the professor—

Dr. Robert Rosan, participated.
The seminar was devoted to
an experiment on the use of
lasers on the retinas of rabbits.
Though the seminar is over now,
research is continuing. Because
the field is new, "no one knew
any more than anyone else."

Commenting on this seminar,
Dr. Rosan said, "I didn't know
who was lecturing to whom. I'm
extremely impressed by the kind
of freshmen here. My only com
plaint is that we had trouble
convincing them that they're
equal. I also wish we had more
space. We had 34 applicants for

"We met on an informal basis
with Prof. Goheen, and also got
to know a small group of stu
dents well."
Carolyn Cotter felt the rela
tionship with the professor
served to destroy the idea that
a "professor is some big guy in
the sky—they're human!" She
was enrolled in "Modern Ballads
and Their Backgrounds" under
Prof. Claude Simpson.
Some Dissatisfied
Not every student wa6 pleased
with his professor. Nancy Hoch
berg felt her instructor's level
of learning was above the
course material. "We didn't
know where we were going and
he didn't know how to direct
us." She was enrolled in Prof.
S. G. O'Hair's Knowledge and
Belief, but dropped out for the
second quarter.
On the whole, however, pro

lessors "made" the course. Mar
ty Cooper was pleased with the
partnership basis established in
her Introduction to Experimen
tal Pathology lab. Only one oth
er student, Dan Maloney; a
third year medical student, Bob
Sherman; and the professor—

Dr. Robert Rosan, participated.
The seminar was devoted to
an experiment on the use of
lasers on the retinas of rabbits.
Though the seminar is over now,
research is continuing. Because
the field is new, "no one knew
any more than anyone else."

Commenting on this seminar,
Dr. Rosan said, "I didn't know
who was lecturing to whom. I'm
extremely impressed by the kind
of freshmen here. My only com
plaint is that we had trouble
convincing them that they're
equal. I also wish we had more
space. We had 34 applicants for
2 positions."
Not Enlightened Coffee Break
"The seminar is a difficult
thing to teach," notes Prof. Den
nis Doolin, who taught Modern
Chinese Literature. "The in
structor must keep it informal
and yet not let it turn into an
enlightened coffee break."
Dr. Rosan was vehemently
opposed to grades. "They are
assmine on almost any occa
sion, but for this seminar pro
gram, they are repulsive. How
can you grade an experiment?"
Said Bill Bently, a student in
Psychological Approaches to
Animal Behavior: "Grades help
keep you on your toes. But we
weren't worried about grades.
Everyone in the cla6s was in
terested in the subject or he
wouldn't have signed up. We
enjoyed our work."
Grading Was Liberal
"Professors were pretty lib
eral with the grades," admitted
Carolyn Cotter. "In fact, some
students outside of the seminar
program complained because
our grades raised our averages."
Most professors agreed that
they graded on an A/B curve
and all but ignored the grades.
Marks weren't released until the
second quarter of the seminar.
"Interest in the subject mat
ter, rather tha"n the need to
work for grades, has led many
students to devote even moro
time to seminar study than to
courses in which they are re
ceiving letter grades on a regu
lar basis," pointed out Mrs.
Webb.
Freshmen were excited to find
how much their seminars re
lated to Civ. Marianne Medved
noted that in her class, "the
same subject matter was ap
proached differently. The semi
nar covered a more limited area,
and therefore was more in
depth."
Students and professors alike
overwhelmingly praised the
Freshman Seminar Program, ex
perimentally initiated this year
"to encourage creativity and de
velopment in the individual stu
dent." The only "complaint" was
that the limitations of the budg
et prevented some from partici
pating.
Students cite close student
professor relationships as the
outstanding aspect of the pro
gram. Professors almost unani
mously termed the program
"great." They were impressed
with their classes, and many ad
mitted that they learned a great
deal from their students.
The program's success has led
to its extension for a minimum
of two more years, according to
Elizabeth Webb, freshman semi
nar director. Next year's pro
gram is already expanded to 45
seminars from this year's 38.
20 Per Cent Participated
The program started with a
grant by an anonymous donor,
and continued when more than
500 students applied for 260
openings. Approximately 20 per
cent of the freshman class par
ticipated in the seminars.
Seminars consisted of from
two to eight students each. They
were not advanced placement
programs, and most listed only
"interest and enthusiasm" as
prerequisites. Members volun
teered and were chosen at ran
dom. They met once or twice a
week over a period of two quar
ters for three units of credit per
quarter.
By meeting for two quarters
rather than the usual one, "stu
dents and instructor, working
together for approximately two
thirds of an academic year, were
able to establish among them
selves a genuine sense of both
intellectual and social commu
nity," noted Mrs. Webb.
Personal Contact With Profs
"The seminar approach is good
especially for first quarter
freshmen," commented Linda
Schuck, who studied Analysis of
Human Behavior with Prof. Ju
dith Polefka. "The first time we
met, I felt that this was sort of
my family, something to identi
fy with in a big university com
munity."
"Meeting at the professor's
home is important," pointed out
Marianne Medved, who met with
Prof. John Goheen for Readings
in Ancient Medieval Philosophy.

with Prof. Goheen, and also got
