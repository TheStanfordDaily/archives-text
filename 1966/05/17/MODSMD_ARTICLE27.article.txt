# From 7,700 Applicants How Did I Ever Get In?

### SANDY SHAPIRO News Editor 
With tears in her eyes and D's
on her midterms, an attractive
freshman dolly wailed, "Oh why
did they ever accept me? I'm
just not smart enough for this
place!"
Many other freshmen asked
this question after their first
encounter with college exams
fall quarter. The Stanford Uni
versity Bulletin proclaims:
"Stanford enrollment is limited
to a figure which permits a
favorable student-faculty ratio
. . . . the University wishes to
preserve its residential char
acter. ... as a result there are
many more applicants than
available places, and only the
better-qualified applicants can
be accepted."
90 Per Cent Academically
Qualified
Determining just who are the
"better-qualified" a p p 1 i c a nts
proves to be a most difficult
task, according to Douglas Wal
ker, associate director of admis
sions. He explained that out of
7700 applicants for the class of
'69, over 90 per cent were aca
demically qualified for Stanford
work.
From this group, 1350 men
and 550 women wore admitted,
and about 63 per cent of the
men and 73 per cent of the wo
men replied affirmatively. Walk
er explained that Harvard and
Radcliffe received the larg
est number of students who did
n't accept Stanford's bid.
According to Walker, high
school grade averages for pres
ent freshmen varied from 3.1 to
4:0 with 3.7 as an approximate
median. S.A.T. scores ranged
from 490 to 800. Average verbal
and math scores for girls were
670 and 640, respectively, with
the figures reversed for the
boys.
Activities Count
'"I would estimate that nearly
25 per cent of this year's fresh
men held some type of student
body office, and almost that
many were active in journal
ism," Walker said.
"Grades are still the most im
portant think we consider, but
with so many outstanding schol
ars, we must also look for well
rounded activities." Walker ex
plained that he discourages stu
dents with a single, concentrated
interest from applying to Stan
ford. "They just won't be hap
py here, and we lose a small
number every year because they
are not pleased with the broad
perspective of our General Stu
dies Program."
Walker and other members of
the admissions staff visit over
900 high schools a year to talk
about Stanford. "I prefer a ques
tion-and-answer session with in
terested students, and I tell the

college counselors about our
program changes, awards, and
activities. I don't mention things
like the Overseas Campuses un
less I'm asked because I dislike
a gimmick approach," Walker
said.
A Letters
One of the programs Stanford
has initiated recently to increase
the number of acceptances from
desirable high school seniors is
the "A Letters." "This is our
answer to other colleges' early
admission policies. We accept a
certain number of applicants in
January and in February, but
they aren't required to reply
until the regular May date,"
Walker explained.
Last year 200 A Letters were
sent, and 51 per cent of the re
cipients are presently enrolled
as freshmen. Walker added that
this was a good return consider
ing the caliber of these students.
More Girls?
When asked if he anticipated
any changes in the general ad
missions policies Walker re
plied, "I'd like to see us admit
more freshmen women, person
ally, but as far as I know no
plans have been made to de
crease the famous ratio."
He added that the incoming
freshman class contains slightly
more students with specialized
interests, but the majority have
varied backgrounds.
As an encouraging note
Walker added that less than 1
per cent of the present freshman
class will be asked to leave for
academic deficiency. Another 4
per cent may not return for per
sonal reasons.
