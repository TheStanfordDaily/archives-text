# The 						Old Grind
## Integrating Those Freshmen 
### Eric Miller 
In the fall of 1968, Stanford
will take a major step in the
impleinenatation of its purport
ed philosophy of co-education
and residence education.
The Moore and Jacks Houses,
scheduled for completion at that
time, will accommodate 550 stu
dents equal numbers of men
and women, all juniors or sen
iorsâ€”in two complexes which
will emphasize the inclusion of
classrooms and faculty members
in the residences themselves. The
design opposes the old expedi
ency of the "domitory," as em
bodied by most of the other liv
ing quarters that the University
now provides.
The hope is to incorporate the
idea of education with the idea
of living and establish true co
education.
It is not, of course, a new
concept.. The authors of Stan
ford's bulletins and handbooks
have been writing about it for
years. Yet the opening of Moore
and Jacks will be only the be
ginning of an experiment. It will
no doubt be some years before
any great consideration will be
given to the conversion of other
dormitories so that more than
a small percentage of the under
graduates will have the option
of co-ed and education residence
at this institution of a co-ed and

residence education.
The necessity for slow and
deliberate change must be rec
ognized. The freshman living
situation is probably far down
the continuum of major renova
tion, while being one of the most
in need of change.
There are three acute defects
in the freshman experience
which seem to result, in a large
part, from the living situation:
an initial isolation from the
rest of the University, a dico
tomy of the sexes which causes
a "boarding school" attitude to
wards dating, and the separation
between living and education.
The logical solution gets the
freshman right where he lives.
Integrate the boys and frosh
dollies when they first, arrive in
September, throw in a few up
perclassmen, and let a larger
number of faculty and grad stu
dents become closely associated
with the residences.
No Barrier
The existing facilities are not
prohibitive to co-ed living. That
is, they aren't unless we consider
such things as the windows in
the bathroom to be major prob
lems. And Stern is already an
example of combining freshmen
with upperclassmen.
Wilbur as it is provides an
escape for many freshman men,

and a hide-away from creeping
intellectualism and the pressures
of the ratio.
Roble and Branner, according
to the testimonies of current
residents and upperclassmen
who regard their frosh dolly
dorm as the worst experience
that Stanford has forced on
them, foster the inevitable
round table of gossip toward
which girls have an innate ten
dency.
It is not, of course, valid to
blame entirely the inadequacy of
our contact during the freshman
year on the buildings we live
in. Why, however, perpetuate the
artificial barriers which oppose
a quick realization of the true
relationships with the opposite
sex and the University as a
whole?
Moore and Jacks is only a
start, and a late one at that. It is
not a start where the problems
start. The life of a freshman, the
single most, crucial period of a
student's life, has many barren
areas which cannot be really be
filled with associates, faculty
and upperclassmen, eating their
lunch in the dorms or with ex
changes between the freshman
residences. Serious consideration
need be given now to the inte
gration of all dormities, both by
sex and class.
