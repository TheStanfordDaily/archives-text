## The 						Wilbur Pseudo-Liberal 
### Jim Shoch 
The events of the last several
weeks have brought to my at
tention the existence of a trend
at Stanford that seems to be
growing more rapidly every day.
For lack of a better term, I
shall call this trend "pseudo
liberalism."
There can be no doubt that
the genuine liberal movement
that does in fact exist at Stan
ford is a healthy and promising
indication of the emerging atti
tudes of some of the students at
this University. But I wonder
how many actually apathetic stu
dents are being swept along
with the tide.
There is currently being cir
culated in Wilbur a petition de
signed to bring about reforms in

the Wilbur system and espe
cially in the activities of the
headmaster, Dr. Eric Hutchin
son. As regards Dr. Hutchinson,
the petition asks that he resign
his position as Director of the
Public Affairs Fellowship Pro
gram, lighten his teaching load,
and live and eat in Wilbur in the
hope that this will allow him
to take a more active role in
communicating with the stu
dents and promoting the intel
lectual goals that he advocated
at the beginning of the year.
These demands are tantamout
to asking for Dr. Hutchinson's
resignation, for it is unlikely
that he would ever agree to meet
all the required conditions. There
can be no doubting the value of

the above-listed ideas to the stu
dents who are genuinely inter
ested in them.
I strongly take issue .however,
with those students who have
signed the petition but who have
no real interest in what it hopes
to accomplish. These students
have signed out of conformity
to the "pseudo-liberalism" that I
have attempted to describe.
These students maintain that
they would like to see greater
communication with the head
master, but how many of them
have ever visited Dr. Hutchinson
during his regular office hours?
Perhaps Dr. Hutchinson is not
an interesting speaker, but this
does not say much for the en
thusiasm of the freshmen men.
There have been many other lec
tures not arranged by Dr. Hutch
inson but more poorly attended.
The petition, conceived by
concerned, well - meaning stu
dents, is being signed in large
numbers by students who are
victims of the apathy that large
ly engulfs this university and
who are merely "following the
crowd," so to speak, in their ac
tions.
It may be idealistic to hope
that the time will come when
every student may choose by
careful thought and considera
tion his own course of action
independent from the behavior
of others. Nevertheless, I be
lieve that it is with the attain
ment of this goal that he uni
versiy and its responsible stu
dents must be concerned.

inson but more poorly attended.
The petition, conceived by
concerned, well - meaning stu
dents, is being signed in large
numbers by students who are
victims of the apathy that large
ly engulfs this university and
who are merely "following the
crowd," so to speak, in their ac
tions.
It may be idealistic to hope
that the time will come when
every student may choose by
careful thought and considera
tion his own course of action
independent from the behavior
of others. Nevertheless, I be
lieve that it is with the attain
ment of this goal that he uni
versiy and its responsible stu
dents must be concerned.
The events of the last several
weeks have brought to my at
tention the existence of a trend
at Stanford that seems to be
growing more rapidly every day.
For lack of a better term, I
shall call this trend "pseudo
liberalism."
There can be no doubt that
the genuine liberal movement
that does in fact exist at Stan
ford is a healthy and promising
indication of the emerging atti
tudes of some of the students at
this University. But I wonder
how many actually apathetic stu
dents are being swept along
with the tide.
There is currently being cir
culated in Wilbur a petition de
signed to bring about reforms in

the Wilbur system and espe
cially in the activities of the
headmaster, Dr. Eric Hutchin
son. As regards Dr. Hutchinson,
the petition asks that he resign
his position as Director of the
Public Affairs Fellowship Pro
gram, lighten his teaching load,
and live and eat in Wilbur in the
hope that this will allow him
to take a more active role in
communicating with the stu
dents and promoting the intel
lectual goals that he advocated
at the beginning of the year.
These demands are tantamout
to asking for Dr. Hutchinson's
resignation, for it is unlikely
that he would ever agree to meet
all the required conditions. There
can be no doubting the value of

the above-listed ideas to the stu
dents who are genuinely inter
ested in them.
I strongly take issue .however,
with those students who have
signed the petition but who have
no real interest in what it hopes
to accomplish. These students
have signed out of conformity
to the "pseudo-liberalism" that I
have attempted to describe.
These students maintain that
they would like to see greater
communication with the head
master, but how many of them
have ever visited Dr. Hutchinson
during his regular office hours?
Perhaps Dr. Hutchinson is not
an interesting speaker, but this
does not say much for the en
thusiasm of the freshmen men.
There have been many other lec
tures not arranged by Dr. Hutch
inson but more poorly attended.
