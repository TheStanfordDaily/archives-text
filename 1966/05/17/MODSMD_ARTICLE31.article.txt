## Singasong Of Social Regs: Frosh Change Their Tune 
### Barbara Levin 
"Roble's boss has lost her
frosh
And doesn't know where to
to find them.
So abolish the sign-out,
And give up the lock-out,
And she'll never have to
remind them."
This nursery rhyme composed
by the freshman women in Roblc
for their Spring Sing entry has
more to it than a catchy tune.
The sentiments expressed con
cerning Social Regulations basi
cally agree with the preliminary
results of a recent all-campus
evaluation.
Member of AWS
As a freshman member of the
much-dumped on AWS Social
Regulations Committee, I can
not claim to be a casual observer
on the subject. However, as a
woman student who had to sign
out to write this story, I can
justify my involvement and my
interest in the changes, if any,
in the frosh viewpoint on wom
en's hours.
The opinions of the individual
freshman are diverse, but the
composite picture seems to have
been altered. Approximately two
thirds of the freshmen women
questioned in the all-campus sur
vey, tended to dismiss personal
reliance upon the rules after
their freshman year.
One-Third Satisfied
One-third of the women on
campus were polled by the Com
mittee; about a hundred fresh
man participated. One out of
every three freshman expressed
her satisfaction with the system,
while the other two were either
vehemently opposed or relatively

indifferent to the Regs. An in
significant few felt that "they
were perhaps too leniant."
A majority of the frosh, how
ever, realized that the rules were
necessary during the first quar
ter, and many felt they were im
portant throughout the fresh
man year. In their replies, it was
evident that many considered the
quota and sign-out "an unneces
sary crutch or "a bad habit."
Discussions with freshman
who feel that further liberaliza
tion is needed reflect their analy
tical thoughts on the reasons for
change. Some of the freshmen
even admit they have become
Imore conservative since they
have come to Stanford, and can
present valid arguments for the
retention of the rules.
Frosh Views Important
The attitudes of this year's
frosh will be important in the
administration's further consid
eration of the Social Regulation
policy. They are the first class
to live with the new rules and
will still be around for the con
clusion jf the three-year experi
ment. The change in hours, the
lack of a Dean of Women, and
the awakened campus interest in
the subject may be factors that
will influence their opinions.
Two long quarters ago the
FROSH DOLLIES < labeled be
fore they could prove them
selves) arrived at their new
homes -the walled fortresses of
Branner and Roble. During Pre-
Reg, they were introduced to the
saving White Knight, Social
Regs. Since then many have
learned his armor is unneces
sary.
