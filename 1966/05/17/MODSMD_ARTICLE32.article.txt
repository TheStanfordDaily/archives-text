# The 						Fearful Spectator
## Freshmen: You Are Here-But When Will You Arrive? Art Fisber

(Editor's note: The following
column is reprinted from the
September 24, 11)65 Lssue of The
Daily).
This, they tell you, is just
the beginning.
You are now a collegiate, eli
gible to wear a Stanford sweat
shirt, causing the home-town
lassies to fling themselves on
the sand.
You have chosen Stanford,
"the life of the mind," and the
Grand Old Stanford Indian Tra
dition.
In the days ahead your mind
will reach out, eager to grasp
the essence of this strange
world of complex institutions
and simple people. Here is a
taste.
Battles
If this year follows tradition,
it will be one of the great bat
tles to achieve long-hallowed
goals: battles of the Involved
Students against the Status Quo.
Students will abandon aca
demic careers to strike out as
rebels, risking lives and embrac
ing public castigation to fight
for a vote for men who believe
they may not deserve one. Stan
ford coeds will risk rape in a
Dixie police station, but black
children will learn that a Negro
is a man.
The Stanford Daily may again
lead a bitter campaign for the
separation of church and state
at Stanford. Can we abolish the
established "nondenomination
al" religion? Is any man free to
worship in the University build
ing of his choice?
Student Outcry
The students will yelp as one
in outcry, when an average Joe
gets the boot for an immature
prank, as if being a jackass
weren't punishment enough.
And the administration will
take advantage of the situation
to issue a dozen statements say
ing nothing with clever ambigu
ity.
Some will call Stanford "the
Harvard of the West" and oth
ers will ask, "Where is Leader
ship in this University?" And a
few will simply scream "RF"
and then subside back into the
long wait for the short weekend.
But amid the great contro
versies that will wear on long
after the present participants
are gone, there stands supreme
the average, tired, bleary-eyed
hero of the academic struggle.
Your English teachers will
coax and cajole and threaten
and warn you. The great impera
tive of the Freshman Year:
"Learn to write!" If you want

to be an insurance salesman or
chemist and think that writing
your name is enough, wait until
you hit the first midterm in
Western Civ.
Seventy Exams
Between you and a diploma
stand some seventy essay exam
inations. At Stanford the pen is
mightier than the sword. Stu
dents are forced to live by the
pen, and not a few die by the
pen.
In the coming years you will
meet teaching assistants so im
mature your kid sister wouldn't
date them and professors so
brilliant you'll sit in awe with
chin on your chest, unable to
write, praying you'll remember.
They say an education at MIT
is like getting a drink of water
at a fire hydrant. Stanford is
more like a public fountain —
now a flood, now a trickle.
The annual freshman specta
cle is an amazing phenomenon
to catch. Freshmen will sprout
pipes and beards, long hair and
short pants. Some will rush
right to the Union and wrap
themselves immediately around
a cup of coffee. Others will stay
away, determined to get the
most from college by thirty self
imposed dead weeks the first
year. Both will miss the point
completely, but then, for the
freshman, there is always next
year.
Beanies
The discrimination between
frosh and the aged is real and
valid. No one wears a beanie
here, but you won't miss the si
lent message: "Kid, you're just
a little freshman and you don't
know what's happening." And
you'll puff up and flash back a
retort, but you'll know you're
wrong.
Later, maybe after Christmas,
a new light will dawn, and you'll
wake up one morning and say,
"I've made it. NOW I know my
way around. I know all the
slang, I dress right, I've got a
girl (or a boy friend) —I'm
really collegiate. At last I know
what it's all about!"
But another day will come,
maybe next year, maybe later,
when you'll look back and smile
at your first months at Stan
ford. It comes slowly and you're
never sure, but one day you will
understand that the seniors who
laughed were right. You will
have changed, and when you
realize that, you'll have made
it.
That is the real beginning.
It's all Frosh Week until then.
