# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Disclaiming The Lawsuit 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As individuals who have been
concerned to see that full free
dom of worship is granted to all
religious groups at Stanford, we
wish to repudiate as emphatical
ly as possible the tactics of a
small group of students who an
nounced last Friday that they
were planrr! .. * to file suit against
the Unive" v for "denial of
religious Ir t «.aom."
Since members of that group
are aware that other plans are
in process to try to resolve the
problem amicably, we can only
regard their action as an unfor
tunate and attention-getting de
vice that obscures the issue at
band rather than illuminating it
and that makes immeasurably
more difficult the achievement
of a (satisfactory solution.
