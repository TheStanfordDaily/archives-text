# Remodeling Scheduled For Freshman Dorms
## 
### JAN WELLS Assistant Editor 
Wilbur Hall's halls will present to
tally new faces to next fall's entering
freshmen. Entry lobbies to each of
the eight houses will be re-decorated
this summer, according to William
Stone, Manager of Men's Residence
Halls.
Corridor floors will be covered with
new carpeting, walls with vinyl cov
ering, and ceilings with accoustical
tile.
The renovation of Stern will con
tinue, with the addition of vinyl wall
covering to the halls of Lassen, Lar
kin, and Holladay planned for com
pletion by next fall.
Wear And Tear
Stone pointed out that, "although
the changes won't eliminate rough
treatment of the facilities, it is hoped
that they will cut down on wear."
As one Ccdro frosh put it: "If it
looks like a fort, we'll treat it like a
fort; but give us something to take
care of, and we'll take care of it."
Stone recognizes, however, that not
even wall-to-wall carpeting can change
Stanford men. "There are still water
balloon fights in the carpeted halls of
Stern and an occasional boy still
brings a motorcycle in and rides it
down a carpeted corridor."
Women's Dorms
Branner and Roble both underwent
major alternations last summer, in
cluding complete re-wiring, re-decora
tion, and carpeting of corridors. Ac
cording to William Friedrichs, Man
ager of Women's Residence Halls, the
dining room of Branner will probably
be carpeted this summer and it is
hoped that both Branner and Roble
will have their plumbing re-done.
Tentative changes would probably
satisfy the Roble girl whose greatest
suggestion was that they "have com
bined faucets instead of separate hot
and cold water," but they ignore the
Wilbur male who echoed "they really
ought to have combined dorms, in
stead of separate 'Men's' and 'Wom
en's."
Moore-Jacks
Many frosh favor co-ed housing, al
though they disagree on exactly what
"co-ed" housing entails. The most
common view is of separate living
areas—whether on alternate floors,
different corridors, or different build
ings—with common lounges and din

ing facilities. This concept will be fol
lowed in the construction of the
Moore-Jacks dorm, to be opened in the
fall of '68. Moore-Jacks, however, will
never house freshmen.
Although most freshmen welcome
innovation in the physical plants of
their dormitories, and would welcome
such radical departures from the pres
ent system as co-ed living, the ma
jority does not favor any change
away from the system of segregated
freshmen, whose major contact with
upper classes is through sponsors.
A Wilburite explained that by liv
ing with frosh he saw others under
going the same adjustment problems
he had. "I have people to share the
worries of Civ and English, and a
strong base from which to build
friendships," he said.
Programs like the Branner series on
majors also tend to draw freshmen
together. "But if we were mixed with
upperclassmen who know what
they're majoring in, there'd prob
ably be such a low per cent attending
that the program would be dropped,"
added a Branner dolly.

Moore-Jacks dorm, to be opened in the
fall of '68. Moore-Jacks, however, will
never house freshmen.
Although most freshmen welcome
innovation in the physical plants of
their dormitories, and would welcome
such radical departures from the pres
ent system as co-ed living, the ma
jority does not favor any change
away from the system of segregated
freshmen, whose major contact with
upper classes is through sponsors.
A Wilburite explained that by liv
ing with frosh he saw others under
going the same adjustment problems
he had. "I have people to share the
worries of Civ and English, and a
strong base from which to build
friendships," he said.
Programs like the Branner series on
majors also tend to draw freshmen
together. "But if we were mixed with
upperclassmen who know what
they're majoring in, there'd prob
ably be such a low per cent attending
that the program would be dropped,"
added a Branner dolly.
Wilbur Hall's halls will present to
tally new faces to next fall's entering
freshmen. Entry lobbies to each of
the eight houses will be re-decorated
this summer, according to William
Stone, Manager of Men's Residence
Halls.
Corridor floors will be covered with
new carpeting, walls with vinyl cov
ering, and ceilings with accoustical
tile.
The renovation of Stern will con
tinue, with the addition of vinyl wall
covering to the halls of Lassen, Lar
kin, and Holladay planned for com
pletion by next fall.
Wear And Tear
Stone pointed out that, "although
the changes won't eliminate rough
treatment of the facilities, it is hoped
that they will cut down on wear."
As one Ccdro frosh put it: "If it
looks like a fort, we'll treat it like a
fort; but give us something to take
care of, and we'll take care of it."
Stone recognizes, however, that not
even wall-to-wall carpeting can change
Stanford men. "There are still water
balloon fights in the carpeted halls of
Stern and an occasional boy still
brings a motorcycle in and rides it
down a carpeted corridor."
Women's Dorms
Branner and Roble both underwent
major alternations last summer, in
cluding complete re-wiring, re-decora
tion, and carpeting of corridors. Ac
cording to William Friedrichs, Man
ager of Women's Residence Halls, the
dining room of Branner will probably
be carpeted this summer and it is
hoped that both Branner and Roble
will have their plumbing re-done.
Tentative changes would probably
satisfy the Roble girl whose greatest
suggestion was that they "have com
bined faucets instead of separate hot
and cold water," but they ignore the
Wilbur male who echoed "they really
ought to have combined dorms, in
stead of separate 'Men's' and 'Wom
en's."
Moore-Jacks
Many frosh favor co-ed housing, al
though they disagree on exactly what
"co-ed" housing entails. The most
common view is of separate living
areas—whether on alternate floors,
different corridors, or different build
ings—with common lounges and din

ing facilities. This concept will be fol
lowed in the construction of the
Moore-Jacks dorm, to be opened in the
fall of '68. Moore-Jacks, however, will
