# English Profs Stress The 'Personal Voice'
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
Freshman English students may
gripe about theme assignments, they
may be excited about their new-found
writing ability, they may argue about
everything from symbolism in Grass'
Cat and Mouse to the teaching ability
of their instructor. But the fact is:
teaching English has undergone revo
lutionary changes in Stanford's fresh
man English program.
Logic, Rhetoric, Grammar
"Before," stated Albert Guerard, di
rector of the program, "logic, rhetoric,
and grammar were stressed. Studies
showed that these had no effect on
writing. Now, we're trying to get the
speaking voice into writing. Students
don't write well unless they care
about what they are writing and are
involved. We want to get people to
write well and read sensitively."
Along with carrying this basic con
cept throughout the three quarters,
several special programs have
evolved, Including poetry and narra
tive writing sections (English 4), Spe
cial English, ungraded sections, and
shrinking class size.
Communication
English T.A. Keith Lowe, who
agrees with Guerard's concept, feels
that the purpose of the course is "to
read, write and to speak the lan
guage." He defines language as "the
chief mode by which an individual can
understand and communicate himself
as well as objective phenomena."
"I believe that the student should
be able to communicate his deepest
feelings and language to understand
himself, as in self-analysis," Lowe
said. "The present program is fulfill
ing this goal, except that it has ig
nored speaking. Students have im
proved in writing, but haven't learned

to speak well."
One English T.A., however, ques
tions using writing as a "catharsis".
"We must deal with literary prob
lems. We can't talk about experiences
with poetry unless we know its form,"
he commented.
Personal Voice
He has doubts about the "idea of a
personal voice". "Most Stanford stu
dents haven't had any profound ex
periences. They come from homoge
nous and middle class backgrounds,"
he said.
"Guerard's approach is psychologi
cal and I fear that it removes the
necessity of evaluating literature. We
can have a direct examination of lit
erature on the conceptual level with
out necessarily relating it to the self."
Carter Wilson, an author and in
structor of a narrative writing sec
tion, believes that students "should
use their personal experiences and re
actions rather than using a bookish
approach. 1 believe i"n the value of
people writing and having people
read. There is a special value in try
ing to do something yourself," he
commented.
"In writing about yourself, you
give meaning to what you do; it's not
the experience itself, but the ability to
analyze that is benefited by this meth
od," Wilson said.
Looking At Oneself
Students, too, vary in their reac
tions to the concept of developing a
personal voice. Sandy Shapiro empha
sized that "the o"ne thing I wasn't
prepared to do before was to look at
myself. Through Special English, I
accomplished this purpose."
Wilbur freshman Chris Pope said
that while he found the class basically
good, he feels that the program
didn't help him personally.
"When I read, I automatically
try to relate it to myself. I don't
express myself in writing any
more than I used to."
"English has been more valu
able than Civ," commented stu
dent Cindy Sandfort. "It has
given me a lot of experience in
writing. But it is lacking in a
coherent theme, although I'm
not sure that English should be
structured."
Guerard and the students in
terviewed are generally pleased
with the idea of ungraded sec
tions. Eric Miller, a Stern fresh
man, feels that "this gives us
the freedom to make out of the
course what we want to. With
out worrying about grades, you
are able to write freely the way
you want to."
Miss Sandfort noted that un
graded sections "provide a good
climate in which to learn Eng
lish. It's too bad that the De
partment has to give grades at
the end of the year anyway, but
we are able most of the time
to forget grades." Guerard ex
plained that pass-fail grades
can't be given until the entire
school is under such a system,
but that the program will be
continued and expanded.
Halved Sections
Another new program to be
continued is cutting sections in
half, as was done this quarter.
Christy Howard, Branner fresh
man, stated that "I have gotten
more out of this quarter than
the other two combined because
of the smaller classes."
While opinions of freshman
English were generally favor
able, many criticized the class
for being "boring" and the
work "a chore". One freshman
called for "more controversy in
class. Too many of my friends
complain that class doesn't ex
cite them." Others felt that
while creative writing sessions
and special groups are good,
regular English is "pathetic."
Inadequate TA's
But, by and large, the greatest
demand made by students was
for good teachers. Many are ag
gravated by the "T.A. totally
inadequate to lead discussion."
And when a student says he
likes the course, he invariably
adds that the instructor was
outstanding.
"My first quarter was suc
cessful because I had a highly
qualified teacher who turned out
a good course," Eric Miller said.
While definite plans are still
uncertain, Guerard said, more
special programs will be insti
tuted next year, particularly in
the field of creative writing.
"Next year, we will expand un
graded and special sections and
form an experimental program
not yet announced. There is a
great fund of creativity in Stan
ford students that should be
tapped."

"In writing about yourself, you
give meaning to what you do; it's not
the experience itself, but the ability to
analyze that is benefited by this meth
od," Wilson said.
Looking At Oneself
Students, too, vary in their reac
tions to the concept of developing a
personal voice. Sandy Shapiro empha
sized that "the o"ne thing I wasn't
prepared to do before was to look at
myself. Through Special English, I
accomplished this purpose."
Wilbur freshman Chris Pope said
that while he found the class basically
good, he feels that the program
didn't help him personally.
"When I read, I automatically
try to relate it to myself. I don't
express myself in writing any
more than I used to."
"English has been more valu
able than Civ," commented stu
dent Cindy Sandfort. "It has
given me a lot of experience in
writing. But it is lacking in a
coherent theme, although I'm
not sure that English should be
structured."
Guerard and the students in
terviewed are generally pleased
with the idea of ungraded sec
tions. Eric Miller, a Stern fresh
man, feels that "this gives us
the freedom to make out of the
course what we want to. With
out worrying about grades, you
are able to write freely the way
you want to."
Miss Sandfort noted that un
graded sections "provide a good
climate in which to learn Eng
lish. It's too bad that the De
partment has to give grades at
the end of the year anyway, but
we are able most of the time
to forget grades." Guerard ex
plained that pass-fail grades
can't be given until the entire
school is under such a system,
but that the program will be
continued and expanded.
Halved Sections
Another new program to be
continued is cutting sections in
half, as was done this quarter.
Christy Howard, Branner fresh
man, stated that "I have gotten
more out of this quarter than
the other two combined because
of the smaller classes."
While opinions of freshman
English were generally favor
able, many criticized the class
for being "boring" and the
work "a chore". One freshman
called for "more controversy in
class. Too many of my friends
complain that class doesn't ex
cite them." Others felt that
while creative writing sessions
and special groups are good,
regular English is "pathetic."
Inadequate TA's
But, by and large, the greatest
demand made by students was
for good teachers. Many are ag
gravated by the "T.A. totally
inadequate to lead discussion."
And when a student says he
likes the course, he invariably
adds that the instructor was
outstanding.
"My first quarter was suc
cessful because I had a highly
qualified teacher who turned out
a good course," Eric Miller said.
While definite plans are still
uncertain, Guerard said, more
special programs will be insti
tuted next year, particularly in
the field of creative writing.
"Next year, we will expand un
graded and special sections and
form an experimental program
not yet announced. There is a
great fund of creativity in Stan
ford students that should be
tapped."
Freshman English students may
gripe about theme assignments, they
may be excited about their new-found
writing ability, they may argue about
everything from symbolism in Grass'
Cat and Mouse to the teaching ability
of their instructor. But the fact is:
teaching English has undergone revo
lutionary changes in Stanford's fresh
man English program.
Logic, Rhetoric, Grammar
"Before," stated Albert Guerard, di
rector of the program, "logic, rhetoric,
and grammar were stressed. Studies
showed that these had no effect on
writing. Now, we're trying to get the
speaking voice into writing. Students
don't write well unless they care
about what they are writing and are
involved. We want to get people to
write well and read sensitively."
Along with carrying this basic con
cept throughout the three quarters,
several special programs have
evolved, Including poetry and narra
tive writing sections (English 4), Spe
cial English, ungraded sections, and
shrinking class size.
Communication
English T.A. Keith Lowe, who
agrees with Guerard's concept, feels
that the purpose of the course is "to
read, write and to speak the lan
guage." He defines language as "the
chief mode by which an individual can
understand and communicate himself
as well as objective phenomena."
"I believe that the student should
be able to communicate his deepest
feelings and language to understand
himself, as in self-analysis," Lowe
said. "The present program is fulfill
ing this goal, except that it has ig
nored speaking. Students have im
proved in writing, but haven't learned

to speak well."
One English T.A., however, ques
tions using writing as a "catharsis".
"We must deal with literary prob
lems. We can't talk about experiences
with poetry unless we know its form,"
he commented.
Personal Voice
He has doubts about the "idea of a
personal voice". "Most Stanford stu
dents haven't had any profound ex
periences. They come from homoge
nous and middle class backgrounds,"
he said.
"Guerard's approach is psychologi
cal and I fear that it removes the
necessity of evaluating literature. We
can have a direct examination of lit
erature on the conceptual level with
out necessarily relating it to the self."
Carter Wilson, an author and in

likes the course, he invariably
adds that the instructor was
outstanding.
"My first quarter was suc
cessful because I had a highly
qualified teacher who turned out
a good course," Eric Miller said.
While definite plans are still
uncertain, Guerard said, more
special programs will be insti
tuted next year, particularly in
the field of creative writing.
"Next year, we will expand un
graded and special sections and
form an experimental program
not yet announced. There is a
great fund of creativity in Stan
ford students that should be
tapped."
Freshman English students may
gripe about theme assignments, they
may be excited about their new-found
writing ability, they may argue about
everything from symbolism in Grass'
Cat and Mouse to the teaching ability
of their instructor. But the fact is:
teaching English has undergone revo
lutionary changes in Stanford's fresh
man English program.
Logic, Rhetoric, Grammar
"Before," stated Albert Guerard, di
rector of the program, "logic, rhetoric,
and grammar were stressed. Studies
showed that these had no effect on
writing. Now, we're trying to get the
speaking voice into writing. Students
don't write well unless they care
about what they are writing and are
involved. We want to get people to
write well and read sensitively."
Along with carrying this basic con
cept throughout the three quarters,
several special programs have
evolved, Including poetry and narra
tive writing sections (English 4), Spe
cial English, ungraded sections, and
shrinking class size.
Communication
English T.A. Keith Lowe, who
agrees with Guerard's concept, feels
that the purpose of the course is "to
read, write and to speak the lan
guage." He defines language as "the
chief mode by which an individual can
understand and communicate himself
as well as objective phenomena."
"I believe that the student should
be able to communicate his deepest
feelings and language to understand
himself, as in self-analysis," Lowe
said. "The present program is fulfill
ing this goal, except that it has ig
nored speaking. Students have im
proved in writing, but haven't learned

to speak well."
One English T.A., however, ques
tions using writing as a "catharsis".
"We must deal with literary prob
lems. We can't talk about experiences
with poetry unless we know its form,"
he commented.
Personal Voice
He has doubts about the "idea of a
personal voice". "Most Stanford stu
dents haven't had any profound ex
periences. They come from homoge
nous and middle class backgrounds,"
he said.
"Guerard's approach is psychologi
cal and I fear that it removes the
necessity of evaluating literature. We
can have a direct examination of lit
erature on the conceptual level with
out necessarily relating it to the self."
Carter Wilson, an author and in
structor of a narrative writing sec
tion, believes that students "should
use their personal experiences and re
actions rather than using a bookish
approach. 1 believe i"n the value of
people writing and having people
read. There is a special value in try
ing to do something yourself," he
commented.
"In writing about yourself, you
give meaning to what you do; it's not
the experience itself, but the ability to
analyze that is benefited by this meth
od," Wilson said.
Looking At Oneself
Students, too, vary in their reac
tions to the concept of developing a
personal voice. Sandy Shapiro empha
sized that "the o"ne thing I wasn't
prepared to do before was to look at
myself. Through Special English, I
accomplished this purpose."
Wilbur freshman Chris Pope said
that while he found the class basically
good, he feels that the program
didn't help him personally.
"When I read, I automatically
try to relate it to myself. I don't
express myself in writing any
more than I used to."
"English has been more valu
able than Civ," commented stu
dent Cindy Sandfort. "It has
given me a lot of experience in
writing. But it is lacking in a
coherent theme, although I'm
not sure that English should be
structured."
Guerard and the students in
terviewed are generally pleased
with the idea of ungraded sec
tions. Eric Miller, a Stern fresh
man, feels that "this gives us
the freedom to make out of the
course what we want to. With
out worrying about grades, you
are able to write freely the way
you want to."
Miss Sandfort noted that un
graded sections "provide a good
climate in which to learn Eng
lish. It's too bad that the De
partment has to give grades at
the end of the year anyway, but
we are able most of the time
to forget grades." Guerard ex
plained that pass-fail grades
can't be given until the entire
school is under such a system,
but that the program will be
continued and expanded.
Halved Sections
Another new program to be
continued is cutting sections in
half, as was done this quarter.
Christy Howard, Branner fresh
man, stated that "I have gotten
more out of this quarter than
the other two combined because
of the smaller classes."
While opinions of freshman
English were generally favor
able, many criticized the class
for being "boring" and the
work "a chore". One freshman
called for "more controversy in
class. Too many of my friends
complain that class doesn't ex
cite them." Others felt that
while creative writing sessions
and special groups are good,
regular English is "pathetic."
Inadequate TA's
But, by and large, the greatest
demand made by students was
for good teachers. Many are ag
gravated by the "T.A. totally
inadequate to lead discussion."
And when a student says he
likes the course, he invariably
adds that the instructor was
outstanding.
"My first quarter was suc
cessful because I had a highly
qualified teacher who turned out
a good course," Eric Miller said.
