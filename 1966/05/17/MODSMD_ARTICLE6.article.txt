# English Profs Stress The 'Personal Voice'
## 
### SUSAN HUDGENS 
Freshman English students may
gripe about theme assignments, they
may be excited about their new-found
writing ability, they may argue about
everything from symbolism in Grass'
Cat and Mouse to the teaching ability
of their instructor. But the fact is:
teaching English has undergone revo
lutionary changes in Stanford's fresh
man English program.
Logic, Rhetoric, Grammar
"Before," stated Albert Guerard, di
rector of the program, "logic, rhetoric,
and grammar were stressed. Studies
showed that these had no effect on
writing. Now, we're trying to get the
speaking voice into writing. Students
don't write well unless they care
about what they are writing and are
involved. We want to get people to
write well and read sensitively."
Along with carrying this basic con
cept throughout the three quarters,
several special programs have
evolved, Including poetry and narra
tive writing sections (English 4), Spe
cial English, ungraded sections, and
shrinking class size.
Communication
English T.A. Keith Lowe, who
agrees with Guerard's concept, feels
that the purpose of the course is "to
read, write and to speak the lan
guage." He defines language as "the
chief mode by which an individual can
understand and communicate himself
as well as objective phenomena."
"I believe that the student should
be able to communicate his deepest
feelings and language to understand
himself, as in self-analysis," Lowe
said. "The present program is fulfill
ing this goal, except that it has ig
nored speaking. Students have im
proved in writing, but haven't learned

to speak well."
One English T.A., however, ques
tions using writing as a "catharsis".
"We must deal with literary prob
lems. We can't talk about experiences
with poetry unless we know its form,"
he commented.
Personal Voice
He has doubts about the "idea of a
personal voice". "Most Stanford stu
dents haven't had any profound ex
periences. They come from homoge
nous and middle class backgrounds,"
he said.
"Guerard's approach is psychologi
cal and I fear that it removes the
necessity of evaluating literature. We
can have a direct examination of lit
erature on the conceptual level with
out necessarily relating it to the self."
Carter Wilson, an author and in
structor of a narrative writing sec
tion, believes that students "should
use their personal experiences and re
actions rather than using a bookish
approach. 1 believe i"n the value of
people writing and having people
read. There is a special value in try
ing to do something yourself," he
commented.
"In writing about yourself, you
give meaning to what you do; it's not
the experience itself, but the ability to
analyze that is benefited by this meth
od," Wilson said.
Looking At Oneself
Students, too, vary in their reac
tions to the concept of developing a
personal voice. Sandy Shapiro empha
sized that "the o"ne thing I wasn't
prepared to do before was to look at
myself. Through Special English, I
accomplished this purpose."
Wilbur freshman Chris Pope said
that while he found the class basically
