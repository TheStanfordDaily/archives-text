# Wilburites Urge Changes
## 
### 
Over 150 Wilbur freshmen have
signed a petition expressing disap
pointment with life in Wilbur and
asking for an evaluation of the entire
freshman residence policy.
The petition, written and circulated
by freshman, was intended to show
the University administration and the
Wilbur administration that the pres
ent freshman class was concerned
with the inadequacies it had noted.
Legitimate Complaints
"We hope," said one circulator,
"that the University administration
and the Wilbur administration will

realize that we have legitimate com
plaints and will launch the compre
hensive study we request."
The petition calls for an impartial
committee to "consider the broad
questions of freshman residence, in
cluding integration of freshman and
upperclass dormitories and coeduca
tional housing."
It also asks for a definition of what
the faculty residents, and the faculty
the sponsors, the faculty residents,
and the faculty master consider to be
their "aims and responsibilities," and
that this be given "the careful con

sideration of the University at large."
"We definitely feel that they have
a purpose here, but we'd like to have
them spell out exactly what it is and
be able to examine it critically in
light of what they have done for Wil
bur this year," commented one of the
freshmen who signed.
The petition noted that in past
yeans the director of Wilbur had held
no other position and had lived and
eaten meals in Wilbur.
By contrast, the present faculty
master, Dr. Eric Hutchinson, lives in
Palo Alto, and is director of the Pub
lic Affairs Fellowship Program and a
Professor of Chemistry in addition to
his job in Wilbur. The petition asks
him to "make a serious attempt to
spend more time with the freshmen
if he plans to continue as faculty
master."
Talking With Frosh
The petition will be presented to
Dr. Hutchinson and Dean Wert. Dr.
Hutchinson has said that he would
like to discuss freshman year and
particularly Wilbur Hall with inter
ested freshmen who have thought
about the problem and have ideas and
suggestions.
According to circulators, fewer than
10 percent of those contacted about
the petition disagreed with the fun
damental parts of the petition, that
they were "disappointed with certain
aspects of freshman life in Wilbur,"
and that they would like to see a
broad reevaluation of freshman resi
dence policy.
