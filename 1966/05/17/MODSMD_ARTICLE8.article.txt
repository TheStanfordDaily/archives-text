# Editors' Note
## 
### 
All great things have to come
to an end. At least temporarily.
And now it's The Stanford Daily
—just for today, of course. The
occasion: the newspaper's an
nual freshman edition, when the
young and uninitiated take over.
Actually, we're pretty proud of
our frosh staffers. Included
among them are some of the
best journalists — or potential
journalists—or should we say
potent journalists — The Dally
has seen in a long time—as we
think this issue will prove.
But in the meanwhile, it's just
a one-day affair. We apologize to
our readers for the inconveni
ence.

(Editor's Note: We apologize for
the above rancid prose. It must
have been written late at night.
—The Freshmen Staffers.)
