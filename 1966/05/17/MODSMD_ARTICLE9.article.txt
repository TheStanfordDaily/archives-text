• SPCV Writes Sterling
The Steering Committee of
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam yesterday sent
a letter to President Sterling
concerning the University's com
pliance with the Selective Serv
ice System.
"The conscription of American
youth is a more serious issue for
the University than freedom of
speech, basic civil liberties, and
secret military contracts," the
letter stated. "Grades furnished
by the University and tests ad
ministered by the University
have now become one of the
criteria which is to determine
whether a young man is sent
abroad to kill or be killed.
"The other critera for select
ing the most expendable of the
population may or may not be
more irrelevant and unjust than
formal academic performance,
but the least a community of
scholars can do is refuse to be
itself an instrument of these
discriminatory processes of con
scription."
The letter specifically re
quests that all grades, class
standings, and other ranking de
vices be withheld from the Selec
tive Service System; that the
Selective Service exam sched
uled for May 21, and any future
exams, be cancelled; and that
the National Service Office
serve no other function than to
advise students about the draft
and offer information and ad
vice on legal alternatives to the
draft.

The letter concludes, "We are
aware that the Academic Coun
cil plans to take up these mat
ters at its meeting on Tuesday,
but if this body has neither the
will nor the power to realize our
requests, we students must do
what is necessary to restore dig
nity to our existence in a time
of war, to bring justice to
American young men, and to
lead the University on a moral
path."
• Napalm Arrests
Two demonstrators were ar
rested yesterday morning when
they tried to block a truck en
tering the napalm plant in Red
wood City.
Dr. Oliver Henderson, the
Palo Alto psychiatrist, and two
other demonstrators stood at
the entrance to the plant holding
an American and a United Na
tions flag. A truck loaded with
empty bomb shells reached the
gate at 9:29 a.m., and for nearly
half an hour the demonstrators
blocked its way.
Alerted by the plant security
guard, the Redwood City chief
of police and other police offi
cials arrived and attempted to
drag the demonstrators away in
order to "protect" them from
being run over by the truck.
When the demonstrators still
refused to move, Dr. Henderson
and Mr. Aaron J. Manganiello,
an electrical engineer, were ar
rested on charges of creating a
public nuisance. They were
later released on bail pending a

court hearing May 24. The third
demonstrator agreed to leave
without being arrested.
A spokesman for United
Technology Center told The
Daily that to his knowledge
these were the first arrests that
have been made in demonstra
tions at any UTC plant.
