# Napalm Foes Arrested; Decision Expected
## 
### EMANUEL GORDON 
A crucial court decision is expected today
by groups protesting the manufacture of na
palm in Redwood City. The controversy has
been heightened this week by the arrests of
demonstrators on Monday and Tuesday.
The decision is expected this morning
in San Mateo County Superior Court on a re
quest by the RCCAN for a writ of mandate to
force the city to certify the petition for a ref
erendum which was filed April 20. The legal
arguments about the validity of the petition
are concerned with the arrangement whereby
United Technology Center acquired land from
Standard Oil of California for the production
of napalm. This arrangement was approved
by the Board of Commissioners of Redwood
City on March 21, and, according to a section
of the city charter, "All leases made or ap
proved by the Board of Port Commissioners
shall be subject to the referendum provisions
of this charter."
On April 20 the RCCAN filed a petition ask

ing the city to reconsider its approval of the
land arrangement, to to hold a referendum to
decide the issue. Before this petition can be
come valid, the City Clerk must certify it by
declaring whether the requisite number of
signatures on it are valid. The City Attorney
has instructed the City Clerk not to certify
the petitions for two reasons: first, that the
action of March 21 involved an "administra
tive act under an existing lease" and was not
a sublease; second, that the petition ought to
have referred to a lease between Standard Oil
of California and the Port which went into
effect May 1, rather than the arrangement
approved on March 21.
The Committee asked for a temporary re
straining order to prevent work at the site
pending the final outcome, but their request
was denied by the Superior Court on April 26.
In addition, the Committee asked for an order
on the city to show cause why a referendum
should not be held, but this action was with
drawn when it was discovered that it might

entail lengthy litigation. The writ of mandate
now before the court will lead to a rapid and
clear cut decision on the legal merits of the
petition, according to James F. Colaianni,
chairman of the RCCAN.
Should the court order the city to certify
the petition, Colaianni told the Daily, state
electoral law requires that all work at the
napalm plant cease until the referendum is
held.
On Monday, Dr. Oliver Henderson, a Palo
Alto psychiatrist and Aaron J. Manganiello, a
Stanford employee, were arrested on charges
of creating a public nuisance. The two demon
strators tried to block a truck entering the
napalm plant in Redwood City with a load of
empty bomb shells.
The Redwood City Chief of Police and two
other police officials arrived at 9:45 A.M. and
started to drag Dr. Henderson away from his
post in front of the truck. "Are you arresting
me?" he cried out repeatedly. The police re
plied that they were not arresting him. "We

have the right of protecting you too," they
told him.
When asked whether such protection is an
ordinary legal measure, the police chief re
plied, "This is correct."
Dr. Henderson later eluded his captors, who
were now arresting Manganiello, and was
standing in front of the truck again. "You
want to be arrested, then? That's what you
want?", one of the police officials said. Hen
derson refused to answer the question directly,
but he said, "I intend to keep standing here."
He was then arrested.
The two demonstrators were later released
on bail pending a court hearing May 24. The
Palo Alto Times speculated Monday that the
demonstration indicated "an abrupt change in
tactics by foes of napalm production at the
port," but the San Jose Mercury article on the
demonstration drew a clear distinction be
tween the demonstrators' personal activities
and the intentions of the Redwood City Com
mittee Against Napalm. The Rev. William H.

Houff, vice-chairman of the RCCAN, told the
Daily that he would not deny the men their
right to perform "an act of conscience" on
their part, but that the actions were not spon
sored by the Committee, nor did he think that
any committee could sponsor acts of civil dis
obedience.
Yesterday Leith Speiden and Alan Traister,
both Stanford students, were arrested when
they attempted to stop another truck at the
napalm plant. The truck had been stopped for
five minutes when the arrests were made by
uniformed policemen. Traister and Miss Spei
den were booked on the same charge as the
men arrested Monday—creating a public nui
sance.
The RCCAN held a meeting Monday night
at Sequoia High School in Redwood City. Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin of the English Depart
ment, officers of the Committee, and Mr. El
liot Steinberg, a lawyer from the American
Civil Liberties Union, spoke on the various as
pects of the campaign against napalm.

port," but the San Jose Mercury article on the
demonstration drew a clear distinction be
tween the demonstrators' personal activities
and the intentions of the Redwood City Com
mittee Against Napalm. The Rev. William H.

Houff, vice-chairman of the RCCAN, told the
Daily that he would not deny the men their
right to perform "an act of conscience" on
their part, but that the actions were not spon
sored by the Committee, nor did he think that
any committee could sponsor acts of civil dis
obedience.
Yesterday Leith Speiden and Alan Traister,
both Stanford students, were arrested when
they attempted to stop another truck at the
napalm plant. The truck had been stopped for
five minutes when the arrests were made by
uniformed policemen. Traister and Miss Spei
den were booked on the same charge as the
men arrested Monday—creating a public nui
sance.
The RCCAN held a meeting Monday night
at Sequoia High School in Redwood City. Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin of the English Depart
ment, officers of the Committee, and Mr. El
liot Steinberg, a lawyer from the American
Civil Liberties Union, spoke on the various as
pects of the campaign against napalm.
A crucial court decision is expected today
by groups protesting the manufacture of na
palm in Redwood City. The controversy has
been heightened this week by the arrests of
demonstrators on Monday and Tuesday.
The decision is expected this morning
in San Mateo County Superior Court on a re
quest by the RCCAN for a writ of mandate to
force the city to certify the petition for a ref
erendum which was filed April 20. The legal
arguments about the validity of the petition
are concerned with the arrangement whereby
United Technology Center acquired land from
Standard Oil of California for the production
of napalm. This arrangement was approved
by the Board of Commissioners of Redwood
City on March 21, and, according to a section
of the city charter, "All leases made or ap
proved by the Board of Port Commissioners
shall be subject to the referendum provisions
of this charter."
On April 20 the RCCAN filed a petition ask

ing the city to reconsider its approval of the
land arrangement, to to hold a referendum to
decide the issue. Before this petition can be
come valid, the City Clerk must certify it by
declaring whether the requisite number of
signatures on it are valid. The City Attorney
has instructed the City Clerk not to certify
the petitions for two reasons: first, that the
action of March 21 involved an "administra
tive act under an existing lease" and was not
a sublease; second, that the petition ought to
have referred to a lease between Standard Oil
of California and the Port which went into
effect May 1, rather than the arrangement
approved on March 21.
The Committee asked for a temporary re
straining order to prevent work at the site
pending the final outcome, but their request
was denied by the Superior Court on April 26.
In addition, the Committee asked for an order
on the city to show cause why a referendum
should not be held, but this action was with
drawn when it was discovered that it might

entail lengthy litigation. The writ of mandate
now before the court will lead to a rapid and
clear cut decision on the legal merits of the
petition, according to James F. Colaianni,
chairman of the RCCAN.
Should the court order the city to certify
the petition, Colaianni told the Daily, state
electoral law requires that all work at the
napalm plant cease until the referendum is
held.
On Monday, Dr. Oliver Henderson, a Palo
Alto psychiatrist and Aaron J. Manganiello, a
Stanford employee, were arrested on charges
of creating a public nuisance. The two demon
strators tried to block a truck entering the
napalm plant in Redwood City with a load of
empty bomb shells.
The Redwood City Chief of Police and two
other police officials arrived at 9:45 A.M. and
started to drag Dr. Henderson away from his
post in front of the truck. "Are you arresting
me?" he cried out repeatedly. The police re
plied that they were not arresting him. "We

have the right of protecting you too," they
told him.
When asked whether such protection is an
ordinary legal measure, the police chief re
plied, "This is correct."
Dr. Henderson later eluded his captors, who
were now arresting Manganiello, and was
standing in front of the truck again. "You
want to be arrested, then? That's what you
want?", one of the police officials said. Hen
derson refused to answer the question directly,
but he said, "I intend to keep standing here."
He was then arrested.
The two demonstrators were later released
on bail pending a court hearing May 24. The
Palo Alto Times speculated Monday that the

strators tried to block a truck entering the
napalm plant in Redwood City with a load of
empty bomb shells.
The Redwood City Chief of Police and two
other police officials arrived at 9:45 A.M. and
started to drag Dr. Henderson away from his
post in front of the truck. "Are you arresting
me?" he cried out repeatedly. The police re
plied that they were not arresting him. "We

have the right of protecting you too," they
told him.
When asked whether such protection is an
ordinary legal measure, the police chief re
plied, "This is correct."
Dr. Henderson later eluded his captors, who
were now arresting Manganiello, and was
standing in front of the truck again. "You
want to be arrested, then? That's what you
want?", one of the police officials said. Hen
derson refused to answer the question directly,
but he said, "I intend to keep standing here."
He was then arrested.
The two demonstrators were later released
on bail pending a court hearing May 24. The
Palo Alto Times speculated Monday that the
demonstration indicated "an abrupt change in
tactics by foes of napalm production at the
port," but the San Jose Mercury article on the
demonstration drew a clear distinction be
tween the demonstrators' personal activities
and the intentions of the Redwood City Com
mittee Against Napalm. The Rev. William H.

Houff, vice-chairman of the RCCAN, told the
Daily that he would not deny the men their
right to perform "an act of conscience" on
their part, but that the actions were not spon
sored by the Committee, nor did he think that
any committee could sponsor acts of civil dis
obedience.
Yesterday Leith Speiden and Alan Traister,
both Stanford students, were arrested when
they attempted to stop another truck at the
napalm plant. The truck had been stopped for
five minutes when the arrests were made by
uniformed policemen. Traister and Miss Spei
den were booked on the same charge as the
men arrested Monday—creating a public nui
sance.
The RCCAN held a meeting Monday night
at Sequoia High School in Redwood City. Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin of the English Depart
ment, officers of the Committee, and Mr. El
liot Steinberg, a lawyer from the American
Civil Liberties Union, spoke on the various as
pects of the campaign against napalm.
A crucial court decision is expected today
by groups protesting the manufacture of na
palm in Redwood City. The controversy has
been heightened this week by the arrests of
demonstrators on Monday and Tuesday.
The decision is expected this morning
in San Mateo County Superior Court on a re
quest by the RCCAN for a writ of mandate to
force the city to certify the petition for a ref
erendum which was filed April 20. The legal
arguments about the validity of the petition
are concerned with the arrangement whereby
United Technology Center acquired land from
Standard Oil of California for the production
of napalm. This arrangement was approved
by the Board of Commissioners of Redwood
City on March 21, and, according to a section
of the city charter, "All leases made or ap
proved by the Board of Port Commissioners
shall be subject to the referendum provisions
of this charter."
On April 20 the RCCAN filed a petition ask

ing the city to reconsider its approval of the
land arrangement, to to hold a referendum to
decide the issue. Before this petition can be
come valid, the City Clerk must certify it by
declaring whether the requisite number of
signatures on it are valid. The City Attorney
has instructed the City Clerk not to certify
the petitions for two reasons: first, that the
action of March 21 involved an "administra
tive act under an existing lease" and was not
a sublease; second, that the petition ought to
have referred to a lease between Standard Oil
of California and the Port which went into
effect May 1, rather than the arrangement
approved on March 21.
The Committee asked for a temporary re
straining order to prevent work at the site
pending the final outcome, but their request
was denied by the Superior Court on April 26.
In addition, the Committee asked for an order
on the city to show cause why a referendum
should not be held, but this action was with
drawn when it was discovered that it might

entail lengthy litigation. The writ of mandate
now before the court will lead to a rapid and
clear cut decision on the legal merits of the
petition, according to James F. Colaianni,
chairman of the RCCAN.
Should the court order the city to certify
the petition, Colaianni told the Daily, state
electoral law requires that all work at the
napalm plant cease until the referendum is
held.
On Monday, Dr. Oliver Henderson, a Palo
Alto psychiatrist and Aaron J. Manganiello, a
Stanford employee, were arrested on charges
of creating a public nuisance. The two demon
strators tried to block a truck entering the

empty bomb shells.
