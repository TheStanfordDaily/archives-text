On Thursday May 19th at 4:15
in the large lounge at Tresidder
there will be a concert by the
winners of the Stanford Prize
in Music. At that time the win
ners of the Stanford Prizes in
Art, Fiction, Poetry, and drama
will also be announced, and
$1800 in prize money will be
awarded.
Richard Patterson, Paula Skol
nick, Kenneth Ziegenfuss, and
Shirly Ann Jacobson are the
music prize winners who will be
performing. Victors in the other
categories will not know of their

The "Stanford Prize" contest,
whose purpose is "to encourage
creative development," is open
to all undergraduates. There are
divisions in humanities, social
sciences, natural sciences, fic
tion, poetry, drama, art, music,
and engineering.
In a letter to The Dally, Pro
fessor Albert Guerard of the
Department of English called
this "the largest contest to en
courage creative thinking among
undergraduates," and added, "its
continuance . . . depends in a
very real sense on the support
the students give it."
