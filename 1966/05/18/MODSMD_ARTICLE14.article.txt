Stanford Repertory Theater
(SRT) will emphasize contem
porary plays during 1966-67, its
second season, Producing Direc
tor Robert Loper told a news
conference here.
He cited "Inadmissable Evi
dence" by John Osborne and
"Marat/Sade" by Peter Weiss
as typical of the kinds of plays
which the Stanford Repertory
hopes to perform.
At least one Shakespearean
play and a new work by a prom
ising American playwright also
will be included. New scripts are
now being read.
New Emphasis
"Since the premiere season
stressed the classic repertoire,
this new emphasis on contem
porary plays should provide di
verse experience both for the
audience and our students," he
added.
In all, he said, four plays will
be given on the main stage of
Memorial Auditorium, while
two will be performed in the
Little Theater.
"We are extremely gratified
by the response of the public to
our first season and feel that
this has been the result of the
continuing push for high quali
ty in the productions as well as
the wide range of the plays,"
Loper said.
Most To lie turn
The majority of the company
will return for the second sea
son.
Erik Vos, well-known Dutch di
rector, who during the premiere
season directed "That Scoundrel
Scapin" and "Prometheus
Bound," will direct the opening
production. Vos is teaching at
Carnegie Institute of Technology
and directing at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse and will spend the
summer in his native Holland.
Mel Shapiro, director of "The
Skin of Our Teeth" and"The
Goodwoman of Setzuan" in the
current season, will take leave
from New York University to re
turn to Stanford.
