Brazil, the colossus of South
America, encompasses both the
sparkling modernity of Brasilia
and the dusty poverty of slums,
the notoriety of a Janio Quadros
or a Juscelino Kubitschek and
the annonymity of millions of
faceless farmers and laborers.
A History of Modern Brazil 1
1889-1964 by Jose Marie Bello
outlines the forces which com
bine into today's diverse Brazil.
In doing so, it portrays in vivid
sketches the succession of men
who guided and prodded Brazil
toward democracy.
Empire And After
The book opens with a glance
at Brazil just prior to the fall
of the Empire. For someone
with no background in the sub
ject, it will prove hard going,
for many essential facts are as
sumed and translators' foot
notes are welcome but of limit
ed help.
This initial weakness is quick
ly overcome, however, with the
first of many personality por

traits which draw the reader
into the story much as if he
were meeting a character in a
novel.
Dom Pedro 11, the last Em
peror of Brazil, was an unspec
tacular man whose dedication
and "sobriety, moderation, and
well-balanced morality" won him
public respect, even though the
monarchy he personified was to
be challenged and defeated by
growing Republicianism.
Personality Sketches
With the founding of the Re
public in 1889, the story of mod
ern Brazil begins. Bello inter
prets it more as the story of in
dividuals maneuvering for pow
er and less as that of men sub
ordinate to great social, political
and economic forces. These are,
of course, not neglected, but
form a background in contrast
to which individuals claim most
of our attention.
The resultant psychological in
sights are rewarding and en
joyable, and contrast with the
dryer reportorial approach of the
chapter on "Brazil since 1954," a
conclusion added by Rollie E.
Poppino. Here, we get all the
facts in sequence, but human
warmth is missing.
A History of Modern Brazil
thus focuses on personalities: in
terpretations concentrate more
often on human than political or
economic subjects. While there is
much more room for a detached
analysis of Brazilian society as a
whole, this approach, enhanced
by a fluid and lucid translation,
makes intriguing and reward
ing reading, a novel background
for understanding Brazil today.
