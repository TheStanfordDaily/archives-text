John H. Finley, Jr., Four
Stages of Greek Thought (The
Harry Camp lectures at Stan
ford University 1965). Stanford
University Press: 1966.
To anyone acquainted with
John Finley's usual platform
manner (or usual manner of
talking in any setting), the
Camp lectures as delivered were
a little disappointing: the manu
script had a somewhat inhibit
ing effect on the magnificent
classroom lecturer so many stu
dents have known. Yet the print
ed text is ample compensation
for any regrets. Here is some
thing that is indeed not for the
moment of its initial delivery,
John Finley's mature summa
tion of his ideas on Greek litera
ture from Homer to Aristotle.
Furthermore, it is written in ad
mirable English, English that
shows how far he has gone in
a lifetime. What impress me
particularly are the examples,
the concrete details so eloquent
ly marshalled into generaliza
tion.
The Ages
There are four chapters, each
stating a cardinal phase of
Greek literature and thought:
The Heroic, The Visionary, The
Theoretical and the Rational
Minds. It is difficult to compress
these distinctions into a couple
of sentences but I will try.
Finley sees in Homer (Heroic
Mind) a mind that works
through sensual images unen
cumbered by ideas. He sees in
the early and mid-fifth century
figures (Pindar, Aeschylus, So
phocles) minds that try to de
scribe a social reality or a soc
ial and to some extent person
al ideal, but still do so in vision
ary or mythical-sensual terms.

He treats Euripides and Thucyd
ides (the typical transitional fi
gures of the Sophistic Age) as
theoretical minds—minds that
either use myth only to reach
an unheroic and contradictory
result or abandon it to arrive
at a rather tragic view of real
ity. But in the rational mind of
the fourth century, Finley sees
a new realism and in its great
philosophers, Plato and Aristo
tie, a new rational solution of
the problems of the state and the
individual.
Finley's terms, of course—i.e.,

theoretical, heroic, visionary, ra
tional —are debatable and are not
in themselves important (the
distinction between theoretical
and rational seems to me a little
awkward). But his "notion of
sense and reason (the concrete
image of myth vs. the abstract
concept) and of the tension be
tween them seems to me very
enlightening. The great age—the
classical age of Aeschylus and
Sophocles—b r o u g h t a brief
'calm of tension' ('the poise of
the boy fully stretched') but this
was shattered by the emergence
of conceptual thought with the
Sophists.
Did Plato and Aristotle really
really recover a moral order or
harmony? Finley argues for a
positive answer but ends by as
serting that Socrates after all
was Plato's 'living example' or
'myth,' a myth held in some ten
sion with his rationalism.
Classical Vitality
The problem here is that Fin
ley is arguing 4or the present
relevance of the classics, for
Homer, Sophocles and Plato as
authors each independently val
uable to us, and not as phases of
a process in which the end in
evitably supersedes the begin
ning and middle. He thus tries
to emphasize the absolute value
of the imagistic or sensual as
well as that of the conceptual
or rational element of literature
and thought.
Where he is excellent is in
his own keenness of apprecia
tion: he touches with uncanny
skill the spots in Homer or
Pindar or Aeschylus to which we
still respond. But as to why we
still respond, why Homer, for
example, is still relevant to us,
he can only answer in terms of
Homer's exemplary power, his
creation of such 'archetypal'
heroes as Achilles or Odysseus.
I see nothing wrong with this

and much that is enlightening
(as well as very eloquently put)
but I would very tentatively
suggest it is far from enough.
(After all, Finley knows this: he
had to put so much into a hun
dred pages!)
When we compare the Greeks
with the Jews or the Babylon
ians, the ancient Indians or the
Chinese, we are conscious, I
think, of the amazing power of
the Greeks to reduce the vague
and cluttered, the diffuse and
immense to very clearcut,
brightly gleaming, immensely
plastic but quite limited images.
This power surely comes out
in their mythology as well as id
both the 'visionary' and 'ration
alistic' phases of their literature
(and of course in their art as
well).
Finley mentions the difference
between the accounts of the
dead in the Gilgamish epic and
in the Odyssey. But I do not de
tect in him any full awareness
of the extraordinary relevance
and importance of this very re
vealing difference. The point I
am trying to make, of course, is
that the Greeks by themselves
never quite explain themselves.
As one who has at least tried
to understand the Jews, Chinese
a"nd Indians, I feel I can say that
one senses something 'classical'

in Homer that one does not
sense in the Mahabharata, the
Gilgamish epic or the Old Testa
ment or, for that matter, in
later Western literature. The
Greek mind seemed to run nat
urally to definitive (and in this
sense classical) images as well
as to definitive ideas. And it is
only, I think, by comparison, by
realization of what is good and
bad or true and false in non
classical literature, that the
meaning of Greek classicism can
be brought out. But I cannot
blame John Finley for what he
omits: his hundred pages con
tain, in all conscience, enough.
Above all, they reflect their au
thor and he, too, is a classical
figure!
