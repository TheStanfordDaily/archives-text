J. R. R. Tolkien, The Ix>rd of
the Rings. New York: Ballantine
Books, Inc., 1965.
It is common knowledge at
Stanford that there are certain
trips one can take without prior
arrangements through the Se
quoia Travel Service. Indeed, in
recent weeks this travel-con
scious community has engaged
in a good deal of animated de
bate over the joys and hazards
of various modes of transport.
One of these modes is available,
of all places, at our friendly
bookstore.
Synthesized by J.R.R. Tolkien
(John Ronald Renel for those
who have been curious) during
the years 1936-1939, LOR became
available in 1954, but the form
in which it was first sold was
almost prohibitively expensive
and its current mass appeal
owes much to its availability in
paperback editions. LOR is
taken in large doses; the trilogy
totals over 1000 pages. Yet its
effects (side, back, or other) are
not known to be injurious, al
though there has been some
speculation that prolonged ex
posure may be Hobbit forming.
Middle Earth
Tolkien enchants his readers
with a secondary world which
may be entered easily through
the power of imagination. Giv
ing ourselves over to his spell,
we find that we are in the midst
of things: in Middle Earth, in
the midst of a story somewhere
in the midst of time—the third
age in the history of a world
that has already experienced
days and years of blossom and
of blight. It is a fantastic world,
inhabited by such diverse species
as hobbits, wizards, ores and
trolls. Yet its borders blend
subtly with the world of our
experience.
Tolkien composes his second
ary world with materials from
the primary world, and so one
would expect to find much in
Middle Earth that is familiar:
happily there are such similari
ties as may be expressed in
hauntingly beautiful landscapes
and in good humor. But one may
also find the all too familiar:
the inhabitants of Middle Earth
are divided against themselves,
beset with the spirit of fear,
hatred and suspicion, and faced
with the challenge to save all
they love from an evil end with
out resorting to evil means that
would corrupt their love.
Middle Earth is intimately re
lated to our primary world, but
this does not mean that The
Lord of the Rings is an allegory.
As Tolkien takes pains to point
out in his foreword, applicability
should not be confused with al
legory; "the one resides in the
freedom of the reader, and the
other in the purposed domina
tion of the author."
Spirit Engendered
The Lord of the Rings is not
an argument; it is an experience

to be enjoyed for its own sake.
But imaginative participation in
Tolkien's world may engender a
spirit that persists beyond the
act of reading. Those who have
been "there and back again"
usually feel that they have been
changed to some extent by their
experience; something of Middle
Earth stays with them to color
their perceptions of the primary
world. Having once seen "Ents,"
one could hardly look at our
fantastic oaks without seeing in
their old gnarled limbs a new
dimension of life. In this sense,
Tolkein, like Heschel, teaches us
"the art of celebration" and as
sists us to recover the common
place from triviality.
The Lord of the Rings cannot
be all things to all men. While
it may serve to heighten our
appreciation for beauty and
wonder in our midst it may, for
some, lack sufficient social con
cern. When the mass of men
look at a tree, their most vital
concern often directs itself to
whether it bears fruit.
But there is little point in
criticizing a book for lacking
that which is outside its concern
when it succeeds so well in what
it sets out to provide: "a really
long story that would hold the
attention of readers, amuse
them, delight them, and at
times maybe excite them or
deeply move them." Professor
Tolkien has given us a great
deal in an imaginative achieve
ment that can transport us to
"regions where pain and delight
flow together and tears are the
very wine of blessedness," and
return us with increased appre
ciation to much that is in our
midst.

we find that we are in the midst
of things: in Middle Earth, in
the midst of a story somewhere
in the midst of time—the third
age in the history of a world
that has already experienced
days and years of blossom and
of blight. It is a fantastic world,
inhabited by such diverse species
as hobbits, wizards, ores and
trolls. Yet its borders blend
subtly with the world of our
experience.
Tolkien composes his second
ary world with materials from
the primary world, and so one
would expect to find much in
Middle Earth that is familiar:
happily there are such similari
ties as may be expressed in
hauntingly beautiful landscapes
and in good humor. But one may
also find the all too familiar:
the inhabitants of Middle Earth
are divided against themselves,
beset with the spirit of fear,
hatred and suspicion, and faced
with the challenge to save all
they love from an evil end with
out resorting to evil means that
would corrupt their love.
Middle Earth is intimately re
lated to our primary world, but
this does not mean that The
Lord of the Rings is an allegory.
As Tolkien takes pains to point
out in his foreword, applicability
should not be confused with al
legory; "the one resides in the
freedom of the reader, and the
other in the purposed domina
tion of the author."
Spirit Engendered
The Lord of the Rings is not
an argument; it is an experience

to be enjoyed for its own sake.
But imaginative participation in
Tolkien's world may engender a
spirit that persists beyond the
act of reading. Those who have
been "there and back again"
usually feel that they have been
changed to some extent by their
experience; something of Middle
Earth stays with them to color
their perceptions of the primary
world. Having once seen "Ents,"
one could hardly look at our
fantastic oaks without seeing in
their old gnarled limbs a new
dimension of life. In this sense,
Tolkein, like Heschel, teaches us
"the art of celebration" and as
sists us to recover the common
place from triviality.
The Lord of the Rings cannot
be all things to all men. While
it may serve to heighten our
appreciation for beauty and
wonder in our midst it may, for
some, lack sufficient social con
cern. When the mass of men
look at a tree, their most vital
concern often directs itself to
whether it bears fruit.
But there is little point in
criticizing a book for lacking
that which is outside its concern
when it succeeds so well in what
it sets out to provide: "a really
long story that would hold the
attention of readers, amuse
them, delight them, and at
times maybe excite them or
deeply move them." Professor
Tolkien has given us a great
deal in an imaginative achieve
ment that can transport us to
"regions where pain and delight
flow together and tears are the
very wine of blessedness," and
return us with increased appre
ciation to much that is in our
midst.

an argument; it is an experience

to be enjoyed for its own sake.
But imaginative participation in
Tolkien's world may engender a
spirit that persists beyond the
act of reading. Those who have
been "there and back again"
usually feel that they have been
changed to some extent by their
experience; something of Middle
Earth stays with them to color
their perceptions of the primary
world. Having once seen "Ents,"
one could hardly look at our
fantastic oaks without seeing in
their old gnarled limbs a new
dimension of life. In this sense,
Tolkein, like Heschel, teaches us
"the art of celebration" and as
sists us to recover the common
place from triviality.
The Lord of the Rings cannot
be all things to all men. While
it may serve to heighten our
appreciation for beauty and
wonder in our midst it may, for
some, lack sufficient social con
cern. When the mass of men
look at a tree, their most vital
concern often directs itself to
whether it bears fruit.
But there is little point in
criticizing a book for lacking
that which is outside its concern
when it succeeds so well in what
it sets out to provide: "a really
long story that would hold the
attention of readers, amuse
them, delight them, and at
times maybe excite them or
deeply move them." Professor
Tolkien has given us a great
deal in an imaginative achieve
ment that can transport us to
"regions where pain and delight
flow together and tears are the
very wine of blessedness," and
return us with increased appre
ciation to much that is in our
midst.
