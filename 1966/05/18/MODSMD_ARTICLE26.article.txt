### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford baseballers closed out
their season last weekend by
splitting two games against play
off-bound Cal Poly of Pomona.
Cal Poly won Friday, 3-2. The
Tribe won Saturday, 3-0.
Jim Hibbs was the only one
with two hits Friday as he
blasted a double for an RBI.
John Mason, the starting pitcher,
gave up eight hits and absorbed
the loss.
Terry Docken did a fine job
Saturday against Cal Poly, limit
ing them to two hits while he
was getting two hits himself. The
hits against him—both by the
same man—were a bloop single
to right and a drag bunt.
Hibbs Triples
Catcher Hibbs went two for
three including another run-pro
ducing triple. Marty Erck dou
bled to knock in another run.
Shortstop Frank Duffy got an
RBI on a fielder's choice.
Although they got only three
runs, Stanford had quite a day
up at the plate.
Steve Hovley, Dick Swan, Tom
Melzer, Hibbs, and Docken all
got two hits apiece.
Meanwhile, Cal took two out
of three games from Santa Clara
to tie Stanford for second place
in the league while UCLA was
losing to USC to fall into third
place.
The Trojans' weekend sweep
easily regained them the CIBA
title.
