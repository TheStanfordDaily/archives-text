# Open House Opens Law Conflict
## 
### WENDY WEINER 
The controversial ASSU open house
policy was the major topic of discus
sion at the Committee of 15 meeting
on Monday afternoon.
The By-Laws amendment, passed
last Thursday and effective as of
this Friday, is in conflict with present
University policy.
The bill establishes new open house
hours whereby non-lobby areas in all
undergraduate residences will be open
Sunday through Thursday from 12
noon until 12 midnight and on week
ends from 10 a.m. unti 12:30 a.m. Liv
ing units will be able to decide their
individual policies within these maxi
mum limitatons.

The bill also removes all restrictions
from graduate student residences.
The Committee's Resolution
The Committee of 15 passed a reso
lution reminding LASSU of the func
tion of the Committee. The Commit
tee of 15 was created with the hope
of preventing unilateral action by any
of the three bodies it represents: the
administration, the faculty, and the
student body.
According to both Dr. Philip Rhine
lander, chairman of the Committee,
and Sandy Mackenzie, ASSU President
and a member of the Committee,
LASSU took such unilateral action in
its decision to consider a change in
open house regulations before the is

sue had gone through established
channels.
Frustrated Legislature
The Legislature had cause for frus
tration, said Mackenzie, commenting
on the lack of willingness to negotiate
demonstrated by the Committee of Af
fairs and Services, to which the bill
had been referred on January 20. The
Committee of Affairs and Services
has been holding closed meetings de
spite the fact that a subcommittee of
the Legislature studied the problem
thoroughtly, taking a random sample
poll about open house and releasing
the results to that committee.
"I think it's unfortunate, however,
that these legislators didn't take ad
vantage of the existing mechanism of
the Committee of 15 before taking
unilateral action," Mackinzie con
cluded.
Committee Of 15
The Committee of 15 is basically
a discussion body, explained Dr.
Rhinelander. But "if action is taken be
fore the discussion can occur, it seems
to reduce the degree of effectiveness
which that discussion might have
had."
Jay Kadane, Speaker of the Legis
lature, stated that under the ASSU
By-Laws, which were negotiated and
agreed upon by the University, the
new open house policy can go into ef
fect Friday despite the conflict in law.
According to the By-Laws, "If Uni
versity policy or laws conflict with
the ASSU Constitution or By-Laws,
the latter shall be controlling in ASSU
judicial proceedings."
Kadane's Speculation
"There is a question of whether
the University will prosecute unde â€¢
the conflict of law," continued Ka
dane. "The conflict on liquor worked
in such a way that although there
was a regulation, a student was never
prosecuted for just drinking. The Uni
versity may choose to have such a pol
icy regarding openhouse or it may
not."
Kadane pointed out that if the Uni
versity should decide to prosecute an
individual for violating openhouse reg
ulations, the case would go before the
ASSU Judicial Council. If the case
were in accord with ASSU policy but
not that of the University, it would
be referred to the Tribunal, "the Uni
versity kangaroo court."

"The only recourse open to the
student body at that point," said
Kadane, "would be extra-legal."
"As of this Friday," Kadane explain
ed the new open house procedure, "if
living units haven't met and formul
lated their own policy, the maximum
ruling will be in effect."
