## Odd Platform For A Leftist 
### 
The students at one of the
larger West coast universities
have elected a new president,
and news stories have described
him (as did some headlines) as
a leftist. He not only has an odd
program for a leftist, but an
analysis of his radicalism indi
cates it is not nearly as daring
as some of that expressed here
in Tucson, on the University of
Arizona campus, during the
Great Depression.
The new leftist student head
advocates abolition of grading
systems, student representation
on the board of trustees of his
university and abolition of fra
ternities.
The lad is an honors student
and a men's hall sponsor, posi
tions hard to allot except on
some system of grading, so pre
sumably his thinking along
those lines needs clarification.

As to wanting a student place
on the board of trustees, such a
board is a continuing organiza
tion and no one-year position
would be likely to be more than
complimentary or of a liaison
nature. And in advocating the
end of the fraternity system,
the student hardly uttered any
thing original.
So is that being a leftist? Not
a word about his political be
liefs, not a word about Viet
Nam, not a word about social
progress entered the student
campaign he won, so far as can
be determined.
Things were not much differ
ent years ago. Students unhesi
tatingly remodeled the world—
not just the campus—and often
did it over illegal beer. They
also rebelled (as every genera
tion does) against their elders.
There are some prominent peo

ple around the country, prac
ticing law, managing businesses,
teaching school and doing other
things, who found themselves in
conflict with the university ad
ministration on such points as
publishing the Wildcat or the
KittyKat, or doing away with
hazing.
Ferment on campuses is not
new. It occurs in a milder form
in the United States than almost
anywhere. It is symptomatic of
youth. Sometimes it is taken out
in demonstrations, sometimes in
protests, sometimes in such an
tics as telephone-booth packing
or goldfish swallowing, some
times in panty raids and some
times in other ways. The best
thing is to treat it in perspec
tive.
