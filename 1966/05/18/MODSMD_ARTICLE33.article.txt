# Spy Records Proceedings Of Athletic Control Board
## 
### Bob Fisbman 
Last week I had the privilege
of sitting in at a secret meeting
of the Board of Athletic Control.
"Sitting in" is not quite accu
rate; I was hiding under the
conference table at the time.
Despite the indignities of my
position, I managed to make a
few notes.
A coach was talking to the
members:
"I have news of the most dire
consequences to report to you
gentlemen. We are about to lose
our entire football team." (Cries
of "Horrors," "Zounds," and
other epithets.)
"Our — er — agents have
been keeping a close watch on
the boys, and here are some of
the things they've flushed out:
• Seven members of the var
sity squad were caught reading
books that were required.
• Ten were observed talking
to professors with known intel
lectual tendencies.
• And, worst of all, I just got
the word from Dean Winbigler
that three of our boys have been
named to the Dean's List."
(Shouts of "Anything but
that!" filled the room. Three as
sistant backfield coaches could
be heard sobbing hysterically.)
"Now I don't want to make
any slanderous accusations," but
it seems to me that our recruit
ing department has fallen down
on the job. Now who was it who
signed up that Merit Scholar?"
From my vantage point under
the table I noticed the knees of
one man begin to shake violent
ly.
"It was you, Smedly, wasn't
it? Own up to your failures like
a man.

"Don't blame me guys! He
promised me he wouldn't study.
He told me he'd join the Delts
as soon as he got the chance.
He swore to me he'd m a jo r in
History!"
"Did you know he writes
poetry?
"Poetry!" Smedley cried. "You
know what I think of perver
sions like that!"
"Look what happened, Smed
ley. He became an English ma
jor, moved into Stern, joined
the Young Democrats, and
hasn't had a haircut since
Christmas."
"No more excuses, Smedley!
You and your recruit are a dis
grace to Stanford athletics. And
you know what happens to peo
ple who let us down . .
Smedley's knees began to
shake violently.
"No, not that, anything but
that!"
"You know the penalties for
failure in this organization.
From now on you're in charge
of intermurals."
"Let that" the coach said "be
a lesson to anyone who falls
prey to the creeping cancer of
intellectualism that's sweeping
this campus.
"When we go out there to give
our all for the old school, we
don't want any of those unusual,
different types fouling up the
works. After all, we represent a
great university."
(Fervent cries of "Hear,
hear!" and "One more for the
gipper!" could be heard as the
meeting adjourned.)

that three of our boys have been
named to the Dean's List."
(Shouts of "Anything but
that!" filled the room. Three as
sistant backfield coaches could
be heard sobbing hysterically.)
"Now I don't want to make
any slanderous accusations," but
it seems to me that our recruit
ing department has fallen down
on the job. Now who was it who
signed up that Merit Scholar?"
From my vantage point under
the table I noticed the knees of
one man begin to shake violent
ly.
"It was you, Smedly, wasn't
it? Own up to your failures like
a man.

"Don't blame me guys! He
promised me he wouldn't study.
He told me he'd join the Delts
as soon as he got the chance.
He swore to me he'd m a jo r in
History!"
"Did you know he writes
poetry?
"Poetry!" Smedley cried. "You
know what I think of perver
sions like that!"
"Look what happened, Smed
ley. He became an English ma
jor, moved into Stern, joined
the Young Democrats, and
hasn't had a haircut since
Christmas."
"No more excuses, Smedley!
You and your recruit are a dis
grace to Stanford athletics. And
you know what happens to peo
ple who let us down . .
Smedley's knees began to
shake violently.
"No, not that, anything but
that!"
"You know the penalties for
failure in this organization.
From now on you're in charge
of intermurals."
"Let that" the coach said "be
a lesson to anyone who falls
prey to the creeping cancer of
intellectualism that's sweeping
this campus.
"When we go out there to give
our all for the old school, we
don't want any of those unusual,
different types fouling up the
works. After all, we represent a
great university."
(Fervent cries of "Hear,
hear!" and "One more for the
gipper!" could be heard as the
meeting adjourned.)
Last week I had the privilege
of sitting in at a secret meeting
of the Board of Athletic Control.
"Sitting in" is not quite accu
rate; I was hiding under the
conference table at the time.
Despite the indignities of my
position, I managed to make a
few notes.
A coach was talking to the
members:
"I have news of the most dire
consequences to report to you
gentlemen. We are about to lose
our entire football team." (Cries
of "Horrors," "Zounds," and
other epithets.)
"Our — er — agents have
been keeping a close watch on
the boys, and here are some of
the things they've flushed out:
• Seven members of the var
sity squad were caught reading
books that were required.
• Ten were observed talking
to professors with known intel
lectual tendencies.
• And, worst of all, I just got
the word from Dean Winbigler
that three of our boys have been
named to the Dean's List."
(Shouts of "Anything but
that!" filled the room. Three as
sistant backfield coaches could
