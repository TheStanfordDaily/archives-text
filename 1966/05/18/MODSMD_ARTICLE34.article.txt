## Alumnus Finds Pill Debate Shocking 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a conservatice "Old Grad,"
I am sincerely shocked by the
recent, student referrundum re
questing the Stanford Adminis
tration to authorize the Health
Service to prescribe contracep
tives. This shock, which is build
ing toward indignation, is in re
sponse to two facts concerning
the situation, as follows:
• An administrative order has
been issued directing the physi
cians of the Health Service to re
frain, under certain circum
stances, from writing certain le
gal prescriptions, regardless of
the need of the particular patient
or the diagnosis of the physi
cian.
* The Director of the Health
Service has defended this ad
ministrative interferance with
his physicians' professional free
dom. lie has even labeled the stu
dents' ballot proposition (which,
if excepted, would merely re
lease an unjustified and unpro
fessional constraint on his staff)
as "simplistic."
It is true that some few stu
dents arc advocating that . .
churches and schools should not
be concerned with the morals of
the individual." That idea, of
course, is not only "simplistic,"
it is absurd. It is tantamount to
saying that churches and schools
should not be concerned with hu
man relationships.
The recent referrundum, how
ever, is an entirely different mat
ter. It seeks the resumption of
mature human relationships be
tween students (encountering
certain universal and crucial
problems with far reaching ef
fects, both inner and outer) and
the University at precisely the
most appropriate point: the phy
sician's private office. I submit
that this request, for all its
bluster, cannot morally be re
fused.
Every practicing physician
knowns the problems raised by
those uninformed patients who
demand penicillan for every ail
ment. Sometimes these bother
some situations are an oppor
tunity for the physician to help
the patient develop an adequate
response to colds. In any case,
the bother of the demand for
help should not be reacted to
by an arbitrary rule that physi
cians be prohibited from ever
prescribing penicillan for a giv
en category of students, regard
less of the illness! That relation
ship-refusing reaction is not only
"simplistic," it is immoral.
Surely Stanford, with its long
and valued tradition of the open

door, where any student can
seek help from the faculty and
staff, should not now close that
door in any area. Least of all
should this be done in the area
of sexual relationship, where
the rewards and the dangers are
so great and where such little
wisdom as has been collected
over the years is so badly
needed.

• Pill Compromise
Editor, The Daily:
The recent explanations of the
University's changing policy on
birth control and the Student
Health Service give a deplorable
picture of the motivations and
principles of the administration,
but they do suggest possible
grounds for a workable compro
mise. Perhaps the solution is not
ideal, but it con do something
toward bringing the services of
Student Health more in line
with student needs.
The proposal is simply to
allow the Health Service doctors
to use their own discretion In
distributing contraceptive infor
mation and equipment to all
interested students over the age
of 21. Similar services should
be available to underage stu
dents if the Health Service ob
tains the written consent of the
parent or guardian.
There are several points to
consider in such a system. The
first, and perhaps most serious
objection, is that the obtaining
of consent for underage stu
dents might be considered a vio
lation of the confidential doctor
patient relationship. On the
other hand, once a student is in
formed of this policy, his con
tinued application to the Health
Service may be construed as
tacit consent. Moreover, the plan
is hardly less ethical than the
present system, which does not
allow the physician to use his
discretion at all.
The second difficulty is the
problem of the underage stu
dent whose parents are opposed
to his use of contraceptives. The
ideal solution is for the student
to come to some understanding
with his parents, but in any

case, he is still free to consult a
private physician, which is cer
tainly no worse than the present
system.
In more general terms, this
system has the advantage of giv
ing the University an answer to
parental objections in that the
parents validly concerned, those
of the student involved, are con
sulted. There is no "pros
miscuous, wholesale" distribu
tion of contraceptives to young,
and perhaps unthinking, stu
dents.
Thus the advantages of such
a compromise which deflects the
storm of parental protest, and
which returns this facet of stu
dent welfare to the people most
concerned with the total well
being of the students on cam
pus (at least for most of the
interested students) should far
outweigh the possible clerical
disadvantages and should argue
for revision of current policy.

• Rather Offensive
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Dr. Osborne's
letter (The Daily, May 12), I
can only say that I find it rather
offensive that "the President"
should act "from his own convic
tions" on contraception if, in
doing so, he attempts to impose
his morality on the rest of the
university.

• Journalese
Editor, The Daily:
Kirk Hanen's first article on
LSD (The Daily, May 11) con
tains at least one incredibly
dangerous inaccuracy, and his
style seems to indicate that his
grasp of a highly complex sub
ject is limited to cliches. Larger
and larger doses are, of course,
not required in the use of psy
chedelic drugs like LSD, as any
researcher will tell you; in fact
it is the finding that smaller
and smaller does produce mind
changing effects that consti
tutes one of the legitimate "dan
gers" of drug taking.
The issue has already been

clouded by too much Sunday
supplement vulgarity, by too
many authorities acting in ig
norance, and by too much hys
terical debate between LSD
phobes and LSD-faddists for
The Daily to compound the fel
ony with misinformation and ir
responsible commentary. The
truest thing Hanen says is that
"LSD has assumed a place
along side the hydrogen bomb."
This durg has the power to
work profound, even metaphysi
cal changes on the lives and out
looks of the people who come
into contact with it. If this is
the case, and if, in fact, some
10 to 20 per cent of the Stan
ford community is involved,
then certainly The Daily ought
to be able to summon the re
sources to cover the subject in
telligently and responsibly.
It is very necessary to com
bat, rather than participate in,
the flow of rumors and half
truths that accompany an un
derground debate on any para
legal subject, since in the ab
sence of anything more legiti
mate, this type of journalism
may well be the students' only
source of information; few, in
any case, are even aware of the
existence, much less the impor
tance, of the several reliable
writings on psychedelic drugs
that do exist.

• Cadet View
Editor, The Daily:
As cadets in the Stanford
ROTC, we gave no blood and
were in no way coerced or oth
erwise forced to donate blood by
Major William C. Hammil (or
anyone else).
Major Hammill is one of the
many great men of our Armed
Forces who is going to Vietnam
prepared to give his life for our
basic American freedoms.
One of these freedoms as free
dom of the press, which you
have so blatantly abused In
slandering such a fine man; an
other is the right to peacefully
demonstrate.
This has also been abused by
people, such as your student
body president, who go out of
their way to cause trouble un
der the guise of "civil rights,"
"academic freedom," or "peace."
