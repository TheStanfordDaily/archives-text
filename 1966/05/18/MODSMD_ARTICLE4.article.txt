# RULE'S STUDY
## Premarital Sex Increasing 
### 
Increased premarital intercourse
among college students is largely
caused by a reaction to parental hy
pocrisy, according to Prof. John T.
Rule of M.I.T.
Rule, who was a consultant for the
The College Student, will speak to
night at 7:30 in Dinkelspiel on "Chang
ing Viewpoints Toward Sex."
"A growing number of students do
not consider premarital sexual in
tercourse immoral," Rule says. He
notes this change in attitude is largely
a result of society's own shift from
religious moral codes toward those
based on individualism.
Surveying Students
Rule is presently conducting a study
of students and changing codes of
morality. Tonight's speech will focus
on the implications of sexual relations
and ways of reconciling conflicts.
The speech is the last in a series
of lecture-discussions on personal be
havior co-sponsored by Stanford To
day and Tomorrow and the Dean of
Students office.
In an article published by The
Atlantic Monthly, Rule commented

that increased availability and effici
ency of birth control methods have
removed the fear of pregnancy from
intercourse.
Virginity Still Important
"This is not to say the question of
maintenance of virginity is not im
portant to women," he wrote. "Its
emotional content, its deep moral
roots, make it a major problem in the
midst of the concurrent search for
personal identity."
Rule said schools that believe educa
tion is not centered only in the class
room generally have adopted more
liberal regulations for students. Such
colleges allow visitors of the opposite
sex in dorm rooms, have removed
dating restrictions, and have made
other important changes.
But once a college commits itself to
"total education," Rule said, it must
consider the development of its stu
dents in non-classroom situations.
Assumed Maturity
The proper guideline, he said, is to
assume students are mature and then
deal with "lapses into immaturity in
mature ways."
The M.I.T. professor believes sex
should become a healthy, desirable,
and normal aspect of everyone's life.
But he warns many of its facets make
its integration—especially for college
students—extremely difficult.
