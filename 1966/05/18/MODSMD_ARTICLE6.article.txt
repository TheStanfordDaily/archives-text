# Special Meeting Of Faculty Council Resolves To Study Research, Draft
## 
### 
With virtually unanimity, the Stan
ford faculty yesterday called for com
mittee study of University involve
ment in classified research and selec
tive service.
An overflow crowd of approximate
ly 325 professors attended a special
meeting of the Academic Council in
the Physics Tank and discussed these
issues for nearly two hours. The
Council has about 800 members.
Resolutions adopted by the Coun
cil read in full as follows:
• Research: "The Academic Coun
cil recommends that the underlying

questions concerning sponsored and
classified research be reviewed by the
Executive Committee with a view to
later recommendations to the Aca
demic Council.
"Pending this review, the Academic
Council recommends that each re
search proposal and contract which re
quires security classification be re
viewed for acceptability by a standing
committee of the Academic Council
and that the recommendations of that
committee be reported to the Presi
dent (of the Universiy).
"Further, the Academic Council re

quests the Committee on the Gradu
ate Division to review the question of
graduate student participation in
classified research and make sure that
its policies and procedures in regard
to approval of classified thesis pro
grams serve the best interest of such
students."
• Selective Service; "The Academic
Council directs its Executive Commit
tee, or empowers a committee appoint
ed by the Executive Committee, to
consider the relationship of the Uni
versity to Selective Service, including
but not limited to the resolution of
Selective Service adopted unanimously
by the San Francisco State (Faculty)
Senate (April 19) and to report its
recommendations to the Academic
Council at the next meeting."
Prof. Ernest Hilgard, chairman of
the Academic Council Executive Com
mittee, said it will meet Tuesday after
noon. The next regular meeting of
the full Council is scheduled June 10.
Stanford has disclosed that it has
13 classified research contracts, in
cluding one with the Central Intelli
gence Agency, in engineering tech
nology. Since 1948, when records were
first kept, 30 students have submitted
classified theses. Fourteen of these
no longer are classified.
Research Policy
In 1964, the Committee on Univer
sity Policy—which includes the Aca
demic Council Executive Committee —
adopted the following statement on
freedom of publication:
"It is the policy of Stanford Uni
versity to guarantee to its faculty
their historic freedom of scholarly
publication. To this end, the Univer
sity does not normally accept agree
ments for research support which con
tains provisions restricting the schol
ar's right to disseminate the results
of his research in the manner, place
and time of his choosing.
"An exception to this policy shall
be where the research to be conducted
involves the possible generation of
classified material and where the pur
pose of publication review is solely
to determine whether the research re
sults must be given security classifica
tion under existing agency regula
tions."
Selective Service Policy
The University provides counseling
to students on questions involving se
lective service, but provides informa

tion on academic standing only with
the consent of the individuals con
cerned. It has served as a center for
the nation-wide tests administered by
Science Research Associates for Selec
tive Service.
