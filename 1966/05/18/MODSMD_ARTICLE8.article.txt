## 
### 
Prof. Paul A. Samuelson, one of
America's most distinguished econo
mists and author of the well known
text, Economis: An Introductory
Analysis, is visiting Stanford this
week.
He will be guest-in-residence at
Stern Hall today through Friday. His
program includes informal meetings
with students at meals and lounge dis
cussions, and a panel discussion in
TMU Thursday. (See schedule below.)
Panel participants include Prof.
John Gurley of the Department of
Economics and Prof. James E. Howell
of the Graduate School of Business.
Dr. Samuelson has taught at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology for

the past 25 years and has been a sig
nificantly influential commentator on
the nation's economic health.
He has been a top advisor to both
the Kennedy and Johnson administra
tions, a member of the Committee for
Economic Development, and a former
president of both the American Eco
nomic Association and the Economet
ric Society.
Samuelson's textbook, now in its
sixth edition, is used by about 40 per
cent of all college students taking in
troductory economics. Economics has
been translated into fourteen lan
guages, including Russian.
Educated at the University of Chi
cago and Harvard, Samuelson is des
cribed by the New York Post as "a
youthful scholar, high-spirited, good
humored, ealculatedly impetuous and
even brash, with a disarming way of
making firm arguments without tak
ing himself too seriously."
