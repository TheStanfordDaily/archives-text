# SLAC's Tomorrow May Revolutionize Science
## 
### PAT McMAHON (Last in a series 
In less than a year, some of science's
basic theories concerning atoms, elec
trons, and negative particles may be
revolutionized. These stunning possi
bilities could be the result of research
at SLAC, now completing construc
tion.
Some of the most exciting research
being carried out today is concerned
with investigating the nature of what
might be the limits of our physical
universe. One of the limits of course
is the "outer limit," the regions of
space which appear to bound our
either expanding or pulsating cosmos.
The other limit is in the opposite di
rection, toward the unutterably
small, the baffling dynamism of the
seemingly basic constituents of all
matter, the "elementary particles."
The experiments planned for SLAC
include the production of secondary
particle beams, studies of electron
and photon-induced processes, study
of particle structure, the extension of
quantum electrodynamics, and the
search for new particles.
Electricity
When SLAC begins full scale op
eration next year, the electricity bill
will total $750 thousand. SLAC will
be using as much power as the city
of Palo Alto.
This amount represents only one
twentieth of the yearly operating costs

scheduled for the accelerator. These
expenses and the initial $114 million
construction cost necessitated that the
federal government finance the proj
ect, and that it consequently be a na
tional facility.
National Facility
The national facility according to
the contract with the Atomic Energy
Commission asks certain considera

tions as to the research carried out:
• "Rapid progress in the field is of
high importance, affecting, as it does,
man's understanding of the nature of
matter.
• "There is a major need to accom
modate scientists from other institu
tions, as well as the University, and
to utilize the National Facility to the
fullest extent consistent with the best

interests of the Government and the
highest scientific objectives.
• "Scientific priority generally shall
govern the allocation of machine time
for carrying out accelerator experi
ments.
• "Scientists from other institutions
shall participate in the deliberations
regarding priority, scheduling, and
allocation of machine time for carry
ing out accelerator experiments."
Committees
In accordance with the last stipula
tion of the contract, there have been
two committees set up. The Scientific
Policy Committee is an advisory com
mitee to the President of Stanford on
SLAC's performance as a national fa
cility. The director of SLAC has the
responsibility to schedule the use of
the accelerator, and has a committee
to advise him. The Program Advisory
Committee helps him establish the
program commitments for the use of
the accelerator.
A major concern of the Scientific
Policy Committee is to ascertain that
the Linear Accelerator is "made avail
able to qualified scientists from other
institutions as well as Stanford Uni
versity, subject only to the quality and
productiveness of the research pro
gram."
The committee has "maximum flex
ibility to consider all scientific and
technical matters pertaining to the
accelerator." Members of the commit

tee are nominated by the SLAC direc
tor and approved by the Board of
Trustees and the AEC.
Members At Stanford
Chairman of that committee which
presently consists of ten physicists
is Professor Roger Hildebrand of the
University of Chicago, and includes
two Stanford professors, Drs. Barber
and Schiff.
The Program Advisory Committee
consists of four Stanford professors
and four other doctors and meet reg
ularly every two to four weeks. Stan
ford professors include Professors
Drell, Berman, Ballam, and Richter.
This committee checks safety pre
cautions, equipment SLAC has avail
able, and works out the schedule and
blocks of time for the experiments.
Procedure
Procedure for proposing an experi
ment is relatively simple. After de
ciding upon the experiment, the ex
perimenter may submit in writing a
request for beam time or he may first
discuss the experiment with the SLAC
staff regarding equipment that will be
needed and special characteristics of
the accelerator.
Once the proposal is accepted for
the accelerator and the Program Ad
visory Committee allocates the time
for it, it is then the responsibility of
the Operations Division of SLAC to
work with the exeprimenter for the

execution of the experiment.
Now as SLAC nears those final
steps, newspapers hold the AEC's
word of the world's largest atom
smasher for which three possible sites
have already been selected. It is im
portant to note however that this
$315 million accelerator is of the cir
cular type and will help to supplement
the research at SLAC. The circular
accelerator will deal with protons and
neutrons.
Future Unknown
One of the excitements of this new
science is that the future is so un
known. Throughout the short history
of accelerator development, many ac
celerators have often turned out to be
the most dramatically effective in areas
not even known about at the time of
their original conception. Elementary
particle physics stands at the frontier
of man's knowledge. As Professor W.
K. H. Panofsky, Director of SLAC,
has said, "All other physical sciences,
and probably all life sciences, must
ultimately rest on the findings of ele
mentary particle physics. It would
indeed violate all our past experience
in the progress of sicence if nature
had created a family of phenomena
which governs the behavior of ele
mentary particles without at the same
time establishing any links between
these phenomena and the large-scale
world which is built from those very
particles."

of man's knowledge. As Professor W.
K. H. Panofsky, Director of SLAC,
has said, "All other physical sciences,
and probably all life sciences, must
ultimately rest on the findings of ele
mentary particle physics. It would
indeed violate all our past experience
in the progress of sicence if nature
had created a family of phenomena
which governs the behavior of ele
mentary particles without at the same
time establishing any links between
these phenomena and the large-scale
world which is built from those very
particles."
In less than a year, some of science's
basic theories concerning atoms, elec
trons, and negative particles may be
revolutionized. These stunning possi
bilities could be the result of research
at SLAC, now completing construc
tion.
Some of the most exciting research
being carried out today is concerned
with investigating the nature of what
might be the limits of our physical
universe. One of the limits of course
is the "outer limit," the regions of
space which appear to bound our
either expanding or pulsating cosmos.
The other limit is in the opposite di
rection, toward the unutterably
small, the baffling dynamism of the
seemingly basic constituents of all
matter, the "elementary particles."
The experiments planned for SLAC
include the production of secondary
particle beams, studies of electron
and photon-induced processes, study
of particle structure, the extension of
quantum electrodynamics, and the
search for new particles.
Electricity
When SLAC begins full scale op
eration next year, the electricity bill
will total $750 thousand. SLAC will
be using as much power as the city
of Palo Alto.
This amount represents only one
twentieth of the yearly operating costs

scheduled for the accelerator. These
expenses and the initial $114 million
construction cost necessitated that the
federal government finance the proj
ect, and that it consequently be a na
tional facility.
National Facility
The national facility according to
the contract with the Atomic Energy
Commission asks certain considera

tions as to the research carried out:
• "Rapid progress in the field is of
high importance, affecting, as it does,
man's understanding of the nature of
matter.
• "There is a major need to accom
modate scientists from other institu
tions, as well as the University, and
to utilize the National Facility to the
fullest extent consistent with the best

interests of the Government and the
highest scientific objectives.
• "Scientific priority generally shall
govern the allocation of machine time
for carrying out accelerator experi
ments.
• "Scientists from other institutions
shall participate in the deliberations
regarding priority, scheduling, and
allocation of machine time for carry
ing out accelerator experiments."
Committees
In accordance with the last stipula
tion of the contract, there have been
two committees set up. The Scientific
Policy Committee is an advisory com
mitee to the President of Stanford on
SLAC's performance as a national fa
cility. The director of SLAC has the
responsibility to schedule the use of
the accelerator, and has a committee
to advise him. The Program Advisory
Committee helps him establish the
program commitments for the use of
the accelerator.
A major concern of the Scientific
Policy Committee is to ascertain that
the Linear Accelerator is "made avail
able to qualified scientists from other
institutions as well as Stanford Uni
versity, subject only to the quality and
productiveness of the research pro
gram."
The committee has "maximum flex
ibility to consider all scientific and
technical matters pertaining to the
accelerator." Members of the commit

tee are nominated by the SLAC direc
tor and approved by the Board of
Trustees and the AEC.
Members At Stanford
Chairman of that committee which
presently consists of ten physicists
is Professor Roger Hildebrand of the
University of Chicago, and includes
two Stanford professors, Drs. Barber
and Schiff.
The Program Advisory Committee
consists of four Stanford professors
and four other doctors and meet reg
ularly every two to four weeks. Stan
ford professors include Professors
Drell, Berman, Ballam, and Richter.
This committee checks safety pre
cautions, equipment SLAC has avail
able, and works out the schedule and
blocks of time for the experiments.
Procedure
Procedure for proposing an experi
ment is relatively simple. After de
ciding upon the experiment, the ex
perimenter may submit in writing a
request for beam time or he may first
discuss the experiment with the SLAC
staff regarding equipment that will be
needed and special characteristics of
the accelerator.
Once the proposal is accepted for
the accelerator and the Program Ad
visory Committee allocates the time
for it, it is then the responsibility of
the Operations Division of SLAC to
work with the exeprimenter for the

execution of the experiment.
Now as SLAC nears those final
steps, newspapers hold the AEC's
word of the world's largest atom
smasher for which three possible sites
have already been selected. It is im
portant to note however that this
$315 million accelerator is of the cir
cular type and will help to supplement
the research at SLAC. The circular
accelerator will deal with protons and
neutrons.
Future Unknown
One of the excitements of this new
science is that the future is so un
known. Throughout the short history
of accelerator development, many ac
celerators have often turned out to be
the most dramatically effective in areas
not even known about at the time of
their original conception. Elementary
particle physics stands at the frontier
of man's knowledge. As Professor W.

$315 million accelerator is of the cir
cular type and will help to supplement
the research at SLAC. The circular
accelerator will deal with protons and
neutrons.
Future Unknown
One of the excitements of this new
science is that the future is so un
known. Throughout the short history
of accelerator development, many ac
celerators have often turned out to be
the most dramatically effective in areas
not even known about at the time of
their original conception. Elementary
particle physics stands at the frontier
of man's knowledge. As Professor W.
K. H. Panofsky, Director of SLAC,
has said, "All other physical sciences,
and probably all life sciences, must
ultimately rest on the findings of ele
mentary particle physics. It would
indeed violate all our past experience
in the progress of sicence if nature
had created a family of phenomena
which governs the behavior of ele
mentary particles without at the same
time establishing any links between
these phenomena and the large-scale
world which is built from those very
particles."
In less than a year, some of science's
basic theories concerning atoms, elec
trons, and negative particles may be
revolutionized. These stunning possi
bilities could be the result of research
at SLAC, now completing construc
tion.
Some of the most exciting research
being carried out today is concerned
with investigating the nature of what
might be the limits of our physical
universe. One of the limits of course
is the "outer limit," the regions of
space which appear to bound our
either expanding or pulsating cosmos.
The other limit is in the opposite di
rection, toward the unutterably
small, the baffling dynamism of the
seemingly basic constituents of all
matter, the "elementary particles."
The experiments planned for SLAC
include the production of secondary
particle beams, studies of electron
and photon-induced processes, study
of particle structure, the extension of
quantum electrodynamics, and the
search for new particles.
Electricity
When SLAC begins full scale op
eration next year, the electricity bill
will total $750 thousand. SLAC will
be using as much power as the city
of Palo Alto.
This amount represents only one
twentieth of the yearly operating costs

scheduled for the accelerator. These
expenses and the initial $114 million
construction cost necessitated that the
federal government finance the proj
ect, and that it consequently be a na
tional facility.
National Facility
The national facility according to
the contract with the Atomic Energy
Commission asks certain considera

tions as to the research carried out:
• "Rapid progress in the field is of
high importance, affecting, as it does,
man's understanding of the nature of
matter.
• "There is a major need to accom
modate scientists from other institu
tions, as well as the University, and
to utilize the National Facility to the
fullest extent consistent with the best

interests of the Government and the
highest scientific objectives.
• "Scientific priority generally shall
govern the allocation of machine time
for carrying out accelerator experi
ments.
• "Scientists from other institutions
shall participate in the deliberations
regarding priority, scheduling, and
allocation of machine time for carry
ing out accelerator experiments."
Committees
In accordance with the last stipula
tion of the contract, there have been
two committees set up. The Scientific
Policy Committee is an advisory com
mitee to the President of Stanford on
SLAC's performance as a national fa
cility. The director of SLAC has the
responsibility to schedule the use of
the accelerator, and has a committee
to advise him. The Program Advisory
Committee helps him establish the
program commitments for the use of
the accelerator.
A major concern of the Scientific
Policy Committee is to ascertain that
the Linear Accelerator is "made avail
able to qualified scientists from other
institutions as well as Stanford Uni
versity, subject only to the quality and
productiveness of the research pro
gram."
The committee has "maximum flex
ibility to consider all scientific and
technical matters pertaining to the
accelerator." Members of the commit

tee are nominated by the SLAC direc
tor and approved by the Board of
Trustees and the AEC.
Members At Stanford
Chairman of that committee which
presently consists of ten physicists
is Professor Roger Hildebrand of the
University of Chicago, and includes
two Stanford professors, Drs. Barber
and Schiff.
The Program Advisory Committee
consists of four Stanford professors
and four other doctors and meet reg
ularly every two to four weeks. Stan
ford professors include Professors
Drell, Berman, Ballam, and Richter.
This committee checks safety pre
cautions, equipment SLAC has avail
able, and works out the schedule and
blocks of time for the experiments.
Procedure
Procedure for proposing an experi
ment is relatively simple. After de
ciding upon the experiment, the ex
perimenter may submit in writing a
request for beam time or he may first
discuss the experiment with the SLAC
staff regarding equipment that will be
needed and special characteristics of
the accelerator.
Once the proposal is accepted for
the accelerator and the Program Ad
visory Committee allocates the time
for it, it is then the responsibility of
the Operations Division of SLAC to
work with the exeprimenter for the

execution of the experiment.
Now as SLAC nears those final
steps, newspapers hold the AEC's
word of the world's largest atom
smasher for which three possible sites
have already been selected. It is im
portant to note however that this
$315 million accelerator is of the cir
cular type and will help to supplement
the research at SLAC. The circular
accelerator will deal with protons and
