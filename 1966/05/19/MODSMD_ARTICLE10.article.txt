## 
### 
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam has called a public meet
ing for noon today in White Memorial
Plaza to discuss current University
policy regarding classified cotracts
and the selective service system.
According to Craig Laudon, orga
nizer of the meeting, it "was called
specifically in response to the Aca
demic Council's inability Tuesday eve
nig to come to any decisions on (1)
classified contracts at Stanford, and
(2) the Uiversity's selective servince
policy.
"The SCPV," he explained, "along
with many other groups, felt thatthe
faculty sold the studets out. The fac
ulty as a group as ahbrognted any
decision making power on these cru
cial issues to the administration. Thus
the meeting today to air these ques
tions in front of all the sudents.
"All of us tsudents wonder if the

faculty will be able to come to any
decision on the Selective Service exam
before the end of the war in Vietnam,"
Laudon concluded.
Deans Joel Smith and H. Donald
Winbigler briefed SCPV leaders yes
terday on the Uiversity's relations
with the Selective Service system.
The Committee invited President
Sterling to speak at. the meeting.
Sterling, however, will be unable to
attend because of a Board of Trus
tees meeting, and so far no other Uni
versity officer has agreed to speak
at the meeting.
Speakers will include Dr. Etzione of
the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems; Christian Bay, visiting Pro
fessor of Political Science, Bob Haas,
Cyril Sia, SCPV President, and prob
ably Professor Bruce Wranklin and
eladers of other radical groups on
