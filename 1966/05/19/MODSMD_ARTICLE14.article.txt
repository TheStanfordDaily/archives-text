# Universities Face New Rule
## 
### 
Although the big protest of
Berkeley is over, the time for
educational changes and a re
assessment of the university's
moral and social commitments
is just beginning.
This was the message of sev
eral educators and students
speaking at a three-day convo
cation on "The University in
America," sponsored by the
Center for the Study of Demo
cratic Institutions in Los An
geles last week.
"Students told us that they
wanted more than just a place
to learn; they wanted a place
to live, one with meaning,
where the university related to
them as human beings," said
Berkeley sociology professor
David Selznick.

The motive of student pro
tests is not to dismantle the
university, but to "validate
their worth" and to say "we are
citizens entitled to full rights,
to a voice in affairs governing
us," he added.

"Universities are now found
abusive and intolerable by
young students because they
fill so well the needs of the
modern corporation and govern
ment," said Berkeley student
Saul Landau. He predicted an
increasing number of students
"will find the universities and
the values of the whole society
an outrage to their sensibilities
and will try to subvert it before
it subverts them.

"Living in the midst of power
and affluence, the academic

finds little stimulus and less rea
son to question the general di
rection or character of our so
ciety, and he warns us not to
disturb the fabric of society,"
agreed Martin Kenner, student
at the new school for Social Re
search in New York.

University of California Pres
ident Clark Kerr summed up
the problems between the uni
versity and its students by ex
plaining that faculty members
have increasingly been with
drawing into specialized re
search at a time when "more
students wanted to gain from
their education a personal and
social philosophy as well as or
even instead of a vocational
skill."
