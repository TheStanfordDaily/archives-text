# Student Power, Discontent Demand Attention
## 
### Joseph Katz Nevitt Sanford 
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.
Nevitt Sanford is director and Joseph Katz research coordinator of the
Stanford Institute for the Study of Human Problems. Katz is research
director of the Student Development Study, a five-year study of students
at Stanford and Berkeley. Sanford was editor of the widely acclaimed
1,000-page study, The American College, published in 1962.


JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack

Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which

For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac

to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu

big help to them.

ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious

4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu

shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen

6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential

they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to

For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac

to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu

ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious

4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu

shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of

cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

strations against either educational or

informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious

dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.
Nevitt Sanford is director and Joseph Katz research coordinator of the
Stanford Institute for the Study of Human Problems. Katz is research
director of the Student Development Study, a five-year study of students
at Stanford and Berkeley. Sanford was editor of the widely acclaimed
1,000-page study, The American College, published in 1962.


JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to

outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac

to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious

4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi

shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

Student problems and student discontent have reached such proportions
that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the
authors. They offer nine suggestions illustrative of realignment needed in
responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.

that nothing short of giving the situation major attention will do, say the

responsibilities of administrators, faculty, and students.

JOSEPH KATZ


NEVITT SANFORD
The academic year 1965-66, in con
trast to the preceding year, has wit
nessed far fewer dramatic episodes of
student protest, particularly demon
strations against either educational or
administrative policies.
The situation is far from quiescent,
however. In some institutions stu
dents have kept up a persistent and
informed criticism of established ar
rangements and policies, pressing for
action in various areas of curricular
or social policy. At other institutions,
which offer fewer opportunities for
purposive action, there has been
marked disaffection, sometimes verg
ing on demoralization.
In the last eighteen months one
central fact has emerged, namely,
that students have arrived as a new
power, a fourth estate which is taking
its place beside the traditional estates
of faculty, administration, and trus
tees.
What is more, the situation is irre
versible. Students have become con
scious of their own power. They read
the educational literature; they quote
the reformers and invite them to their
campuses; they take seminars on stu
dent life and university problems;
they know that reforms are possible
and feel that the colleges have been
letting them down.
Above all, they have experienced
success in making their presence felt
and in extracting concessions.
Big Changes
Things will never again be the
same, and the colleges will be wise if
they anticipate big changes. But the
exact boundaries of the new power
situation are yet to be determined.
They will depend on such factors as
the extent to which students them
selves press for power, what support
the more active students are able to
muster in the student bodies at large,
and what countervailing pressures
the other three estates will exert.
One of the traditional obstacles to
student power has been the individual
student's relatively short stay in the
institution. But it is not impossible
that students themselves will develop
self-perpetuating structures that will
institutionalize their new power. Simi
lar structures have always existed,
e.g., student-appointed successions of
college newspaper editors or officers
in student political, literary, or service
organizations; these organizations
have continuity in spite of their rapid
ly changing memberships.
Drawbacks
Defining the relations of students
to the college in terms of power does
have its drawbacks. It feeds a grow
ing tendency in recent years to define
student-college relations in legal, even
legalistic terms. We have seen in
stances recently in which such legalis
tic procedures were used by students
primarily to irritate faculty or admin
istrators.
These adult figures, for their part,
can fall into the trap of considering
these legal issues as the substantive
ones and fail to consider the real is
sues of student discontent, of which
the legalistic attack is only a symp
tom. We have to keep on asking,
What is educational? Students would
not raise the question of their rights
so frequently if the process of their
education were more meaningful to
them and if they felt more respected.
We think that the most fundamen
tal fact underlying the present situa
tion is that student problems and stu
dent discontent have reached such pro
portions that nothing short of giving
the situation major attention and
moving towards major reforms will
do.
We must be prepared to accept dis
content or even more destructive ef
fects as long as the situation is given
only perfunctory attention and the
arrangements of the college are al
lowed to remain as they have been in
the past. That changes seem difficult
or impossible does not matter. We
must begin to make them.
Situation Not Understood
One of the primary facts of the
present situation is that the reality of
the student's situation — what it
means to be a student today—is not
yet sufficiently vivid in the minds of
administrators and faculty, even
those who hold positions of special re
sponsibility for students.
The student's reality presents many
facets: his academic existence, in
which he frequently is an impersonal
entity, herded into many classrooms
where his sense of personal participa
tion in the process of learning is mini
mal; his often enforced stay in dormi
tories which, particularly by the jun
ior year, may have become oppressive,
noisy, omnipresent communities from
which he longs to escape into privacy;
his doubts and uncertainties about his
future occupational role, confounded
frequently by grave reservations
about the life style of his own par
ents; his uncertainties and profound
struggles over his sexual identity;
and, for the men, the omnipresent
shadow of the draft, and a war whose
meaning many students and faculty
deeply question.
As we list these details, we may ap
pear to say nothing very new. Yet
our observation is that people dealing
with students need to have much
more information about them and a
more emphatic grasp of their life in
and out of the classroom.
There is too much talk about stu
dents as "they," too much phantom
like ascription of characteristics to
them. As a result, many adults are
not sufficiently aware of the high de
gree of integrity which college stu
dents possess. Perhaps we have al
ways underestimated students, but

this present generation is particularly
unusual because it has taken more ac
tive steps toward presenting and
realizing some of its own values.
We are dealing in many institutions
with a better informed and intellec
tually more sophisticated group of
students than a decade ago. The stu
dents' own grasp of the complexity of
the university, their knowledge of the
relevant facts of power, faculty con
cerns, curricular arrangements, etc.,
is growing broader; their analytic
powers are being sharpened; and they
are learning to present their case in
more highly reasoned terms, begin
ning even to rely on some research
of their own to give empirical sup
port to their arguments.
It is, moreover, our impression that
during the past year the base of stu
dent reformism has widened in many
institutions. More former middle-of
the road and semi-passive students
are this year talking like activists.
We have heard it said occasionally
that students even today show little
interest in discussions of educational
matters sponsored by administration
or faculty. Perhaps it is true that they
do not show up at these meetings, but
it may not be from a lack of interest
but because they have lost faith that
there will be real consequences in ac
tion instead of just more talk or even
rhetoric.
The students are certainly quick to
see through the rhetoric.
As we said, many students know
the predicaments of faculty members
—their departmental obligations and
publication pressures. They know the
problems of a president vis-a-vis legis
latures or the public when he at
tempts to bring about changes in so
cial or political matters.
But they seem to be less and less
willing to accept two sorts of things.
First, they do not wish to be treated

as if they did not understand the situ
ation adeqautely, as if they had to be
told what to do, rather than be made
working partners. This is not easy,
for true partnership would require,
for instance, a real accommodation by
faculty in their teaching habits.
Second, students do not want to
have the complexity of the situation—
the multiplicity of aims and conflict
ing pressures of parents, future em
ployers, alumni, legislatures, news
papers, and the public—used as an ex
cuse for inaction. The fact of com
plexity in no way alleviates the diffi
culties of their own situation, and
they are getting restless about having
their intellectual, moral, and emotion
al well-being sacrificed to institution
alized complexity and the interests of
other groups, particularly when the
rhetoric says that colleges are for
students.
Realigning Responsibility
What can be done to remedy the
situation? The following suggestions
deal mainly with the realignment of
the responsibilities of administrators,
faculty, and students. As the problems
are many, the following suggestions
can only be illustrative. A precondi
tion of many changes is more infor
mation, and we turn to this first.
L We need considerably more
knowledge of the details of the stu
dents' academic and nonacademic
lives and of their feelings about and
attitudes toward their situation.
One way to learn these things is
by studying students, but the research
will have to be continuous because
the picture is changing rapidly from
year to year.
Knowledge can also be gained by
having those who are in especially
strategic positions devote an Import
ant part of their time to detailed lis
tening to what students have to say.
For instance, in a college which re
quires all of its students to live in
dormitories, the responsible authorties
may not be adequately aware of the
social burden and interference with
studying that this entails, particularly
for upperclassmen.
Such awareness might then lead to
fuller inquiries about the situation
at other institutions where a greater
variety of residential opportunities,
for men or women, has been shown to
have beneficial effects. (In the light
of the current generation's striving
for more independence, the whole
question of residential patterns re
quires a fresh examination.)
In our many contacts with different
institutions during the past years we
have been amazed at how little infor
mation about students is in the posses
sion of many administrators and fac
ulty members. We found many who
had not enough of that knowledge or
sympathy which would seem to be a
precondition for effective action.
Decline of Paternalism
2. The principle of acting in loco
parentis seems to be in considerable

decline, particularly beyond the fresh
ties for them.
We like to point out in passing that
one of the options here suggested, i.e.,
to their university.
man level. The nurturant aspects of
that principle have been on the wane
for some time. Now students are
challenging what has remained: the
control and punishment aspects of
acting in locol parentis.
This decline is perhaps a fruit of the
persistent emphasis on anti-authori
tarianism in child-rearing during the
past decades. The students are not
only willing but are demanding to
assume a much greater share of the
responsibility for their behavior.
It may, of course, be questioned
whether at any time college rules ac
tually provided effective control of
behavior in such matters as drinking,
sexual practices, or intellectual in
volvement. Perhaps administrators
ought to relax and realize that they
simply cannot control much of the
behavior they might like to control.
They could then turn their atten
tion to what they can do; that is to
fulfill an important educational func
tion by providing more facilities for
advice and discussion in these crucial
areas. By the reduction of administra
tive attempts at control students will
be forced to realize more clearly that
their decisions are their own and
affect their lives.
Incidentally, such a move would also
prevent students from having the
sheer pleasure of rebelliousness out
weigh sufficient consideration of their
own responsibility to themselves and
others.)
Overconcern With Deviants
In general, we have found that
many administrators are overly con
cerned with the deviant, perhaps na
turally so, because, though few, they
engage in particularly dramatic ac
tions that attract general attention.
But too many rules are made with he
deviants in mind, and not enough is
". . . thought about their ham string
ing . . ." effects on the broad mass of
nondeviant students. Many deans seem
to have an exaggerated conception of
the amount of deviance that woftld
result once rules were relaxed. *
Our own research, as well as that
of others, has shown that, in the mat
ter of sex, for instance, students ex
ercise a high degree of responsiblity.
What they are asking for is a chance
to learn for themselves, not to be
given a carte blanche for outrageous
behavior. Sometimes deans see de
mands for sexual license in what is
really a search for privacy in which
to work out the difficult problems
of human relations.
One particularly trying "deviant" is
the highly intelligent student whose
criticisms of the college are expertly
designed for irritation even destruc
tiveness. Here, too, administrators
should not be misled into thinking
that such a student is representative
of his fellow students.
On the other hand, neither should
they overlook the many truths he may
present. He can make a contribution
and must be listened to. In a more
benignly functioning community oth
er students would help to control him.
3. There are many situations in
which administrators would gladly
side with the students, were it not for
pressures from the public, legisla
tures, or parents. In view of that pres
sure, their tendency has instead been
to scold the students for their lack
of realism or responsibility. The stu
dents in turn counter with the charge
of hypocrisy.
Can this traditional antagonism not
be converted to an alliance in which
students and administrators work to
gether to change irrational, inapprop
riate, or unenforceable demands of the
outside world?
For instance, it has recently been
recommended to the administration of
a major university that it take an ac
tive role in encouraging the legislature
to lower the minimum legal age for
purchase and consumption of alco
holic beverages from 21 to 18 years.
Administrators may discover that stu
dents if genuinely enlisted, can be a
big help to them.
At another university a few years
ago, a student letter-writing cam
paign to parents was a substantial
factor in making the public conscious
of the need for more financial support

greater variety of on-campus and off
dilemmas of some institutions which
4. Internal problems of the univers
ity might well be thrown out to stu
dents, too. Let them share the facul
ty's perplexities about teaching—the
other demands on their time and their
continuing concerns about getting
through to the students. In a recent
study we found that students respond
with increased involvement to such co
operative efforts. In return professors
might even receive help from their
students in their own research and
publication endeavors.
In sum, we are for including stu
dents, giving them as much responsi
bility as they can handle, accenting
shared interests and concerns and
goals, relying on them for informa
tion, having faith in them. The first
step is listening to them—but a listen
ing that is neither a subtle form of
"telling" nor a manipulative attempt
to let them blow off steam.
Enlarging Opportunity
5. In response both to the demands
for more autonomy and the great di
versity of students we serve, we need
to enlarge the opportunities for the
students' own choices.
We need a wider variety of types of
academic programs within the same
institution, particularly if it is a
large one; more opportunity for
"field" work, for work experiences,
and for relating these to the academic
work; facilitation of planned inter
rupt'on of studies (which will require
changes in the draft administration);
more variety of on-campus and off
campus living; opportunity for study
ing away, from the college in other
parts of the United States or abroad.
The free elective principle does not
have much force today because the
range of its options applies to the
academic area only, and even there
does not allow sufficient variety of
types of programs. We need to widen
options both in the academic and non
academic areas to educate a wide var
iety of different individuals, and this
will require a good "advising" system
to make these options known and
meaningful.
After that we can rely on the stu
dents' own good sense to guide them
into the most appropriate opportuni

dilemmas ofsome institutions which
are in the process of expansion but
still cling to the stereotype that they
ought to provide on-campus residen
tial facilities for all students.
6. One of the problems in student
college relations is the differential
time spans of students and faculty
or administrators. Students need to
see results much sooner, both be
cause they are young and because
they have only a four-year tenure.
Colleges, therefore, should overhaul
their decision-making machinery so
that students can see the effects of
their thoughts, recommendations, and
demands much sooner, whether in the
academic or other areas.
This will not only help them to
participate more effectively but will
also make educational capital from
the experience of seeing bad sugges
tions enacted. We could be less afraid
to enact "bad" things, once we had
adapted ourselves to the students'
time span, because many specific ar
rangements will be only short-lived.

Each new college generation needs
the opportunity to redefine the situ
ation in its own terms, and our de
cisions would become ad hoc in the
best sense of the term.
7. Many institutions still need to
expand considerably such services as
the psychiatric or counseling services,
where the student can talk in com
plete confidentiality and where noth
ing that he says is reported to any
other agency in the college.
Such an arrangement is beneficial
not only to the individuals involved
but also provides the college with a
group of people (there should never
be fewer than two) who have a spec
ial professional competence to repre
sent the students' point of view.
It also would be desirable to have
members of the psychiatric or counsel
ing staff initiate or be available for

discussion within student groups,
rather than only "wait" for students
in their offices.
8. We view as one of the chief goals
of undergraduate education the appli
cation of rationality to the conduct of
life. Mere exercise or development of
cognitive skills is not enough.
Because we have negelected to
foster the extension of rationality, our
lavish educational enterprise has not
been as successful as it might have
been in raising the quality of our
everyday lives as individuals or as
a society.
Some of the students' protests, call
ing for more intellectuality and less
physical enterprise, point to this ne
glect.
The problem is massive and yet
many hardly recognize it. It should
be a central theme in the debate that
has started.
Need For Sensitivity
9. There is need for more college
and university presidents who com
psychological qualifications — espec
ially sensitivity to students. Experi
ence seems to show that particularly
in these days of ferment on the cam
pus, the resident who is primarily a
fund-raiser or public relations man
may be too insensitive to the educa
tional and human needs of the stu
dents and may frustrate the efforts
of deans or faculty who know better.
We lack arrangements that would
allow shortening of presidential ten
ure when desirable without too much
hurt to the individual.
Education - minded presidents are
likely to receive special support soon
from younger alumni. The student
constituencies have changed signifi
cantly during the last ten years in
many colleges which have been get
ting much higher proportions of ei
ther academically or intellectually
motivated students, and this shift
may soon reflect itself in statements
from alumni which sound like those
of the student activists.
At any rate, many presidents may
have to face up to two different
kinds of alumni groups.
Growing Pains
We trust that no one will have
drawn the conclusion from our re
marks that we regard the present
situation as disagreeable. Indeed, we
view the difficulties we have listed
as growing pains, a tribute to the past
educational efforts of the parents and
schools that have produced the cur
rent crop of articulate, sensitive, and
enterprising college students.
The present situation in the col
leges can have all the excitement of
social pioneering and may allow us
to start a new chapter in the history
of education.
