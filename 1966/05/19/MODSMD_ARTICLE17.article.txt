## Senior Class Gift Goes To The Heritage Fund 
### 
The Class of 1966 has an
nounced that as its gift to the
University it will provide schol
arship money to the Heritage
Fund. The past eleven senior
classes have contributed over
$146,000, and the class of '66 has
already collected more than $17,-
000.
The Heritage Fund is a per
petual scholarship fund for
freshmen and sophomores. An
nual donations from local busi

nesmen are sought each year by
members of the Senior Class.
Money from the Heritage
Fund has furnished scholarships
for 110 students, including 14
this year. The scholarships are
based on financial need and
leadership qualities. Each fall
the students who receive schol
arships are asked to personally
thank the donors.
Gary Philips, University ad
viser for the program, corn

mented, "The advantages of ?
plea from President Sterling
combined with personal contact
with students makes the pro
gram more worthwhile than if
alumni alone tried to solicit
funds."
The campaign begins with a
personal letter from President
Sterling to each prospective do
nor, urging the business, to give
a "hearing" to students who will
solicit for the program. A bro
chure describing the program
is mailed shortly after the Presi
dent's letter.
Student teams are assigned to
prospects, and make telephone
appointments in winter
quarter. The actual solicitation
takes place late in winter quar
ter and early in spring quarter.
In January, President Sterling
and Vice-President for Finance
Cuthbertson initiated the drive
with a briefing session. Adviser
Philips added, "We have 'think'
sessions and 'happy hours'
throughout the year, and stu
dents can receive activity cred
its."
The teams, with representa
tives from both sexes, call on 5
prospects during the 2 quar
ters, explaining the program
from the student viewpoint. "It's
the students giving other stu
dents a helping hand," says Phil
ips.
Students have found the con
tact with businesses very re
warding, commented Philips,
and some have even been offered
jobs in the course of their so
liciting.
Donors include businesses that
gave in previous years, and those
who provide essential services
to the University community.
While the program is aimed at
local businesses, from time to
time parents and other individ
uals have contributed.
The Chairman for the Heri
tage Fund drive is selected by
the incoming Senior Class Presi
dent and the outgoing Chairman
in the spring. Interviews for po
sitions on the committee are
held in the fall.
The program was started in
1955 when a group of 22 seniors
personally solicited Palo Alto
businesses for scholarship funds.
The group collected $7,410 from
15 merchants.
Since that time, funds have
been collected annually. The
amounts collected have ranged
as high as $20,000, and have
consistently exceeded $10,000.
