# Rebel Scholar Needed
## 
### 
Dr. Ernst Borinski of Touga
loo College, Mississippi, has an
nounced the availability of the
position of co-director in the So
cial Sciences Division at Touga
loo. Salary is roughly $500 a
month for 10 months, plus
housing.
The only formal requirement
is that the applicant have an
M.A. in a social science. Infor
mal requisites are "that he be a
special combination of activist
and scholar with unlimited en
ergy." The job is described as
"exciting and demanding."
"We have no formal classes to
teach and we can create our own
programsâ€”a real, paid, Free
University," claims Dr. Borin
ski. "Many of our projects in
volve Tougaloo directly with
changes in Mississippi. This
really is implementing the in
terests of the activists on cam
pus. The bulk of the students
come from the narrow, restric
tive, unquestioning state schools
and are therefore unquestioning
and apathetic. The real challenge
is to get through to them. And
we're always looking for new
ways."
This year the Social Sciences
Division has already arranged
for summer jobs for 50-70 stu
dents, has sponsored a voter
card drive in Jackson to build a
file of eligible Negro voters, ad
vised a school desegregation
drive and provided teaching aids
for the local Head Start Center.

It plans to sponsor a Vietnam
teach-in and has conducted an
Inter-Collegiate seminar with
students from nearby white and
Negro colleges.
Tougaloo is also looking for
MA's in Sociology and Psychol
ogy to take full time teaching
positions. Applications may be
made by writing directly to Dr.
Ernst Borinski, Chairman, So
cial Science Division, Tougaloo
College, Tougaloo, Miss.
