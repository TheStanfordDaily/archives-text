# Crew To Travel To Vallejo For Western Sprints
## 
### DAN CABRERA 
This Saturday the Stanford
crew will travel to Vallejo, Cali
fornia to participate in the
Western Inter - Collegiate
Sprints. After having beat Cal
last Sunday, the Varsity must
again meet tough Washington
in addition to eleven other col
leges.
Varsity coach Will Condon
will be taking both the Varsity
and JV oarsmen while frosh
coach A 1 Miller will take only
the first Frosh.
The Varsity shell has lost
only to Washington during the
season, while our JVs are unde
feated. This is the last outing
for the Indian crew before the
IRA to be held in Syracuse on
June 18.
Last year Washington cap
tured first place at the Sprints,
and returns this year with an
undefeated crew.
Washington will therefore
hold the first position in the
morning heats, while Stanford's
Varsity is placed in the second
position.
Hoping to even the score with
Stanford, both Cal and UCLA
will be represented, but the
Huskies are undoubtedly Stan
ford's most formidable oppo
nents.
In the JV races, the Huskies
are again favored. But because
of boat changes during the sea
son, the contest should be a
close one between Cal, Wash
ington, and Stanford.
Each year the winner of the
Sprints takes home the Ky Ev
right cup, named for a former
crew coach from UC Berkeley.
The elimination heats will be
gin Saturday morning at 8:30
a.m. and the final Sprints will
take place in the afternoon.
