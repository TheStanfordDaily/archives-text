## US State Department Officials Take A Viet Deferment Test 
### Art Buchwald 
The recent test given to col
lege students by Selective Ser
vice officials to help decide
whether they would be deferred
or not has boen up for some
criticism. As one college student
put it, "What they're going to
wind up with is a dumb army."
I'm not against giving college
students tests to see if they go
to Viet Nam or not, but I think
it's only fair that we give tests
to people who are responsible
for our Viet Nam policy, inclu
ding all State Department, De
fense, and White House offi
cials.
Sample Questions
Here are some of the ques
tions that could be included in
the tests:
• Name one (just one) South
Vietnamese official whom we
could support to head up a
South Viet Nam government.

what the Buddhists want in
South Viet Nam.
• Explain in a short essay
what the Catholics want in
South Viet Nam.
• Describe in detail how there
can be free elections in South
Viet Nam under the present
government.
• If you can't get the South
Vietnamese military to talk to
the Buddhists and you can't get
the Catholics to talk to Ambas
sador Lodge, how can you get
the North Vietnamese to talk
to the Americans?
• If the South Vietnamese
troops in the south are used to
protect Gen. Ky in Saigon and
the South Vietnamese troops in
the north are used to protect
Gen. Dihn in Da Nang, what
troops will be left to fight the
Viet Cong in the countryside?
