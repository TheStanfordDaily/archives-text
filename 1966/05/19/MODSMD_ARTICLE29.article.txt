# Student Strikes—The Latin Way To University Reform
## 
### KAYE NORTHCOTT 
MEXICO CITY (CPS)—Noth
ing but an occasional snowstorm
or flash flood stops the Ameri
can university student from car
rying out his appointed round of
lectures, quizzes, and finals on
an orderly academic timetable.
And if a student doesn't like the
way his university is run, he can
start a petition, write a letter to
the student paper, or form a
committee and try to get things
changed.
Such an orderly process seems
a bit stodgy to Latin American
students, for they have more
dramatic ways of expressing
their views. They strike.
In the past month a strike of
7,000 students closed the Na
tional University of Mexico and
most of the other educational in
stitutions in Mexico City.
This student revolt has been
treated by the Mexican press as
everything from an ersatz panty
raid to an international commu
nist conspiracy. It has been
treated hardly at all by journal
ists in this country.
History
A history of the strike may
shed some light on its nature.
Two months ago, a law school
dean at the National University
announced that no more make
up tests would be given to sus
pended students. A number of
those affected by the decision
asked to use the school's audi
torium to denounce law school
Dean Cesar Sepulveda. When
they were turned down, they re
acted by handing out leaflets
protesting the denial.
Sepulveda charged that the
leaflets werr undermining his
authority, and he suspended stu
dents for distributing this "sub

versive propaganda." The press
inter pr eted "subversive" to
mean "communist," and so the
red label immediately became
attached to the disgruntled stu
dents.
Approxmiately 2,000 of the
university's 7,000 law students
launched a strike in reaction to
the suspensions.
Faculty Support
Numerous members of the
law school faculty supported the
strike, and soon it was joined
by students in the schools of
economics and political science.
Three weeks ago, a group of
law students approached Dr. Ig
nacio Chaves, the university rec
tor, with a list of demands. Dur
ing the interview in Chaves' of
fice, two students were beaten
by members of the campus se
curity force.
When the students, bruised
and bleeding, withdrew from the
administration building, a group
of students waiting outside be
came enraged. They marched on
the building, breaking windows
and beating down doors. Chaves
was held captive for six hours
until he and some faculty mem
bers tendered their resignations.
Growing 1 Demands
From the first demands for re
examinations grew long lists of
university reforms. And from a
small rebellion, the strike grew
into an academic revolution. A
majority of striking schools and
the faculties of law and philoso
phy and letters have asked for
the complete revision of the
rules of the university. Their
demands include:
• Abolition of the campus se
curity force;
• Cessation of administrative
intervention in student organi
zations;

• Student participation in re
organization of curriculum and
in the selection of rector and
other top administrators;
• University residences for
students (there are none on cam
pus); and
• Free medical services for
students and workers.
The "Junta del Gobierno,"
governing body of the univer
sity, has yet to appoint a suc
cessor to Chaves. Few are
anxious to accept the job.
In the past 35 years, students
have forced two other rectors to
quit. Until 20 years ago, stu
dents themselves elected the
rector, and they still believe
they should have a vote in the
selection of administrators.
Not Communistic
It has been charged by some
Mexican newspapers and by the
attorney general of Mexico
that communists strongly influ
enced the strikers. Many of the
student leaders are Marxists or
Trotskyists, but the strikers em
phasize that their complaints
are academic rather than politi
cal. Strikers are of both the
right and the left.
The "huelga" has disrupted the
schooling of thousands of Mexi
can students and has rocked an
already volatile city. By stand
ards in this country, both the
students and the administration
have gone ridiculously far in a
disagreement that, might have
been settled by reasoning and
conciliation. But most of the
student demands are just, and
neither the students, the facul
ty, the administration, nor the
citizens of Mexico City seem
greatly disturbed by the extrem
ist tactics in this academic revo
lution.

have gone ridiculously far in a
disagreement that, might have
been settled by reasoning and
conciliation. But most of the
student demands are just, and
neither the students, the facul
ty, the administration, nor the
citizens of Mexico City seem
greatly disturbed by the extrem
ist tactics in this academic revo
lution.
MEXICO CITY (CPS)—Noth
ing but an occasional snowstorm
or flash flood stops the Ameri
can university student from car
rying out his appointed round of
lectures, quizzes, and finals on
an orderly academic timetable.
And if a student doesn't like the
way his university is run, he can
start a petition, write a letter to
the student paper, or form a
committee and try to get things
changed.
Such an orderly process seems
a bit stodgy to Latin American
students, for they have more
dramatic ways of expressing
their views. They strike.
In the past month a strike of
7,000 students closed the Na
tional University of Mexico and
most of the other educational in
stitutions in Mexico City.
This student revolt has been
treated by the Mexican press as
everything from an ersatz panty
raid to an international commu
nist conspiracy. It has been
treated hardly at all by journal
ists in this country.
History
A history of the strike may
shed some light on its nature.
Two months ago, a law school
dean at the National University
announced that no more make
up tests would be given to sus
pended students. A number of
those affected by the decision
asked to use the school's audi
torium to denounce law school
Dean Cesar Sepulveda. When
they were turned down, they re
acted by handing out leaflets
protesting the denial.
Sepulveda charged that the
leaflets werr undermining his
authority, and he suspended stu
dents for distributing this "sub

versive propaganda." The press
inter pr eted "subversive" to
mean "communist," and so the
red label immediately became
attached to the disgruntled stu
dents.
Approxmiately 2,000 of the
university's 7,000 law students
launched a strike in reaction to
the suspensions.
Faculty Support
Numerous members of the
law school faculty supported the
strike, and soon it was joined
by students in the schools of
economics and political science.
Three weeks ago, a group of
law students approached Dr. Ig
nacio Chaves, the university rec
tor, with a list of demands. Dur
ing the interview in Chaves' of
fice, two students were beaten
by members of the campus se
curity force.
When the students, bruised
and bleeding, withdrew from the
administration building, a group
of students waiting outside be
came enraged. They marched on
the building, breaking windows
and beating down doors. Chaves
was held captive for six hours
until he and some faculty mem
bers tendered their resignations.
Growing 1 Demands
From the first demands for re
examinations grew long lists of
university reforms. And from a
small rebellion, the strike grew
into an academic revolution. A
majority of striking schools and
the faculties of law and philoso
phy and letters have asked for
the complete revision of the
rules of the university. Their
demands include:
• Abolition of the campus se
curity force;
• Cessation of administrative
intervention in student organi
zations;

• Student participation in re
organization of curriculum and
in the selection of rector and
other top administrators;
• University residences for
students (there are none on cam
pus); and
• Free medical services for
students and workers.
The "Junta del Gobierno,"
governing body of the univer
sity, has yet to appoint a suc
cessor to Chaves. Few are
anxious to accept the job.
In the past 35 years, students
have forced two other rectors to
quit. Until 20 years ago, stu
dents themselves elected the
rector, and they still believe
they should have a vote in the
selection of administrators.
Not Communistic
It has been charged by some
Mexican newspapers and by the
attorney general of Mexico
that communists strongly influ
enced the strikers. Many of the
student leaders are Marxists or
Trotskyists, but the strikers em
phasize that their complaints
are academic rather than politi
cal. Strikers are of both the
right and the left.
The "huelga" has disrupted the
schooling of thousands of Mexi
can students and has rocked an
already volatile city. By stand
ards in this country, both the
students and the administration
have gone ridiculously far in a
disagreement that, might have
been settled by reasoning and
conciliation. But most of the
student demands are just, and

MEXICO CITY (CPS)—Noth
ing but an occasional snowstorm
or flash flood stops the Ameri
can university student from car
rying out his appointed round of
lectures, quizzes, and finals on
an orderly academic timetable.
And if a student doesn't like the
way his university is run, he can
start a petition, write a letter to
the student paper, or form a
committee and try to get things
changed.
Such an orderly process seems
a bit stodgy to Latin American
students, for they have more
dramatic ways of expressing
their views. They strike.
In the past month a strike of
7,000 students closed the Na
tional University of Mexico and
most of the other educational in
stitutions in Mexico City.
This student revolt has been
treated by the Mexican press as
everything from an ersatz panty
raid to an international commu
nist conspiracy. It has been
treated hardly at all by journal
ists in this country.
History
A history of the strike may
shed some light on its nature.
Two months ago, a law school
dean at the National University
announced that no more make
up tests would be given to sus
pended students. A number of
those affected by the decision
asked to use the school's audi
torium to denounce law school
Dean Cesar Sepulveda. When
they were turned down, they re
acted by handing out leaflets
protesting the denial.
Sepulveda charged that the
leaflets werr undermining his
authority, and he suspended stu
dents for distributing this "sub

versive propaganda." The press
inter pr eted "subversive" to
mean "communist," and so the
red label immediately became
attached to the disgruntled stu
dents.
Approxmiately 2,000 of the
university's 7,000 law students
launched a strike in reaction to
the suspensions.
Faculty Support
Numerous members of the
law school faculty supported the
strike, and soon it was joined
by students in the schools of
economics and political science.
Three weeks ago, a group of
law students approached Dr. Ig
nacio Chaves, the university rec
tor, with a list of demands. Dur
ing the interview in Chaves' of
fice, two students were beaten
by members of the campus se
curity force.
When the students, bruised
and bleeding, withdrew from the
administration building, a group
of students waiting outside be
came enraged. They marched on
the building, breaking windows
and beating down doors. Chaves
was held captive for six hours
until he and some faculty mem
bers tendered their resignations.
Growing 1 Demands
From the first demands for re
examinations grew long lists of
university reforms. And from a
small rebellion, the strike grew
into an academic revolution. A
majority of striking schools and
the faculties of law and philoso
phy and letters have asked for
the complete revision of the
rules of the university. Their
demands include:
• Abolition of the campus se
curity force;
• Cessation of administrative
intervention in student organi
zations;

• Student participation in re
organization of curriculum and
in the selection of rector and
other top administrators;
• University residences for
students (there are none on cam
pus); and
• Free medical services for
students and workers.
The "Junta del Gobierno,"
governing body of the univer
sity, has yet to appoint a suc
cessor to Chaves. Few are
anxious to accept the job.
In the past 35 years, students
have forced two other rectors to
quit. Until 20 years ago, stu
dents themselves elected the
rector, and they still believe
they should have a vote in the
selection of administrators.
Not Communistic
It has been charged by some
Mexican newspapers and by the
attorney general of Mexico
that communists strongly influ
enced the strikers. Many of the
student leaders are Marxists or
Trotskyists, but the strikers em
phasize that their complaints
are academic rather than politi
cal. Strikers are of both the
right and the left.
