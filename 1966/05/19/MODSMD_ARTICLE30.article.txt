# rack Star Suggests Reforms
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The controversy over the ath
letic department's authoritarian
role in determining the appear
ance of its athletes brings to
mind other instances of the stul
lifying effect of present athletic
practices upon the student-ath
lete.
To clear the record, my ex
perience in Stanford athletics
over the past four years includes
receival of about $6000 in Buck
Club and BAC money, captain or
co-captainship of one freshman
and two varsity teams, two
freshman and three varsity let
ters, and enjoyment of many
good meals on athletic trips.
Students on athletic scholar
ships or grants-in-aid are profes
sionals. That the bulk of the ath
lete's "salary" goes towards tui
tion does not alter its power to
buy participation and loyalty.
The conditions under which
grant-in-aid is given do not dif
fer from those of any profes
sional team: compete, or the
money stops. The paid athlete
who develops as a student is
faced with an insolvable dilem
ma, for the sport which sup
posedly provides him the means
for an education prevents him
from taking full advantage of it.
The indirect effect of profes
sionalism are severe.
Contributors to the athletic
program expect success and put
pressure on coaches to win. This
pressure is transferred to the
athlete to the extent that it is
heresy to admit enjoyment of a
contest not won. The bidding for
athletes during recruitment
causes coaches to view their ath
letes somewhat as commodities
and tto reinforce their inability to
recognize athletes as individuals
with serious interests and com
mitments apart from athletics.
Activities potentially interfer
ing with "a win" are discouraged
to the point where, for example,
being caught reading a book be
fore a track meet is occasion for
censure. Pressure to win often
exceeds that of academic work,
negating the usefulness of ath
letics as a release from aca
demic tension.
To get the athletes necessary
for athletic prestige academic
entrance requirements are oc
casionally compromised and
those athletes who cannot handle
the work are subject to four
years of frustration and aliena
tion if they survive at all. The
exact effect upon the general
quality of education of those ath
letes who do not care about
studies can be better estimated
by faculty members than by
myself. Professor Guerard has
commented on some of the ways
that athletics interfere with aca
demic life.
To correct these weaknesses
in the role of athletics in the
Stanford community I suggest
the following reforms:
• Elimination of athletic schol
arships and grants-in-aid.
• Elimination of any traces if
preferential admission for ath
letes.
• Elimination of the costly
recruitment program.
• Participation in a league in
which we can compete with the
above standards.
• Revision of the principle be
hind the athletic program from
professionalism and concern for
the prestige of the institution to
that of recreation on a scale
which supplements rather than
undermines the academic aims
of the university.

• From Down Under
Editor, The Daily:
As a foreign athlete on the
freshman track team, I realize
the great opportunity that a
sporting grant-in-aid furnishes.
I also realize the responsibili
ties that must go with such
priveledges and that an athlete's
duty to the organization he rep
resents, goes beyond that of
maximum athletic performance.
In order for any athletic team
to function in the best interests
of each individual on the team,
certain standards must neces
sarily be set.
As Coach of the track team,
Payton Jordan has a rightful
authority that cannot be ignored
by any athlete if the team is to
function properly.
I feel that Coach Jordan's de
mands to team members have
been perfectly reasonable and
necessary for the best team per
formance, and those demands
have left me ample opportunity
to exert my individuality.

• Thanks, Coach
Editor, The Daily:
I thank you, Payton Jordan,
for your recent scientific break
through in finding a quantita
tive measure to Stanford's "edge
of greatness"—i.e., greatness is
inversely proportional to the
length of a student's hair. For
this important discovery, I wish
to nominate you for the Stan
ford "Cog of the Year" Award
presented by the Alumni Asso
ciation to the individual who
keeps Stanford's few, wealthy,
and "well-informed" alumni hap
piest.
As a once upon a time, world
renowned track and field coach,
you have convinced me, as no

one else at Stanford could, that
the University wishes to be
"great" in the eyes of the Little
Ole Ladies of Palo Alto, the
press, and the petty alumni with
bulging pockets. You exemplify
the administrative viewpoint in
crying "to hell with evaluating
a man according to his abilities
and his performance. At Stan
ford, we graduate robots who
have the monied society's "Seal
of Approval."
Please notify the Buck Club
and the Alumni Association
which you so ably serve that
they may keep whatever influ
ence I might otherwise have
bought in future years. Who
knows, if others at Stanford
feel as I do and so inform you,
you might even win the Buck
Club's "McNamara Cost-Effi
ciency Award" of the year. After
all, they will have only a few
wealthy, "well-informed," and
influential alumni from whom
to seek funds.
Payton Jordan, I once thought
you above petty administrative
politics. I am sorry, angry, and
disgusted that I naively chose to
come to Stanford two years ago
for graduate study only to be
come associated indirectly with
you and what you represent.

• A Tricky Lot
Editor, The Daily:
Brother Robert Anderson of
Delta Chi psychologizes that the
older Stanfordites dislike long
hair because Jesus wore it that
way and they were bored stiff at
Sunday School.
This stacks up fine with a lot
of theories gleefully advanced by
psychologists. However, Ander
son says, "No one can deny
Jesus Christ, the major figure in
their childhood church experi
ences had hair down to his
shoulders.
Now, wait a minute, Ander
son. Next thing, you'll be telling
us no one can deny the Devil has
a forked tail and cloven hooves.
Or that Uncle Sam wears stretch
pants, a beaver hat and a goatee.
Artists, Anderson, are respon
sible for the styles of hair-do and
clothes, etc., of Biblical charac
ters and they had no shame. I
have never seen a sketch of J. C.
"from life."
It is just possible that he wore
a butch with handle-bar mous
taches. By the same token, can
anyone deny that God wears a
"... flowing beard? Or that
Gabe ..." blows a Conn tuba?
The point is, Anderson, be
careful when you say, "No one
can deny . . ." when you base
your claim on artists' concepts.
They're a tricky lot.

• His Own Business
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford is an institution ex
tolling individual freedom. Free
dom of dress (including hair
style) is certainly part of the
idea. The department of ath
letics should stand for these
same objectives.
To set up "rules of member
ship" of the sort condemning
Mr. Morrison contradicts the
exercise of the university policy.
The function of a rule is to bene
fit a group or society, not to
indulge in personal tastes.
A "no smoking" rule is a posi
tive action for a team; but a
rule demanding someone cut his
hair is implemented not to im
prove the team, but solely to
make the image of an athlete
more acceptable to some public.
If Stanford athletes are here to
perform just for this public, let
us establish Old Spice pit stops,
so as not to offend the finer
noses in the crowd.
To make an arbitrary rule of
prettiness for an athlete has no
connection whatsoever with the
goals of the University or de
velopment of an athlete. Neither
the athletic department, nor the
Buck Club have any right to
coerce an athlete to change his
appearance by threatening dis
missal from a team.
It is unfortunate that the
B.A.C. has allowed themselves
to become apparant puppets of
the narrow-minded tastes of
some public. Evidently, a cer
tain segment of our society can
not reconcile long hair (not on
the chest) with athletic prow
ess. It was much easier to dis
miss the long haired as beatniks
etc.
Thank you Mr. Morrison for
confusing those poor minds and
clarifying the issue.
Mr. Morison's hair is his own
business, not Mr. Jordan's, not
the track team's, not Stanford's,
and last and least, not the alum
ni's. Under the BAC's criteria,
it doesn't look like that man on
the five dollar bill would be ac
ceptable either. (Yes, that's
right, styles change.)

• Ton Limited
Editor, The Dally:
In the current CIA contro
versy, Mr. Lobdell (The Daily,
May 6) would point out that no
one is forced to work on a clas
sified contract. He would furth
er define academic freedom as
being allowed to work on a proj-

ect, free of harassment from
other members of the academic
community, until he is person
ally satisfied with his findings.
Such a definition of academic
freedom is, I feel, too limited.
In a commonwealth of schol
ars, a single individual is re
sponsible for seeing that the
knowledge he pursues is for the
betterment of some segment of
mankind and that it is accessible
to those who wish it. To demand
isolated working conditions is to
demand that misanthropic ego
tism be pampered.
This selfishness is especially
unjust if it is related to facili
ties paid for by students and
donors as a whole.
A man engaged in research
should not be forced to make
conclusions before he is ready
but he is morally obligated to
reveal those hypotheses whose
results he is reasonable confi
dent will be fruitful to the prog
ress of learning.
There have, up to now, been
a number of other secret re
search projects. This lack of gen
eral communication is, in prin
ciple, as regrettable as that in
volved in the CIA intervention.
There has also, however, pre
viously been a mutual trust be
tween respected experimenters,
students and a government
whose general function is the
service of its citizens.
This trust has not been as se
verely threatened before as it is
now in confrontation with the
CIA. The CIA is obviously sur
reptitious. Its objectives are
either unknown or they involve
espionage and subversive war
fare. If a researcher accepts a
CIA project, he is devoting him
self to highly questionable
goals, and I feel he must either
clear his name openly, or pose
as a conspicuous threat to an
intellectual exchange which, if
it is to preserve its impartiality,
must be free of association with
armed international conflicts.
As the MSU scandal and the
refusal of CIA contracts by MIT
and Harvard have indicated, the
presence of this vaguely defined
but powerful organization on
this campus is one step too far
in the wrong direction.

• Leisurely Reply
Editor, The Daily:
Concerning the leisurely radi
cal articles of Messrs. Anderson,
Cornberg and Company which
have dramatically challenged
Daily readers these last few
weeks, we would like to offer a
few hopefully constructive
hints.
Using Mr. Anderson's article
as a springboard for some gen
erally applicable comments, we
suggest that supergeneralized
platitudes are made no more
palatable when they are spiced
with some radical 'conserva
tism," "radical reorientation,"
and "radical approach." Perhaps
a definition of the monster con
ventionalism would guide the
reader to a radical conclusion
concerning the worth of radical
conservatism . . .
Husserl, who seems to be
your grammatical mentor, won
the right to term his endeavor
"radically novel" because he
took the Transcendental Turn,
because he at least attempted to
construct an all-embracing, all
explaining philosophy. He
reached beyond the academic
dinner table, he grasped for
more than jargon; "radical" ap
plies to his sincerity, not to his
success.
He read and learned before he
spoke: yes, even a bit of that
dangerous rote memorization,
even a bit of mathematics.
Hence, his complicated language
reflects complicated (and inci
dently, always concurrent)
thought.
You see, esoteric scholars, the
commoners are often unable to
intuit your radically bright
suns. Their truth—and, we're
afraid, your truth—needs to be
served in terms of common,
everyday shadows.
Our allusion is clumsy, but it
is to Plato and so our esoteri
cism is, according to your prin
ciples, radical and permissible.
Regarding your rhetorical,
flamboyant, and embarrassingly
naive question, "Is there an edu
cator in the house?" we suggest
that you give up your radical
asking and do some racidal, and,
if possible, sincere searching.
And then again, perhaps you are
looking in the wrong house?
(We personally have found some
educators.)
To knot our thread of spleen,
two small points: Such paren
thetical coyness ("dear Read
er .. . ") has no place in a
"radical reorientation of thought
structure," and the effect of an

education is not merely reflected
in the dexterous employment of
Greek maxims; the Greeks did
some churning before they came
up with their cream.
Before you begin as Faust
does, we suggest you return to
the plain, unradical time when
you were 'just as wise as when
you entered school.'

• Victory Plan
Editor, The Daily:
With Stanford totering on the
edge of greatness, at last has
come its chance to accomplish
its aim. What does it need to
do? It has only to rally behind
the presidential crusade of God
zilla (the famous sea creature of
horror films). Godzilla is attack
ing the present administration
(as who isn't) on the theory
that even the policies of a mon
ster would be more humane than
those currently being followed
by our government in Vietnam.
If elected he plans to eat Mar
shall Ky. His overall plan to end
the war is cunningly simplistic.
He plans to swim to Washing
ton and trample the Pentagon
while breathing napalm out of
each nostril. If such finese does
not win them over he plans to
go to Saigon and personally be
gin negotiations with his old
enemy, the King of the Kong.
The first lady is, of course,
Rasputa Byrd, the real power
behind the nest.
Any questions will be answer
ed outside TMU where a table
shall be setup to distribute but
tons and campaign materials.

• Out Of Touch?
Editor, The Daily:
As one who has eaten dinner
and lunch many times with Dr.
Hutchinson, and one who at
tends a weekly chemistry tutor
ial instituted and taught by Dr.
Hutchinson for Wilbur fresh
men, and who has gone to sev
eral study-breaks given by Dr.
Hutchinson, and one who real
izes that Dr. Hutchinson does
keep office hours for the bene
fit of the freshmen, I can testify
that the Wilbur Hall faculty
master is not nearly so unreach
able as the Wilbur petitioners
have made him out to be.
It is my feeling that those
who wish to talk to their faculty
master could possibly make a
trip to the Wilbur office some
Tuesday afternoon, or could sit
at his table at lunch, or could
even make a tremendous effort
and ask him to dinner on their
own some night.
Or maybe the truth is that
most freshman couldn't really
care less about the faculty mas
ter and they only complain
about his unavailability because
the "in" thing to do seems to be
to attack him. This I think is a
far more probable reason for
the complaints against Dr.
Hutchinson than his being out
of touch with the freshmen.
