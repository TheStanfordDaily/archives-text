# Harvard Considering SU's Sponsor System
## 
### 
The disenchantment of some Stan
ford administrators with the sponsor
program comes at a time when Har
vard University—oftentimes said to
be the model for Stanford emulation
—is considering the adoption of an
upperclass counseling program for
freshmen modeled specifically on the
Stanford sponsor system.
The Harvard Undergraduate Coun
cil made such a proposal recently on
the basis of a poll of freshmen and
the report of the Council president,
who has seen the Stanford sponsor
program in operation. He termed it
a significant improvement over Har
vard's present system of proctors.
The use of upperclassmen for the
counselling and advising of freshman
students was questioned last week by
Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert J. Wert, who stated that Stan
ford is the only university in the
United States entrusting such respon
sibility to upperclassmen.
A comprehensive survey among 20
per cent of all four-year colleges and
universities in the United States,
taken in 1963 by two Hogg Founda
tion researchers, indicated that 63
per cent of the responding institu
tions with student enrollments of
2000 or more used undergraduate stu
dent counselors in the guidance of
freshmen. Of these schools, 88 per
cent placed student counselors in resi
dence halls.
The foundation study showed that
88 per cent of the schools asked the
upperclassmen to serve in "dormitory
life supervision," 85 per cent in "new
student orientation," and 44 per cent
in "personal-social problem counsel

ing." These roles closely parallel
those of the Stanford sponsor.
Ninety per cent of the responding
colleges and universities indicated
that the student counselors made an
effective and positive contribution to
their institution's total guidance pro
gram; 98 per cent of the schools plan
to continue the use of student coun
selors.
The study, made by William F.
Brown and Vernon Zunker, was pub
lished in the January, 1966 issue of
Th<> Journal of College Student Per.
