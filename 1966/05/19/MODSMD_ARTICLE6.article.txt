In less than four years, the Stan
ford-in-Washington program has be
come the nation's largest contributor
of university student summer interns
to the federal government.
Operating on a "shoestring budget,"
the students manage it themselves.
They have some faculty advice and
some help from Stanford alumni, but
the brunt of the project is their own
responsibility. Last summer 87 Stan
ford students were placed in Congres
sional offices and agencies, compared
with 14 when the program started in
1963.

This year there will be at least 90,
according to student chairman Stefan
Halper, a senior majoring in political
science, and a smiliar program will be
established in state government at
Sacramento.
The 1965 project was carried out
with $1300 contributed by four private
donors. Of this $3100 went toward par
tial defraying of living expenses to
the 11 interns needing it most; an
other $650 was used for student or
ganizers' advance trips to Washing
ton to recruit job openings, housing
among Stanford alumni, etc.
Financing is difficult. Halper said
some of the students who have signed
up for jobs which pay little or no
thing, may have to drop out unless
they get firmer assurance of help with
living expenses.
"We have tried hard to keep the
Stanford-in-Washington group from
turning into a wealthy clique who can
all afford to pay their own way," he
said.
"A few interns who have special ex
perience or qualifications to offer will
earn up to $1,000 or more but the ma
jority in Washington won't get more
than $250 or $300."
Congressional coordinator William
R. Meyer, Stanford junior, said no
body was screened out because of lack
of money.
Robert J. Murphy 111. of the Stan
ford Law School, was the 1965 agency
coordinator in Washington, and this
year launched the state government
program. One intern might be placed
in the governor's office and several
with legislators.
Halper said a considerable .lumber
of former interns "now have permanent
jobs in government posts. Many more
of last year's group received offers

at the summer's end, but declined
them in order to complete their de
grees.
Faculty advisers say academic ef
fects of the program already can be
seen in classrooms. Just as undergrad
uates returning from six months on
the Stanford campuses in Europe have
a broader understanding of world his
tory and appreciation of other cul
tures, the Washington interns come
back with a sounder and more sophis
ticated knowledge of national govern
ment.
