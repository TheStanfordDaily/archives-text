# Rush To Undergo Frosh Evaluation
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
The ad hoc committee on rush will
administer a questionnaire tonight to
freshman men. The questionnaire
seeks to evaluate current rush policies
and freshmen reaction to the various
living groups.
Prof. Larry Bennigson, Wilbur fac
ulty resident and chairman of the
committee, explained, "The committee
will learn from freshmen answering
the questionnaires where rush pro
cedures are presently not serving
their purpose."
The ad hoc committee, composed of
representatives from the fraternities,
eating clubs, Stern Hall, and Wilbur
Hall, will also learn what aspects of
their present programs positively or
negatively influence freshmen rush
ees.
Exposure Questioned
The questionnaire asks questions re
lating to "exposure to various living
groups," and whether there was "suf
ficient time to make decisions after

bids were offered." The value of the
pre-rush orientation meeting, and the
status of physical plants in decision
making are also included.
The ad com committee was formed
last year by the four living groups,
with the co-operation of the Dean of
Students Office. The group sought to
standardize rush procedure for this
year, resulting in a unifed rush pol
icy statement and a combined rush
booklet.
The committee this year has con
tinued co-operation among the living
groups under the new policy. The poll
tonight will help the committee decide
how successful those policies have
been.
Committee To Continue?
Whether the ad hoc committee w"l
continue next year, or be replaced y
a standing committee, is "presently
being evaluated" according to Ben
nigson.
Bennigson pointed out, "There has
never been a thorough sample taken
of rushees' reaction to present rush
programs, although the ad hoc com
mittee has talked at length with many
individual students."
Previous Poll
The only previous survey of fresh
men was a poll taken in April 1964.
A freshmen organization, called CON
CARN reported 2150 out of 300 queried
reported some dissatisfaction with
rush. Discussion that spring and the
next fall led to the formation of the
ad hoc committee last winter.
Present faculty members of the
committee are Prof. Bennigson, chair
man, Prof. Harry Rathbun, faculty
resident of fraternity cluster I, Prof.
John Mothershead, and Robert Free
len, Stern faculty resident. Students
on the committee are Ted Anstedt,
Eric Vittinghoff, William Kelso, and
Tom Petersmeyer.
