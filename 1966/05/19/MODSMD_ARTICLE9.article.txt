# Micronesia To Receive Peace Corps Volunteers
## 
### 
Dr. Ross Pritchard, Director of Far
East Programs for the Peace Corps,
will deliver a brief policy statement
on the recently revealed Peace Corps
project for the Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands (Micronesia), at 7:45
tonight in TMU Room 270.

In 1947 the United Nations gave the
U.S. the responsibility of preparing
Micronesia for self-government, by
helping to rebuild the area's social,
economic and political infrastructure,
which had been almost completely
destroyed during World War 11.
This has been America's first at
tempt at administering a mandate,
and according to informed sources,
that attempt has been woefully in
adequate. When the question of Mi
cronesia's status comes before the
U.N. for review, which will occur
within the next 12 months, it is un
likely that developing nations will ac
cept the excuse that this rich nation
"always seemed to have more urgent
problems at hand in Korea and Viet
nam, in Birmingham and Watts."
To remedy the situation, 750 Peace
Corps Volunteers will be sent to Mi
cronesia within seven months to work
in education, community development,
public health and public works proj
ects.
In lieu of the all-out recruiting
"blitzes" that have so far hit 68 ma
jor colleges and universities, the Stan
ford Peace Corps Committee has con
vinced Peace Corps/Washington to en
gage in an open forum, to answer
some of the serious policy questions
that the new project raises.
After Pritchard delivers his policy
statement he will discuss various
aspects of the program with Frank
Mahoney, a cultural anthropologist
who spent several years in Micronesia.
