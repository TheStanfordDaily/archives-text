### 

CURT KECK, Dally Entertain
ment Editor and Judge at Spring
Sing, was totally snafu-ed in try
ing to pick the winners; but was
elated when he heard that he
had not won the Originality Ist
prize because, as he said, "I've
been wearing this brown helmet
for so long that I'm afraid my
whole head would come off if I
had to doff it to the cheering
masses."
