# 'Tangent's' Improvisations Make Theatre Illegitimate'
## 
### ANDREW WILSON 
For those who lost it at the
movies and are searching for a
different sort of light entertain
ment, the Tangent on University
Avenue in Palo Alto is a good
bet for a lively evening. Like
much of today's camp, the Tan
gent harks back for its inspira
tion to an old convention long
since considered somewhat of a
joke.
The Tangent attempts to up
date and upbeat the hallowed
leisure institution which tele
vision has killed—parlor games.
While the emphasis is given to
the progressive aspects of spon
taneous and experimental thea
tre, what else are the on-the-spot
improvisations by Tangent ac
tors in sung, barroom sur
roundings but a commercialized
version of the outdated parlor
games?
The audience is encouraged to
participate and, indeed, much of
the Tangent's success depends
upon the audience's willingness
to offer suggestions, criticize,
and, in general, become actively
involved with the performances.
The highest virtue to which a
Tangent act may aspire is riot
ousness.
Almost all the actors in the
Tangent are teachers and/or
Stanford graduate students.
While several of the actors are
genuinely funny and talented,

none are full-time professionals
which may well be advantage
ous in keeping the production
from becoming too slick.
The Committee, which does
the same sort of thing as the
Tangent with actors who are
professional, cuts the ground
from under itself by making its
improvisations seem too good
and too virtuoso. Part of Tan
gent's charm is that their show
is frankly amaturish; we under
lings in the audience are part of
the scheme, not objects for it.
Folk Singing
Folk singing is also included
in the Tangent's activities. I am
embarrassed to admit that I lost
his name, but the folk singer
currently playing is first-rate.
Not the least of his attributes is
his sardonic wit and stage man
ner. Typical in this regard was
his remark introducing a diffi
cult guitar instrumental: "Now
if you watch very closely, you'll
notice that at no time do my
fingers ever leave my hand."
The "Illegitimate Theatre," as
the Tangent calls itself some
what bogusly (suggesting diver
gent promiscuity), provides a
full evening of varied entertain
ment at a low cost. As added in
centives, beer and pizza are serv
ed throughout the performances.
I receommend it to all you
anonymous fun-lovers out there
in the mass-media.

the same sort of thing as the
Tangent with actors who are
professional, cuts the ground
from under itself by making its
improvisations seem too good
and too virtuoso. Part of Tan
gent's charm is that their show
is frankly amaturish; we under
lings in the audience are part of
the scheme, not objects for it.
Folk Singing
Folk singing is also included
in the Tangent's activities. I am
embarrassed to admit that I lost
his name, but the folk singer
currently playing is first-rate.
Not the least of his attributes is
his sardonic wit and stage man
ner. Typical in this regard was
his remark introducing a diffi
cult guitar instrumental: "Now
if you watch very closely, you'll
notice that at no time do my
fingers ever leave my hand."
The "Illegitimate Theatre," as
the Tangent calls itself some
what bogusly (suggesting diver
gent promiscuity), provides a
full evening of varied entertain
ment at a low cost. As added in
centives, beer and pizza are serv
ed throughout the performances.
I receommend it to all you
anonymous fun-lovers out there
in the mass-media.
For those who lost it at the
movies and are searching for a
different sort of light entertain
ment, the Tangent on University
Avenue in Palo Alto is a good
bet for a lively evening. Like
much of today's camp, the Tan
gent harks back for its inspira
tion to an old convention long
since considered somewhat of a
joke.
The Tangent attempts to up
date and upbeat the hallowed
leisure institution which tele
vision has killed—parlor games.
While the emphasis is given to
the progressive aspects of spon
taneous and experimental thea
tre, what else are the on-the-spot
improvisations by Tangent ac
tors in sung, barroom sur
roundings but a commercialized
version of the outdated parlor
games?
The audience is encouraged to
participate and, indeed, much of
the Tangent's success depends
upon the audience's willingness
to offer suggestions, criticize,
and, in general, become actively
involved with the performances.
The highest virtue to which a
Tangent act may aspire is riot
ousness.
Almost all the actors in the
Tangent are teachers and/or
Stanford graduate students.
While several of the actors are
genuinely funny and talented,

none are full-time professionals
which may well be advantage
ous in keeping the production
from becoming too slick.
The Committee, which does
the same sort of thing as the
Tangent with actors who are
professional, cuts the ground
from under itself by making its
improvisations seem too good
and too virtuoso. Part of Tan
