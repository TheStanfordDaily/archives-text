## 'Good woman' Superior 
### WALTER SOKEL 
Poverty as a major factor in
modern life either has been or
can be banished by mass pro
duction and the application of
Keynesian economics. The gods
to whom the good people of
Setzuan appeal and on whom
Brecht showers his merciless
irony seem rather irrelevant
since no less an authority than
the Bishop of Woolwich ques
tioned the relevance of the One
who lurks behind Brecht's three.
Striking out at religious faith
and poverty, did Brecht do no
more than beat dead horses?
"The Good Woman of Setzuan"
was written in exile, in one of
the darkest years of modern his
tory — 1939 — when total i
tarianism, right or left, and
world war seemed to be, in
Europe at least, the only ans
wers to chronic misery and
world edpression. Ironically, but

inevitably, Brecht was ignored
when his work seemed to be ap
plicable at its most obvious
level. It is the affluent society
that can afford to patronize him
nearly thirty years after.
Theatrical Fable
However, there is more to
Brecht's theatrical fable of the
impossibility of being good to
others and to oneself simultan
eously. Otherwise the emotional
impact encountered in the Stan
ford Repertory Theater's cur
rent production of Brecht's
"Good Woman" would be inex
plicable.
Brecht's play ostensibly deals
with the evil caused by poverty
and social inequality. Actually
it centers around the tragic co
existence of the need to expand
the self in love and the necessity
to contract it in self-preserva
tion. The second theme supoprts
the first: Goodness without the
means of making it effective re
mains as vacuous as the gods
of Setzuan, who have come to
earth in search of a good person
and leave it on a rosy cloud, im
pervious to human questions
and complexities. Yet the means
which are to make goodness ef
fective must defeat the end they
are to serve. In a world in which
a lot of selfish callousness and
gratuitous meanness exists side
by side with some good will,
good people are forced to choose
between self-destruction and
self-betrayal.
Shows Split
Brecht shows the split within
human existence literally. Shen
Te, former prostitute and mo
ther-to-be, can find the means
that enable her to be the charit
able "angel of the slums," love
her man, and provide for her
child, only by negating herself,
by making herself disappear, as
she puts on the mask of her fic
titious cousin, Shui Ta, a shrewd
and ruthless business man.
Brecht's cynical realism is
shot through with a deep-seated
romanticism concerning human
nature. Because of this unusual
compound he possess the moral
indignation that gives his ma
ture plays their poetic and dra
matic substance. Brecht's plays
possess a powerful and dramatic
substance. Brecht's plays pos
sess a powerful pathos which
Brecht's theory seeks to deny.
It is the great merit of the
Stanford production that it does
not permit the theorist of the
alienation effect to get in the
way of the dramatist and poet.
Mr. Shapiro's direction fully
allows Brecht's next and struct
ure, in Eric Bently's effective
English version, to appeal to us
directly, unencumbered by ques
tionable poetics. All aspects of
the playwright are given their
due —the irony and cynicism;
the tongue-in-check fairy-tale
tone; the grim humor alternat

ing with flights of poetry; the
Hogarthian raggedness and ras
cality familiar from"The Three
Penny Opera." Above all, the
Stanford production does not
shy away from emphasizing the
dramatic emotion contained in
the climatic scenes of the play.
It must be commended for that.
The music, although effective
in its own right and in keeping
with the spirit of Brecht's play,
unfortunately tends to drown
out the words of the songs.
Brecht's lines must be heard and
understood. His songs are not
opera libretti. The supremacy
of the music at the cost of the
text is the one truly unaccept
able infraction of the Brechtian
canon in this production.
Stylizafcion
The production ranges from
extreme stylization, particularly
pronounced in Sam Schacht's
playing of Shu Fu, to a relative
naturalness. Brecht purists
might find fault with this com
posite point of view. The result,
however, is a dramatic momen
tum that involves the audience
emotionally, increasingly so as
the play progresses. Despite
Brechat's theory, this involve
ment is inevitable in the great
plays of his last creative period,
and, from the point of view of
the lover of good drama, emin
ently desirable.
Jeanne Paynter as Shen Te
brings out very able the sturdy
good nature and the ethereal
lyricism which combine in the
former prostitute who is a lover
of the world. Miss Paynter's
gradual development in the role
of Shui Ta is interesting. Un
certain and timid in her first
impersonation, she grows into
the part slowly until, in the To
bacco Factory Scene, she has
indentified completely with Shen
Te's other —hated—self. This
slow development effectively un
derscores the great inner diffi
culties Shen Te has to overcome
as she learns to assume the ruth
less aspect of her split self,
which the duty of self-preserva
tion imposes upon her.
Hiken
Gerald Hiken as the water
seller, Wong, shows a similar
development from humble, good
natured submissiveness to stern
rebelliousness. The imperturb
able blandness and doddering,
amiably fussy decrepitness of
the three gods are deligntfully
conveyed by Messrs. Gould,
Sharp, and Fisher. The whole
cast plays with gusto, verve, and
a fine register of moods.
The production succeeds very
well in demonstrating the hu
mane intelligence, the moral pas
sion, the wit and humor, and
above all, the sheer joy of creat
ing theater that characterize
Brecht's drama at its best. This
production of one of his greatest
plays is a theatrical experience
that should not be missed.
