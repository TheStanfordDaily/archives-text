# 'New York Six' Art Show Is Good
## 
### MICHAEL J. COLLINS 
The show "Six From New
York" is really worth going to
not because it contains particur
ly outstanding examples of the
work of those represented, but
because the artists in the show
have had a large effect on the
contemporary art scene, and
come from- a rather diverse
background and tradition.
For instance, Roy Lichtenstein
is there, famous for his role in
the Pop Art craze that swept the
country, his Terry and the Pi
rates and romance comic book
characters. Lichtenstein has
three more in this same tradi
tion exhibited. All are done in
the same pointilistie, newspaper
print style, which occasionaly
shows imperfection to remind
us that these were really done
by man. The most noteworthy
piece in the group was painted
not long after Lichtenstein had
been rejected from a show at the
Museum of Modern Art. He
couldn't resist taking a biting
indirect cut at the "museum,"
which leads one to believe that
he has a lot of fun with his
paintings, (to what end is up to
suppossition) but enough has
been written about Pop Art that
I need say no more here.
Also there is Frank Stella who
was one of the American entries
in the Sao Paulo Biennial. Al
though represented by a rather
weak piece when compared to
those works in the Biennial and
the new, exciting things in his
recently opened show in New
York which has some extremely
interesting departures, his style
that carried from 1960 to pres
ent is unique enough to make
it worthwhile to say a few words
about.
The finst thing that strikes the
viewer is how "Gold West," as
Stella's other works, is a com
plete departure from anything
else being done on the American
art scene in its approach to non
objective imagery. He seems to
develop his own logical system
based on a modular approach to
the painting.
The first set of modules in the
rather large canvas is the basic
line, or bars, of color approxi
mately 2V* inches wide which

are placed parallel to each other
running across the canvas, thin
strips of bare canvas showing
between them.
These bars of color conform
to the boundaries of the canvas
which are constructed of the sec
ond module, triangles placed to
gether in a very interesting fash
ion making effective use of the
shape-canvas idiom. The paint
ing is virtually closed both top
and bottom, both because the
bars form a definite boundary
and because of the way the mod
ules are fit together. But it is
quite open on the ends, and the
viewer feels it could continue in
this regular pattern ad infini
tum.
The most interesting paradox
of the painting revolves around
the gold stripes, which are al
most metallic in color and seem
to be paint from some industrial
source. This, coupled with the
rigidity of the logically develop
ed modular structure, would im
mediately strike one as being
rather sterile and machine made.
But Stella has laid the stripes
on by hand, which, while still ac
curate, does not produce a hard
edge work. This simple ambig
uity of definition of line removes
Stella from the realm of the ab
solutist or the purist while still
maintaining his own unique
identity.
A relative new comer to the
west coast is Raymond Parker,
whose work I found to be some
of the most refreshing in the
show. His focal point has a
Rothcoesque shaped rectangle,
but here any and all other sim
ilarities end. These paintings are
masses of pure color on a plain
white canvas and the interplay
between the two results in a sim
ple, light, but refreshing dialetic.
Claes Oldenburg, who was
there with his larger than life
ironing board, and other such
out of scale parphernalia that
has plagued many a casual ob
server for years. This is not to
belittle his work, for he has cer
tainly done many interesting
things, and his influence is be
fog felt in Los Angeles right
now as people crane their necks
on guided tours to see what

those people are doing in the
back of Keinholz's 1938 Dodge.
Poon's New Direction
Another relative newcomer is
Larry Poons, who also repre
sented the U.S.A.- in the Sao
Paulo Biennial. Though the
/works at the show are not
among his best, Poon's new di
rections deserve a little more
attention.
tention.
"Away Out on the Mountain,"
as other paintings by Poons, is
covered by dots, which upon
closer examination can be seen
to be small, precise, eliptical
shapes. They are many differ
ent shades and hues, but the
background is uniform through
out. The color is totally man
made and unnaturalistic, prob
ably intended to look as con

trived, almost "otherworldly," as
possible.
On first glance the eliptical
shapes seem to be placed in a
completely random order, but as
one continues to look at the
work a clear and orderly grid
becomes apparent. At this point
the whole nature of the painting
changes and the invisible lines
become the focus and their
points of intersection the focal
point.
This sets up a rhythmic and
cyclical movement which con
trols the pulsating tension of the
many-colored eliptical shaeps.
But this complex interplay does
not end at the boundaries of the
painting; it is extremely open,
moving out from the canvas in
a way that tends to create its
own dimension.
