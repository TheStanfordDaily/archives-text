THEATER
The Stanford Repertory Theatre closes its season this weekend
with final performances of THE GOODWOMAN OF SETZUAN.
In an eminently successful production, this best-of-Brecht should
not be missed. BILL COSBY will be at the Circle Star next weekend;
if you want to see him better get your tickets right away. Kenneth
Brown's non-play of Marine Corps brutality and slave-driving, THE
BRIG, will continue tonight and tomorrow night at The Playhouse
in S.F. Opening tonight at the Interplayer's Theatre ("a charming
theatre, between the cable cars and Ghirardelli Square") will be
Shakespeare's rather curious comedy, TWELFTH NIGHT.
FILMS
THE CONNECTION, the story of dope addiction told with shock
shock-shocking dialogue, is tonight's movie at Tresidder.
Saturday night's Tresidder flick is the sensational NO EXIT. An
Argentine and American adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre's play, the
storyline itself (for those of you who have read the play) should
be provocative enough to make you want to see the film: a lesbian,
a nymphomaniac, and a cowardly man all lonely, all driven by their
guilts, and all closeted in an exitless room in Hell.
Sunday night at the Flicks will be THE WORLD OF SUZIE
WONG, the exotic and sympathetic story of a Chinese prostitute
who falls in love with an American painter. Starring France Nuyen,
as Suzie, this movie should be at the top of your don't-miss list.
The only movie for miles around that's worth seeing is A THOU
SAND CLOWNS, playing in a double bill with NEVER ON SUN
DAY at the Bijou. It is my contention that "Clowns" is a whalea
gator of success from every angle and for every angler.
OTHER
THE MILES DAVIS QUINTET will be featured this Sunday in
the last of Stanford Jazz Year's sound spectaculars.
The STANFORD CONCERT BAND will play in Dink Sunday
afternoon at 3:30, conducted by Arthur Barnes.
