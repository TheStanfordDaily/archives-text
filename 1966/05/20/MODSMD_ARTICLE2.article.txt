# Rally, Night-Long Sit-in Protest Draft Test
## The 						Office Smelted Of Orange Peels...

The scene last night in the lobby of
Building 10 had the serio-comic
strains of an absurdist play.
Some forty students marched into
President Sterling's suite of offices
shortly after one yesterday and an
nounced, "We are going to stay here
until we have some reassurance that
our demands are going to be lis
tened to."
While group leaders made their de
mands for a meeting with President
Sterling known to Dean Robert Wert
in the vacant Provost's office, the
bulk of the protestors gathered in the
stylishly furnished lobby to begin
their vigil.
As the student-Administration be
came clear, the demonstrators found
ways to pass the hours. Graduate
student Caesar Ames was working
over the first draft of a paper for
English 308, Studies in Satire. Many
had brought their books, but others
preferred to talk among themselves or
sing folksongs.
The warm afternoon made the
suite uncomfortable for everyone.
Some students had sent out for soft

drinks, and the lobby smelled of
freshly peeled oranges.
The normal office routine contin
ued, but some clearly resented the in
vasion. Miss Lillian, Sterling's secre
tary, who has been at Stanford since
the 1920'5, said to one protester, "This
is darned tom foolery. You ought to
be ashamed of yourselves."
Two demonstrators had found the
occasion important enough to bring
their pets along. Mark Sapir assured
a reporter his Chinese Teahound
Youssel was house-broken. "He barks
every time he sees an administrator,"
he proudly announced. The owner of
a bxown and white basset hound cau
tiously admitted his pet was a CIA
agent.
With the end of the normal busi
ness day students relaxed in their
new environment. By 8:30 the lobby
looked like the setting of an informal
party rather than a protest against
University involvement in the Se
lective Service test. Placards de
claring "I am just unexpendable" and
"Uncle Sam needs cannon fodder"
had been propped against the door as
student listened to rock-and-roll tunes
and Joan Baez folk songs.
