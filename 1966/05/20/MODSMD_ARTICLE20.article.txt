# M.I.T. Prof Claims Sex Talk Is Uninformed And Emotional
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO 
Much of the talk about sex
today is "ill-informed, ill-docu
mented, and emotional," Profes
sor John T. Rule of M.I.T. told
a small audience at Dinkelspiel
Wednesday night, in the last
lecture in the student behavior
series.
Although sex is more openly
discussed than ever before, it is
"a subject you have to be care
ful with," he said. Much of the
sensationalism connected with
sex is the result "of a need for
revolt against a hypocritical so
ciety that gives lip service to
an unobeyed code." Young peo
ple today find "too many 'Thou
shalt nots' and not enough af
firmatives. They seem to be
seeking some rationale—a posi
tive, unhypocritical standard."

Professor Rule proceeded to
trace the history of sexual be
havior and attitudes. "There
have never been any historical
absolutes about sexual behavior,
although each society thought
theirs were. That style of living
became so deeply engrained into
the individual that it reinforced
the idea that the code was natu
ral to man."
The former dean said that be
cause there is no universality
about sex, it has different
meanings and, therefore, differ
ent solutions for every indivi
dual. "I believe you cannot codi
fy morality other than saying
that any harm you do to any
other human being is immoral.
That is the only value judgment
I will make.'
Rationalization
Professor Rule felt that ra
tionalization is the most com
mon thought process. "The
mind, by and large, is an instru
ment of emotion. Reason is used
to justify beliefs and desires
dictated by the subconscious.
Sex is the strongest of all emo
tional drives and has the great
est capacity to make you use
your mind."
Under the compulsion to sat
isfy needs, he said, "you have
the capacity to deceive your
self. There are complex emo
tional components accompany
ing sex that individuals are un
aware of."
In addition, Professor Rule
pointed out some deeper com
pulsions that sex may tempo
rarily satisfy, but that are es
sentially self - seeking because
they do not involve the partner.
These include ego - centric de
sires for power, dominition, and
to conquer. "The need to con
quer seeks minor tokens of
power, and once the conquest is
achieved it is finished. The need
for power is constant. The need
to dominate is similar, except it
makes the partner a slave and
is a satisfaction of vanity."
Comfort, Permanence, Escape
Sex may also be an expres
sion of hostility or hate, he said.

"It seems to be a source of com
fort and reassurance, and so it
may also be pursued because of
insecurity. It appears to offer
permanence, and can be a source
of forgetfulness or momentary
escape."
The methods universities have
of handling sex vary greatly ac
cording to Professor Rule. In a
recent survey of 37 colleges he
conducted, he found many in
consistent policies. "In seven col
leges in the East girls are per
mitted in boys' rooms, but the
boys are barred from girls'
dorms. In some colleges girls
are required to sign out so that
they can be notified in emer
gencies, but no such measures
are taken for the boys.
Puritan Silence
"Failure to specifically state
sex opinions is subscription to
Puritan silence. Constant dia
logue is essential; even if it's
restrictive in nature, it should
be explained." When asked if he
felt contraceptives should be
made available to students at
college health services, he re
plied, "Let me say that contra
ceptives should be available to
any individual who wants them,
but why from the college?
Should they give you liquor just
because students have expressed
a desire in that area? The first
function of a university should
be to develop minds; anything
impeding this is secondary.
Rules must be rather pragmatic
in order to perform this major
function."
In his concluding remarks,
Professor Rule stated, "I am not
for or against pre-marital sex.
There are certain circumstances
where it is extremely rewarding.
But it is an area of the greatest
difficulties resulting from per
fectly rational and the best of
intentions. I know many college
students who treat sex natural
ly and with good humor, but in
some cases you may think that
genuine interest, spiritual com
munion, and permanence exist,
and they don't."

lecture in the student behavior
series.
Although sex is more openly
discussed than ever before, it is
"a subject you have to be care
ful with," he said. Much of the
sensationalism connected with
sex is the result "of a need for
revolt against a hypocritical so
ciety that gives lip service to
an unobeyed code." Young peo
ple today find "too many 'Thou
shalt nots' and not enough af
firmatives. They seem to be
seeking some rationale—a posi
tive, unhypocritical standard."

Professor Rule proceeded to
trace the history of sexual be
havior and attitudes. "There
have never been any historical
absolutes about sexual behavior,
although each society thought
theirs were. That style of living
became so deeply engrained into
the individual that it reinforced
the idea that the code was natu
ral to man."
The former dean said that be
cause there is no universality
about sex, it has different
meanings and, therefore, differ
ent solutions for every indivi
dual. "I believe you cannot codi
fy morality other than saying
that any harm you do to any
other human being is immoral.
That is the only value judgment
I will make.'
Rationalization
Professor Rule felt that ra
tionalization is the most com
mon thought process. "The
mind, by and large, is an instru
ment of emotion. Reason is used
to justify beliefs and desires
dictated by the subconscious.
Sex is the strongest of all emo
tional drives and has the great
est capacity to make you use
your mind."
Under the compulsion to sat
isfy needs, he said, "you have
the capacity to deceive your
self. There are complex emo
tional components accompany
ing sex that individuals are un
aware of."
In addition, Professor Rule
pointed out some deeper com
pulsions that sex may tempo
rarily satisfy, but that are es
sentially self - seeking because
they do not involve the partner.
These include ego - centric de
sires for power, dominition, and
to conquer. "The need to con
quer seeks minor tokens of
power, and once the conquest is
achieved it is finished. The need
for power is constant. The need
to dominate is similar, except it
makes the partner a slave and
is a satisfaction of vanity."
Comfort, Permanence, Escape
Sex may also be an expres
sion of hostility or hate, he said.

"It seems to be a source of com
fort and reassurance, and so it
may also be pursued because of
insecurity. It appears to offer
permanence, and can be a source
of forgetfulness or momentary
escape."
The methods universities have
of handling sex vary greatly ac
cording to Professor Rule. In a
recent survey of 37 colleges he
conducted, he found many in
consistent policies. "In seven col
leges in the East girls are per
mitted in boys' rooms, but the
boys are barred from girls'
dorms. In some colleges girls
are required to sign out so that
they can be notified in emer
gencies, but no such measures
are taken for the boys.
Puritan Silence
"Failure to specifically state
sex opinions is subscription to
Puritan silence. Constant dia
logue is essential; even if it's
restrictive in nature, it should
be explained." When asked if he
felt contraceptives should be
made available to students at
college health services, he re
plied, "Let me say that contra
ceptives should be available to
any individual who wants them,
but why from the college?
Should they give you liquor just
because students have expressed
a desire in that area? The first
function of a university should
be to develop minds; anything
impeding this is secondary.
Rules must be rather pragmatic
in order to perform this major
function."
In his concluding remarks,
Professor Rule stated, "I am not
for or against pre-marital sex.
There are certain circumstances
where it is extremely rewarding.
But it is an area of the greatest
difficulties resulting from per
fectly rational and the best of
intentions. I know many college
students who treat sex natural
ly and with good humor, but in
some cases you may think that
genuine interest, spiritual com
munion, and permanence exist,
and they don't."
Much of the talk about sex
today is "ill-informed, ill-docu
mented, and emotional," Profes
sor John T. Rule of M.I.T. told
a small audience at Dinkelspiel

an unobeyed code." Young peo
ple today find "too many 'Thou
shalt nots' and not enough af
firmatives. They seem to be
seeking some rationale—a posi
tive, unhypocritical standard."

Professor Rule proceeded to
trace the history of sexual be
havior and attitudes. "There
have never been any historical
absolutes about sexual behavior,
although each society thought
theirs were. That style of living
became so deeply engrained into
the individual that it reinforced
the idea that the code was natu
ral to man."
The former dean said that be
cause there is no universality
about sex, it has different
meanings and, therefore, differ
ent solutions for every indivi
dual. "I believe you cannot codi
fy morality other than saying
that any harm you do to any
other human being is immoral.
That is the only value judgment
I will make.'
Rationalization
Professor Rule felt that ra
tionalization is the most com
mon thought process. "The
mind, by and large, is an instru
ment of emotion. Reason is used
to justify beliefs and desires
dictated by the subconscious.
Sex is the strongest of all emo
tional drives and has the great
est capacity to make you use
your mind."
Under the compulsion to sat
isfy needs, he said, "you have
the capacity to deceive your
self. There are complex emo
tional components accompany
ing sex that individuals are un
aware of."
In addition, Professor Rule
pointed out some deeper com
pulsions that sex may tempo
rarily satisfy, but that are es
sentially self - seeking because
they do not involve the partner.
These include ego - centric de
sires for power, dominition, and
to conquer. "The need to con
quer seeks minor tokens of
power, and once the conquest is
achieved it is finished. The need
for power is constant. The need
to dominate is similar, except it
makes the partner a slave and
is a satisfaction of vanity."
Comfort, Permanence, Escape
Sex may also be an expres
sion of hostility or hate, he said.

"It seems to be a source of com
fort and reassurance, and so it
may also be pursued because of
insecurity. It appears to offer
permanence, and can be a source
of forgetfulness or momentary
escape."
The methods universities have
of handling sex vary greatly ac
cording to Professor Rule. In a
recent survey of 37 colleges he
conducted, he found many in
consistent policies. "In seven col
leges in the East girls are per
mitted in boys' rooms, but the
boys are barred from girls'
dorms. In some colleges girls
are required to sign out so that
they can be notified in emer
gencies, but no such measures
are taken for the boys.
Puritan Silence
"Failure to specifically state
sex opinions is subscription to
Puritan silence. Constant dia
logue is essential; even if it's
restrictive in nature, it should
be explained." When asked if he
felt contraceptives should be
made available to students at
college health services, he re
plied, "Let me say that contra
ceptives should be available to
any individual who wants them,
but why from the college?
Should they give you liquor just
because students have expressed
a desire in that area? The first
function of a university should
be to develop minds; anything
impeding this is secondary.
Rules must be rather pragmatic
in order to perform this major
function."
In his concluding remarks,
Professor Rule stated, "I am not
for or against pre-marital sex.
There are certain circumstances
where it is extremely rewarding.
But it is an area of the greatest
difficulties resulting from per
fectly rational and the best of
intentions. I know many college
students who treat sex natural
ly and with good humor, but in
some cases you may think that
genuine interest, spiritual com
munion, and permanence exist,
and they don't."
