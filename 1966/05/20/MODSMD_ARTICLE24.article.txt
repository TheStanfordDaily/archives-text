# AAWU Track Meet Starts Today
## 
### BOB EGELKO 
Stars descend on Stanford
Stadium today, and conference
records are in for a battering
as the Cards host the seventh
AAWU track and field cham
pionships.
Competition today, with quali
fying in all events but the three
mile and probably the mile, will
start at 1:30, as will tomorrow's
finals.
Stanford will get its first look
this year at defending AAWU
champion and NCAA co-titlist
Oregon; but the Ducks' reign
should be ended by the team
that finished sixth last year,
UCLA.
Jim Bush's Bruins, with the
addition of some tremendous
sophomores and help from over
seas, have swept through the
conference unbeaten and unchal
lenged, substantiating presea
son predictions which made
them the best in the country.
Despite several injuries, they
are a good bet to keep going
this weekend.
Steinhauer Choice
In the heated competition,
only a few events look easy to
predict. One is the shot put,
where Neal Steinhauer of Ore
gon appears to have only Dallas
Long's meet record of 63-7% to
beat. Steinhauer has thrown
66-10 this year, an AAWU rec
ord.
The best chance for a world
mark should be in the three
mile, where little Gerry Lind
gren of Washington State, a
prohibitive favorite in the ab
sence of UCLA's Bob Day,
could break Ron Clarke's stand
ard of 12:52.4 if he is pressed at
all in the early going.
Stanford, which tied USC for
fourth last year, could improve
on that showing with a few
come through performances and
some breaks from the rest of the
field. The Indians are in their
best shape of the season, ac
cording to Coach Pay ton Jor
dan.
Brightest Card hopes ride in
the long jump, where Craig

Vaughn (24-5%) and Bud Walsh
stand 1-2 in the conference.
Their closest competitors appear
to be a couple of Oregonians,
Tony Albin of Oregon State and
Herman Brame of Oregon.
With Norm Jackson of UCLA
and Dwight Middleton of USC
expected to be below par be
cause of injuries, Larry Questad,
who ran encouragingly at Fres
no, figures in the thick of things
in both sprints.
Jackson, Middleton, Dick Hick
man and Jim Johnson of Wash
ington State and Mike Deibele
of Oregon also look strong in
the 100, and Bruins Tom Jones
and Bob Frey and defending
champion Forrest Beaty of Cal
are added threats in the 220.
Like the sprints, the hurdles ap
pear to lack a clear-cut favorite.
Kerry Ailing
The man who has beaten them
all in the highs, Paul Kerry of
USC, is a likely scratch due to
a bruised heel. Ron Copeland of
UCLA, with the year's fastest
time of 13.7, may be the best
of the rest, but he is by no
means a cinch against USC's
Earl McCullough, Oregon's Bob
Blum, Washington's Bill Roe,
Cal's Lou Kirtman, and Stan
ford's improving Bud Walsh.

The intermediates could turn
out to be a homestretch duel
among Paddy McCrary of Cal,
Roger Johnson of UCLA, and
Dave Williams of Washington;
Walsh, if he qualifies, may be
capable of a lot faster than his
seasonal best, 53.2. McCrary has
run 51.3.
However scrambled each fin
ish becomes, favored UCLA
doesn't figure to be hurt too
badly. The Bruins are set in the
pole vault with NCAA record
holder Marc Savage; Dick Selby
has the league's best javelin
mark, 247-11; Bob Frey is a
good bet in the 440, and NCAA
titlist Day, if his legs hold up,
has to rule as the favorite in
the mile, with Geoff Pyne fig
uring somewhere also.
Even without Day, the mile
would be a dogfight, with one
or more sub-four-minutes times
likely. There may or may not
be two heats today, with to
morrow's final set for 2:10 re
gardless.
Besides Day and Pyne, Bruce
Bess and John Link of USC,
Dave Deubner of Stanford, and
Wade Bell and Ken Moore of
Oregon appear the leading con
tenders.
Oregon's Moore also rules as
the favorite in today's only final,
the 3000 meter steeplechase. He
won it last year.
Discus: Anyone's Guess
Highlight of .the field events
should be the discus, a tossup
among Gary Carlsen of USC,
A 1 Pemberton of Washington,
Stanford co-captain Bob Stoeck
er, and Oregon's Steinhauer,
trying for a weights double.
Carlsen has thrown this
year.
Field-strong USC also boasts
favored Greg Heet, consistent at
6-10 in the high jump, and Ma
honey Samuels, who if healthy
is the class of the triple jump
field.
Trojan Dennis Carr, possibly
the best half miler in the coun
try, may be pushed below 1:47
by Oregon's Bell and Cal's De
vone Smith.
