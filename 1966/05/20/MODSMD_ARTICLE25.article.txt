# USC Favored In League Golf

### 
USC's Trojans seek their third
straight league title in the
AAWU Golf Championships be
ing held today and tomorrow on
the Stanford course. Northern
Division champ Oregon State
p.nd a young and improving
Stanford squad could give the
experienced Southlanders a
scare.
The Trojans are led by Sher
man Finger, who won the
league individual championship
the last two years. Finger is
backed up by Lee Davis, whose
72 stroke season average places
him in a first place tie for con
ference honors. Davis, only a
junior, was runnerup in the
1966 Western Intercollegiates.
Finger recently blasted out of
a slump by winning the Wendell
Alexander tournament. His low
competitive round this year was
a 65. In 1964 he won the league
title with a 280 total for 72
holes and then repeated last
year with a 286.
Bruins Strong, Too
USC won 22 of 23 matches
this season, losing only to cross
town rival UCLA. The Bruins
who also boast a home course
win over Cal State of Los An
geles, third place finisher in last
year's NCAA tournament, can
not be counted out this week
end.
Terry Hartshorn leads the
Bruin squad with a 75 average.
In dual team matches against
USC he shot a 71 to beat Finger
and followed with a fine round

of 70 to defeat Lee Davis. In
the Western Intercollegiates
Hartshorn finished third.
Dave Ledbetter, fifth place
finisher in the 1965 league tour
ney, also sports a 75 average
for the Bruins. Former NCAA
Long Drive Champ Brian Kauf
man should provide golf fans
with some tremendous wallops
off the tee.
Cards Improved

season as they soundly
whipped Cal and threw a scare
into NCAA contender San Jose
State. The Cards are led by jun
ior John Bottomley and sopho
more Greg Picard, both of whom
averaged 73 strokes for the year.
The Cards will also enter jun

iors Leith Anderson, Loy Mar
tin, and Walt Driver and sopho
more Dick Harris. Anderson,
Martin, and Harris have aver
aged 75 this year, while Driver
has been one shot higher.
The Northwest challenge is
spearheaded by Oregon State's
Beavers, who will count on two
par golfers, Bill McCrae and
Lloyd West, to pace their forces.
On the basis of team depth the
Beavers should pose the most
serious threat to USC with three
golfers averaging 74.
Hu.stkies Hopeful
Washington's Huskies come to
Stanford with high hopes of
matching last year's fourth place
finish. Steve Cole led the team
this year with a 72 average, and
fellow sophomore Jim Gannon
consistently carded 73.
The team championship will
be decided by the total of each
team's four lowest individual
scores after 72 holes. The indi
vidual trophy is also awarded on
the basis of 72 holes of play.
Stanford will host the NCAA
tourney in mid-June, so confer
ence golfers have the opportuni
ty to become accustomed to the
Stanford course well in advance
of the other competitors.
