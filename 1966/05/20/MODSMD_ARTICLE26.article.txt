# Laxmen And Palo Alto To Mix It Up For Keg
## 
### 
Although no trophy will be
riding on the outcome of Satur
day's lacrosse game, Stanford's
squad has a case of beer to de
fend, when it meets the powerful
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club in what
promises to be the best game of
the NorCal season.
The Palo Alto Club is riding
high on a thirteen game winning
streak and sports its share of
All-Americans and All-Ivy play
ers. Because the Indians lost to
the club in a winter quarter con
test and tied Cal in their first
outing against the Bears, the
Palo Altans have the league
championship wrapped up.
But the Stanford team has
jelled into what some observers
think is the best team in the
league, and Stanford Coach
Gene Dickason has bet a case
of beer on the outcome.
Dickason has put his faith in
a previously impenetrable de
fense which now has two gap
ing holes. Strapping defenseman
Jack Dirman presently has a
class conflict and goalie Mel
Ellis suffered what may be a
separated shoulder and is a ques

tion mark for the game.
Dickason must now turn to
either Jim Crawford or Buck
Wales for the defensive spot and
Hugh West in the nets.
The contest still shapes up to
be a close one and a brutal one.
Palo Alto has had a three week
lay-off, and it is Dickason's hope
that he can rely on his midfield
depth to run the older (not to
say more dissipated) Palo Altans
into the ground.
Game time is 1:30 p.m.
