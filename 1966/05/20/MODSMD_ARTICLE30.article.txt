# On Protesting The Test
## 
### 
The all-night vigil in the President's Office
protesting University cooperation with the Se
lective Service System has brought out a river
of emotions dotted with a few islands of reason
ableness and strong currents of irrationality.
The emotions of the indignant students are
understandable. An unjust federal draft policy
has forced them into a position where they must
either cooperate with an inequitable Selective
Service System or chance risking their lives in
cause of a questionable "freedom" in an unwill
ing and distant land.
Spokesmen for the protesting students have
asked for an open meeting with President Ster
ling to discuss the University's decision to allow
the draft examinations to be held on campus.
This we feel is a reasonable demand, for, as the
protesters point out, the University gave stu
dents no voice in making the decision—not that
it would necessarily have been different, but
that student viewpoints were ignored on an is
sue that affects them vitally.
The protestors further demand that the Uni
versity conduct "a complete, public investiga
tion of the social and moral implications of this
examination" and that there be "a report to the
Stanford community on the results of this in
vestigation." This, we feel, is also reasonable.
The Academic Council called for just such a
study at its special meeting Tuesday, and it can
be called into session again for further debate
by any 20 of its 850 members. That study, how
ever, is not "public." Perhaps it should be opened
to the whole community.
The students' additional demand that the ad
ministration immediately cease giving the draft
exam is a different case. It is, we believe, di
rected to the wrong constituency. John D. Black,
director of the campus Counseling and Testing

Center which administrates the tests at Stan
ford, points out that the University in adminis
tering the draft test is not endorsing the validity
of the test or subscribing to any particular idea
of what the criteria for drafting men should be.
Its function, rather, is to accommodate the 3000
or more students who want to take the test. (All
of which is not to say that the University's coop
eration with General Hershey does not deserve
scrutiny, but that there is at least partial justifi
cation for it.) In light of this, it appears that the
protesters are spanking the wrong child: they
might better and more justly direct their efforts
at convincing students to stay in bed Saturday
morning. The choice should be left to the indiv
idual student; the dissenters are unjustified in
demanding that the University foist their moral
code upon the entire male segment of the stu
dent body.
The vigil itself has been marked with con
siderable restraint. The civil disobedience has
progressed with reasonable conduct; the Presi
dent's Office is undamaged, and no physical
force has been used. The administration, on its
part, has not repeated the mistake of Berkeley's
Edward Strong of forcibly removing the pro
testers. On the other hand, the administrators
have proven themselves more flexible than the
students — Dean Wert appeared immediately
when the demonstrators in the President's Office
asked to speak to a representative of the adminis
tration, but spokesmen for the protesters later
rudely turned down an offer by Dr. Black to
present his point of view.
One of the protesters said yesterday afternoon
that there are occasions when "orderly proced
ures" are not enough, and that more direct meth
ods are called for. This might well be one of
those times; if it is, the protesters must not allow
their emotions to dominate their reason.

vestigation." This, we feel, is also reasonable.
The Academic Council called for just such a
study at its special meeting Tuesday, and it can
be called into session again for further debate
by any 20 of its 850 members. That study, how
ever, is not "public." Perhaps it should be opened
to the whole community.
The students' additional demand that the ad
ministration immediately cease giving the draft
exam is a different case. It is, we believe, di
rected to the wrong constituency. John D. Black,
director of the campus Counseling and Testing

Center which administrates the tests at Stan
ford, points out that the University in adminis
tering the draft test is not endorsing the validity
of the test or subscribing to any particular idea
of what the criteria for drafting men should be.
Its function, rather, is to accommodate the 3000
or more students who want to take the test. (All
of which is not to say that the University's coop
eration with General Hershey does not deserve
scrutiny, but that there is at least partial justifi
cation for it.) In light of this, it appears that the
protesters are spanking the wrong child: they
might better and more justly direct their efforts
at convincing students to stay in bed Saturday
morning. The choice should be left to the indiv
idual student; the dissenters are unjustified in
demanding that the University foist their moral
code upon the entire male segment of the stu
dent body.
The vigil itself has been marked with con
siderable restraint. The civil disobedience has
progressed with reasonable conduct; the Presi
dent's Office is undamaged, and no physical
force has been used. The administration, on its
part, has not repeated the mistake of Berkeley's
Edward Strong of forcibly removing the pro
testers. On the other hand, the administrators
have proven themselves more flexible than the
students — Dean Wert appeared immediately
when the demonstrators in the President's Office
asked to speak to a representative of the adminis
tration, but spokesmen for the protesters later
rudely turned down an offer by Dr. Black to
present his point of view.
One of the protesters said yesterday afternoon
that there are occasions when "orderly proced
ures" are not enough, and that more direct meth
ods are called for. This might well be one of
those times; if it is, the protesters must not allow
their emotions to dominate their reason.
The all-night vigil in the President's Office
protesting University cooperation with the Se
lective Service System has brought out a river
of emotions dotted with a few islands of reason
ableness and strong currents of irrationality.
The emotions of the indignant students are
understandable. An unjust federal draft policy
has forced them into a position where they must
either cooperate with an inequitable Selective
Service System or chance risking their lives in
cause of a questionable "freedom" in an unwill
ing and distant land.
Spokesmen for the protesting students have
asked for an open meeting with President Ster
ling to discuss the University's decision to allow
the draft examinations to be held on campus.
This we feel is a reasonable demand, for, as the
protesters point out, the University gave stu
dents no voice in making the decision—not that
it would necessarily have been different, but
that student viewpoints were ignored on an is
sue that affects them vitally.
The protestors further demand that the Uni
versity conduct "a complete, public investiga
tion of the social and moral implications of this
examination" and that there be "a report to the
Stanford community on the results of this in
vestigation." This, we feel, is also reasonable.
