# Worship And The Trustees
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees is to be congratulated
on its decision yesterday to allow the University
to make plans for members of major non-
Christian faiths to worship on campus outside
the confines of Memorial Church. The change
hopefully will permit Rabbi Charles Familant
to lead Jewish services in a location where spiri
tual worship will not be hampered by overbear
ing Christian symobilsm.
We question, however, the Boards insistance
that it have a final say over the schedule of wor
ship services once it is formulated by the Presi
dent and the Dean of the Chapel. This, we

think, is unnecessary bureaucratic detail. There
is no reason why the Board should have to worry
itself over whether the Catholics worship at 10
o'clock or 1 o'clock —no reason, that is, other
than a general Trustee tendancy to fret over
every change the University makes, including
changes American society adopted 190 years
ago. The Board might better spend its time
worrying about some of die University's mid
twentieth-century problems.
Stanford is apparently approaching comple
tion of its metamorphasis from an Anglican par
ish to a campus on which freedom of worship is
an unrestricted right. It's time to move on.
