# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The 						White Tower University 
### 
• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

"Education" or learning ough
n't to be much fun —if I've un
derstood the series of solemn
pronouncements entitled "Edu
cation at Stanford."
Wonder and amazement, strip
ped of delight and shorn of en
chantment hearken us in an awe
ful, almost tragic, tone to return
to the oh-so-serious business of
understanding ourselves and the
world we live in. Come, turn
away from this distracting
world of people and events to
bathe in the deodorized purity
of a "theoretical" understanding
of the Good, the True, and the
Beautiful.
Is this academe, or perhaps
more accurately, is this a monas
tary with students transformed
into monks constrained by an
austere ascetic ideal? Has un
derstanding lost its delight in a
compuslive search for satori? Is
this veriegated and multiformed
world so irrelevent to our lives
that an "ideal" education impels
the caustic disparagement of ap
plication, of applied knowledge
—of knowledge and understand
ing applied to life?
RadicaK?) historicism leads
only to the past while the sensi
tive creation of viable forms for
our time depends upon a view of
the future. A sensitive under
standing of historical forms is
crucial, but insufficient. Walk
ing backwards is a rough way to
travel, and a bit silly; at best it's
reactive, at worst disasterous,
and rarely prevenient.
Regardless of the roots of the
Western academic tradition, per
haps it's time to transcend Com
berg's razor, and recreate an
idea of the university commen
surate with its multifold poten
tials. We live at the verge of a
renaissance, a nascent revolution

in understanding and social
form from which the timid may
retreat to reflectively consider
from afar, but into which the
more courageous illuminati can
thrust themselves in the crea
tion of new forms and ideas to
vitalize a growing culture .
In this context the university
not only has an educative poten
tial, but can serve to house and
cross-fertilize a cultural and in
tellectual vanguard that will
lead our society bravely into its
futux-e.

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

• Society First
Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Insane War
Editor, The Daily:
I have just heard the regular
network (ABC) news report
from Vietnam. An MP kept say
ing "Don't cry sonny, don't cry."
The kid had been shot in the
neck. A terrorist had set off a
bomb. The MP's in the area
opened fire, most of the time
shooting at one another. Men,
women and children were
caught in the crossfire. There
were 38 civilian casualties. The
American embassy issued an
apology (sorry about that) but
said the terrorist was to blame.
The war in Vietnam is insane.
Only the insane would have it
continue.
RICHARD HIRSH
• Non-Sequitur
Editor, The Daily:
In " 'The New Left' Under
Pressure: Drachkovitch" (The
Daily, May 10) Dr. Drachkovitch
is quoted as saying that Staugh
ton Lynd's Hanoi statement de
nouncing the U. S.'s "barbarous
aggression in Vietnam ... is
symbolic of how easy it is to
slip from a-Communism to pro-
Communism."
Rather is Drachkovitch's
statement symbolic of muddle
headed reasoning which should
have no place in intelligent dis
cussion of vital issues in this
academic community.
The only way of passing from
the putative factual claim that
Lynd made such a statement, to
the "conclusion" that this shows
that he has a pro-Communist
attitude (this is clearly implied
in Drachkovitch's statement:
see above), is by way of the ad
ditional premise that "anyone
who brands U. S. Vietnam pol
icy aggression is pro-Communist
(at least on this issue)." How
ever this premise is patently
false, for there are many indi
viduals who take such a stand
on U. S. Vietnam policy, yet
who carry no brief for the Viet
cong, this writer included.
I suggest that Dr. Drachko
vitch consider auditing Philoso
phy 5 (Introduction to Logic) as
a possible cure for his addiction
to non-sequitur.

ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

Editor, The Daily:
I have just heard the regular

The kid had been shot in the

opened fire, most of the time
shooting at one another. Men,
women and children were
caught in the crossfire. There
were 38 civilian casualties. The

• Non-Sequitur
Editor, The Daily:
In " 'The New Left' Under
Pressure: Drachkovitch" (The
Daily, May 10) Dr. Drachkovitch
is quoted as saying that Staugh
ton Lynd's Hanoi statement de
nouncing the U. S.'s "barbarous
aggression in Vietnam ... is
symbolic of how easy it is to
slip from a-Communism to pro-
Communism."
Rather is Drachkovitch's
statement symbolic of muddle
headed reasoning which should
have no place in intelligent dis
cussion of vital issues in this
academic community.
The only way of passing from
the putative factual claim that
Lynd made such a statement, to
the "conclusion" that this shows
that he has a pro-Communist
attitude (this is clearly implied
in Drachkovitch's statement:
see above), is by way of the ad
ditional premise that "anyone
who brands U. S. Vietnam pol
icy aggression is pro-Communist
(at least on this issue)." How
ever this premise is patently
false, for there are many indi

on U. S. Vietnam policy, yet
who carry no brief for the Viet

I suggest that Dr. Drachko

• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam

ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like

Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

Theta Delta Chi
• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as

and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the

giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

• Society First
Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Insane War
Editor, The Daily:
I have just heard the regular
network (ABC) news report
from Vietnam. An MP kept say
ing "Don't cry sonny, don't cry."
The kid had been shot in the
neck. A terrorist had set off a
bomb. The MP's in the area
opened fire, most of the time
shooting at one another. Men,
women and children were
caught in the crossfire. There
were 38 civilian casualties. The
American embassy issued an
apology (sorry about that) but
said the terrorist was to blame.
The war in Vietnam is insane.
Only the insane would have it
continue.
RICHARD HIRSH
• Non-Sequitur
Editor, The Daily:
In " 'The New Left' Under
Pressure: Drachkovitch" (The
Daily, May 10) Dr. Drachkovitch
is quoted as saying that Staugh
ton Lynd's Hanoi statement de
nouncing the U. S.'s "barbarous
aggression in Vietnam ... is
symbolic of how easy it is to
slip from a-Communism to pro-
Communism."
Rather is Drachkovitch's
statement symbolic of muddle
headed reasoning which should
have no place in intelligent dis
cussion of vital issues in this
academic community.
The only way of passing from
the putative factual claim that
Lynd made such a statement, to
the "conclusion" that this shows
that he has a pro-Communist
attitude (this is clearly implied
in Drachkovitch's statement:
see above), is by way of the ad
ditional premise that "anyone
who brands U. S. Vietnam pol
icy aggression is pro-Communist
(at least on this issue)." How
ever this premise is patently
false, for there are many indi
viduals who take such a stand
on U. S. Vietnam policy, yet
who carry no brief for the Viet
cong, this writer included.
I suggest that Dr. Drachko
vitch consider auditing Philoso
phy 5 (Introduction to Logic) as
a possible cure for his addiction
to non-sequitur.

nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Insane War
Editor, The Daily:
I have just heard the regular

from Vietnam. An MP kept say
ing "Don't cry sonny, don't cry."
The kid had been shot in the
neck. A terrorist had set off a
bomb. The MP's in the area
opened fire, most of the time
shooting at one another. Men,
women and children were
caught in the crossfire. There
were 38 civilian casualties. The

said the terrorist was to blame.

• Non-Sequitur
Editor, The Daily:
In " 'The New Left' Under
Pressure: Drachkovitch" (The
Daily, May 10) Dr. Drachkovitch
is quoted as saying that Staugh
ton Lynd's Hanoi statement de
nouncing the U. S.'s "barbarous
aggression in Vietnam ... is
symbolic of how easy it is to
slip from a-Communism to pro-
Communism."
Rather is Drachkovitch's
statement symbolic of muddle
headed reasoning which should
have no place in intelligent dis
cussion of vital issues in this
academic community.
The only way of passing from
the putative factual claim that
Lynd made such a statement, to
the "conclusion" that this shows
that he has a pro-Communist
attitude (this is clearly implied
in Drachkovitch's statement:
see above), is by way of the ad
ditional premise that "anyone
who brands U. S. Vietnam pol
icy aggression is pro-Communist
(at least on this issue)." How
ever this premise is patently
false, for there are many indi
viduals who take such a stand
on U. S. Vietnam policy, yet
who carry no brief for the Viet

I suggest that Dr. Drachko

a possible cure for his addiction

• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam

ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like

Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

Theta Delta Chi
• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience

ly running up and down the

I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in

and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.

loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

I have just heard the regular

The kid had been shot in the

• Non-Sequitur
Editor, The Daily:
In " 'The New Left' Under

is quoted as saying that Staugh

nouncing the U. S.'s "barbarous

The only way of passing from
the putative factual claim that
Lynd made such a statement, to
the "conclusion" that this shows
that he has a pro-Communist

in Drachkovitch's statement:
see above), is by way of the ad

(at least on this issue)." How
ever this premise is patently
false, for there are many indi

• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

• Society First
Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Road To Infamy
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently discovered
that there are incompatibilities
between ROTC and the univer
sity and the athletic program
and the university.
Having established this mo
mentum we should soon arrive
at an even more significant con
clusion: that there is an incom
patibility between the Univer
sity and the university—that is
to say between the University
as it is as Stanford and the
ideal university which we sup
posedly aspire to be. (If Stan
ford does not aspire to this
ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

ideal it might as well rename it
self—something like the Leland
Stanford Junior Institute for
the Production of Knowledge
able Social Creatures
(LSJIPKSC) might be suit
able.)
What is this ideal university?
Some people call it a white
tower. But this is not quite apt
for it suggests various elements
which should not be part of the
ideal university.
To begin with, structure: the
university should be a haven of
freedom where one can escape
the artificial structures and
hence confinements of society.
Secondly, it suggests isola
tion and protection from the
harsh reality of the outer
world. The ideal university
should instead provide a pers
pective from which one can take
an objective view of the world
surrounding, draw value judge
ments from the observations
and act in accordance with
these value judgements (hence
civil rights work, etc.).
Thirdly, the whiteness: it sug
gests, aside from racial discrim
ination, a sense of innocence.
The ideal university should im
merse one in reality; it should
be a place where one can probe
deeply into the problems con
fronting humanity. The univer
sity should be the vanguard in
the progress of humanity, not
in the domination of one artifi
cial set of values or another.
Now obviously a university
which must cater to the tastes
and values of its alumni or foun
ders to sustain itself economical
ly must structure itself accord
ing to external and alien values.
In such an environment the
freedom necessary for becoming
an ideal university cannot be
found.
We are thus faced, quite sim
ply, with two alternatives. Ei
ther the alumni rhust contribute
money without any strings at
tached, thus dedicating them
selves to Stanford's pursuit of
the ideal form (thus liberating
professors from the pressure to
publish in order to convince po
tential funds givers that Stan
ford is a great institution well
worthy of being placed in their
tax deduction column), or re
name itself and adapt new poli
cies consistent with its goals.
For instance it should admit
students not on the basis of in
telligence or creativity but on
the basis of malleability.
Since the latter alternative is
much more compatible with the
goals of our society we might
as well start ordering banners
labeled LSJIPKSC and lead our
society down the road to in
famy under this glorious sym
bol.

"Education" or learning ough
n't to be much fun —if I've un
derstood the series of solemn
pronouncements entitled "Edu
cation at Stanford."
Wonder and amazement, strip
ped of delight and shorn of en
chantment hearken us in an awe
ful, almost tragic, tone to return
to the oh-so-serious business of
understanding ourselves and the
world we live in. Come, turn
away from this distracting
world of people and events to
bathe in the deodorized purity
of a "theoretical" understanding
of the Good, the True, and the
Beautiful.
Is this academe, or perhaps
more accurately, is this a monas
tary with students transformed
into monks constrained by an
austere ascetic ideal? Has un
derstanding lost its delight in a
compuslive search for satori? Is
this veriegated and multiformed
world so irrelevent to our lives
that an "ideal" education impels
the caustic disparagement of ap
plication, of applied knowledge
—of knowledge and understand
ing applied to life?
RadicaK?) historicism leads
only to the past while the sensi
tive creation of viable forms for
our time depends upon a view of
the future. A sensitive under
standing of historical forms is
crucial, but insufficient. Walk
ing backwards is a rough way to
travel, and a bit silly; at best it's
reactive, at worst disasterous,
and rarely prevenient.
Regardless of the roots of the
Western academic tradition, per
haps it's time to transcend Com
berg's razor, and recreate an
idea of the university commen
surate with its multifold poten
tials. We live at the verge of a
renaissance, a nascent revolution

in understanding and social
form from which the timid may
retreat to reflectively consider
from afar, but into which the
more courageous illuminati can
thrust themselves in the crea
tion of new forms and ideas to
vitalize a growing culture .
In this context the university
not only has an educative poten
tial, but can serve to house and
cross-fertilize a cultural and in
tellectual vanguard that will
lead our society bravely into its
futux-e.

• Reply To Lowe
Editor, The Daily:
In the absence of Professor
Jan Triska, who is currently
teaching on the Stanford Cam
pus at Florence, I am respond
ing to Mr. Keith Lowe's refer
ence to the Studies of the Com
munist System (Letters, May 4).
Under Professor Triska's di
rection, the Studies—financed by
a grant from the Ford Founda
tion have pioneered in efforts to
view the Communist System as
objectively as possible. Every ef
fort has been made—and new ef
forts are continually being initi
ated—to devise methods of re
search that will remove as much
bias as humanly possible from
the study of a system which em
braces such currently divergent
viewpoints as the Soviet Rus
sian, the Communist Chinese,
the Yugoslav, the Cuban, the
Rumanian and so forth.
This is no easy task. If Mr.
Lowe or anyone else can devise
even more objective methods for
studying these and other coun
tries, he will find an eager and
respectful audience among those
faculty members and graduate
students associated with the
Studies.
In undertaking the develop
ment of more precise, objective
and replicable research techni
ques, the Studies have attracted
frequent expressions of indigna
tion from the ever-vocal Right.
(I need not be specific; one re
quires only a small experience
to recognize the angry vocabu
lary of extremists.)
Now that Mr. Lowe has con
signed this attempt at basic, un
fettered research to the Inner
C i t y's "whorelike" operations
"for the enjoyment of big busi
ness, the military, Cold War
demonologists, etc.," we can at
least rest assured that the criti
cism is balanced.
Along with many colleagues, I
empathize with recent indica
tions of intellectual, as well as
social unrest among students
and have no desire to administer
what a recent Daily column re
ferred to as a "devastating ri
poste." The world, including
even Stanford's corner of it, is a
confusing place these days, and
I expect many of the confusions
and problems to proliferate be
fore the century is out. On the
other hand, sweeping verbal hay
makers on anyone's part are not
always the best inspiration for
dialogue.
Whatever its drawbacks, I
find the Stanford University
campus one of the most stimu
lating places anywhere: intel
lectual frontiers are being
pierced in department after de
partment, and the wonder; are
only beginning. If large parts of
the student body are unaware,
uninvolved, non-infected or bit
terly hostile, we suffer a serious
disability and should all lend a
hand to do something about it.
Indeed, if this be a whore
house, as suggested, then per
haps the first move is to dis
tribute more keys so that Mr.
Lowe and others may have a
closer view of what it is like
inside.

• Society First
Editor, The Daily:
I can't help but think "that
Stanford is changing". In cries
of foul play and well publicized
violation of individual freedom,
students at Stanford have com
pletely cast aside their responsi
bility to the university in efforts
to demonstrate their prowess as
individuals.
When a person becomes part
of a society he assumes a re
sponsibility to conduct himself
in the best interest of that so
ciety and is restricted by the
laws of that organization. The
more socialized and powerful
the government, the more the
individual freedoms are re
stricted.
Thus a civilized person has
two types of inhibitions affect
ing his freedom. First he must
morally judge his personal ac
tions. If they are offensive to
his fellows he must make deci
sions by considering the effect
upon others and the gains to
himself. I feel a person's alle
giance is to his society and not
to himself. Actions by many
students at Stanford indicate
they feel differently. The second
type of inhibition upon individu
al freedom is the regulations
that insure order in the societ
ty. •
The current mode in our so

ciety is to sacrifice the organi
zation for the individual. Draft
dodging is condoned, civil dis
obedience is accepted and stu
dents are demanding more con
trol of University policy.
If a member does not abide
by the rules of his society, what
right does he have to demand
partial control and if his actions
do implement change, will he
expect others to obey his new
rules?
It appears that the people
whose cause is individual free
dom, who want free speech, who
are concerned about the govern
ment contracts with the univer
sity, and who want more con
trol in what goes on about them
are the same people who want
a "Great Society", medicare,
free pills, a war on poverty and
federal aid to an endless list of
things.
More concisely the people
who want more individual free
dom also want control and so
cialism. Socialism restricts in
dividual freedom and takes con
trol from the individual. To
some people it is a "free lunch"
(to others a forced lunch) and
complain about the menu.
With any organization, par
ticularly a socialistic one, the
members are like the tail of a
dog. At Stanford the tail (the
students) is trying to wag the
dog.

• 'Passive' Theater
Editor, The Daily:
In the May 3 lead article in
The Daily in which Gerald Hi
ken of the Stanford Repertory
Theatre was interviewed about
the audience response to this
year's productions, Mr. Hiken,
in the tradition of Herbert Blau
of the Lincoln Center Theatre
in New York, castigated the
average American audience as
polite, passive, and following
the "middle way".
The implication of the com
ments throughout this pub
lished interview was similar to
much current dramatic theory
which stresses the concept that
theatre is only exciting when
people's emotions and ideas are
so violently assaulted that large
segments of the audience will
either rise in anger and leave
the theatre or will drop polite
ness and enter into the proceed
ings on the stage.
It is all part and parcel of the
present usually unquestioned ar
tistic ideal that to shock, to as
sault, to argue, to preach, to of
fend is the one great legitimate
aim of theatrical production, if
it is not to be a mere sop to con
ventional middle class taste.
I think this prevalent attitude
should not go completely un
questioned or unexamined as an
appropriate aim for the re-In
terpretation of the classics, as
a method in new plays, or as a
general aim in production.
That it can make for an ex
citing evening in the theatre in
the hands of a fine director is
certain, but that it should be a
general aim for the new reper
tory theatres springing up about
the country is, I feel, a one
sided and limiting idea.
The history of the theatre, as
with any other art, is filled with
performances that have been re
corded as near riots because the
audience was shocked or stirred
by certain things said in a new
play or by a violent re-interpre
tation of an old classic, but the
balance sheet in retrospect
shows that many of these pro
ductions and plays were not par
ticularly brilliant, they just hap
pened at a particularly apt his
torical moment.
Hernani, Playboy of the West
ern World, Waiting for Lefty
are plays whose first perform
ance records would fulfill all Mr.
Hiken's fondest hopes, but only
Playboy is still thought of as a
minor classic.
What about all the great thea
tre classics that depend upon a
quiet, thoughtful, inner listen
ing of the heart and mind, in
which the deepest reaches of the
audience's being is being tapped,
not just his intellect, his social
instincts and his desire for jus
tice.
In some of the great Greek
tragedies there is an integra
tion of dance, music, chanted
words and deep human suffering
that can, in a brilliant perform
ance, affect us well below the
conscious intellectual level.
When one sees such a perform
ance (usually only a few times
during a lifetime), quiet still
ness is almost always the audi
ence reaction during the key
scenes and at the end of the per
formance.

The same is true of a brilliant
performance of Lear. The
audience is not merely polite,
nor is it challenged as a group,
nor is it assaulted with mes
sages, it is slowly and subcon
sciously reduced to its bas i c,
naked core of being.
In short, why is it not just as
valid in the theatre as in poetry
and music to explore the inner
world of dreams, of subcon
scious moods, of barely defina
ble feeling, as it is to thrust the
stage violently into the audience
lap and have actors continuous
ly running up and down the
aisles?
I think I know one answer.
Because it is much more diffi
cult. It takes careful training in
dance, body movement, voice
and diction and in subtlety of
expressed feeling. One glaring
mistake and the whole mood
crumbles. One wrong color or
one loud noise and the scene
and even the play can be lost.
Just because this is a noisy,
loud, brash world that continual
ly assaults us on all sides during
our daily living, it does not
mean that there is no longer an
inner man, inner moods, quiet
reveries and a world of the
primitive and the subconscious
that we often take little time to
know.
Why cannot a play or a pro
duction appeal "to the mind's
eye"? Perhaps because some
theatre people are afraid to be
that subtle or think an audience
couldn't sit that quietly and feel
that deeply. It is a question of
respecting the audience's ability
to be an audience.
I think the theatre must do
both things and do them well,
and I do not believe that all the
great plays of the past should
be re-interpreted to fit the mold
of activist theatre; and I do not
believe that all productions
should have the so-called "ad
venturous staging" mentioned
in the first sentence of the
Daily interview.
The life of the theatre should
be broader not narrower than
real life, and I admire brilliant
productions that are not neces
sarily committed to "Challenge"
—where the audience is deeply
"passive".

• Insane War
Editor, The Daily:
I have just heard the regular
network (ABC) news report
from Vietnam. An MP kept say
ing "Don't cry sonny, don't cry."
The kid had been shot in the
neck. A terrorist had set off a
bomb. The MP's in the area
opened fire, most of the time
shooting at one another. Men,
women and children were
caught in the crossfire. There
were 38 civilian casualties. The
American embassy issued an
apology (sorry about that) but
said the terrorist was to blame.
The war in Vietnam is insane.
Only the insane would have it
continue.
RICHARD HIRSH
• Non-Sequitur
Editor, The Daily:
In " 'The New Left' Under
Pressure: Drachkovitch" (The
Daily, May 10) Dr. Drachkovitch
is quoted as saying that Staugh
ton Lynd's Hanoi statement de
nouncing the U. S.'s "barbarous
aggression in Vietnam ... is
symbolic of how easy it is to
slip from a-Communism to pro-
Communism."
Rather is Drachkovitch's
statement symbolic of muddle
headed reasoning which should
have no place in intelligent dis
cussion of vital issues in this
academic community.
The only way of passing from
the putative factual claim that
Lynd made such a statement, to
the "conclusion" that this shows
that he has a pro-Communist
attitude (this is clearly implied
in Drachkovitch's statement:
see above), is by way of the ad
ditional premise that "anyone
who brands U. S. Vietnam pol
icy aggression is pro-Communist
(at least on this issue)." How
ever this premise is patently
false, for there are many indi
viduals who take such a stand
on U. S. Vietnam policy, yet
who carry no brief for the Viet
cong, this writer included.
I suggest that Dr. Drachko
vitch consider auditing Philoso
phy 5 (Introduction to Logic) as
a possible cure for his addiction
to non-sequitur.
