# Trustees Ask Study Of 'Possibility' Of On-Campus Non-Christian Rites
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Associate Editor 
Formal Jewish worship services
may be permitted on campus outside
Memorial Church by virtue of a dec
laration made yesterday by the Board
of Trustees.
The Board in a statement released
last night requested that "President
Sterling consider with the Dean of the
Chapel the possibility of providing an
other existing location on campus be
sides Memorial Church for formal re
ligious worship by members of major
non-Christian faiths."
The Dean, B. Davie Napier, told The
Daily two weeks ago that he saw no
reason why formal Jewish services
could not be permitted in a campus
location other than Memorial Church.
Sterling, the statement said, will
submit for the consideration of the
trustees of their next meeting in July

"a revised program for formal re
ligious services."
Rabbi Charles Familant, director of
the Stanford Hillel foundation, said
last night in resopnse to the declara
tion: "I am quite satisfied. It seems
to make the provisions we requested.
The issue is closed as far as the Jew
ish group is concerned."
Permission Denial
The rabbi had two weeks ago been
denied permission to lead sabbath ser
vices in the Women's Clubhouse. He
made his request, after the University
had announced authorization for Jew
ish students to hold daily kaddish ser
vices in the Clubhouse.
The rabbi's request was denied on
the grounds that the February Trus
tee declaration permitting sectarian
worship on campus "explicitly limited
formal denominational worship to
Memorial Church."
The explanation given for allowing
the daily prayer service was that it is
"an informal assembly for the purpose
of private prayer."
'Timely And Constructive'
The President's Committee on Re
ligious Activities, meeting yesterday
afternoon, announced that it regarded
the trustees' action as "timely and
constructive."
"We note that non-Christian groups

have met and will continue to meet at
the Women's Clubhouse," the Com
mittee stated.
Committee chairman Lewis Spitz
explained the statement was noting
that "precedents exist for formal on
campus worship outside Memorial
Church."
Father John Duryea, Newman chap
lain at Stanford, said last night he
will consult with Chaplain Robert
Minto about scheduling at least one
mass before the end of the year.
'Adequate Provision' Asked
(Duryea and the other campus min
isters had earlier announced that they
would not begin holding services on
campus until "adequate provision is
made for the Jewish members of the
community.")
The chaplain is in charge of Me
morial Church and its activities until
July 1 when he goes on sabbatical.
From that date on, B. Davie Napier
will be in charge as Dean of the
Chapel. It is with Napier that Presi
dent Sterling will consult about the
services referred to in the declaration.
Tension over the issue was height
ened late last week when five Legis
lature members announced their in
tention to file suit against the Uni
versity for "denial of religious free
dom."
Their planned action was repudiated
by members of President Sterling's
Religious Advisory Committee, as well
as officers of the Student body and
the campus denominational ministers.
Deeision Changed
The students later decided not to
file the suit, explaining that the ad
ministration had assured them the sit
uation would be reviewed by the Trus
tees at the meeting held yesterday.
Until February of this year, the
only worship services allowed on cam
pus were the 'non-denominational"
ones in Memorial Church. The old
policy was based on the Founding
Grant of the University which states
that: "The University must be forever
maintained upon a strictly nonpar
tisan and non-sectarian basis.'
In February, the Board authorized
President Sterling to make arrange
ments "for the various denominations

to hold worship services on a regular
schedule in Memorial Church."
Rabbi Familant announced that he
could not conduct services in the
Church because a large number of
Hillel members found it impossible to
worship in a building dedicated to
Christian worship.

Permission Denial
The rabbi had two weeks ago been
denied permission to lead sabbath ser
vices in the Women's Clubhouse. He
made his request, after the University
had announced authorization for Jew
ish students to hold daily kaddish ser
vices in the Clubhouse.
The rabbi's request was denied on
the grounds that the February Trus
tee declaration permitting sectarian
worship on campus "explicitly limited
formal denominational worship to
Memorial Church."
The explanation given for allowing
the daily prayer service was that it is
"an informal assembly for the purpose
of private prayer."
'Timely And Constructive'
The President's Committee on Re
ligious Activities, meeting yesterday
afternoon, announced that it regarded
the trustees' action as "timely and
constructive."
"We note that non-Christian groups

have met and will continue to meet at
the Women's Clubhouse," the Com
mittee stated.
Committee chairman Lewis Spitz
explained the statement was noting
that "precedents exist for formal on
campus worship outside Memorial
Church."
Father John Duryea, Newman chap
lain at Stanford, said last night he
will consult with Chaplain Robert
Minto about scheduling at least one
mass before the end of the year.
'Adequate Provision' Asked

would not begin holding services on
campus until "adequate provision is
made for the Jewish members of the
community.")
The chaplain is in charge of Me
morial Church and its activities until

From that date on, B. Davie Napier

services referred to in the declaration.
Tension over the issue was height
ened late last week when five Legis
lature members announced their in
tention to file suit against the Uni

Their planned action was repudiated
by members of President Sterling's
Religious Advisory Committee, as well
as officers of the Student body and
the campus denominational ministers.

The students later decided not to
file the suit, explaining that the ad
ministration had assured them the sit

tees at the meeting held yesterday.
Until February of this year, the
