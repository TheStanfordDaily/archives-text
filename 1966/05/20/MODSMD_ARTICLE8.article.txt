### JOE ROSENBLOOM Managing Editor 
A disgruntled group of about 75
students yesterday occupied the lobby
of President Wallace Sterling's office
demanding a moratorium on the se
lective service test scheduled for to
morrow, refusing to leave until they
receive "a meaningful reply from the
administration."
The group marched to the office
from a noon rally in White Memorial
Plaza held to protest the test.
Last night about 35 students were
sprawled in the chairs and on the car
pet in the office, intending to stay
through the night.
"We are here to protest the admin
istering of the selective service exam
on campus," said Craig Lauden, or

ganizer of the rally, "to protest the
faculty's indecision on this matter,
and to bring to their attention our
strong feelings about it."
The Stanford Academic Council in
a special meeting Tuesday delegated
its Executive Committee to consider
next Tuesday the question of the Uni
versity's involvement with the se
lective service.
"We object to the tabling of any
discussion of the test until after it is
over with," commented Steven Marks,
one of the protesters.
President Sterling, who was in San
Francisco for a Board of Trustees
meeting, agreed yesterday to meet
privately and "not under duress" with
representatives of the group, accord
ing to Undergraduate Dean Robert
J. Wert. The students had demanded
earlier that the president meet with
them. But they voted to reject his
offer, deciding that any meeting had
to be public.
"There is simply nothing that could
be discussed in private that shouldn't
be discussed in public," one of them
said. "We want everyone involved be
cause everyone is concerned."
The protesters also voted yesterday
afternoon to attempt to disrupt the
selective service test if it is given to
morrow. They said in a statement to
The Daily that the test "discriminates
unfairly against members of minority
groups, the poor, and the badly edu
cated, forcing them to fight America's
unjust wars."
Meanwhile, another group of stu
dents has organized a counter-protest
and called for support in picketing the
president's office today at 9 a.m.
"We feel very strongly that such
coercive and harassing tactics as a
small group of students have des
cended to are neither proper in a uni
versity setting nor representative of
a majority of Stanford students," ex
plained Carey Coulter, organizer of
the group and a recent returnee from
refugee work with the International
Voluntary Service in Vietnam.

"We do not object to orderly pro
test," he said, "but we do object to
any action, such as the seizure of uni
versity offices, that substitutes force
for reason."
the Administration contemplates any
It was uncertain last night whether
action although Laudon said he has
received asurances that no such action
is planned.
University regulations prohibit
campus demonstrations held "within
University buildings, stadia, amphi
theaters, or fields while University
functions are in progress therein."
Protesters stressed the urgency of
their cause in justifying their protest.
"If the administration does not see
fit to give this serious and emergency
kind of treatment, we feel we are not
being listened to," said Chuck Des
pres. "What we are concerned about
is that the test Is being given on Sat
urday."
"The administration obviously will
not consider our point of view unless
we do something as drastic as this,"
sophomore Ken Washington com
mented.
Economics Professor Kenneth Ar
row, secretary of the Academic Coun
cil, told students outside the presi
dent's office that he felt "forcible ac
tion is not warranted under the cir
cumstances."
"The University has proven methods
for discussion," he said.
Dave Harris, ASSU president-elect,
who appeared temporarily at the pres
ident's office, supports the "lobby-in"
as a "recourse taken when those peo
ple who could speak to the issue
failed to speak to it."
Harris, who said he did not plan to
spend the night in the office because
he "had other commitments," added,
"The discussion had to be forced when
the issue wasn't dealt with on a vol
untary basis."
He said he opposed the idea of dis
rupting the selective service test he
cause it would be "playing with the
lives" of those who would be trying
to pass the test.
In various meetings the protesters
expressed at least three major
grievances: discontent with the stu
dent role in the decision-making proc
ess in the University, dissatisfaction
with the selective service test, and op
position to the Vietnam War.
But despite a divergence of griev
ances, the ad hoc group did find
strong support among its members
for the decisions reached.
