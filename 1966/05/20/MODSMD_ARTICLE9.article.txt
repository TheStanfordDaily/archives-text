# Panel On New Economics Warns Of Boom, Inflation
## 
### WALTER NEILSEN 
After warning those who might
have taken a wrong turn that "I'm
not the Lovin' Spoons," Prof. Paul
Samuelson opened a spirited panel dis
cussion on "The New Problems of the
New Economics" yesterday.
On the panel with Dr. Samuelson,
professor of economics at M.I.T. and
author of the textbook Economics:
An Introductory Course, were Prof.
Gurley of the Stanford Economics De
partment and Prof. Howell of the
Graduate School of Business.
Prof. Samuelson began by referring
to the present expansion as Methuse
lah among booms, and as the Prom

ised Land toward which the Kennedy-
Johnson economic advisors had been
working.
He predicted a continuing increase
in the rate of growth and decrease in
unemployment. Warning of a problem
of inflation, he asked that government
take action to slow the present boom.
His program consisted of four rec
ommendations: suspend the tax credit
on investment, increase the personal
income tax, increase the corporate in
come tax, and tighten the money sup
ply through the Federal Reserve
Board. Samuelson qualified these ree
commendations by pointing out that
they were based on present estimates
and unforeseen changes in the econ
omy may occur before the program
can be put into effect.
Although he agreed that the present
boom was a triumph for the New
Economics, Prof. Gurlcy warned of the
costs of the boom. He emphasized
that the increasing investment had
been obtained by tax credits to busi
ness, and that these were now pro
ducing excessive profits. The recent
anti-inflation measures such as restor
ing the excise tax and increasing so
cial security taxes have fallen most
heavily on the middle and lower
classes, he pointed out.
The term "Kennedy-Johnson boom"
brought an objection from Prof.
Howell, who thought "McNamara-Ho
boom" was more indicative of its
causes. He suggested that we decrease
government seconding as an anti-in
flation measure.
