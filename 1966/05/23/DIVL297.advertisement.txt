Watching Ralph's hand fly over the pages (his
hand acts as a pacer), yoU can't believe that he's
actually reading. He must be skimming.
But he's not.
Ralph Frey can read the average novel in a little
under 40 minutes. Once, while standing in a book
store, he read three complete novels before he was
asked to leave.
He studies between 1,500 to 2,000 words a minute,
and rarely dips below 1,000 wpm, even on the
toughest material.
Most significantly, however, is that he can com
prehend and recall what he's read aright down to
the details.
Ralph Frey is not a mental freak. Nor is he a
naturally fast reader. He learned this revolutionary
technique of rapid reading at the Evelyn Wood
Reading Dynamics Institute. He is one of more
than 10,000 graduates in the Ray Area.
Ralph was one of our better students. He started
the course at about 400 words a minute and
increased his rate 8 times. Our average student
begins at about 300 words a minute and works up
to speeds over 1,500 words a minute.
You can do this, too!
"Reading dynamically," says Ralph, "means that
I can cover both the required and the suggested
reading for a course during the first month of the
semester. That leaves time for more extracurricular
activities. On the weekend before an exam, I've
reread several complete texts."
You may not learn to read quite as fast as Ralph
Frey (and then again you might!), but the
nationally known Reading Dynamics Institute
guarantees that you'll at least triple your reading
speed with good comprehension or receive a full
tuition refund.
.lust to show you that Ralph Frey is not unique,
here are the beginning and ending speeds of high
school and college students in the Hay Area.
