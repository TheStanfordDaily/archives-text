The technique of dynamic reading was
discovered by a Utah schoolteacher.
Evelyn Wood first observed dynamic reading 18
years ago when a universitv professor read her
term paper at an amazing 6,000 words a minute.
Mrs. Wood's curiosity caused her to look for other
exceptional readers, and over the next few years,
she found 50 people who could read faster than
1,500 words a minute, with fine comprehension,
outstanding recall, and great reading satisfaction.
She was now sure it was possible to read faster
than anyone had thought, but the question of how
was not yet answered. It took 8 years of toil and
research, working with "natural" fast readers
before she developed a technique whereby average
students learn to read 3 to 10 times faster.
The first Reading Dynamics Institute was opened
in Washington, D. C. in September, 1959. Since
that time institutes have been opened in 61 cities
throughout the country, and national enrollment
for the course now tops 150,(XX).
Comprehension is stressed.
At a recent teacher training conference Mrs. Wood
emphasized that dynamic reading is nothing like
the skimming techniques commonly used in speed
reading courses. "You read five times faster," she
