Thousands of college students—in
cluding 800 at Stanford—took draft
deferment tests around the country
Saturday as sporatic demonstrations
against the Selective Service System
—and reaction to them—continued
across the nation.
Officials conducting Saturday's tests
said they were baffled by the low
turnouts in some places. A University
of Missouri spokesman in Kansas City
suggested many students may have
stayed away after Lt. Gen. Lewis
Hershey, the Selective Service Direc
tor, told a reporter in Dallas that
there are enough nonstudents and
college dropouts to fill current mili
tary needs.
In Pittsburgh Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara yesterday de
fended—in the name of "freedom of
dissent" — campus protests against
U.S. policy in Vietnam even though
he said they give comfort to the en
emy.
"However much we may disagree
with some aspects of it, wo can be
genuinely proud that free discussion
is so vigorous on the American cam
pus today," McNamara said in a
speech prepared for commencement
ceremonies at Chatham College.
"Of course, there is a serious di
mension to the protest among some
students today," he said.
"But whatever comfort some of the
extremist protest may be giving our
enemies—and it is clear from Hanoi's
own statements that it is—let us be
perfectly clear about our principles
and our priorities.
"This is a antion in which the free
dom of dissent is absolutely funda
mental.
Concurrent with the Stanford sit

in, other protests continued across the
nation.
Some 40 students, faculty members
and priests staged a protest out
side the building where the tests were
held at St. Vincent's College, a Roman
Catholic liberal arts school in Latrobe,
Pa.
They carried signs, handed out
pamphlets and delivered speeches pro
testing against all war as immoral,
the war in Vietnam as not justified
and the Selective Service System as
unjust. The demonstration lasted sev
eral hours but there were no inci
dents.
In Chicago
Four Roosevelt University students
were arrested Friday night rather
than give up their sit-in post in a cam
paign against the school's draft in
formation policy.
The protesters contend the school
should not send class rankings to the
Selective Service, that no further de
ferment tests be given at the school
and that Roosevelt give them a "real
voice" in the making of policy deci
sions.
Roosevelt's acting president, Rolf
A. Weil, has said the protesters repre
sent a "tiny minority" of the school's
6,400 students and that he would not
allow the demonstrators to stop the
educational process at the school.
At Brooklyn Colleeg in New York,
a 24-hour sit-in was conducted against
use of the college's facilities for the
draft exams. Of the 275 students who
began the demonstration at the col
lege administration building, 75 were
on hand when it ended.
At Madison, Wis., a five-day student
demonstration against the University
of Wisconsin policy toward the draft
