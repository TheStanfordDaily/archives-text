# Draft Stirs Concerned Action Across Nation
## 'Mac' Defends Sit-ins, Rights; Protests Boom 
### 
Compiled From the AP
Thousands of college students—in
cluding 800 at Stanford—took draft
deferment tests around the country
Saturday as sporatic demonstrations
against the Selective Service System
—and reaction to them—continued
across the nation.
Officials conducting Saturday's tests
said they were baffled by the low
turnouts in some places. A University
of Missouri spokesman in Kansas City
suggested many students may have
stayed away after Lt. Gen. Lewis
Hershey, the Selective Service Direc
tor, told a reporter in Dallas that
there are enough nonstudents and
college dropouts to fill current mili
tary needs.
In Pittsburgh Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara yesterday de
fended—in the name of "freedom of
dissent" — campus protests against
U.S. policy in Vietnam even though
he said they give comfort to the en
emy.
"However much we may disagree
with some aspects of it, wo can be
genuinely proud that free discussion
is so vigorous on the American cam
pus today," McNamara said in a
speech prepared for commencement
ceremonies at Chatham College.
"Of course, there is a serious di
mension to the protest among some
students today," he said.
"But whatever comfort some of the
extremist protest may be giving our
enemies—and it is clear from Hanoi's
own statements that it is—let us be
perfectly clear about our principles
and our priorities.
"This is a antion in which the free
dom of dissent is absolutely funda
mental.
Concurrent with the Stanford sit

in, other protests continued across the
nation.
Some 40 students, faculty members
and priests staged a protest out
side the building where the tests were
held at St. Vincent's College, a Roman
Catholic liberal arts school in Latrobe,
Pa.
They carried signs, handed out
pamphlets and delivered speeches pro
testing against all war as immoral,
the war in Vietnam as not justified
and the Selective Service System as
unjust. The demonstration lasted sev
eral hours but there were no inci
dents.
In Chicago
Four Roosevelt University students
were arrested Friday night rather
than give up their sit-in post in a cam
paign against the school's draft in
formation policy.
The protesters contend the school
should not send class rankings to the
Selective Service, that no further de
ferment tests be given at the school
and that Roosevelt give them a "real
voice" in the making of policy deci
sions.
Roosevelt's acting president, Rolf
A. Weil, has said the protesters repre
sent a "tiny minority" of the school's
6,400 students and that he would not
allow the demonstrators to stop the
educational process at the school.
At Brooklyn Colleeg in New York,
a 24-hour sit-in was conducted against
use of the college's facilities for the
draft exams. Of the 275 students who
began the demonstration at the col
lege administration building, 75 were
on hand when it ended.
At Madison, Wis., a five-day student
demonstration against the University
of Wisconsin policy toward the draft
ended quietly with students pledging
to continue a camapign to persuade
the faculty to approve a change in
the practice of furnishing class rank
to draft boards.

In Long Beach, Calif., about 25 dem
onstrators unfurled banners protest
ing the Vietnam War as President
Johnson began addressing the United
Auto Workers Convention by tele
phone from Washington.
For students who fear their draft
notices are near, there were reassur
ing words from the director of the
Selective Service System.
Lt. Gen. Lewis Hershey said very
few if any college students will be
drafted unless the monthly quota
jumps over 30,000 men. He said non
students and college dropouts are in
sufficient number to fill current mili
tary needs.
Boy Scout Meeting
Hershey, in Dallas to attend the an
nual meeting of the National Council
of the Boy Scouts of America, made
his remarks to a Dallas Times Herald
reporter.
He said college students are not de
ferred because they have "any in
herent right or special quality come
down from heaven," but rather be
cause colleegs must plan for the fu
ture manpower needs of society.
Selective Service assumes that a col
lege graduate will make a more pro
ductive citizen than the non-graduate,
Hershey said, adding that this is the
basis the agency must go on.
"Considering how long it takes to
train a professional man, and since
we don't know how many doctors, for
instance, we'll need 15 years from
now, we must consider the importance
of the students who will eventually
graduate," Hershey said.
'What?'
"What we're trying to determine (in
testing and evaluations) is, who in
school is not likely to finish school;
because if they're not going to finish,
then what are they doing there?"

He said college students are not de

herent right or special quality come
down from heaven," but rather be
cause colleegs must plan for the fu

Selective Service assumes that a col

Hershey said, adding that this is the
basis the agency must go on.
"Considering how long it takes to
train a professional man, and since
we don't know how many doctors, for

now, we must consider the importance
of the students who will eventually
graduate," Hershey said.

Thousands of college students—in
cluding 800 at Stanford—took draft
deferment tests around the country
Saturday as sporatic demonstrations
against the Selective Service System
—and reaction to them—continued
across the nation.
Officials conducting Saturday's tests
said they were baffled by the low
turnouts in some places. A University
of Missouri spokesman in Kansas City
suggested many students may have
stayed away after Lt. Gen. Lewis
Hershey, the Selective Service Direc
tor, told a reporter in Dallas that
there are enough nonstudents and
college dropouts to fill current mili

In Pittsburgh Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara yesterday de

U.S. policy in Vietnam even though
he said they give comfort to the en

"However much we may disagree
with some aspects of it, wo can be
genuinely proud that free discussion
is so vigorous on the American cam
pus today," McNamara said in a
speech prepared for commencement
ceremonies at Chatham College.
"Of course, there is a serious di
mension to the protest among some
students today," he said.
"But whatever comfort some of the
extremist protest may be giving our
enemies—and it is clear from Hanoi's
own statements that it is—let us be
perfectly clear about our principles
and our priorities.
"This is a antion in which the free

Concurrent with the Stanford sit

in, other protests continued across the
nation.
Some 40 students, faculty members
and priests staged a protest out
side the building where the tests were
held at St. Vincent's College, a Roman
Catholic liberal arts school in Latrobe,
Pa.
They carried signs, handed out
pamphlets and delivered speeches pro
testing against all war as immoral,
the war in Vietnam as not justified
and the Selective Service System as
unjust. The demonstration lasted sev

Four Roosevelt University students

Officials conducting Saturday's tests
said they were baffled by the low
turnouts in some places. A University

In Pittsburgh Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara yesterday de
fended—in the name of "freedom of
dissent" — campus protests against
U.S. policy in Vietnam even though
he said they give comfort to the en

"However much we may disagree
with some aspects of it, wo can be
genuinely proud that free discussion
is so vigorous on the American cam
pus today," McNamara said in a
speech prepared for commencement
ceremonies at Chatham College.
"Of course, there is a serious di
mension to the protest among some
students today," he said.
"But whatever comfort some of the
extremist protest may be giving our
enemies—and it is clear from Hanoi's
own statements that it is—let us be
perfectly clear about our principles
and our priorities.

Concurrent with the Stanford sit

in, other protests continued across the
nation.
Some 40 students, faculty members
and priests staged a protest out
side the building where the tests were
held at St. Vincent's College, a Roman
Catholic liberal arts school in Latrobe,
Pa.
They carried signs, handed out
pamphlets and delivered speeches pro
testing against all war as immoral,
the war in Vietnam as not justified
and the Selective Service System as
unjust. The demonstration lasted sev
eral hours but there were no inci
dents.
In Chicago
Four Roosevelt University students
were arrested Friday night rather
than give up their sit-in post in a cam
paign against the school's draft in
formation policy.
The protesters contend the school
should not send class rankings to the
Selective Service, that no further de
ferment tests be given at the school
and that Roosevelt give them a "real
voice" in the making of policy deci
sions.
Roosevelt's acting president, Rolf
A. Weil, has said the protesters repre
sent a "tiny minority" of the school's
6,400 students and that he would not
allow the demonstrators to stop the
educational process at the school.
At Brooklyn Colleeg in New York,
a 24-hour sit-in was conducted against
use of the college's facilities for the
draft exams. Of the 275 students who
began the demonstration at the col
lege administration building, 75 were
on hand when it ended.
At Madison, Wis., a five-day student
demonstration against the University
of Wisconsin policy toward the draft
ended quietly with students pledging
to continue a camapign to persuade
the faculty to approve a change in
the practice of furnishing class rank
to draft boards.

In Long Beach, Calif., about 25 dem
onstrators unfurled banners protest
ing the Vietnam War as President
Johnson began addressing the United
Auto Workers Convention by tele
phone from Washington.
For students who fear their draft
notices are near, there were reassur
ing words from the director of the
Selective Service System.
Lt. Gen. Lewis Hershey said very
few if any college students will be
drafted unless the monthly quota
jumps over 30,000 men. He said non
students and college dropouts are in
sufficient number to fill current mili
tary needs.
Boy Scout Meeting
Hershey, in Dallas to attend the an
nual meeting of the National Council
of the Boy Scouts of America, made
his remarks to a Dallas Times Herald
reporter.
He said college students are not de
ferred because they have "any in
herent right or special quality come
down from heaven," but rather be
cause colleegs must plan for the fu
ture manpower needs of society.
Selective Service assumes that a col
lege graduate will make a more pro
ductive citizen than the non-graduate,
Hershey said, adding that this is the
basis the agency must go on.
"Considering how long it takes to
train a professional man, and since
we don't know how many doctors, for
instance, we'll need 15 years from
now, we must consider the importance
of the students who will eventually
graduate," Hershey said.
'What?'
"What we're trying to determine (in
testing and evaluations) is, who in
school is not likely to finish school;
because if they're not going to finish,
then what are they doing there?"
