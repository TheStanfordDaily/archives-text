# Congress Set To Examine Draft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress
ional critics pressed Friday for an ex
haustive re-examination of the na
tion's military draft system. They
charged present procedures are incon
sistent, inequitable, discriminatory
and as outdated as the horse cavalry.
Two resolutions were introduced in
the House asking appointment of spe
cial investigating committees. In the
Senate, Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis.,
called upon the President to appoint
a commission to review the "many
inconsistencies and inequities" of the
draft.
The developments came as Penta
gon officials reported Secretary of
Defense Robert S. McNamara opposes
the idea of allowing service in the
Peace Corps or similar programs to be
accepted as a substitute for military
service.
McNamara Proposal
McNamara left this question unan
swered when he said in a Montreal
speech Wednesday that inequities in
the draft might be remedied "by ask
ing every young person in the United
States to give two years of service to
his country" in uniform, the Peace
Corps or other help-mankind pro
grams.
Some members of Congress said,
however, that alternatives to military
service should be considered. Among
the possibilities, they listed the Peace
Corps, hospital or slum work, urban
construction and conservation.
But in Dallas, Tex., Lt. Gen. Lewis
B. Ilershey, Selective Service director,
said he doubts Congress can be sold
on a plan that would substitute some
other form of service for military
duty.
"It's awfully hard to keep that
'something else' within reasonable
limits," Ilershey said. He declined
further comment on the resolutions,
saying similar proposals have been of
fered in the past. Horshey was in
Texas to accept a Boy Scout award.
Senate Support
In the Senate, Nelson drew support
from Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y., when he
introduced the resolution seeking a
draft review.
Javits said college deferments
should be abandoned because "mostly
poor guys are ending up in Vietnam."
Sen. Ernest Gruening, D-Alaska, said
the draft should be suspended until
the study is completed.

Rep. Donald Fraser, D-Minn., co
sponsor of one of the House resolu
tions, termed present draft laws" pa
tently discriminatory aaginst the poor
and uneducated." He said those who
don't have the money to go to college
stand a better chance of being drafted.
Rep. William E. Minshal, R-Ohio,
sponsor of the other resolution, said
the current system "no more fills to
day's military requirements than
would the horse cavalry, the 817 or
the Springfield rifle."
But Rep. L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
chairman of the House Armed Ser
vices Committee which normally
would handle an inquiry into the
draft, opposed the creation of sepcial
committees to take over the task.
Rivers said his committee would
yield its jurisdiction over Selective
Service for no one. He also said

Hershey had been invited to testify on
the "state of the health" of the draft
at an early date.
Universal Training
Sen. Richard B. Russell, D-Ga., Sat
urday called for six months of mili
tary training for all young Americans.
"Every youth, high or low, ought to
have six months of military training,"
said Russell, who is chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
"If we just had a lot system, letting
a man stick his hand in a glass jar
and pull out a number, it would be
fairer than the system we have now,"
he said.
"If I don't change my mind in the
next year, I will try to get it through
the Senate and see if we can't get it
through the House," he said.
Deferments
The present draft system allows de-

ferments to college students with good
grades, married men with children,
and young men who pass the new Se
lective Service Qualification Test.
Russell contended the present sys
tem "was not designed for a period of
peace, or even a limited war such as
we have in Vietnam."
"In this regard," Russell said. "I
have read with interest the suggestion
by the Secretary of Defense that every
young American give two years of
service to his country—either in the
military or in the Peace Corps or some
similar program.
"I have not seen the details of his
proposal, but I do not see how it could
be considered fair or equitable to
count two years of service in the
Peace Corps the same as two years of
service in Vietnam."
