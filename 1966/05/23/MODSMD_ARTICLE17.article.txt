# Goodman Speaks And Visits Sit-In

### SUSAN HUDGENS 
While students sitting in the Presi
dent's Office demanded a voice in the
University's decision-making process,
education critic Paul Goodman, speak
ing at Stanford, called for "decen
tralization of big-front organizations."
Goodman, brought in by the Free
University of Palo Alto, symphathized
with the protestors and spoke fre
quently to them during his stay. Be
fore his major address Friday after
noon, the author of "Compulsory Mis
education" and "A Community of
Scholars" spoke to the large crowd
in front of Sterlings' Office.
"The Government made a tremen
dous goof in asking for the test —
this is typical goof of the social engi
neers in Washington,"he told the dem
onstrators. "My son at Cornell is up
for expulsion because of the same
thing you're asking for."
Goodman, addressing a large group
at Memorial Auditorium, decried the
tendency of advanced countries to
ward "the organization of society by
social engineers where individuals are
processed to be useful cobs in that
machine." He compared the "critical
situation" to Orwell's "1984."
Young people today, he said, a r e
revolting against this "dehumanizing
process." "They sense a need for inter

personal relationships and feel sense
of community." «
"Often," Goodman remarked,
"young people form cults and live in
self-imposed poverty rather than try
to work in big machinery where they
can't have a say."
"They are also protesting against a
curious morality so prevalent in this
system. Young people prefer plain
honesty as opposed to the double-talk
essentially involved in big-front or
ganizations like the problem you have
here at Stanford." j
"This is also true with the govern
ment in Washington. 1984 depends on
this kind of double-talk."
The controversial liberal also com
mented that many young people sense
that "old standards, old values are
phony. They are willing to try other
ways. Improvisation is a major char
acteristic of the young generation.
And, of course, this is bad for the con
ditioning necessary to run 1984."
"We must try for decentralization.
Very many functions are better if
done on a smaller scale with inter
personal relationships. The question
is: 'Am I going to lead a life, or just
get well-paid and take orders.' "
"The young are in a peculiar posi
tion," he said. "You are in young aris
tocrats, what with technology and af

fluence. But, for the first time, the
dominant class (the middle class in
America) hasn't brought up its chil
dren to be free."
"They are subjected to slavery in
school, long hours. The system is a
capsule that all young people are
caught in for 16 years. The majority
aren't academic, but all have to go be
cause that's the way it's set up."
"The purpose of elementary school,"
Goodman claimed, "is babysitting. It's
the same way with higher education.
Only ten per cent need tarining to run
the economy, to keep the structure
going. But it's given to everybody to
keep them occupied and out of trou
ble."
As Goodman was about to go on to
the subject of free universities which
he said must "counter these tenden
cies," his speech was interrupted by
an erroneous announcement that the
demonstrators in the sit-in were going
to be thrown out. Following a request
by Bob Burroughs that people block
the arches surrounding the President's
Office, Goodman asked the audience
to leave, and followed them to the sit
in.
Goodman remained at Stanford Fri
day night and Saturday, frequently
talking with leaders of the demon
stration and giving encouragement to
protestors.
