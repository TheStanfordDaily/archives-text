# Civ Is Often Super, But Frosh Still Urge Changes
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
(Editor's note: The following
article concludes a series de
signed to evaluate student and
faculty opinions of the Western
Civ program.)

Whether they respond "I love
it!" or "It's torture!" to the
mention of Civ, most students
feel it can be improved.
Freshman Jim McNish sug
gested changing the course into
an introductory humanities or
social science course for physical
science majors, with social sci
ence and humanities students
being offered "a different course
oriented toward their interests."
Another boy suggested, "I
think they should experiment

one year, have the first quarter
a general introduction followed
by the option of a branch em
phasizing history and one em
phasizing philosophy."
Civ Instructor Jacqueline
Strain noted that there is "too
much overlap" between Civ and
courses such as the Humanities
60 series, beginning courses in
social sciences, and freshman
English. "We need more coop
eration, especially between Eng
lish and Civ. Possibly a group
of students could have the same
English and Civ instructors. It
would improve the exam situa
tion. I could grade them for his
tory, and the English teacher for
composition."

Instructor Donald Buck sug
gested that "the only way to
really alleviate the problems of
overlap and a heavy reading
load would be to overhaul the
whole freshman program, to
maybe integrate two or three
courses. Ideally, Civ would be a
two-year course. It already is in
some institutions."
A Wilbur freshman agreed,
stating, "I'd like to see the
course be compulsory for two
years. You can't cover all this
material in so little time."
The Roble survey, modeled af
ter the scratch sheet and de
signed espec!ally to evaluate
methods of teaching Civ, asked
students to rate their instruc
tors in ten categories. Instruc
tors were rated highest in the
areas "is clear and understand
able in his explanations" and
"inspires class confidence in his
knowledge of the subject," low
est in "has motivated me to do
my best work" and "gets me in
terested in the subject."
One suggestion for improving
teaching was "to stimulate dis
cussions by handing out specific
questions to think about while
doing the reading and preparing
for class."

Freshman Jenny Fricker add
ed, "There's too much pressure
to discuss in many classes." An
other freshman, Ned Wight,
continued, "The total discussion
and reading approach is poor;
there should be more of a varie
ty in programming."
Freshman John Bergholt sug
gested that more independent
study be made available for low
Band C students. "Many stu
dents of average Stanford abili
ty are still easily capable of
benefitting from self - directed
work," he explained, "and to
quelch red-hotness in a student
just because he writes a poor
final or doesn't talk seems un
fair."
The complaint was "not that
these programs are bad; it just
seems unfair; Some 'super civ'
classes, especially, involve much
more work than others."
In answer to the "unfair"
charge, Dr. David Savage ex
plained, "That idea indicates a
viewpoint based on competition.
The wiser viewpoint is to eval
uate and value your own experi
ence for what it is."
He continued, "In general, it's
best to allow instructors con
siderable freedom in both the
formal organization of the class
and in the subject matter. If we

tried to put all the instructors
in a mold, some of them
wouldn't fit."
The idea of independent sec
tions, or "super civ," has proved
popular with most students who
are participating. "It's great . . .
should be extended to more peo
ple," is a typical response to
mention of "super civ." The
most common complaint is, "I'd
like to take it, but it's just too
much reading for only one more
unit."
The possibility of ungraded or
"pass-fail" grading in Civ is an
other frequently proposed topic.
According to Dr. Savage, the
University has authorized the
Civ department to try the sys
tem if the department wishes to
next year. It was also authorized
for this year, he added.
A meeting of Civ instructors
will be held later this week to
discuss the idea, explained Dr."
Savage. He added that he sees
"a strong possibility for an ex
periment in deferred grades next
year."
Opinion of "pass-fail" varies.
Freshman David Leedy observed
that "ungraded Civ could be a
good idea, but the kids would
take too much advantage of it."
Steve Textor continued, "There's
a tendency to kiss off anyway."

Instructor Douglas Wood em
phasized the idea of written re
ports by instructors, adding that
pass-fail would be more work
for instructors," but that he per
sonally felt the idea was excel
lent.
According to John Bergholt,
"It's unfeasible at thi6 time. No
instructor will ever fail a stu
dent. How many F's have you
heard of in Civ?"
According to Dr. Savage, next
year's Civ program will be very

similar to this year's, with con
centration again on reading and
discussion supplemented by lec
tures autumn and winter quar
ters. One change definitely ap
proved for next year is some sec
tions meeting two instead of
three times per week for a pe
riod and a half each time. The
syllabus is undergoing its annual
revision, but no major changes
are expected. "Pass-fail" results
will be announced later.
