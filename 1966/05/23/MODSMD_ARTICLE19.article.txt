# Cards Place Fourth Behind Bruin Blitz In Track Finals
## 
### 
Friday's high hopes were
brought down to earth Saturday
as Cardinal trackment, in a suc
cession of frustrating "almosts,"
had to settle for fourth place in
the AAWU track and field finals
in gusty Stanford Stadium.
Several good performances in
Friday's preliminaries appeared
to have put third place, and pos
sibly second, within Stanford's
reach; but the Cards, despite two
heat winners and a field event
leader in the prelims, couldn't
get a first place in Saturday's
finals, and wound up behind
UCLA, USC, and Oregon.
The Bruins, as expected, rolled
to their first AAWU title with
80 points to USC's 44, Oregon's
37, and Stanford's 32.
Heat Wins
The closest Payton Jordan's
team got to the winner's circle
was in the 100, in which Larry
Quested and Donn Forbes, the
latter running his best time
ever, clocked 9.6's to win both
heats.
In the finals, Forbes started
well, but Tom Jones of UCLA
took the lead midway, with
Questad Just behind. It was
close, but the Bruin junior hung
on in 9.5, running into a 4.4 mph
wind.
Questad was given 9.6, and
Forbes, who wound up fourth
back of UCLA's Norm Jackson,
was caught in 9.7.
Jones came back to lead a

Westwood avalanche in the 220
in 21.0, as he and teammates
Ron Copeland and Bob Frey
went 1-2-3. Questad, off cautious
ly after one false start, appeared
to stumble slightly coming off
the turn and finished fourth.
Earlier, a strong anchor leg
by Questad brought Stanford
home second behind UCLA in
the 440 relay. The Bruins ran a
meet record 40.3, while Stanford
had a record tying 40.9.
Form Holds
It was a good day for form
players, as upsets were scarce.
Outside of Jones' sprint double,
the only reversals came in the
high hurdles, in which USC's
Earl McCullough edged favored
Ron Copeland of UCLA in 14.0
in the day's lone photo finish,
and in the long jump, where
Oregon State's Tony Albin
jumped 24-7V2, seven inches far
ther than his best this year, to
win.
The long jump proved a ma
jor disappointment to Stanford
fans in the crowd of about 6000,
as Craig Vaughin, the AAWU's
leader going in with a best of
24-SV&, had an off day Friday
and failed to qualify for the six
man finals.
Bud Walsh, the Cards' other
entry, jumped good
enough in most dual meets this
year but not against seasonal
bests by Albin and Cal's Jim
Kennedy (23-10 %).

Despite eight new meet rec
ords, times and distances were
generally a bit below expecta
tions possibly because of the
wind.
WSU's Gerry Lindgren, run
ning by himself for the last mile
and a half, was well off a hoped
for world record in the three
mile at 13:12.8; Oregon's Neal
Steinhauer, though also setting
a meet record, was well back of
his best with a 63-8% shotput.
USC dominated the middle dis
tances, going 1-2 in the 880 with
Dennis Carr clocking a stadium
record 1:47.8, and 1-3 in the mile,
with Bruce Bess running a meet
record 4:02.4.
Bruins Best
UCLA quarter-milers were su
preme, as Bob Frey led a 1-3
finish in 46.4, and the mile relay
team clocked a meet record
3:09.3.
Stanford picked up two sec
onds and two thirds in the field
events, as Bob Stoecker, who led
the prelims, lost the dicus by a
foot to USC's Gary Carlsen, who
threw 184-8 ; George Porter
placed a surprising third in the
javelin at and Jim
Eshelman and Chuck Smith
went 2-3 in the vault, with Eshel
man clearing the same height as
Bruin Marc Savage, a meet rec
ord 16-1, but placing second be
cause of two misses at fifteen
feet.


Stanford's Larry Questad is barely beaten to the tape by UCLA's
Tom Jones in the finals of the 10<) yard dash in the AAYVU meet.
Jones was clocked in 9.5, Questad in 0.6.

mile at 13:12.8; Oregon's Neal
Steinhauer, though also setting
a meet record, was well back of
his best with a 63-8% shotput.
USC dominated the middle dis
tances, going 1-2 in the 880 with
Dennis Carr clocking a stadium
record 1:47.8, and 1-3 in the mile,
with Bruce Bess running a meet
record 4:02.4.
Bruins Best
UCLA quarter-milers were su
preme, as Bob Frey led a 1-3
finish in 46.4, and the mile relay
team clocked a meet record
3:09.3.
Stanford picked up two sec
onds and two thirds in the field
events, as Bob Stoecker, who led
the prelims, lost the dicus by a
foot to USC's Gary Carlsen, who
threw 184-8 ; George Porter
placed a surprising third in the
javelin at and Jim
Eshelman and Chuck Smith
went 2-3 in the vault, with Eshel
man clearing the same height as
Bruin Marc Savage, a meet rec
ord 16-1, but placing second be
cause of two misses at fifteen
feet.


Stanford's Larry Questad is barely beaten to the tape by UCLA's
Tom Jones in the finals of the 10<) yard dash in the AAYVU meet.
Jones was clocked in 9.5, Questad in 0.6.
Friday's high hopes were
brought down to earth Saturday
as Cardinal trackment, in a suc
cession of frustrating "almosts,"
had to settle for fourth place in
the AAWU track and field finals
in gusty Stanford Stadium.
Several good performances in
Friday's preliminaries appeared
to have put third place, and pos
sibly second, within Stanford's
reach; but the Cards, despite two
heat winners and a field event
leader in the prelims, couldn't
get a first place in Saturday's
finals, and wound up behind
UCLA, USC, and Oregon.
The Bruins, as expected, rolled
to their first AAWU title with
80 points to USC's 44, Oregon's
37, and Stanford's 32.
Heat Wins
The closest Payton Jordan's
team got to the winner's circle
was in the 100, in which Larry
Quested and Donn Forbes, the
latter running his best time
ever, clocked 9.6's to win both
heats.
In the finals, Forbes started
well, but Tom Jones of UCLA
took the lead midway, with
Questad Just behind. It was
close, but the Bruin junior hung
on in 9.5, running into a 4.4 mph
wind.
Questad was given 9.6, and
Forbes, who wound up fourth
back of UCLA's Norm Jackson,
was caught in 9.7.
Jones came back to lead a

Westwood avalanche in the 220
in 21.0, as he and teammates
Ron Copeland and Bob Frey
went 1-2-3. Questad, off cautious
ly after one false start, appeared
to stumble slightly coming off
the turn and finished fourth.
Earlier, a strong anchor leg
by Questad brought Stanford
home second behind UCLA in
the 440 relay. The Bruins ran a
meet record 40.3, while Stanford
had a record tying 40.9.
Form Holds
It was a good day for form
players, as upsets were scarce.
Outside of Jones' sprint double,
the only reversals came in the
high hurdles, in which USC's
Earl McCullough edged favored
Ron Copeland of UCLA in 14.0
in the day's lone photo finish,
and in the long jump, where
Oregon State's Tony Albin
jumped 24-7V2, seven inches far
ther than his best this year, to
win.
The long jump proved a ma
jor disappointment to Stanford
fans in the crowd of about 6000,
as Craig Vaughin, the AAWU's
leader going in with a best of
24-SV&, had an off day Friday
and failed to qualify for the six
man finals.
Bud Walsh, the Cards' other
entry, jumped good
enough in most dual meets this
year but not against seasonal
bests by Albin and Cal's Jim
Kennedy (23-10 %).

Despite eight new meet rec
ords, times and distances were
generally a bit below expecta
tions possibly because of the
wind.
WSU's Gerry Lindgren, run
ning by himself for the last mile
and a half, was well off a hoped

by Questad brought Stanford
home second behind UCLA in
the 440 relay. The Bruins ran a
meet record 40.3, while Stanford
had a record tying 40.9.
Form Holds
It was a good day for form
players, as upsets were scarce.
Outside of Jones' sprint double,
the only reversals came in the
high hurdles, in which USC's
Earl McCullough edged favored
Ron Copeland of UCLA in 14.0
in the day's lone photo finish,
and in the long jump, where
Oregon State's Tony Albin
jumped 24-7V2, seven inches far
ther than his best this year, to
win.
The long jump proved a ma
jor disappointment to Stanford
fans in the crowd of about 6000,
as Craig Vaughin, the AAWU's
leader going in with a best of
24-SV&, had an off day Friday
and failed to qualify for the six
man finals.
Bud Walsh, the Cards' other
entry, jumped good
enough in most dual meets this
year but not against seasonal
bests by Albin and Cal's Jim
Kennedy (23-10 %).

Despite eight new meet rec
ords, times and distances were
generally a bit below expecta
tions possibly because of the
wind.
WSU's Gerry Lindgren, run
ning by himself for the last mile
and a half, was well off a hoped
for world record in the three
mile at 13:12.8; Oregon's Neal
Steinhauer, though also setting
a meet record, was well back of
his best with a 63-8% shotput.
USC dominated the middle dis
tances, going 1-2 in the 880 with
Dennis Carr clocking a stadium
record 1:47.8, and 1-3 in the mile,
with Bruce Bess running a meet
record 4:02.4.
Bruins Best
UCLA quarter-milers were su
preme, as Bob Frey led a 1-3
finish in 46.4, and the mile relay
team clocked a meet record
3:09.3.
Stanford picked up two sec
onds and two thirds in the field
events, as Bob Stoecker, who led
the prelims, lost the dicus by a
foot to USC's Gary Carlsen, who
threw 184-8 ; George Porter
placed a surprising third in the
javelin at and Jim
Eshelman and Chuck Smith
went 2-3 in the vault, with Eshel
man clearing the same height as
Bruin Marc Savage, a meet rec
ord 16-1, but placing second be
cause of two misses at fifteen
feet.


Stanford's Larry Questad is barely beaten to the tape by UCLA's
Tom Jones in the finals of the 10<) yard dash in the AAYVU meet.
Jones was clocked in 9.5, Questad in 0.6.
Friday's high hopes were
brought down to earth Saturday
as Cardinal trackment, in a suc
cession of frustrating "almosts,"
had to settle for fourth place in
the AAWU track and field finals
in gusty Stanford Stadium.
Several good performances in
Friday's preliminaries appeared
to have put third place, and pos
sibly second, within Stanford's
reach; but the Cards, despite two
heat winners and a field event
leader in the prelims, couldn't
get a first place in Saturday's
finals, and wound up behind
UCLA, USC, and Oregon.
The Bruins, as expected, rolled
to their first AAWU title with
80 points to USC's 44, Oregon's
37, and Stanford's 32.
Heat Wins
The closest Payton Jordan's
team got to the winner's circle
was in the 100, in which Larry
Quested and Donn Forbes, the
latter running his best time
ever, clocked 9.6's to win both
heats.
In the finals, Forbes started
well, but Tom Jones of UCLA
took the lead midway, with
Questad Just behind. It was
close, but the Bruin junior hung
on in 9.5, running into a 4.4 mph
wind.
Questad was given 9.6, and
Forbes, who wound up fourth
back of UCLA's Norm Jackson,
was caught in 9.7.
Jones came back to lead a

Westwood avalanche in the 220
in 21.0, as he and teammates
Ron Copeland and Bob Frey
went 1-2-3. Questad, off cautious
ly after one false start, appeared
to stumble slightly coming off
the turn and finished fourth.
Earlier, a strong anchor leg

home second behind UCLA in
