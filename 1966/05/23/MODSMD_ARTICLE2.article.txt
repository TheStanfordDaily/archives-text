# Quiet Atmosphere Belies Tension; Nerves On Edge In 'The Inner City'
## 'Out!' 
### WENDY WEINER BOB FISHMAN 
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White
Memorial Flaza. Speakers will
be members of the protesting
group. The rally, according to
spokesmen for the group, will
be concerned with the facts of
the sit-in and its issues, includ
ing the Selective Service tests
and a possbile confrontation
with President Sterling.

"This is the didactic radio station,
KSCPV, broadcasting from the Inner
City," said Jeff Lewin. Lewin was
self-appointed disk jockey at a dance

held Friday night in the lobby of
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Attending were 27 active individuals
who had stayed for the party when
the University Administration ordered
a cease to the influx of protesters into
Building 10 of Inner Quad. Those in
side at 12:30 p.m. were informed that
if they left they forfeited their oppor
tunity to return in time to attend that
night's discoteque.
Attendance at the party by sym
pathizers outside was strongly dis
couraged by strategically placed mem
bers of the Stanford Police Force.
It was noted by several of the
guests, however, that between 12:30
and midnight, approximately eight
party crashers entered Building 10
through an office window, which was
nailed shut just after the witching
hour.
The scene had been quite different
the night before. From 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. the reception room of Building
10 was filled with over 100 students
loudly debating the tactics and ethics
of their actions. The crowd overflowed
into the corridors until people had to
look in the windows to see what was
going on.
Inside the building, students sitting
beneath an oil portrait of little Leland
argued about the purposes and goals
of the University.
"We demand the right to make the
decisions that affect our ilves," said
one undergrad. "'Who's making the
decisions' is the primary question we
have to answer."
At 1:03 a.m. Friday morning it was
finally decided that the draft test was
indeed a "life and death matter" and
a statement was approved by a voice
vote.
Immediately after the vote was
taken, ASSU President-elect Dave

Harris and several students rushed
into the room with pizzas which they
distributed to the protestors.
The meeting then broke up into sev
eral small groups arguing among
themselves about such topics as the
draft test, conscription, Vietnam, the
purpose of education, and the purpose
of life.
"They should open the President's
office every night," one student com
mented. "It's a great place to go after
the Union closes."
A Stanford policeman kept watch
throughout the night, but made no
move to interfere. Both doors re
mained open and demonstrators came
and went as they pleased."
Most of the sleepers were up by
dawn, in time to greet the secretaries
who arrived promptly at 8 a.m. Fri
day morning. The secretaries stared at
the demonstrators but said nothing,
although one secretary seemed sur
prised to find a student sleeping under
her desk.
The students were soon joined by
reporters, photographers, and camera
men who took flash pictures and
stuck microphones in people's faces.
And, at 9 a.m., a group of 100 "anti
pacifist" picketers began to parade
around outside Building 10.
They carried signs that read "Sup
port President Sterling," "Academic
Freedom AND Responsibility," and
"Oppose Anarchy."
By 11 a.m. a large crowd of stu
dents, faculty, and staff had gathered
in Inner Quad to watch the sit-in and
the picketers. Television cameras,
newspaper photographers and Stan
ford policemen added variety to the
crowd.
"Gosh, this is exciting," commented
one frosh dolly.


At nine o'clock Friday morning, some
75 anti-demonstration pickets showed
up outside President Sterling's office.
Many stayed 'til noon to cheer Dean
Itol>ert J. Wert's statement of the Ad
ministration's stand.
Shortly after noon, Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
entered the lobby and informed the
demonstrators they were in violation
of University regulations which states
demonstrations "shall not be held
within University buildings while
University functions are in progress
therein."
"The University will now institute
its normal judicial proceedings," Wert
said. University spokesmen said the
names of the protesters would be
turned over to the student judicial
councils.

Wert went to the door of the lobby
and reread his statement for the newts
media. He reaffirmed President Ster
ling's willingness to meet with repre
sentatives of the draft protest group,
which Sterling outlined in his letter
to the Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, dated May 18.
He said such a meeting could take
place only "with a small group of Stu
dents and Faculty," and only if it were
not held under duress.
Cheers of Support
When Wert announced the Univer
sity's intention to administer the Se
lective Service exam as scheduled the
crowd gave a cheer. He concluded the
prepared statement, "The University
intends to follow its policy on demon
stration and its normal disciplinary
procedures on this and other occa
sions." The partisan crowd cheered
again as he finished.
As Wert left the building, Stanford
police sealed the office allowing no
one to enter. Some of the would-be
protesters were caught outside and
were refused permission to re-enter.
The demonstrators proposed a se
ries of compromises through Associ
ate Dean of Students Joel Smith for
various guarantees of an open meet
ing if the sit-in were called off.
Smith flatly told the demonstrators
the University was "simply not pre
pared to bargain." All compromises
involving a form of guarantee were
rejected by Sterling.
Later in the afternoon, Smith told
the group, "It is absolutely impossible
for you people to gain any concession
as a result of a sit-in." Instead he sug
gested they accept the "strong possi
bility" that the Administration would
provide an open meeting of the form
the demonstrators were proposing.
No Guarantees
However, Smith stressed, "Neither
I nor any official of the University
can give you any guarantees."
Smith allowed David Harris, stu
dent body president-elect, to enter the
building and discuss the situation
with the demonstrators. Harris said,
"As a group, you have made the point,
not the big point about the draft test,
but about public concern." Harris
spent the afternoon working as a me
diator, but the group found no accept
able solution.
Viewing the scene of demonstration
and counter - demonstration Friday
morning, /Harris told The Daily, "I
think the whole thing has turned into
a circus." He believed the draft pro
testers "could have used much better
tactics."
Yet the student body president
thought the demonstrations were
"roughly a good thing. I like to see
people concerned."
By mid-afternoon Friday the dem
onstrators showed signs of flagging.
Talking in terms of a "diplomatic leap
of faith," they were on the verge of
leaving the President's office, but
they were unable to reach agreement
on the contents of their statement of
capitulation.
Goodman Lends Support
The appearance of education critic
Paul Goodman, who was on campus
to give a lecture, was cheered by the
draft protesters and seem to renew
their will to stay.
Several members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
told the protesters they would recom
mend a meeting of student and facul
ty committees to discuss the draft is
sue and classified contracts.
The protesters had earlier accused
the Academic Council of procrastina
tion and irresponsibility for referring
consideration of the University policy
in both areas to committee
when the Council met last Tuesday.
Professor Kenneth Arrow, secretary
of the Executive Committee, told the
protesters students would be involved
in the Academic Council's considera
tion of University compliance with
the Selective Service System. "Th e
only question is the form of consulta
tion," he said.

"The substitution of a small group
like this violates the spirit of non-vio
lence and democratic process," Arrow
told the sit-indemonstrators.
In a reply to Arrow's remarks the
protesters drafted a statement late
Friday night which urged Arrow and
the rest of the Executive Committee
to call upon President Sterling to ini
tiate an open meeting.
The Executive Committee was un
able to convene Friday for want of a
quorum. But four members of the
committee, as individuals, urged the
draft protesters "to terminate your
defiance of University regulations."
The note drawn up Saturday morn
ing was signed by Arrow, Gordon
Wright, Albert Guerard, and Herbert
L. Packer.
"As several of us assured you at
various times during the day yester
day, the Executive Committee is plan
ning to hold open hearings on the sub
jects which have been referred to it
by the Academic Council,"the four
professors wrote.
"Unless you disbelieve these assur
ances, there is no 'impasse'."
The demonstrators passed their sec
ond night in Sterling's office with no
incident. University officials allowed
friends to bring the demonstrators
food and soft drinks throughout the
confinement.
Late Saturday morning the pro
testers agreed to give up the sit-in.
Kenny Washington told The Dally the
group had gained all it could through
sit-in tactics, a"nd that it was time to
use new measures.
The group's formal statement said
the protesters had decided to end the
sit-in "of our own free will, choosing
this kind of withdrawal in the belief
that this would strengthen our future
struggle for our just demands."
"We have come to protest the moral
callousness of the administration
which chose to comply with a dis
criminatory conscription policy," the
statement continued.
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White

indeed a "life and death matter" and
a statement was approved by a voice
vote.
Immediately after the vote was
taken, ASSU President-elect Dave

Harris and several students rushed
into the room with pizzas which they
distributed to the protestors.
The meeting then broke up into sev
eral small groups arguing among
themselves about such topics as the
draft test, conscription, Vietnam, the
purpose of education, and the purpose
of life.
"They should open the President's
office every night," one student com
mented. "It's a great place to go after
the Union closes."
A Stanford policeman kept watch
throughout the night, but made no
move to interfere. Both doors re
mained open and demonstrators came
and went as they pleased."
Most of the sleepers were up by
dawn, in time to greet the secretaries
who arrived promptly at 8 a.m. Fri
day morning. The secretaries stared at
the demonstrators but said nothing,
although one secretary seemed sur
prised to find a student sleeping under
her desk.
The students were soon joined by
reporters, photographers, and camera
men who took flash pictures and
stuck microphones in people's faces.
And, at 9 a.m., a group of 100 "anti
pacifist" picketers began to parade
around outside Building 10.
They carried signs that read "Sup
port President Sterling," "Academic
Freedom AND Responsibility," and
"Oppose Anarchy."
By 11 a.m. a large crowd of stu
dents, faculty, and staff had gathered
in Inner Quad to watch the sit-in and
the picketers. Television cameras,
newspaper photographers and Stan
ford policemen added variety to the
crowd.
"Gosh, this is exciting," commented
one frosh dolly.


At nine o'clock Friday morning, some
75 anti-demonstration pickets showed
up outside President Sterling's office.
Many stayed 'til noon to cheer Dean
Itol>ert J. Wert's statement of the Ad
ministration's stand.
Shortly after noon, Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
entered the lobby and informed the
demonstrators they were in violation
of University regulations which states
demonstrations "shall not be held
within University buildings while
University functions are in progress
therein."
"The University will now institute
its normal judicial proceedings," Wert
said. University spokesmen said the
names of the protesters would be
turned over to the student judicial
councils.

Wert went to the door of the lobby
and reread his statement for the newts
media. He reaffirmed President Ster
ling's willingness to meet with repre
sentatives of the draft protest group,
which Sterling outlined in his letter
to the Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, dated May 18.
He said such a meeting could take
place only "with a small group of Stu
dents and Faculty," and only if it were
not held under duress.
Cheers of Support
When Wert announced the Univer
sity's intention to administer the Se
lective Service exam as scheduled the
crowd gave a cheer. He concluded the
prepared statement, "The University
intends to follow its policy on demon
stration and its normal disciplinary
procedures on this and other occa
sions." The partisan crowd cheered
again as he finished.
As Wert left the building, Stanford
police sealed the office allowing no
one to enter. Some of the would-be
protesters were caught outside and
were refused permission to re-enter.
The demonstrators proposed a se
ries of compromises through Associ
ate Dean of Students Joel Smith for
various guarantees of an open meet
ing if the sit-in were called off.
Smith flatly told the demonstrators
the University was "simply not pre
pared to bargain." All compromises
involving a form of guarantee were
rejected by Sterling.
Later in the afternoon, Smith told
the group, "It is absolutely impossible
for you people to gain any concession
as a result of a sit-in." Instead he sug
gested they accept the "strong possi
bility" that the Administration would
provide an open meeting of the form
the demonstrators were proposing.
No Guarantees
However, Smith stressed, "Neither
I nor any official of the University
can give you any guarantees."
Smith allowed David Harris, stu
dent body president-elect, to enter the
building and discuss the situation
with the demonstrators. Harris said,
"As a group, you have made the point,
not the big point about the draft test,
but about public concern." Harris
spent the afternoon working as a me
diator, but the group found no accept
able solution.
Viewing the scene of demonstration
and counter - demonstration Friday
morning, /Harris told The Daily, "I
think the whole thing has turned into
a circus." He believed the draft pro
testers "could have used much better
tactics."
Yet the student body president
thought the demonstrations were
"roughly a good thing. I like to see
people concerned."
By mid-afternoon Friday the dem
onstrators showed signs of flagging.
Talking in terms of a "diplomatic leap
of faith," they were on the verge of
leaving the President's office, but
they were unable to reach agreement
on the contents of their statement of
capitulation.
Goodman Lends Support
The appearance of education critic
Paul Goodman, who was on campus
to give a lecture, was cheered by the
draft protesters and seem to renew
their will to stay.
Several members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
told the protesters they would recom
mend a meeting of student and facul
ty committees to discuss the draft is
sue and classified contracts.
The protesters had earlier accused
the Academic Council of procrastina
tion and irresponsibility for referring
consideration of the University policy
in both areas to committee
when the Council met last Tuesday.
Professor Kenneth Arrow, secretary
of the Executive Committee, told the
protesters students would be involved
in the Academic Council's considera
tion of University compliance with
the Selective Service System. "Th e
only question is the form of consulta
tion," he said.

"The substitution of a small group
like this violates the spirit of non-vio
lence and democratic process," Arrow
told the sit-indemonstrators.
In a reply to Arrow's remarks the
protesters drafted a statement late
Friday night which urged Arrow and
the rest of the Executive Committee
to call upon President Sterling to ini
tiate an open meeting.
The Executive Committee was un
able to convene Friday for want of a
quorum. But four members of the
committee, as individuals, urged the
draft protesters "to terminate your
defiance of University regulations."
The note drawn up Saturday morn
ing was signed by Arrow, Gordon
Wright, Albert Guerard, and Herbert
L. Packer.
"As several of us assured you at
various times during the day yester
day, the Executive Committee is plan
ning to hold open hearings on the sub
jects which have been referred to it
by the Academic Council,"the four
professors wrote.
"Unless you disbelieve these assur
ances, there is no 'impasse'."
The demonstrators passed their sec
ond night in Sterling's office with no
incident. University officials allowed
friends to bring the demonstrators
food and soft drinks throughout the
confinement.
Late Saturday morning the pro
testers agreed to give up the sit-in.
Kenny Washington told The Dally the
group had gained all it could through
sit-in tactics, a"nd that it was time to
use new measures.
The group's formal statement said
the protesters had decided to end the
sit-in "of our own free will, choosing
this kind of withdrawal in the belief
that this would strengthen our future
struggle for our just demands."
"We have come to protest the moral
callousness of the administration
which chose to comply with a dis
criminatory conscription policy," the
statement continued.
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White
Memorial Flaza. Speakers will
be members of the protesting
group. The rally, according to
spokesmen for the group, will
be concerned with the facts of
the sit-in and its issues, includ
ing the Selective Service tests
and a possbile confrontation
with President Sterling.

"This is the didactic radio station,
KSCPV, broadcasting from the Inner
City," said Jeff Lewin. Lewin was
self-appointed disk jockey at a dance

held Friday night in the lobby of
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Attending were 27 active individuals
who had stayed for the party when
the University Administration ordered
a cease to the influx of protesters into
Building 10 of Inner Quad. Those in
side at 12:30 p.m. were informed that
if they left they forfeited their oppor
tunity to return in time to attend that
night's discoteque.
Attendance at the party by sym
pathizers outside was strongly dis
couraged by strategically placed mem
bers of the Stanford Police Force.
It was noted by several of the
guests, however, that between 12:30
and midnight, approximately eight
party crashers entered Building 10
through an office window, which was
nailed shut just after the witching
hour.
The scene had been quite different
the night before. From 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. the reception room of Building
10 was filled with over 100 students
loudly debating the tactics and ethics
of their actions. The crowd overflowed
into the corridors until people had to
look in the windows to see what was
going on.
Inside the building, students sitting
beneath an oil portrait of little Leland
argued about the purposes and goals
of the University.
"We demand the right to make the
decisions that affect our ilves," said
one undergrad. "'Who's making the
decisions' is the primary question we
have to answer."
At 1:03 a.m. Friday morning it was

within University buildings while
University functions are in progress
therein."
"The University will now institute
its normal judicial proceedings," Wert
said. University spokesmen said the
names of the protesters would be
turned over to the student judicial
councils.

Wert went to the door of the lobby
and reread his statement for the newts
media. He reaffirmed President Ster
ling's willingness to meet with repre
sentatives of the draft protest group,
which Sterling outlined in his letter
to the Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, dated May 18.
He said such a meeting could take
place only "with a small group of Stu
dents and Faculty," and only if it were
not held under duress.
Cheers of Support
When Wert announced the Univer
sity's intention to administer the Se
lective Service exam as scheduled the
crowd gave a cheer. He concluded the
prepared statement, "The University
intends to follow its policy on demon
stration and its normal disciplinary
procedures on this and other occa
sions." The partisan crowd cheered
again as he finished.
As Wert left the building, Stanford
police sealed the office allowing no
one to enter. Some of the would-be
protesters were caught outside and
were refused permission to re-enter.
The demonstrators proposed a se
ries of compromises through Associ
ate Dean of Students Joel Smith for
various guarantees of an open meet
ing if the sit-in were called off.
Smith flatly told the demonstrators
the University was "simply not pre
pared to bargain." All compromises
involving a form of guarantee were
rejected by Sterling.
Later in the afternoon, Smith told
the group, "It is absolutely impossible
for you people to gain any concession
as a result of a sit-in." Instead he sug
gested they accept the "strong possi
bility" that the Administration would
provide an open meeting of the form
the demonstrators were proposing.
No Guarantees
However, Smith stressed, "Neither
I nor any official of the University
can give you any guarantees."
Smith allowed David Harris, stu
dent body president-elect, to enter the
building and discuss the situation
with the demonstrators. Harris said,
"As a group, you have made the point,
not the big point about the draft test,
but about public concern." Harris
spent the afternoon working as a me
diator, but the group found no accept
able solution.
Viewing the scene of demonstration
and counter - demonstration Friday
morning, /Harris told The Daily, "I
think the whole thing has turned into
a circus." He believed the draft pro
testers "could have used much better
tactics."
Yet the student body president
thought the demonstrations were
"roughly a good thing. I like to see
people concerned."
By mid-afternoon Friday the dem
onstrators showed signs of flagging.
Talking in terms of a "diplomatic leap
of faith," they were on the verge of
leaving the President's office, but
they were unable to reach agreement
on the contents of their statement of
capitulation.
Goodman Lends Support
The appearance of education critic
Paul Goodman, who was on campus
to give a lecture, was cheered by the
draft protesters and seem to renew
their will to stay.
Several members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
told the protesters they would recom
mend a meeting of student and facul
ty committees to discuss the draft is
sue and classified contracts.
The protesters had earlier accused
the Academic Council of procrastina
tion and irresponsibility for referring
consideration of the University policy
in both areas to committee
when the Council met last Tuesday.
Professor Kenneth Arrow, secretary
of the Executive Committee, told the
protesters students would be involved
in the Academic Council's considera
tion of University compliance with
the Selective Service System. "Th e
only question is the form of consulta
tion," he said.

"The substitution of a small group
like this violates the spirit of non-vio
lence and democratic process," Arrow
told the sit-indemonstrators.
In a reply to Arrow's remarks the
protesters drafted a statement late
Friday night which urged Arrow and
the rest of the Executive Committee
to call upon President Sterling to ini
tiate an open meeting.
The Executive Committee was un
able to convene Friday for want of a
quorum. But four members of the
committee, as individuals, urged the
draft protesters "to terminate your
defiance of University regulations."
The note drawn up Saturday morn
ing was signed by Arrow, Gordon
Wright, Albert Guerard, and Herbert
L. Packer.
"As several of us assured you at
various times during the day yester
day, the Executive Committee is plan
ning to hold open hearings on the sub
jects which have been referred to it
by the Academic Council,"the four
professors wrote.
"Unless you disbelieve these assur
ances, there is no 'impasse'."
The demonstrators passed their sec
ond night in Sterling's office with no
incident. University officials allowed
friends to bring the demonstrators
food and soft drinks throughout the
confinement.
Late Saturday morning the pro
testers agreed to give up the sit-in.
Kenny Washington told The Dally the
group had gained all it could through
sit-in tactics, a"nd that it was time to
use new measures.
The group's formal statement said
the protesters had decided to end the
sit-in "of our own free will, choosing
this kind of withdrawal in the belief
that this would strengthen our future
struggle for our just demands."
"We have come to protest the moral
callousness of the administration
which chose to comply with a dis
criminatory conscription policy," the
statement continued.
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White
Memorial Flaza. Speakers will
be members of the protesting
group. The rally, according to
spokesmen for the group, will
be concerned with the facts of
the sit-in and its issues, includ
ing the Selective Service tests
and a possbile confrontation
with President Sterling.

"This is the didactic radio station,
KSCPV, broadcasting from the Inner
City," said Jeff Lewin. Lewin was
self-appointed disk jockey at a dance

held Friday night in the lobby of
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Attending were 27 active individuals
who had stayed for the party when
the University Administration ordered
a cease to the influx of protesters into
Building 10 of Inner Quad. Those in
side at 12:30 p.m. were informed that
if they left they forfeited their oppor
tunity to return in time to attend that
night's discoteque.
Attendance at the party by sym
pathizers outside was strongly dis
couraged by strategically placed mem
bers of the Stanford Police Force.
It was noted by several of the
guests, however, that between 12:30
and midnight, approximately eight
party crashers entered Building 10
through an office window, which was
nailed shut just after the witching
hour.
The scene had been quite different
the night before. From 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. the reception room of Building
10 was filled with over 100 students
loudly debating the tactics and ethics
of their actions. The crowd overflowed
into the corridors until people had to
look in the windows to see what was
going on.
Inside the building, students sitting
beneath an oil portrait of little Leland
argued about the purposes and goals
of the University.
"We demand the right to make the
decisions that affect our ilves," said
one undergrad. "'Who's making the
decisions' is the primary question we
have to answer."
At 1:03 a.m. Friday morning it was
finally decided that the draft test was
indeed a "life and death matter" and
a statement was approved by a voice
vote.
Immediately after the vote was
taken, ASSU President-elect Dave

Harris and several students rushed
into the room with pizzas which they
distributed to the protestors.
The meeting then broke up into sev
eral small groups arguing among
themselves about such topics as the
draft test, conscription, Vietnam, the
purpose of education, and the purpose
of life.
"They should open the President's
office every night," one student com
mented. "It's a great place to go after
the Union closes."
A Stanford policeman kept watch
throughout the night, but made no
move to interfere. Both doors re
mained open and demonstrators came
and went as they pleased."
Most of the sleepers were up by
dawn, in time to greet the secretaries
who arrived promptly at 8 a.m. Fri
day morning. The secretaries stared at
the demonstrators but said nothing,
although one secretary seemed sur
prised to find a student sleeping under
her desk.
The students were soon joined by
reporters, photographers, and camera
men who took flash pictures and
stuck microphones in people's faces.
And, at 9 a.m., a group of 100 "anti
pacifist" picketers began to parade
around outside Building 10.
They carried signs that read "Sup
port President Sterling," "Academic
Freedom AND Responsibility," and
"Oppose Anarchy."
By 11 a.m. a large crowd of stu
dents, faculty, and staff had gathered
in Inner Quad to watch the sit-in and
the picketers. Television cameras,
newspaper photographers and Stan
ford policemen added variety to the
crowd.
"Gosh, this is exciting," commented
one frosh dolly.


At nine o'clock Friday morning, some
75 anti-demonstration pickets showed
up outside President Sterling's office.
Many stayed 'til noon to cheer Dean
Itol>ert J. Wert's statement of the Ad
ministration's stand.
Shortly after noon, Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
entered the lobby and informed the
demonstrators they were in violation
of University regulations which states
demonstrations "shall not be held
within University buildings while
University functions are in progress
therein."
"The University will now institute

said. University spokesmen said the

diator, but the group found no accept
able solution.
Viewing the scene of demonstration
and counter - demonstration Friday
morning, /Harris told The Daily, "I
think the whole thing has turned into
a circus." He believed the draft pro
testers "could have used much better
tactics."
Yet the student body president
thought the demonstrations were
"roughly a good thing. I like to see
people concerned."
By mid-afternoon Friday the dem
onstrators showed signs of flagging.
Talking in terms of a "diplomatic leap
of faith," they were on the verge of
leaving the President's office, but
they were unable to reach agreement
on the contents of their statement of

Goodman Lends Support
The appearance of education critic
Paul Goodman, who was on campus
to give a lecture, was cheered by the
draft protesters and seem to renew
their will to stay.
Several members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
told the protesters they would recom
mend a meeting of student and facul
ty committees to discuss the draft is
sue and classified contracts.
The protesters had earlier accused
the Academic Council of procrastina
tion and irresponsibility for referring
consideration of the University policy
in both areas to committee
when the Council met last Tuesday.
Professor Kenneth Arrow, secretary
of the Executive Committee, told the
protesters students would be involved
in the Academic Council's considera
tion of University compliance with
the Selective Service System. "Th e
only question is the form of consulta
tion," he said.

"The substitution of a small group
like this violates the spirit of non-vio
lence and democratic process," Arrow
told the sit-indemonstrators.
In a reply to Arrow's remarks the
protesters drafted a statement late
Friday night which urged Arrow and
the rest of the Executive Committee
to call upon President Sterling to ini
tiate an open meeting.
The Executive Committee was un
able to convene Friday for want of a
quorum. But four members of the
committee, as individuals, urged the
draft protesters "to terminate your
defiance of University regulations."
The note drawn up Saturday morn
ing was signed by Arrow, Gordon
Wright, Albert Guerard, and Herbert
L. Packer.
"As several of us assured you at
various times during the day yester
day, the Executive Committee is plan
ning to hold open hearings on the sub
jects which have been referred to it
by the Academic Council,"the four
professors wrote.
"Unless you disbelieve these assur
ances, there is no 'impasse'."
The demonstrators passed their sec
ond night in Sterling's office with no
incident. University officials allowed
friends to bring the demonstrators
food and soft drinks throughout the
confinement.
Late Saturday morning the pro
testers agreed to give up the sit-in.
Kenny Washington told The Dally the
group had gained all it could through
sit-in tactics, a"nd that it was time to
use new measures.
The group's formal statement said
the protesters had decided to end the
sit-in "of our own free will, choosing
this kind of withdrawal in the belief
that this would strengthen our future
struggle for our just demands."
"We have come to protest the moral
callousness of the administration
which chose to comply with a dis
criminatory conscription policy," the
statement continued.
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White
Memorial Flaza. Speakers will
be members of the protesting
group. The rally, according to
spokesmen for the group, will
be concerned with the facts of
the sit-in and its issues, includ
ing the Selective Service tests
and a possbile confrontation
with President Sterling.

"This is the didactic radio station,
KSCPV, broadcasting from the Inner
City," said Jeff Lewin. Lewin was
self-appointed disk jockey at a dance

held Friday night in the lobby of
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Attending were 27 active individuals
who had stayed for the party when
the University Administration ordered
a cease to the influx of protesters into
Building 10 of Inner Quad. Those in
side at 12:30 p.m. were informed that
if they left they forfeited their oppor
tunity to return in time to attend that
night's discoteque.
Attendance at the party by sym
pathizers outside was strongly dis
couraged by strategically placed mem
bers of the Stanford Police Force.
It was noted by several of the
guests, however, that between 12:30
and midnight, approximately eight
party crashers entered Building 10
through an office window, which was
nailed shut just after the witching
hour.
The scene had been quite different
the night before. From 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. the reception room of Building
10 was filled with over 100 students
loudly debating the tactics and ethics
of their actions. The crowd overflowed
into the corridors until people had to
look in the windows to see what was
going on.
Inside the building, students sitting
beneath an oil portrait of little Leland
argued about the purposes and goals
of the University.
"We demand the right to make the
decisions that affect our ilves," said
one undergrad. "'Who's making the
decisions' is the primary question we
have to answer."
At 1:03 a.m. Friday morning it was
finally decided that the draft test was
indeed a "life and death matter" and
a statement was approved by a voice
vote.
Immediately after the vote was
taken, ASSU President-elect Dave

Harris and several students rushed
into the room with pizzas which they
distributed to the protestors.
The meeting then broke up into sev
eral small groups arguing among
themselves about such topics as the
draft test, conscription, Vietnam, the
purpose of education, and the purpose
of life.
"They should open the President's
office every night," one student com
mented. "It's a great place to go after
the Union closes."
A Stanford policeman kept watch
throughout the night, but made no
move to interfere. Both doors re
mained open and demonstrators came
and went as they pleased."
Most of the sleepers were up by
dawn, in time to greet the secretaries
who arrived promptly at 8 a.m. Fri
day morning. The secretaries stared at
the demonstrators but said nothing,
although one secretary seemed sur
prised to find a student sleeping under
her desk.
The students were soon joined by
reporters, photographers, and camera
men who took flash pictures and
stuck microphones in people's faces.
And, at 9 a.m., a group of 100 "anti
pacifist" picketers began to parade
around outside Building 10.
They carried signs that read "Sup
port President Sterling," "Academic
Freedom AND Responsibility," and
"Oppose Anarchy."
By 11 a.m. a large crowd of stu
dents, faculty, and staff had gathered
in Inner Quad to watch the sit-in and
the picketers. Television cameras,
newspaper photographers and Stan
ford policemen added variety to the
crowd.
"Gosh, this is exciting," commented
one frosh dolly.


At nine o'clock Friday morning, some
75 anti-demonstration pickets showed
up outside President Sterling's office.
Many stayed 'til noon to cheer Dean
Itol>ert J. Wert's statement of the Ad
ministration's stand.
Shortly after noon, Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
entered the lobby and informed the
demonstrators they were in violation
of University regulations which states
demonstrations "shall not be held
within University buildings while
University functions are in progress
therein."
"The University will now institute
its normal judicial proceedings," Wert
said. University spokesmen said the
names of the protesters would be
turned over to the student judicial
councils.

Wert went to the door of the lobby
and reread his statement for the newts
media. He reaffirmed President Ster
ling's willingness to meet with repre
sentatives of the draft protest group,
which Sterling outlined in his letter
to the Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, dated May 18.
He said such a meeting could take
place only "with a small group of Stu
dents and Faculty," and only if it were
not held under duress.
Cheers of Support
When Wert announced the Univer
sity's intention to administer the Se
lective Service exam as scheduled the
crowd gave a cheer. He concluded the
prepared statement, "The University
intends to follow its policy on demon
stration and its normal disciplinary
procedures on this and other occa
sions." The partisan crowd cheered
again as he finished.
As Wert left the building, Stanford
police sealed the office allowing no
one to enter. Some of the would-be
protesters were caught outside and
were refused permission to re-enter.
The demonstrators proposed a se
ries of compromises through Associ
ate Dean of Students Joel Smith for
various guarantees of an open meet
ing if the sit-in were called off.
Smith flatly told the demonstrators
the University was "simply not pre
pared to bargain." All compromises
involving a form of guarantee were
rejected by Sterling.
Later in the afternoon, Smith told
the group, "It is absolutely impossible
for you people to gain any concession
as a result of a sit-in." Instead he sug
gested they accept the "strong possi
bility" that the Administration would
provide an open meeting of the form
the demonstrators were proposing.
No Guarantees
However, Smith stressed, "Neither
I nor any official of the University
can give you any guarantees."
Smith allowed David Harris, stu
dent body president-elect, to enter the
building and discuss the situation
with the demonstrators. Harris said,
"As a group, you have made the point,
not the big point about the draft test,
but about public concern." Harris
spent the afternoon working as a me
diator, but the group found no accept
able solution.

day, the Executive Committee is plan
ning to hold open hearings on the sub
jects which have been referred to it
by the Academic Council,"the four
professors wrote.
"Unless you disbelieve these assur
ances, there is no 'impasse'."
The demonstrators passed their sec
ond night in Sterling's office with no
incident. University officials allowed
friends to bring the demonstrators
food and soft drinks throughout the
confinement.
Late Saturday morning the pro
testers agreed to give up the sit-in.
Kenny Washington told The Dally the
group had gained all it could through
sit-in tactics, a"nd that it was time to
use new measures.
The group's formal statement said
the protesters had decided to end the
sit-in "of our own free will, choosing
this kind of withdrawal in the belief
that this would strengthen our future
struggle for our just demands."
"We have come to protest the moral
callousness of the administration
which chose to comply with a dis
criminatory conscription policy," the
statement continued.
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White
Memorial Flaza. Speakers will
be members of the protesting
group. The rally, according to
spokesmen for the group, will
be concerned with the facts of
the sit-in and its issues, includ
ing the Selective Service tests
and a possbile confrontation
with President Sterling.

"This is the didactic radio station,
KSCPV, broadcasting from the Inner
City," said Jeff Lewin. Lewin was
self-appointed disk jockey at a dance

held Friday night in the lobby of
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Attending were 27 active individuals
who had stayed for the party when
the University Administration ordered
a cease to the influx of protesters into
Building 10 of Inner Quad. Those in
side at 12:30 p.m. were informed that
if they left they forfeited their oppor
tunity to return in time to attend that
night's discoteque.
Attendance at the party by sym
pathizers outside was strongly dis
couraged by strategically placed mem
bers of the Stanford Police Force.
It was noted by several of the
guests, however, that between 12:30
and midnight, approximately eight
party crashers entered Building 10
through an office window, which was
nailed shut just after the witching
hour.
The scene had been quite different
the night before. From 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. the reception room of Building
10 was filled with over 100 students
loudly debating the tactics and ethics
of their actions. The crowd overflowed
into the corridors until people had to
look in the windows to see what was
going on.
Inside the building, students sitting
beneath an oil portrait of little Leland
argued about the purposes and goals
of the University.
"We demand the right to make the
decisions that affect our ilves," said
one undergrad. "'Who's making the
decisions' is the primary question we
have to answer."
At 1:03 a.m. Friday morning it was
finally decided that the draft test was
indeed a "life and death matter" and
a statement was approved by a voice
vote.
Immediately after the vote was
taken, ASSU President-elect Dave

Harris and several students rushed
into the room with pizzas which they
distributed to the protestors.
The meeting then broke up into sev
eral small groups arguing among
themselves about such topics as the
draft test, conscription, Vietnam, the
purpose of education, and the purpose
of life.
"They should open the President's
office every night," one student com
mented. "It's a great place to go after
the Union closes."
A Stanford policeman kept watch
throughout the night, but made no
move to interfere. Both doors re
mained open and demonstrators came
and went as they pleased."
Most of the sleepers were up by
dawn, in time to greet the secretaries
who arrived promptly at 8 a.m. Fri
day morning. The secretaries stared at
the demonstrators but said nothing,
although one secretary seemed sur
prised to find a student sleeping under
her desk.
The students were soon joined by
reporters, photographers, and camera
men who took flash pictures and
stuck microphones in people's faces.
And, at 9 a.m., a group of 100 "anti
pacifist" picketers began to parade
around outside Building 10.
They carried signs that read "Sup
port President Sterling," "Academic
Freedom AND Responsibility," and
"Oppose Anarchy."
By 11 a.m. a large crowd of stu
dents, faculty, and staff had gathered
in Inner Quad to watch the sit-in and
the picketers. Television cameras,
newspaper photographers and Stan
ford policemen added variety to the
crowd.
"Gosh, this is exciting," commented
one frosh dolly.


At nine o'clock Friday morning, some
75 anti-demonstration pickets showed
up outside President Sterling's office.
Many stayed 'til noon to cheer Dean
Itol>ert J. Wert's statement of the Ad
ministration's stand.
Shortly after noon, Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert,
entered the lobby and informed the
demonstrators they were in violation
of University regulations which states
demonstrations "shall not be held
within University buildings while
University functions are in progress
therein."
"The University will now institute
its normal judicial proceedings," Wert
said. University spokesmen said the
names of the protesters would be
turned over to the student judicial
councils.

Wert went to the door of the lobby
and reread his statement for the newts
media. He reaffirmed President Ster
ling's willingness to meet with repre
sentatives of the draft protest group,
which Sterling outlined in his letter
to the Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, dated May 18.
He said such a meeting could take
place only "with a small group of Stu
dents and Faculty," and only if it were
not held under duress.
Cheers of Support
When Wert announced the Univer
sity's intention to administer the Se
lective Service exam as scheduled the
crowd gave a cheer. He concluded the
prepared statement, "The University
intends to follow its policy on demon
stration and its normal disciplinary
procedures on this and other occa
sions." The partisan crowd cheered
again as he finished.
As Wert left the building, Stanford
police sealed the office allowing no
one to enter. Some of the would-be
protesters were caught outside and
were refused permission to re-enter.
The demonstrators proposed a se
ries of compromises through Associ
ate Dean of Students Joel Smith for
various guarantees of an open meet
ing if the sit-in were called off.
Smith flatly told the demonstrators
the University was "simply not pre
pared to bargain." All compromises
involving a form of guarantee were
rejected by Sterling.
Later in the afternoon, Smith told
the group, "It is absolutely impossible
for you people to gain any concession
as a result of a sit-in." Instead he sug
gested they accept the "strong possi
bility" that the Administration would
provide an open meeting of the form
the demonstrators were proposing.
No Guarantees
However, Smith stressed, "Neither
I nor any official of the University
can give you any guarantees."
Smith allowed David Harris, stu
dent body president-elect, to enter the
building and discuss the situation
with the demonstrators. Harris said,
"As a group, you have made the point,
not the big point about the draft test,
but about public concern." Harris
spent the afternoon working as a me
diator, but the group found no accept
able solution.
Viewing the scene of demonstration
and counter - demonstration Friday
morning, /Harris told The Daily, "I
think the whole thing has turned into
a circus." He believed the draft pro
testers "could have used much better
tactics."
Yet the student body president
thought the demonstrations were
"roughly a good thing. I like to see
people concerned."
By mid-afternoon Friday the dem
onstrators showed signs of flagging.
Talking in terms of a "diplomatic leap
of faith," they were on the verge of
leaving the President's office, but
they were unable to reach agreement
on the contents of their statement of
capitulation.
Goodman Lends Support
The appearance of education critic
Paul Goodman, who was on campus
to give a lecture, was cheered by the
draft protesters and seem to renew
their will to stay.
Several members of the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council
told the protesters they would recom
mend a meeting of student and facul
ty committees to discuss the draft is
sue and classified contracts.
The protesters had earlier accused
the Academic Council of procrastina
tion and irresponsibility for referring
consideration of the University policy
in both areas to committee
when the Council met last Tuesday.
Professor Kenneth Arrow, secretary
of the Executive Committee, told the
protesters students would be involved
in the Academic Council's considera
tion of University compliance with
the Selective Service System. "Th e
only question is the form of consulta
tion," he said.

"The substitution of a small group
like this violates the spirit of non-vio
lence and democratic process," Arrow
told the sit-indemonstrators.
In a reply to Arrow's remarks the
protesters drafted a statement late
Friday night which urged Arrow and
the rest of the Executive Committee
to call upon President Sterling to ini
tiate an open meeting.
The Executive Committee was un
able to convene Friday for want of a
quorum. But four members of the
committee, as individuals, urged the
draft protesters "to terminate your
defiance of University regulations."
The note drawn up Saturday morn
ing was signed by Arrow, Gordon
Wright, Albert Guerard, and Herbert
L. Packer.
"As several of us assured you at
various times during the day yester
day, the Executive Committee is plan
ning to hold open hearings on the sub
jects which have been referred to it
by the Academic Council,"the four
professors wrote.
"Unless you disbelieve these assur
