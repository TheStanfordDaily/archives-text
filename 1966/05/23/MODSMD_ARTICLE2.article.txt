# Quiet Atmosphere Belies Tension; Nerves On Edge In 'The Inner City'
## 'Out!' 
### WENDY WEINER BOB FISHMAN 
A teach-in rally conducted by
members of the sit-in at Presi
dent Sterling's Office will be
held today at 12 noon at White
Memorial Flaza. Speakers will
be members of the protesting
group. The rally, according to
spokesmen for the group, will
be concerned with the facts of
the sit-in and its issues, includ
ing the Selective Service tests
and a possbile confrontation
with President Sterling.

"This is the didactic radio station,
KSCPV, broadcasting from the Inner
City," said Jeff Lewin. Lewin was
self-appointed disk jockey at a dance

held Friday night in the lobby of
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Attending were 27 active individuals
who had stayed for the party when
the University Administration ordered
a cease to the influx of protesters into
Building 10 of Inner Quad. Those in
side at 12:30 p.m. were informed that
if they left they forfeited their oppor
tunity to return in time to attend that
night's discoteque.
Attendance at the party by sym
pathizers outside was strongly dis
couraged by strategically placed mem
bers of the Stanford Police Force.
It was noted by several of the
guests, however, that between 12:30
and midnight, approximately eight
party crashers entered Building 10
through an office window, which was
nailed shut just after the witching
hour.
The scene had been quite different
the night before. From 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. the reception room of Building
10 was filled with over 100 students
loudly debating the tactics and ethics
of their actions. The crowd overflowed
into the corridors until people had to
look in the windows to see what was
going on.
Inside the building, students sitting
beneath an oil portrait of little Leland
argued about the purposes and goals
of the University.
"We demand the right to make the
decisions that affect our ilves," said
one undergrad. "'Who's making the
decisions' is the primary question we
have to answer."
At 1:03 a.m. Friday morning it was
finally decided that the draft test was
indeed a "life and death matter" and
a statement was approved by a voice
vote.
Immediately after the vote was
taken, ASSU President-elect Dave

Harris and several students rushed
into the room with pizzas which they
distributed to the protestors.
The meeting then broke up into sev
eral small groups arguing among
themselves about such topics as the
draft test, conscription, Vietnam, the
purpose of education, and the purpose
of life.
"They should open the President's
office every night," one student com
mented. "It's a great place to go after
the Union closes."
A Stanford policeman kept watch
throughout the night, but made no
move to interfere. Both doors re
mained open and demonstrators came
and went as they pleased."
Most of the sleepers were up by
dawn, in time to greet the secretaries
who arrived promptly at 8 a.m. Fri
day morning. The secretaries stared at
the demonstrators but said nothing,
although one secretary seemed sur
prised to find a student sleeping under
her desk.
The students were soon joined by
reporters, photographers, and camera
men who took flash pictures and
stuck microphones in people's faces.
And, at 9 a.m., a group of 100 "anti
pacifist" picketers began to parade
around outside Building 10.
They carried signs that read "Sup
port President Sterling," "Academic
Freedom AND Responsibility," and
"Oppose Anarchy."
By 11 a.m. a large crowd of stu
dents, faculty, and staff had gathered
in Inner Quad to watch the sit-in and
the picketers. Television cameras,
newspaper photographers and Stan
ford policemen added variety to the
crowd.
"Gosh, this is exciting," commented
one frosh dolly.


At nine o'clock Friday morning, some
75 anti-demonstration pickets showed
up outside President Sterling's office.
Many stayed 'til noon to cheer Dean
Itol>ert J. Wert's statement of the Ad
ministration's stand.
