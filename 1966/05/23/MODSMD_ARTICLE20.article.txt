The University of Southern
California Trojans swept the in
dividual and team titles in the
AAWU tournament at Stanford
Saturday.
Trojan Sherman Finger (no
relation to the Stanford coach
Bud Finger) shot a 72-hole 291
to garner his third straight in
dividual title and lead the USC
team to it6 third straight team
title.
But Sherman needed the help
of good fortune to take the top
honors alone. Finger would have
shared the top of the heap with
Stanford's Greg Picard but Pic
ard hooked his tee shot on the
tenth hole into a tree for a one
stroke penalty on the unplayable
lie.
Picard was still all right in his
contest with Finger, except he

unknowingly violated the rules
when dropping his ball and was
assessed another two stroke
penalty.
That put Picard in third place
two strokes back of Finger and
one back of his USC teammate
Ricft Rhoades, and made the dif
ference between the Stanford
and USC team scores three
strokes instead of one.

Perhaps Picard was being paid
back for the four-iron hole-in-one
he dropped on the 200-yard third
hole in the final round.
Dick Harris and Bob Boucher
of Stanford followed Picard in
the fourth and fifth spots and
the Indian's John Bottomly se
cured seventh.
The Trojans had a team score
of 1183 to Stanford's 1186.
