# Stanford Oarsmen Second In Sprints
## 
### DAN CABRERA 
The Stanford Varsity crew
finished a slim-margined second
behind Washington Saturday at
the Western Intercollegiate
Sprints.
On water absolutely no one
could have walked on, with the
wind blowing twenty knots, all
the crews represented found the
rowing very rough. Although
the course at Vallejo is one of
few wide enough to accomodate
the number of boats entered in
the Sprints, weather conditions
are far from ideal for racing.
In the Varsity race, Washing
ton pulled out for a slight lead
until the 500-meter mark, when
Stanford came from behind,
taking over with a half-length
on both Washington and Cal.
Stanford Held Lead
All three of the leaders were
even at the three-quarter couree
point when Washington made
its move and Cal's oarsmen
caught a crab and dropped into
third. Recovering beautifully,
Cal made a strong bid for the
second position with Stanford,
but was unsuccessful.
What is unexplainable is why
Stanford, having once gained the
lead over Washington, was un
able to hold it. Undoubtedly the
water conditions played an im
portant role in the afternoon' 6
results.
After watching the races, it is
apparent that the winners of the
IRA next month will have no
great odds behind them going
into the race. After a clean
sweep against Cal last weekend,
the Indian crew had to pull with
every ounce of strength they
had to hold off Cal in the
Sprints, and Washington's final

win might very well have never
been seen had their draw of po
sitions of the course been dif
ferent.
The water was noticably
rougher next to shore, in the
number one and two positions.
In the varsity race, Stanford
drew the number two position,
and Washington drew number
five.
Whitecapped Water
Whitecaps were actually visi
ble on the course near the finish
line, and to see a gull flapping
its wings a<s hard as possible and
still remain stationary gave one
some idea of how hard the wind
was blowing. Between races the
spectators would retire to the
warmth of their cars, returning
at the start of each race with a
blanket wrapped around them
selves.
The Washington JV's proved
to be just as strong as reported,
and rowed away from the field
by a length with Orange Coast
College and the University of
Britishf Columbia trailing. Stan
ford's JV's were unable to coor
dinate their timing for any con
siderable distance on the rough
water, although they had drawn
one of the calmer lanes.
Unexpectedly strong Orange
Coast set a new course record
of 5'26.1 in the Frosh finals,
while Cal was able to turn the
tables on Stanford, who finished
third behind them.
This is the last meet of the
season for the Stanford crew
before they travel to Syracuse
on June 18 for the IRA. The
annual regatta sponsored by the
Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion is the largest in the nation,
with schools from both East
and West coasts represented.

What is unexplainable is why
Stanford, having once gained the
lead over Washington, was un
able to hold it. Undoubtedly the
water conditions played an im
portant role in the afternoon' 6
results.
After watching the races, it is
apparent that the winners of the
IRA next month will have no
great odds behind them going
into the race. After a clean
sweep against Cal last weekend,
the Indian crew had to pull with
every ounce of strength they
had to hold off Cal in the
Sprints, and Washington's final

win might very well have never
been seen had their draw of po
sitions of the course been dif
ferent.
The water was noticably
rougher next to shore, in the
number one and two positions.
In the varsity race, Stanford
drew the number two position,
and Washington drew number
five.
Whitecapped Water
Whitecaps were actually visi
ble on the course near the finish
line, and to see a gull flapping
its wings a<s hard as possible and
still remain stationary gave one
some idea of how hard the wind
was blowing. Between races the
spectators would retire to the
warmth of their cars, returning
at the start of each race with a
blanket wrapped around them
selves.
The Washington JV's proved
to be just as strong as reported,
and rowed away from the field
by a length with Orange Coast
College and the University of
Britishf Columbia trailing. Stan
ford's JV's were unable to coor
dinate their timing for any con
siderable distance on the rough
water, although they had drawn
one of the calmer lanes.
Unexpectedly strong Orange
Coast set a new course record
of 5'26.1 in the Frosh finals,
while Cal was able to turn the
tables on Stanford, who finished
third behind them.
This is the last meet of the
season for the Stanford crew
before they travel to Syracuse
on June 18 for the IRA. The
annual regatta sponsored by the
Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion is the largest in the nation,
with schools from both East
and West coasts represented.
The Stanford Varsity crew
finished a slim-margined second
behind Washington Saturday at
the Western Intercollegiate
Sprints.
On water absolutely no one
could have walked on, with the
wind blowing twenty knots, all
the crews represented found the
rowing very rough. Although
the course at Vallejo is one of
few wide enough to accomodate
the number of boats entered in
the Sprints, weather conditions
are far from ideal for racing.
In the Varsity race, Washing
ton pulled out for a slight lead
until the 500-meter mark, when
Stanford came from behind,
taking over with a half-length
on both Washington and Cal.
Stanford Held Lead
All three of the leaders were
even at the three-quarter couree
point when Washington made
its move and Cal's oarsmen
caught a crab and dropped into
third. Recovering beautifully,
Cal made a strong bid for the
second position with Stanford,
but was unsuccessful.
