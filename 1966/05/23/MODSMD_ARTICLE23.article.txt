# Scrappy Indian Stickmen Edged By Veteran Team
## 
### 
The scrappy Stanford La
crosse team could not quite over
come the expert stickwork and
game instinct of the wisened
veterans of the Palo Alto La
crosse Club and were edged out
by the league chamipons Satur
day by a 6-4 count.
The final game of the North
ern California Lacrosse Associ
ation season proved to be the
climax of the season, as the fans
were treated to one of the
roughest, hard-hitting games
seen in these parts. Tensions
were high and a thirteen game
win streak was at stake, and the
upstart Indians nearly knocked
the Palo Altans off their pedes
tal.
The Palo Alto Club is made
up mostly of Stanford graduate
students who have played in the
East and have attained some of
the highest honors in lacrosse.
The Indians actually con
trolled the ball most of the
game, but the Palo Alto fast
break proved deadly in a third
quarter splurge of four goals,
and there were times when it

seemed the Indians could not
buy a goal. Former All-New En
gland goalie at Yale Don Ogilvie
made 26 saves on the Cards
The Indians were playing with
a crippled goalie in Mell Ellis,
who played despite a severe
shoulder injury. Ellis played a
fine game, and it was difficult
to tell he was injured.
The score was knotted at 1-1
at halftime by virtue of second
quarter goals by Palo Alto's
Jim Lucas and Stanford's Wick
Rowland. With a minute gone
in the period, Lucas took the
feed on the crease from Bob
Barton and scooted the shot past
Ellis. But just 33 seconds later
Bob Murphy dodged two men
and from behind the cage found
fellow midfielder Rowland on
the crease.
Surprising Stamina
Showing surprising stamina,
the Palo Alto club floored the
Indians with four third quarter
goals. Cagey Bruce Lloyd assist
ed on no less than three of the
goals, while Barton picked up
his second assist. The goals were
contributed by Bill Oatway,
Lucas, and Toby Hayes, the
latter with two.
Stanford goals by Dick Speas,
Sill Sanders, and Clay Primrose
in the fourth quarter were not
enough to overcome the Club.
Lucas got another security goal
during that final period to earn
a hattrick.

his second assist. The goals were
contributed by Bill Oatway,
Lucas, and Toby Hayes, the
latter with two.
Stanford goals by Dick Speas,
Sill Sanders, and Clay Primrose
in the fourth quarter were not
enough to overcome the Club.
Lucas got another security goal
during that final period to earn
a hattrick.
The scrappy Stanford La
crosse team could not quite over
come the expert stickwork and
game instinct of the wisened
veterans of the Palo Alto La
crosse Club and were edged out
by the league chamipons Satur
day by a 6-4 count.
The final game of the North
ern California Lacrosse Associ
ation season proved to be the
climax of the season, as the fans
were treated to one of the
roughest, hard-hitting games
seen in these parts. Tensions
were high and a thirteen game
win streak was at stake, and the
upstart Indians nearly knocked
the Palo Altans off their pedes
tal.
The Palo Alto Club is made
up mostly of Stanford graduate
students who have played in the
East and have attained some of
the highest honors in lacrosse.
The Indians actually con
trolled the ball most of the
game, but the Palo Alto fast
break proved deadly in a third
quarter splurge of four goals,
and there were times when it

seemed the Indians could not
buy a goal. Former All-New En
gland goalie at Yale Don Ogilvie
made 26 saves on the Cards
The Indians were playing with
a crippled goalie in Mell Ellis,
who played despite a severe
shoulder injury. Ellis played a
fine game, and it was difficult
to tell he was injured.
The score was knotted at 1-1
at halftime by virtue of second
quarter goals by Palo Alto's
Jim Lucas and Stanford's Wick
Rowland. With a minute gone
in the period, Lucas took the
feed on the crease from Bob
Barton and scooted the shot past
Ellis. But just 33 seconds later
Bob Murphy dodged two men
and from behind the cage found
fellow midfielder Rowland on
the crease.
Surprising Stamina
Showing surprising stamina,
the Palo Alto club floored the
Indians with four third quarter
goals. Cagey Bruce Lloyd assist
ed on no less than three of the
goals, while Barton picked up
his second assist. The goals were
contributed by Bill Oatway,
Lucas, and Toby Hayes, the
latter with two.
Stanford goals by Dick Speas,
Sill Sanders, and Clay Primrose
in the fourth quarter were not
