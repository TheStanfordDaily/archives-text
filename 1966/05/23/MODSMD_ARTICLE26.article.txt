# LASSU My ASSU
## A 						Zoo Takes On The World 
### Perry Lee Birchard 
There lives in the forest near
Big Sur a wizened little hermit.
Twice a week he calls a meeting
of representatives of all the
animal kingdom.
He stands before the assem
blage waving a hemlock branch
to attract their attention; it
helps to minimize the animals'
squeaking and gnawing each
other. He also holds, in his left
hand, a tattered Bible, which he
judiciously cites on appropriate
occasions (when he doesn't know
the answer to a question or
when he is unable to keep the
animals orderly).
A Tradition
Why the animals meet twice
a week is unclear, except that it
is "traditional" (no one can re
member not meeting twice a
week, and besides it makes
some of them feel important or
worthwhile. At least it gives
them something to do.)
Usually, discussion centers
around the structure of the uni
verse: Whether the earth is
square or round, flat or not; and
whether the earth circles around
the stars or the stars about the
earth. Periodically, the animals
resolve to protest or change
their perceived order of things.
They also debate a lot about
their debating—what rules they
should follow, where they should
meet, and what they should
serve for refreshments.
Bickering
In either case, the animals
bicker for hours over the state
ments and resolutions. This is
particularly true when one of
the "representatives" (you can
never tell who really is a repre
sentative; anyone can attend and
vote if he is not obtrusive) has
explored an issue. Animals who
have an interest in an issue ex
plore it; the rest just vote about
it.
On one particular occasion, at
a meeting which this observer
was able to watch, a frog spoke
first. "I move that we hold our
meetings in the afternoon next

to the creek from now on," he
said.
"Any debate?" queried the
hermit.
"Question," came a voice.
"A vote has been called. All in
favor of meeting next to the
creek say 'aye'." There c a m e a
chorus of "ayes." "No's?" There
were none.
"I move to specify where
next to the creek we should
meet," said the salamander.
Open Floor
"The floor is open to sugges
tion," said the hermit, gripping
the Bible.
"I move that we meet under
the old oak tree," hooted the
owl.
"Motion seconded," said the
squirrel.
"Any debate?"
"I think that the old oak is
politically unfair," said the
beaver. "I prefer the beech tree."
"I'd rather meet in the mead
ow upstream," volunteered the
rabbit.
"So would I," said the gopher,
coming out of his sleep a mo
ment.
Compromise
"Why don't we compromise
and meet under the old oak tree
and the beech tree on alter
nating Thursdays, and meet in
the meadow on Tuesdays?" mut
tered the deer.
"I second the motion," said a
fieldmouse.
"Any further debate?" asked
the hermit. Except for errant
squeakings, there was silence.
"Does the first party assent to
the second party's suggestion?"
"No", replied the salamander.
"Or to that of the third par
ty?"
"It depends upon the second
party."
"I'll go along," responded the
gopher.
"All right. We will now vote
on whether or not to meet un
der the oak and beech trees on
alternating Thursdays and in

the meadow on Tuesdays, All in
favor, raise your right appen
dages."
Some Didn't Vote
This, indeed, was a difficult
task for some of the animals,
so they didn't bother to vote.
The caterpillens, spiders, and
centipedes, of course, were at
a distinct advantage — as long
as the hermit could see them at
all.
"All opposed?" he said, and
counted the dissenters by wav
ing his hemlock branch up and
down for each vote. "M o t i on
passed," he concluded. "Next?"
A caterpillar stepped forward
and resolved, "God is dead. And
now we animals must search for
a new basis for our philosophy
of life and death."
"Dead?!" chorused the re
mainder of the animals. And a
tumult ensued in which the
caterpillar was eaten by a blue
jay who just happened to be
passing through.
The hermit ran to and fro in
front of the crowd, waving his
branch shouting, "Order! Order!
God has said He is not dead.
Right here in the Bible." He
pointed to a torn page. "There
fore, the motion of our de
ceased beloved colleague was out
of order. But we will table it in
his honor."
"I move to strike out 'be
loved'," cried the ant, "if this
statement is to reflect our feel
ings."
"I object," spoke up the re
maining butterfly, flitting an
grily.
"You're out of order," cho
rused the rest of the animals
with the hermit. "But," added
the hermit, "I will now enter
tain your motion."
"I object to striking out the
word 'beloved'," repeated the
butterfly.
"Any further debate?" asked
the hermit. There was none. "All
in favor of striking out beloved
say 'aye'. Opposed say 'no'."
"Motion carried. Next?"
