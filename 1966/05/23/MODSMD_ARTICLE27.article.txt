## 'The Nation' Views 'Rebel President' 
### 
In earthquake prone Califor
nia a minor socio-political tem
blor has been recorded at Stan
ford University: a spokesman
for the New Left has been elect
ed president of the student body.
David Harris, a 20-year-old jun
ior and honors major in social
thought, won the post by a mar
gin of 535 votes out of 4,252
votes cast—the largest turn-out
in a student election in the Uni
versity's history (about 10,000
students were eligible to vote).
Harris is an admirer of Mario
Savio, who was a leader of the
Free Speech Movement at
Berkeley, and of educational
critic Paul Goodman. "I was
forged with the student revolu
tionary spirit," he contends, and
his credentials confirm it: a

stint with SNCC in Mississippi,
peace activities and marches
with the Delano grape pickers.
No one was more "shocked"
by the results than Harris, who
had anticipated that he would
be lucky if he received 200 votes.
He campaigned in dungarees, a
rumpled sport coat and sandals.
During the campaign he took a
strong stand in favor of student
strikes, abolition of fraternities,
abolition of the grading system
and of required courses, and in
sisted that students were en
titled to representation on the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
"The Universiy structure," he
said, "has forgotten about edu
cation, and has shifted its em
phasis away from concern with
the students which should be the

reason for its existence."
Students interviewed on the
campus were not quite sure
themselves how it was that Har
ris' campaign caught on, but
The Stanford Daily concluded
that the new president's candid
and outspoken style was for
many a welcome relief from the
usual drivel of student politics.
His candidacy became "a sym
bolic gesture, a protest." And
there may be a larger signifi
cance in Harris' victory than he
or The Dally suspect. When the
New Left can win at affluent
Stanford, there is life in the
body politic. Politicians may be
forced to take note of a new
axiom: the more affluent the
community, the better the
chances of the rebel candidate.

blor has been recorded at Stan
ford University: a spokesman
for the New Left has been elect
ed president of the student body.
David Harris, a 20-year-old jun
ior and honors major in social
thought, won the post by a mar
gin of 535 votes out of 4,252
votes cast—the largest turn-out
in a student election in the Uni
versity's history (about 10,000
students were eligible to vote).
Harris is an admirer of Mario
Savio, who was a leader of the
Free Speech Movement at
Berkeley, and of educational
critic Paul Goodman. "I was
forged with the student revolu
tionary spirit," he contends, and
his credentials confirm it: a

stint with SNCC in Mississippi,
peace activities and marches
with the Delano grape pickers.
No one was more "shocked"
by the results than Harris, who
had anticipated that he would
be lucky if he received 200 votes.
He campaigned in dungarees, a
rumpled sport coat and sandals.
During the campaign he took a
strong stand in favor of student
strikes, abolition of fraternities,
abolition of the grading system
and of required courses, and in
sisted that students were en
titled to representation on the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
"The Universiy structure," he
said, "has forgotten about edu
cation, and has shifted its em
phasis away from concern with
the students which should be the

reason for its existence."
Students interviewed on the
campus were not quite sure
themselves how it was that Har
ris' campaign caught on, but
The Stanford Daily concluded
that the new president's candid
and outspoken style was for
many a welcome relief from the
usual drivel of student politics.
His candidacy became "a sym
bolic gesture, a protest." And
there may be a larger signifi
cance in Harris' victory than he
or The Dally suspect. When the
New Left can win at affluent
Stanford, there is life in the
body politic. Politicians may be
forced to take note of a new
axiom: the more affluent the
community, the better the
chances of the rebel candidate.
