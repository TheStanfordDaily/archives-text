# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 2-S Deferment A Greater Evil 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Those who criticize the hypo
crisy of the government in its
administration of the selective
service test had better look at
their own arguments.
In the polemic at White Plaza
Thursday, it was stated that
anyone who takes the Selective
Service test, and who does well,
is sending someone from a low
er socio-economic class into the
army. If this is to be the prin
ciple argument against the test,
it had better be realized that the
student deferment itself is a
greater evil.
For it keeps upper and mid
dle class students out of the
army, at the expense of lower
class Americans. Any govern
ment decision to draft some col
lege students, not matter on
what basis, reduces the amount
of discrimination between the
rich and educated, and the poor
and ignorant.
If the issue is selective service
itself, those who deplore the dis
crimination against lower class
Americans implicit in the test
should advocate abolition of the
student deferrment and a ran
dom selection process. If the is
sue is not selective service, but
the specific selective process
used, critics of the test had bet
ter decide what is a just rational
for deferment of college stu
dents.

Editor, The Daily:
May 17, during the election
for Stanford Playboy of the
Year, the Arnold Air Society ar
bitrarily ruled that the winner
of the supposed election to this
highly coveted title was not to
be the candidate with the
largest number of votes, but
rather the candidate most fit
ting to be a "Stanford Playboy."
At the time of the ruling,
grass roots support had thrown
the Hon. Ho Chi Minh into a
lead of 538 votes to 185 votes
for his nearest contender.
Although this action, typical
of many military regimes, ap
pears to reflect the character
and purposes of the Arnold Air
Society, we feel that the demo
cratic process should reign su
preme.

• No Secret
Editor, The Daily:
Many Stanford students and
faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys
tem and about which informa
tion is readily available today.
There are those who charge
that classified research is in
compatible with academic free

dom. Should they not stop and
consider that to abolish it would
be to infringe upon the freedom
of those who have different
views and feel that this sort of
research is entirely acceptable
within the framework of current
University policy?
Does a man really lose his aca
demic freedom when he willing
ly undertakes such research and
agrees that his results should
not be published immediately in
the interest of national defense?
I suggest that the Academic
Council and its Executive Com
mittee do a considerable amount
of homework before making any
further decisions.

• The Loss Of Beye
Editor, The Daily:
Few students read the "scratch
sheet" more assiduously than do
the freshmen who, for the first
time, are liberated to master
their own academic program.
Yet, on no fewer than five oc
casions familiar to us these stu
dents have asked who is the
brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even
tually suffer most.
Many will grieve deeply the
loss of Professor Beye, and few
freshmen will ever know just
how great that loss will really
be.

• Disgraceful 40%
Editor, The Daily:
David Victor Harris is your
newly elected Study Body Presi
dent. Mr. Harris may prove to
be an excellent President. He
may not.
It is not my place to comment
on his qualifications for office
or the platform on which he
ran. Of these I know little and
agree with less. However, I
must believe he is not the true
representative of the majority
of the Student Body.
It seems difficult to imagine
that the majority of the Stu
dents at Stanford desire to
strike for "educational reforms"
and to eliminate grades. Does
the majority of the Stanford stu
dents admire such questionable
fellow travelers as Mario Savio,
or such successful politicians as
Norman Thomas?
If this is true, then the right
man was elected and no more
need be said. However, I refuse
to believe that this is the situa
tion. Then why has this man
been elected if he does not re
flect the view of the majority!
Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

• Birth Control
Editor, The Dally:
Drs. Goldstein, Kalman and
McClennan failed to mention
another effective birth control
measure in their letter to you
of May 11. I refer, of course,
to vasectomies for all male stu
dents.
Isn't there some way that the
Health Service can be pressured
to performing these on the cam
pus?
I suggest we begin with the
new president of the student
body.

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

• An Alum For Pat
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me that if Stan
ford really cared about the
moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra
tional reason or perhaps a prac
tical, though irrational reason
is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and
Ken Noel of San Jose State with
their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol
icy. The record books do not re
veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard
er and not criticize him.
I am one alumnus who sup
ports individual liberty rather
than conservative alumni dona
tions. I hope Pat remains at
Stanford in spite of the petty
administrators and their narrow
views. Does Stanford care more
for individual liberty or for con
servative alumni donations?

• Counterfeit Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any
one who won't keep his hair
trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in
considerate.
Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam
pus, and the people I know who
have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to
point out that barbarism is the
absence of common standards to
which appeal and reference can
be made. To the extent that a
person ignores or flouts cri
teria of his society, whether
written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in
dividual is asocial.
Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming
represents standing up for prin
ciples or for maintenance of
freedom. It represents a denial
of principle and is a covert de
fense of lawlessness which is a
counterfeit of freedom under
law.

• No Secret
Editor, The Daily:
Many Stanford students and
faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys
tem and about which informa
tion is readily available today.
There are those who charge
that classified research is in
compatible with academic free

dom. Should they not stop and
consider that to abolish it would
be to infringe upon the freedom
of those who have different
views and feel that this sort of
research is entirely acceptable
within the framework of current
University policy?
Does a man really lose his aca
demic freedom when he willing
ly undertakes such research and
agrees that his results should
not be published immediately in
the interest of national defense?
I suggest that the Academic
Council and its Executive Com
mittee do a considerable amount
of homework before making any
further decisions.

• The Loss Of Beye
Editor, The Daily:
Few students read the "scratch
sheet" more assiduously than do
the freshmen who, for the first
time, are liberated to master
their own academic program.
Yet, on no fewer than five oc
casions familiar to us these stu
dents have asked who is the
brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even
tually suffer most.
Many will grieve deeply the
loss of Professor Beye, and few
freshmen will ever know just
how great that loss will really
be.

• Disgraceful 40%
Editor, The Daily:
David Victor Harris is your
newly elected Study Body Presi
dent. Mr. Harris may prove to
be an excellent President. He
may not.
It is not my place to comment
on his qualifications for office
or the platform on which he
ran. Of these I know little and
agree with less. However, I
must believe he is not the true
representative of the majority
of the Student Body.
It seems difficult to imagine
that the majority of the Stu
dents at Stanford desire to
strike for "educational reforms"
and to eliminate grades. Does
the majority of the Stanford stu
dents admire such questionable
fellow travelers as Mario Savio,
or such successful politicians as
Norman Thomas?
If this is true, then the right
man was elected and no more
need be said. However, I refuse
to believe that this is the situa
tion. Then why has this man
been elected if he does not re
flect the view of the majority!
Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra

is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and

their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol

veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard

I am one alumnus who sup

Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in

Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming

For it keeps upper and mid

faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys
tem and about which informa
tion is readily available today.
There are those who charge
that classified research is in
compatible with academic free

dom. Should they not stop and
consider that to abolish it would
be to infringe upon the freedom
of those who have different
views and feel that this sort of
research is entirely acceptable
within the framework of current
University policy?
Does a man really lose his aca
demic freedom when he willing
ly undertakes such research and
agrees that his results should
not be published immediately in
the interest of national defense?
I suggest that the Academic
Council and its Executive Com
mittee do a considerable amount
of homework before making any
further decisions.

• The Loss Of Beye
Editor, The Daily:
Few students read the "scratch
sheet" more assiduously than do
the freshmen who, for the first
time, are liberated to master
their own academic program.
Yet, on no fewer than five oc
casions familiar to us these stu
dents have asked who is the
brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even
tually suffer most.
Many will grieve deeply the
loss of Professor Beye, and few
freshmen will ever know just
how great that loss will really
be.

• Disgraceful 40%
Editor, The Daily:
David Victor Harris is your
newly elected Study Body Presi
dent. Mr. Harris may prove to
be an excellent President. He
may not.
It is not my place to comment
on his qualifications for office
or the platform on which he
ran. Of these I know little and
agree with less. However, I
must believe he is not the true
representative of the majority
of the Student Body.
It seems difficult to imagine
that the majority of the Stu
dents at Stanford desire to
strike for "educational reforms"
and to eliminate grades. Does
the majority of the Stanford stu
dents admire such questionable
fellow travelers as Mario Savio,
or such successful politicians as
Norman Thomas?
If this is true, then the right
man was elected and no more
need be said. However, I refuse
to believe that this is the situa
tion. Then why has this man
been elected if he does not re
flect the view of the majority!
Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

Drs. Goldstein, Kalman and

to vasectomies for all male stu

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra

is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and
Ken Noel of San Jose State with
their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol

veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard

I am one alumnus who sup

Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any
one who won't keep his hair
trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in
considerate.
Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam
pus, and the people I know who
have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to
point out that barbarism is the
absence of common standards to
which appeal and reference can
be made. To the extent that a
person ignores or flouts cri
teria of his society, whether
written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in
dividual is asocial.
Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming
represents standing up for prin

of principle and is a covert de

COLLIN ORME

Editor, The Daily:
Those who criticize the hypo
crisy of the government in its
administration of the selective
service test had better look at
their own arguments.
In the polemic at White Plaza
Thursday, it was stated that
anyone who takes the Selective
Service test, and who does well,
is sending someone from a low
er socio-economic class into the
army. If this is to be the prin
ciple argument against the test,
it had better be realized that the
student deferment itself is a
greater evil.
For it keeps upper and mid
dle class students out of the
army, at the expense of lower
class Americans. Any govern
ment decision to draft some col
lege students, not matter on
what basis, reduces the amount
of discrimination between the
rich and educated, and the poor
and ignorant.
If the issue is selective service
itself, those who deplore the dis
crimination against lower class
Americans implicit in the test
should advocate abolition of the
student deferrment and a ran
dom selection process. If the is
sue is not selective service, but
the specific selective process
used, critics of the test had bet

for deferment of college stu

• The Loss Of Beye
Editor, The Daily:
Few students read the "scratch
sheet" more assiduously than do
the freshmen who, for the first
time, are liberated to master
their own academic program.
Yet, on no fewer than five oc
casions familiar to us these stu
dents have asked who is the
brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even
tually suffer most.
Many will grieve deeply the
loss of Professor Beye, and few
freshmen will ever know just
how great that loss will really
be.

• Disgraceful 40%
Editor, The Daily:
David Victor Harris is your
newly elected Study Body Presi
dent. Mr. Harris may prove to
be an excellent President. He
may not.
It is not my place to comment
on his qualifications for office
or the platform on which he
ran. Of these I know little and
agree with less. However, I
must believe he is not the true
representative of the majority
of the Student Body.
It seems difficult to imagine
that the majority of the Stu
dents at Stanford desire to
strike for "educational reforms"
and to eliminate grades. Does
the majority of the Stanford stu
dents admire such questionable
fellow travelers as Mario Savio,
or such successful politicians as
Norman Thomas?
If this is true, then the right
man was elected and no more
need be said. However, I refuse
to believe that this is the situa
tion. Then why has this man
been elected if he does not re
flect the view of the majority!
Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school

I can find present examples

It would seem that some irra

is to blame for Pat Morrison's

A look at Tommy Smith and

reveal a more enlightened pol

veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the

I am one alumnus who sup

Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any

trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in

Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam

have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to

be made. To the extent that a

written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in

Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming

Those who criticize the hypo

administration of the selective
service test had better look at
their own arguments.
In the polemic at White Plaza
Thursday, it was stated that
anyone who takes the Selective
Service test, and who does well,
is sending someone from a low
er socio-economic class into the
army. If this is to be the prin
ciple argument against the test,
it had better be realized that the
student deferment itself is a
greater evil.
For it keeps upper and mid
dle class students out of the
army, at the expense of lower
class Americans. Any govern
ment decision to draft some col
lege students, not matter on
what basis, reduces the amount
of discrimination between the
rich and educated, and the poor
and ignorant.
If the issue is selective service
itself, those who deplore the dis
crimination against lower class
Americans implicit in the test
should advocate abolition of the
student deferrment and a ran
dom selection process. If the is
sue is not selective service, but
the specific selective process
used, critics of the test had bet

for deferment of college stu

• No Secret
Editor, The Daily:
Many Stanford students and
faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys

brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even
tually suffer most.
Many will grieve deeply the
loss of Professor Beye, and few
freshmen will ever know just
how great that loss will really
be.

• Disgraceful 40%
Editor, The Daily:
David Victor Harris is your
newly elected Study Body Presi
dent. Mr. Harris may prove to
be an excellent President. He
may not.
It is not my place to comment
on his qualifications for office
or the platform on which he
ran. Of these I know little and
agree with less. However, I
must believe he is not the true
representative of the majority
of the Student Body.
It seems difficult to imagine
that the majority of the Stu
dents at Stanford desire to
strike for "educational reforms"
and to eliminate grades. Does
the majority of the Stanford stu
dents admire such questionable
fellow travelers as Mario Savio,
or such successful politicians as
Norman Thomas?
If this is true, then the right
man was elected and no more
need be said. However, I refuse
to believe that this is the situa
tion. Then why has this man
been elected if he does not re
flect the view of the majority!
Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me that if Stan
ford really cared about the
moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra

tical, though irrational reason
is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and
Ken Noel of San Jose State with
their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol
icy. The record books do not re
veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard
er and not criticize him.
I am one alumnus who sup
ports individual liberty rather

• Counterfeit Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any
one who won't keep his hair
trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in
considerate.
Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam
pus, and the people I know who
have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to
point out that barbarism is the
absence of common standards to
which appeal and reference can
be made. To the extent that a
person ignores or flouts cri
teria of his society, whether
written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in
dividual is asocial.
Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming
represents standing up for prin

of principle and is a covert de

COLLIN ORME

Editor, The Daily:
Those who criticize the hypo
crisy of the government in its
administration of the selective
service test had better look at
their own arguments.
In the polemic at White Plaza
Thursday, it was stated that
anyone who takes the Selective
Service test, and who does well,
is sending someone from a low
er socio-economic class into the
army. If this is to be the prin
ciple argument against the test,
it had better be realized that the
student deferment itself is a
greater evil.
For it keeps upper and mid
dle class students out of the
army, at the expense of lower
class Americans. Any govern
ment decision to draft some col
lege students, not matter on
what basis, reduces the amount
of discrimination between the
rich and educated, and the poor
and ignorant.
If the issue is selective service
itself, those who deplore the dis
crimination against lower class
Americans implicit in the test
should advocate abolition of the
student deferrment and a ran
dom selection process. If the is
sue is not selective service, but
the specific selective process
used, critics of the test had bet
ter decide what is a just rational
for deferment of college stu

• No Secret
Editor, The Daily:
Many Stanford students and
faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys
tem and about which informa
tion is readily available today.
There are those who charge
that classified research is in
compatible with academic free

dom. Should they not stop and
consider that to abolish it would
be to infringe upon the freedom
of those who have different
views and feel that this sort of
research is entirely acceptable
within the framework of current
University policy?
Does a man really lose his aca
demic freedom when he willing
ly undertakes such research and
agrees that his results should
not be published immediately in
the interest of national defense?
I suggest that the Academic
Council and its Executive Com
mittee do a considerable amount
of homework before making any
further decisions.

• Disgraceful 40%
Editor, The Daily:
David Victor Harris is your
newly elected Study Body Presi
dent. Mr. Harris may prove to
be an excellent President. He
may not.
It is not my place to comment
on his qualifications for office
or the platform on which he
ran. Of these I know little and
agree with less. However, I
must believe he is not the true
representative of the majority
of the Student Body.
It seems difficult to imagine
that the majority of the Stu
dents at Stanford desire to
strike for "educational reforms"
and to eliminate grades. Does
the majority of the Stanford stu
dents admire such questionable
fellow travelers as Mario Savio,
or such successful politicians as
Norman Thomas?
If this is true, then the right
man was elected and no more
need be said. However, I refuse
to believe that this is the situa
tion. Then why has this man
been elected if he does not re
flect the view of the majority!
Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

Drs. Goldstein, Kalman and

another effective birth control
measure in their letter to you

to vasectomies for all male stu

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

• An Alum For Pat
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me that if Stan
ford really cared about the
moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra
tional reason or perhaps a prac
tical, though irrational reason
is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and
Ken Noel of San Jose State with
their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol
icy. The record books do not re
veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard
er and not criticize him.
I am one alumnus who sup
ports individual liberty rather
than conservative alumni dona

Stanford in spite of the petty
administrators and their narrow
views. Does Stanford care more
for individual liberty or for con

• Counterfeit Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any
one who won't keep his hair
trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in
considerate.
Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam
pus, and the people I know who
have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to
point out that barbarism is the
absence of common standards to
which appeal and reference can
be made. To the extent that a
person ignores or flouts cri
teria of his society, whether
written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in
dividual is asocial.
Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming
represents standing up for prin
ciples or for maintenance of
freedom. It represents a denial
of principle and is a covert de
fense of lawlessness which is a
counterfeit of freedom under

COLLIN ORME

Editor, The Daily:
Those who criticize the hypo
crisy of the government in its
administration of the selective
service test had better look at
their own arguments.
In the polemic at White Plaza
Thursday, it was stated that
anyone who takes the Selective
Service test, and who does well,
is sending someone from a low
er socio-economic class into the
army. If this is to be the prin
ciple argument against the test,
it had better be realized that the
student deferment itself is a
greater evil.
For it keeps upper and mid
dle class students out of the
army, at the expense of lower
class Americans. Any govern
ment decision to draft some col
lege students, not matter on
what basis, reduces the amount
of discrimination between the
rich and educated, and the poor
and ignorant.
If the issue is selective service
itself, those who deplore the dis
crimination against lower class
Americans implicit in the test
should advocate abolition of the
student deferrment and a ran
dom selection process. If the is
sue is not selective service, but
the specific selective process
used, critics of the test had bet
ter decide what is a just rational
for deferment of college stu
dents.

• No Secret
Editor, The Daily:
Many Stanford students and
faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys
tem and about which informa
tion is readily available today.
There are those who charge
that classified research is in
compatible with academic free

dom. Should they not stop and
consider that to abolish it would
be to infringe upon the freedom
of those who have different
views and feel that this sort of
research is entirely acceptable
within the framework of current
University policy?
Does a man really lose his aca
demic freedom when he willing
ly undertakes such research and
agrees that his results should
not be published immediately in
the interest of national defense?
I suggest that the Academic
Council and its Executive Com
mittee do a considerable amount
of homework before making any
further decisions.

• The Loss Of Beye
Editor, The Daily:
Few students read the "scratch
sheet" more assiduously than do
the freshmen who, for the first
time, are liberated to master
their own academic program.
Yet, on no fewer than five oc
casions familiar to us these stu
dents have asked who is the
brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even

Many will grieve deeply the

Because the majority did not
even bother to vote!
It is a disgrace that only 40
per cent of the Student Body
bothered to exercise their right
at the polls. This disgrace has
happened many times in the
past but this latest election
proves what a sin apathy can
be.

You and I and our children
must pay the price. You will suf
fer because you must live with
this man as your representative,
your envoy to the world, mus
tach, sandals and all.
I will suffer because I am an
alumnus and most alumni are
suffering from a lack of pride
in our university and its own
lack of responsibility. In the
past we have been proud to say
that we attended Stanford Uni
versity, and we have also been
proud of the university's ability
to work with and respond to the
students in a respectable fash
ion.
Our children, yours and mine,
will suffer because many peo
ple who don't understand apathy
and accidents will decide to di
vert their funds into other di
rections, which will mean that
Stanford has to suffer in its
plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

• Birth Control
Editor, The Dally:
Drs. Goldstein, Kalman and
McClennan failed to mention
another effective birth control
measure in their letter to you
of May 11. I refer, of course,
to vasectomies for all male stu
dents.
Isn't there some way that the
Health Service can be pressured
to performing these on the cam
pus?
I suggest we begin with the
new president of the student

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

• An Alum For Pat
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me that if Stan
ford really cared about the
moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra
tional reason or perhaps a prac
tical, though irrational reason
is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and
Ken Noel of San Jose State with
their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol
icy. The record books do not re
veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard
er and not criticize him.
I am one alumnus who sup
ports individual liberty rather
than conservative alumni dona
tions. I hope Pat remains at
Stanford in spite of the petty
administrators and their narrow
views. Does Stanford care more
for individual liberty or for con
servative alumni donations?

• Counterfeit Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any
one who won't keep his hair
trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in
considerate.
Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam
pus, and the people I know who
have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to
point out that barbarism is the
absence of common standards to
which appeal and reference can
be made. To the extent that a
person ignores or flouts cri
teria of his society, whether
written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in
dividual is asocial.
Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming
represents standing up for prin
ciples or for maintenance of
freedom. It represents a denial
of principle and is a covert de
fense of lawlessness which is a
counterfeit of freedom under
law.
COLLIN ORME
Junior, Biology
Editor, The Daily:
Those who criticize the hypo
crisy of the government in its
administration of the selective
service test had better look at
their own arguments.
In the polemic at White Plaza
Thursday, it was stated that
anyone who takes the Selective
Service test, and who does well,
is sending someone from a low
er socio-economic class into the
army. If this is to be the prin
ciple argument against the test,
it had better be realized that the
student deferment itself is a
greater evil.
For it keeps upper and mid
dle class students out of the
army, at the expense of lower
class Americans. Any govern
ment decision to draft some col
lege students, not matter on
what basis, reduces the amount
of discrimination between the
rich and educated, and the poor
and ignorant.
If the issue is selective service
itself, those who deplore the dis
crimination against lower class
Americans implicit in the test
should advocate abolition of the
student deferrment and a ran
dom selection process. If the is
sue is not selective service, but
the specific selective process
used, critics of the test had bet
ter decide what is a just rational
for deferment of college stu
dents.

• No Secret
Editor, The Daily:
Many Stanford students and
faculty have voiced objections
to the University's involvement
in clasified research since "it
became known in April." This is
strange, because the University
has had essentially the same
policy concerning this subject
for over fifteen years and it has
certainly been no secret.
It seems that the most vocal
opponents are those who truly
do not understand, and have
made little effort to find out,
what the classified research be
ing conducted at Stanford is all
about.
It also seems that many of
these people equate classified re
search with weapons production
for the war in Vietnam. This is
simply not the case.
It so happens that many re
search projects are classified
only because the researchers
have access to certain informa
tion, such as spacecraft launch
dates, communication frequen
cies, aircraft performance data,
etc., which the sponsoring agen
cy feels is vital to the national
defense.
There have been countless
scientific developments which
were at first classified but have
since been declassified. A nota
ble example is radar, which is
now such a vital part of this
country's air traffic control sys
tem and about which informa
tion is readily available today.
There are those who charge
that classified research is in
compatible with academic free

dom. Should they not stop and
consider that to abolish it would
be to infringe upon the freedom
of those who have different
views and feel that this sort of
research is entirely acceptable
within the framework of current
University policy?
Does a man really lose his aca
demic freedom when he willing
ly undertakes such research and
agrees that his results should
not be published immediately in
the interest of national defense?
I suggest that the Academic
Council and its Executive Com
mittee do a considerable amount
of homework before making any
further decisions.

• The Loss Of Beye
Editor, The Daily:
Few students read the "scratch
sheet" more assiduously than do
the freshmen who, for the first
time, are liberated to master
their own academic program.
Yet, on no fewer than five oc
casions familiar to us these stu
dents have asked who is the
brilliant Prof. Beye praised more
lavishly than most if not all
other Stanford professors. And
which of his courses best suits
a sophomore schedule?
Of course, as most upperclass
men know, Prof. Beye is leav
ing for reasons not understand
able to many.
Certainly, Prof. Beye can stand
proudly on his achievements
both as a teacher and scholar.
One glance at the "scratch
sheet" makes it abundantly
clear that he is a most success
ful and dedicated professor.
Where, then, is the catch?
How is it that Stanford allows
him to part?
Perhaps the answer rests
within the department itself. By
virtue of its size it is under
standable that many decisions
occur as the result of highly
personal associations. But
should the personal feelings of
a few affect so greatly the aca
demic direction of the Univer
sity?
We believe not, for the stu
dents are the ones who even

Many will grieve deeply the
loss of Professor Beye, and few
freshmen will ever know just
how great that loss will really
be.

David Victor Harris is your

It is not my place to comment

It seems difficult to imagine

the majority of the Stanford stu

plans for the future, the time
when our children will be seek
ing a college education.
It may be that the election
results would have been th e
same if 100 per cent of you stu
dents had voted. If not, how
ever, there is hope, and per
haps next year there will be the
sound of shoes walking into the
Student Body President's office
and the barbers can be "removed
from the inactive list." Apathy
is an immature trait. Let's pray
for maturity in the future.

• Sponsoring At WSU
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the editorial and
letters in the May 12 Daily con
cerning Wilbur Hall. I would
like to make a few comments
from my own experience as a
sponsor. As an undergraduate I
was a student at Washington
State University and I was a
sponsor in one of the dormitories
there during my senior year.
WSU did not have freshman
dormitories. The freshmen were
integrated with the upperclass
men and all the dormitories had
sponsors (the position of R.A.
did not exist). The sponsors re
ported to the Dorm Director,
but, as they were not paid at
that time, they were not employ
ees of he university. The fact
that they were not paid also
eliminated the possibility of peo
ple applying for the position for
the purpose of financial aid.
During the year which I
served as a sponsor (1957-58),
the students in the dormitory
section for which I was respon
sible were mainly freshmen.
There were some problems
which occurred which I believe
may have been avoided if the
ratio of upperclassmen to fresh
men had been higher. In normal
practice, the majority of the stu
dents in any section of a dormi
tory were upperclassmen.
While the freshmen may have
caused some minor disturbances,
I do not recall that they ever
drove the upperclassmen to
drink. In my own opinion the
presence of the upperclassmen
tended to have a stabilizing in
fluence on the freshmen.
The main problem at Stanford
seems to be the lack of housing
on campus plus the high cost of
the housing that is provided.
This fact, rather than the pres
ence of freshmen in the dormi
tories, would be the reason for
students to move off campus.

• Birth Control
Editor, The Dally:
Drs. Goldstein, Kalman and
McClennan failed to mention
another effective birth control
measure in their letter to you
of May 11. I refer, of course,
to vasectomies for all male stu
dents.
Isn't there some way that the
Health Service can be pressured
to performing these on the cam
pus?
I suggest we begin with the
new president of the student
body.

• Why We Lose
Editor, The Daily:
After four years of losing on
Stanford track teams I've asked
myself innumerable times,
"What indiscernable something
has made Stanford athletics
synonymous with the all too
common "choke performance,"
the "psych-out" and the "moral
victory"?
What is it that Southern Cal
can put together year in and
year out to beat Stanford teams
that are better "man for man"?
It cannot be the coaches' faults
because their previous teams
have been winners everywhere
across the board.
It cannot be the lack of fa
cilities and we have the best
equipment available. The train
ing programs are adopted ver
batim throughout the world
and produce fantastic results.
Pat Morrison, a friend of mine
I hope, probably doesn't realize
that in his four years (should
he decide to stay at Stanford)
he will probably never be a
member of a winning team. But
the "archaic relic" of policy

which he has sacrificed his ath
letic career at Stanford to des
troy represents, I've concluded,
the key element to the success
of any future athletic cam
paigns here.
No Stanford team will ever
win without a total commitment
and profound dedication to their
team members, their coaches,
and their mutual goals. The in
dividual must be willing to dedi
cate himself and his principles
if necessary for the attainment
of victory, if victory is to be
earned.
The price is extraordinarily
high! Payton Jordan is an Amer
ican before he is a coach and is
someone who will fight for and
defend any man's God given
rights and privileges under the
law.
Fortunately for some of us he
has dedicated himself to the "old
fashioned" ideals of competitive
athletics characterized by the
principles of Christian morality
and ethical behavior; I will re
mind our guests, the same prin
ciples upon which this country
was founded.
He has made it his life to
mould boys into men around
these principles. Jordan knows
only too well the price of vic
tory but he has been forced to
succumb to the will of the "indi
vidual" at Stanford to the point
that he is no longer permitted
to demand total loyalty, total
respect, and total obedience.
Victory at Stanford has be
come inconsistent with a philos
ophy which professes to perpe
tuate the spirit of this univer
sity. Individualism prevails and
Stanford loses, again, and
again, and again. . . .

• An Alum For Pat
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me that if Stan
ford really cared about the
moral character of its athletes
and their image, it would not al
low them to compete after they
had been suspended from school
for criminal or juvenile offenses.
I can find present examples
of this without looking very far.
It would seem that some irra
tional reason or perhaps a prac
tical, though irrational reason
is to blame for Pat Morrison's
troubles.
A look at Tommy Smith and
Ken Noel of San Jose State with
their sunglasses and beret will
reveal a more enlightened pol
icy. The record books do not re
veal whether an athlete looked
like a "beatnik" or a "hipster."
If Pat Morrison can beat the
best the varsity has to offer with
his curly locks then maybe the
other athletes should work hard
er and not criticize him.
I am one alumnus who sup
ports individual liberty rather
than conservative alumni dona
tions. I hope Pat remains at
Stanford in spite of the petty
administrators and their narrow
views. Does Stanford care more
for individual liberty or for con
servative alumni donations?

• Counterfeit Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I consider inconsiderate any
one who won't keep his hair
trimmed. I recognize that every
person has the right to be in
considerate.
Nevertheless, to be barbered is
better than to be barbarian.
That expression is not used in
the spirit of name-calling. I
know of no barbarians on cam
pus, and the people I know who
have untrimmed hair are pretty
level headed underneath it all.
I use the expression, rather, to
point out that barbarism is the
absence of common standards to
which appeal and reference can
be made. To the extent that a
person ignores or flouts cri
teria of his society, whether
written statute or understood
standard, to that extent the in
dividual is asocial.
Let no one lull himself into
the self-centered delusion that
defense of personal ill-grooming
represents standing up for prin
ciples or for maintenance of
freedom. It represents a denial
of principle and is a covert de
fense of lawlessness which is a
counterfeit of freedom under
law.
