# SLAC Tested—All Systems Go
## 
### 
At exactly 6:38 a.m., Saturday
morning, with a group of scientists
and engineers watching on in two
control rooms of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, the two mile ma
chine flashed a pulsating beam of
electrons through the tunnel.
"The accelerator's performance in
its first full-length turn-on was better
than we had any right to expect," an
nounced Professor Wolfgang Panof
sky, director of SLAC. "F"ull credit
should go to our staff of scientists,
engineers, and technicians who
worked hard for it to come true."
The accelerator produced electrons
with energies of 10BEV (billion elec

tron volts), operating at reduced
power levels.
"Associate Director Richard B. Neal
has done a truly remarkable job co
ordinating the vast numbers of con
tributors, both within Stanford and
from the outside. We had assumed we
might need as much as another year
for readjustment and tune-up before
using the beam in experiments. Now
it looks an though we might begin
research operations within six
months," noted Panofsky.
Ten Years In Making
This event climaxed ten years of
study, design work, and construction
begun by Stanford scientists in 1956.
The project was authorized by Con
gress in 1961, and ground was broken
in 1962.
Panofsky added, "It is particularly
noteworthy that the accelerator is far
along to allow the beam to be
turned on within one month of the
date our original schedule called for."
Atomic Energy Commission Chair
man Glenn T. Seaborg has scheduled
a visit to the center early in June to
observe the operation of the accele
rator.
The $114 million scientific tool is
being built by Stanford University un
der contract with the AEC.
"Ten experiments already have been
approved for the first year of research
with the big machine," said Dr. Panof
sky.
New Particles
"These involve a search for new
particles along with various studies
of nucleon structure, and were pro
posed by research teams comprising
scientists of four institutions —Stan-
ford, MIT, Cal Tech, and U.C. Berke
ley. As a national research facility,
SLAC will be opened to use by sci
entists from all parts of the U.S. and
the world."
"It is still too early for precise
scheduling of experiments," according

to Dr. Matthew Sands, SLAC deputy
director, "but we have adopted some
operating guidelines.
"These contemplate running the ac
celerator at something less than 'flat
out' until we gain some experience
with performance and reliability of
the accelerator components and their
maximum capibilities," he added.
Much Work Left
Between now and the time of full
research capability, much work yet re
mains to be done. The installation of
magnets and other components to di
rect the heam to research areas is now
underway. The analytical devices to
perform the experiments in the re
search areas are now being manufac
tured.
At full energy the accelerator is
expected to generate up to 20 BEV
and beam currents (number of elec
trons accelerated) as high as 30 mi
croampheres. This would be nearly 20
times the energy and 30 times the
current of the largest existing linear
accelerator in the U. S., Stanford's
Mark 111. Another electron accelerator
operating near two BEV at quite low
current, recently came into operation
in the USSR at Kharkov in the
Ukraine.
Greater Ability
More energy means greater ability
to "see" into the atomic nucleus. High
er current means more electrons in
the beam to bomb nuclear targets,
hence more reactions yielding more
information.
The beam, about the size of a pencil
in cross section, travels in an abso
lutely straight line. The accelerator
pipe had to be straight within one
millimeter, or about .04 inch over its
entire 10,000-foot length.
A scientific report containing the
technical performance characteristics
of the first beam turn-on will be pub
lished shortly in Science, a scientific
journal, Dr. Panofskv said.

At full energy the accelerator is
expected to generate up to 20 BEV
and beam currents (number of elec
trons accelerated) as high as 30 mi
croampheres. This would be nearly 20
times the energy and 30 times the
current of the largest existing linear
accelerator in the U. S., Stanford's
Mark 111. Another electron accelerator
operating near two BEV at quite low
current, recently came into operation
in the USSR at Kharkov in the
Ukraine.
Greater Ability
More energy means greater ability
to "see" into the atomic nucleus. High
er current means more electrons in
the beam to bomb nuclear targets,
hence more reactions yielding more
information.
The beam, about the size of a pencil
in cross section, travels in an abso
lutely straight line. The accelerator
pipe had to be straight within one
millimeter, or about .04 inch over its
entire 10,000-foot length.
A scientific report containing the
technical performance characteristics
of the first beam turn-on will be pub
lished shortly in Science, a scientific
journal, Dr. Panofskv said.
At exactly 6:38 a.m., Saturday
morning, with a group of scientists
and engineers watching on in two
control rooms of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, the two mile ma
chine flashed a pulsating beam of
electrons through the tunnel.
"The accelerator's performance in
its first full-length turn-on was better
than we had any right to expect," an
nounced Professor Wolfgang Panof
sky, director of SLAC. "F"ull credit
should go to our staff of scientists,
engineers, and technicians who
worked hard for it to come true."
The accelerator produced electrons
with energies of 10BEV (billion elec

tron volts), operating at reduced
power levels.
"Associate Director Richard B. Neal
has done a truly remarkable job co
ordinating the vast numbers of con
tributors, both within Stanford and
from the outside. We had assumed we
might need as much as another year
for readjustment and tune-up before
using the beam in experiments. Now
it looks an though we might begin
research operations within six
months," noted Panofsky.
Ten Years In Making
This event climaxed ten years of
study, design work, and construction
begun by Stanford scientists in 1956.
The project was authorized by Con
gress in 1961, and ground was broken
in 1962.
Panofsky added, "It is particularly
noteworthy that the accelerator is far
along to allow the beam to be
turned on within one month of the
date our original schedule called for."
Atomic Energy Commission Chair
man Glenn T. Seaborg has scheduled
a visit to the center early in June to
observe the operation of the accele
rator.
The $114 million scientific tool is
being built by Stanford University un
der contract with the AEC.
"Ten experiments already have been
approved for the first year of research
with the big machine," said Dr. Panof
sky.
New Particles
"These involve a search for new
particles along with various studies
of nucleon structure, and were pro
posed by research teams comprising
scientists of four institutions —Stan-
ford, MIT, Cal Tech, and U.C. Berke
ley. As a national research facility,
SLAC will be opened to use by sci
entists from all parts of the U.S. and
the world."
"It is still too early for precise
scheduling of experiments," according

to Dr. Matthew Sands, SLAC deputy
director, "but we have adopted some
operating guidelines.
"These contemplate running the ac
celerator at something less than 'flat
out' until we gain some experience
with performance and reliability of
the accelerator components and their
maximum capibilities," he added.
Much Work Left
Between now and the time of full
research capability, much work yet re
