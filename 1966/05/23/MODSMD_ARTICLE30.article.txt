# LETTER POLICY
## 
### 
The Daily is happy to accept
and print letters to the editor.
They must be typewritten on
65-space lines and double spaced.
Letters should not exceed 300
words in length. Shorter letters
have a better cliance of being
printed.
As a general rule, unsigned
letters will not be printed, but
nanii>s will be withheld under
certain circumstances upon re
quest.
The Daily reserves the right
to edit all letters for grammar
and spelling, and also to fit
available space.
