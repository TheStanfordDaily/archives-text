# Protesters Quietly Leave 'Number 10'
## Administration Refuses To Give Any Ground: 'We Refuse To Be Coerced Or Intimidated' Exodus 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
Twenty - seven Stanford students
ended a 50-hour sit-in demonstration
early Saturday afternoon by volun
tarily walking out of the lobby to
President Wallace Sterling's office.
In a group statement read by grad
uate student Barry Greenberg, the
demonstrators said they had spent the
past two days trying to gain assur
ances that the Administration "would
convene in good faith an open meet
ing, with students and faculty having
a real share in decision-making" to
discuss the University's administering
of Selective Service deferment exams.
With no promises from the Admin
istration, the protesters voluntarily
ended the sit-in "in the belief that this
would srengthen our future struggle
for our just demands."
No Disruption
Over 800 men took the draft test
Saturday morning without disruption.
Anti-draft protesters handed out leaf
lets to men as they entered University
buildings, but took no other action.
Stanford police were stationed
around the campus to prevent any in
terference with the tests. A number
of Santa Clara county sheriffs were
assembled behind the police depart
ment early Saturday morning in case
of large scale disturbance, but they
were not used.
Keith Lowe, one of the group's main
spokesmen throughout the sit-in,
briefly addressed the pro-demonstra
tion crowd of about 150 which had
gathered outside Building 10 Saturday
afternoon. As Lowe concluded, he
urged the crowd to join the demon
strators in a march to President Ster
ling's home to present their demands.
At 3:30 the demonstrators walked
out of the office in a double file line
as the partisan crowd gave out with a
loud cheer. The protesters looked tired
and worn after the two-day vigil.
Many of them were carrying sleeping
bags and blankets along with their
placards as they left.
March Begins
Over 100 people joined in the march
to the President's home. With an
American and a United Nations flag
at the head of the procession, the
group marched through White Plaza,

up the lower row, and met only one
minor incident as a small foreign car
pulled out of a fraternity parking lot.
Executive Assistant to the President
Frederick Glover met the marchers
at the entrance of the long circular
driveway which connects the Sterling
residence with Madera Avenue.
He informed them the President
was away for the weekend, but gave
the group permission to file by the
front of the home and leave a placard,
to which was tacked the demonstra
tor's formal statement, on the Presi
dent's doorstep. Glover took the
placard and said he would give it to
Sterling.
The marchers continued along the
circular drive and returned to campus
without incident.
About 75 students occupied Ster
ling's office Thursday afternoon fol
lowing a noon rally, organized by
Craig Lauden. Initial attempts to get
University officials to declare a mora
torium on the Selective Service exam
scheduled Saturday soon changed to
demands for an open meeting with a
representative of the President.

Unwilling to name five representa
tives for a closed door meeting of
fered by University officials, the dem
onstrators spent Thursday night in
the President's office without incident.
At 9 Friday morning, 75 anti-dem
onstration pickets appeared outside
Building 10. Sporting signs which read
"Support President Sterling," "Down
with Mob Rule," and "Academic Free
dom and Responsibility," the pickets
paraded in force for about 4 hours.
The anti-demonstrators were organ
ized late Thursday evening by Carey
Coulter, who recently returned from
9 months in Vietnam with Interna
tional Volunteer Services.
Coulter told The Daily, "We have
given an indication to the University
community as a whole and to the com
munity in general that the sit-in dem
onstrators do not represent the ma
jority of the Stanford students."
Anti-protest pickets engaged in
heated, sporadic debates with mem
bers of the sit-in group who came out
of the President's lobby. Several dem
onstrators semi-seriously told the
pickets they were in violation of Uni
versity regulation for blocking access
along the Inner Quad, but Stanford
police made no effort to curb the ac
tivities of either group.
Crowd Grows
By noon a crowd of several hundred
had gathered. Most of the people out
side the office said they were against
the sit-in, although a random sample
of non-pickets found little support for
the tactics of the counter-protesters.


A 3:10 p.m. Saturday, the last o>f the sit-ins walked out of President Sterling's
office. The total number of protesters had varied between 27 and 40.
