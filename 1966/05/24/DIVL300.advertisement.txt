The no-drag shaver
You might not shift
to 3rd until
you're 17.
Usually 17 is the time peach fuzz turns into hard bristle. Then you've got trouble,
unless you have a shaver that can grow up with you. Like the new Remington o 200
Selectro Shaver with the dial. Alias no-drag. We gave it an alias because you can

We also make a complete line of cordless shavers, in case you're interested.
