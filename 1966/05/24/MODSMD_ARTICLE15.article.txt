# Fisticuffs, Finesse And Fencing
## 
### DAN CABRERA 
"Stanford has a fencing
team?" is a common comeback
upon reading that the Stanford
Fencing Teams have emerged
from another tournament carry
ing a bronze medal as they did
at VaLlejo.
Stanford has both a women's
and a men's fencing team. The
women's coach is Jean Heiiiwell,
while the men have had no coach
since 1958 when Elewyn Bugge
retired. Bugge had coached Stan
ford's fencing teams since 1928.
Fencing, however, was not

born in 1928 at Stanford. Just
where and when the art of fenc
ing originated is not exactly
known. There are pictorial rec
ords of fencing matches which
took place as long ago as 1190
BC in Egypt.
Finesse Came Slowly
Fencing in its early days, how
ever, was more of a clumsy ef
fort the outcome of which was
more dependent on brute
strength than on any demonstra
tion of finesse. It was not until
the invention of gunpowder in
the fifteenth centry, and the
widespread transformation of
weapons into more easily man
ageable forme that fencing, then
centered around the Italians, be
gan to resemble the art it is to
day. The quick and exact use of
the point of the sword replaced
the hacking that was common
when the edge of the sword was
the main means of offense.
Along with its other "firsts,"
the court of Louis XIV in France
with its silk stockings, satin
dresses, brocaded coats and knee
breeches, introduced the use
of the light foil in preference
over the heavier rapier then used
in most European countries.
An interesting phenomenon oc
curred near the end of eigh
teenth century when James
Figg, who was then both Cham
pion of the Corporation of Fenc
ing Masters and the first British
Boxing Champion, introduced
fisticuff contests as part of the
regular "prize fights" which
were fencing matches held out
doors for entertainment.
Boxing became so popular that
the "prize fights" became fisti
cuff contests, and for a period
the fencers were relegated to the
realm of provincial amusement.
Not until 1906, when the Ama
teur Fencing Association was
formed in Britain, did fencing as
sume a truly respected position
in the world of sports.
Stanford Fencing
Not long after, fencing came
to the Farm, where the Skelton
Cup was won in 1915 by Stan
ford's men fencers. With Elewyn
Bugge, winner of the 1923 Pa
cific Coast Championship for

Stanford, came the coach the
teams needed to attain collegiate
prominence.
At present there exists no
coach or University-supported
program for men's fencing, while
the Women's Physical Education
Dep't has obtained Mrs. Jean
Heiiiwell as a women's coach. Be
cause outfitting each man is a
relatively expensive operation
(about 75 dollars) the immediate
problem is one of finding finan
cial support for the men's team,
for both equipment and expenses
incurred while traveling to par
ticipate in the numerous tourna
ments held throughout the state.

Fencing is particularly suited
for the student more interested
in developing coordination than
brawn although physical condi
tioning is extremely important
to the sport. For the beginner, in
troductory courses are offered
each quarter, and for the fast
learner, the annual novice meet
presents an excellent opportun
ity for the experience of athletic
competition that many students
never have during their college
life.
"There is an exhilaration upon
winning one's first meet that is
impossible to forget," Mrs. Helli
well has commented.
