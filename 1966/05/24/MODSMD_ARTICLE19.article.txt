# Intransigence Forever?
## 
### 
Building 10 has returned to normalcy. The
protesters have gone, the secretaries have re
turned. Musty sleeping bags no longer cover the
pebble brown carpet of the Presidental lobby.
Outwardly, the Inner City is as it was before.
Thirty students had confronted the adminis
tration with their physical presence for more
than 50 hours, and then backed down. Even
by their own admissions, the protesters may
have used the wrong tactics —their immediate
purpose, to bring an end to University coopera
tion with the Selective Service, had little popu
lar support. But beyond this they were protest
ing a deeper injustice. They were fed up with
the whole decision-making structure of the Uni
versity, and chose civil disobedience as a reply
to the plodding bureaucracy.
Some of their demands were perhaps unrea
sonable —the University must declare a mori
torium on the Selective Service Qualification
Test, they said—and the administration quickly
said "no," Other demands were not so unreason
able—that President Sterling participate in an
open decision-making meeting with students,
and that negotiations begin on increasing stu
dent participation in decision-making. Dean
Wert's reply was that the President would not
meet with students "under duress." According
to another administrator, Sterling objected not
so much to the idea of a meeting as to the idea
of recognizing the "symbolic protest" — he
would not deal with students on any but his
own terms, even if students had found through
experience that the President's terms were in
adequate.
The defeat of the students was, on the sur
face, total. But beneath the newspaper head
lines and television newscasts, the administra
tion had lost, too. By replacing any effort at
understanding the discontent represented by the
sit-iners with arrogant intransigence, the ad
ministration furthered its loss of contact with
the individuals for whom it exists —the stu
dents. An earlier recommendation by Prof.
Philip Rhinelander, that "students ought always
to be listened to ... , even, or especially, when
their demands seem most unreasonable," went
unheeded.
Most guilty of not listening, we feel, is Presi
dent Sterling himself. Until five years ago, he
made sincere efforts at meeting with and under
standing students. Often, he would appear un
announced for dinner in dormitories, and would
stay around afterwards to play the piano or

pool. But, about the time the PACE era began,
the demands on his time became heavier, and
his contacts with students dwindled. Today, stu
dents talk with the President only at his own
leisure, and only on his own level. When stu
dents with values and ideas different from his
attempt to communicate with him, they find
little genuine understanding and—when the at
tempt is made behind closed doors—often not a
little anger. The President has lost touch with
a significant portion of the student body, and as
a consequence has lost a feeling of sensitivity
toward those whose lives are affected by the
decisions he makes. Last weekend's protesters
made several attempts to compromise, and by
Friday evening were demanding only that the
President or his representative participate in
an open meeting to discuss decision-making at
Stanford. Sterling's arrogant refusal demon
strated once again the intransigence that has
become peculiarly his when asked to deal with
students on any but his own terms.
Addressing the Legislature last quarter,
Speaker Jay Kadane noted that "student power
within the University, to the extent that we
have power, is based ultimately on the threat
of disruption of life on the campus and its at
tendant bad publicity for the University." A bit
of a generalization it was, for there are many
decision-makers in the University who are will
ing to look at the merit of an idea or proposal
before checking to see if it came from a student
or an administrator. Unfortunately they are in
a minority, and more unfortunately they rarely
are promoted. Nevertheless, there is painful
truth in what Kadane said.
Few issues on the Stanford campus have the
potential for both arousing widespread and ac
tive student resentment and embarrassing the
University. Last weekend's demonstration was
not such an issue, for its support was limited.
The restriction on Jewish worship could have
been such an issue—and it was largely for that
reason that the Board of Trustees removed the
cause for discontent. To date, the University
has managed through piecemeal accommoda
tionism to avoid crises like the one that rocked
Berkeley a year a half ago. To date, all the in
gredients necessary to cause a full-scale flexing
of the student muscle have not been found in
any single issue. But in 1966, with student ac
tivism at Stanford gaining more and more self
confidence, it is no longer safe to say that "it
can't happen on The Farm."
