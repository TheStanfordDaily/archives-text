# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Footnotes To A Sit-In 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
For me and my fellow demon
strators at the sit-in in President
Sterling's office to claim that
our efforts were ineffectual
would be unreasonable.
It is probably true that we
will have little influence on ac
tual policy decisions for some
time to come, but it would be
quite egotistical for us to as
sume that we were the only ones
deeply concerned with the is
sues at stake or that there were
n't varying degrees of sympathy
with our cause, some of which
stopped just short of causing
their proponents to join us.
Quite the contrary appears to
have been true.
There was a continual effort
on the part of news media to re
port the beliefs of our spokes
men and there were many by
standers, uncommitted or other
wise, who engaged us in open,
rational debate. Since we did
have considerable influence on
the level of public opinion, it
was the responsibility of our
group to see that all of our
statements and behavior were
conscientiously coordinated.
Even though the main issues
in the demonstration, that the
draft is discriminatory and that
it should be the university and
not the government which de
cides whether its students are
academic material, may have
been clear or were legitimate
cause for protest, there was, I
charge of many, needlessly alien
ated, that our position was sur
rounded by incoherence and un
certainty. Below I have listed
several reasons which I consider
to be the causes of this unfor
tunate outcome:
1. There should have been a
general meeting before any ac
tual steps were taken or before
any statements were released to
the press. As a result, most of
the preparation for the sit-in
were mismanaged.
a. The protest would have
been more appropriate if it had
coincided with the first test.
Since, as it was, because the Ac
ademic Council refused debate,
it appeared "post facto," our
requests would have been more
logically centered around set
ting up an open debate about
the tests rather than around
cancelling the tests themselves,
one of which had already been
allowed to take place unopposed.
b. Our initial rejection of
President Sterling's offer lor
a closed meeting was most re
grettable as it gave the impres
sion that we were totally un
willing to compromise. Such was
not the case. Our feeling was
that those few chosen by us to
stick their necks out, would be
singled out for harsher punish
ment.
As soon as our group had
met as a whole, we agreed that
accepting the closed meeting
would be desirable even if just
to discuss the possibility of an
open meeting. At the same time
that we would not allow our
leaders to risk their safety de
cisively by discussing the is
sues themselves, we should have
expressed greater willingness to
make other compromises on this
point.
2. Unfortunately, we created
the impression of "partying" ra

ther than of seriously demon
strating. Even though when I
left on Friday morning the room
had been vacuumed and picked
up, our influence, in the eyes of
many, would have been greater
if we had provided ourselves
only with books and sleeping
bags, and had gone out for food
or refreshments.
In sum, the sit-in was a ser
ious and influential affair. The
reason that it didn't evoke the
unanimous response which a
similar protest received from
the faculty and students of San
Francisco State may be because
our faculty and student body are
more conservative and petit
bourgeois, but it may also be
because there was an embarrass
ing lack of attention on the part
of myself and my comrades in
protest given to creating an
earnest, forceful and coherent
atmosphere with which to make
the basic integrity of our posi
tion more acceptable.

â€¢ No Sell-out
Editor, The Daily:
It is generally agreed that the
war in Vietnam is a miserable
mess and we all wish for peace
there.
However, the spokesman for
the SCPV as reported in Thurs
day's Daily not only discredited
the cause of peace, he also dam
aged the entire community with
half truths and plain lies. As a
member of the Academic Council
and a citizen in this community
of scholars, I must protest this
display of poor scholarship and
reprehensible behavior.
The spokesman is quoted to
the effect that the rally was
called because of the failure of
Tuesday's meeting of the Aca
demic Council. In fact, I have a
copy of a letter distributed be
fore that meeting took place an
nouncing Thursday's rally. To
assume the outcome before the
fact is a classic perversion of in
vestigation and unworthy of any
man who claims the title "schol
ar."
It is claimed in The Daily that
the "faculty as a group has abro
gated any decision making pow
er on the crucial issues to the
administration." The facts are
that both the issue of classified
contracts and of selective service
policy were referred to the Ex
ecutive Committee elected by the
Academic Council.
In both cases, these actions
were taken because of the seri
ousness of the issues involved
and the need for quick but fair
and careful study of all points
of view. In no sense was any
one "sold out" for any reason
whatever.

Finally, the SCPV spokesman
wonders if the war in Vietnam
will end before Stanford has a
new policy. At its meeting Tues
day, May 17, the Academic Coun
cil insisted that the Executive
Committee report on the selec
tive service policy at he June
meeting only three weeks later.
I pray that the Vietnam war is
ended as soon!
